  Bruce Sterling defines spimes, in part, as extensively rich streams of data and information about things. From a theoretical viewpoint, the concept of spimes is indeed interesting, with seemingly endless possibilities for enriching our knowledge about the things all around us. In terms of our everyday decision-making activities, spimes could have significant influence on our behaviours, empowering us to make more informed choices. No where is this more true than in topics relating to sustainability, especially in how sustainability relates to the selection of the food that we eat. With vast amounts of information available, the issue of selecting good food can be difficult and more adequate support is needed. This paper proposes a framework for design by discussing a model of social interaction which encourages, engages, and motivates consumer participation, enabling consumers to share experiences and bridge knowledge barriers. By developing a framework for community support in such respects, we ensure information quality, transparency, and potentially provide more effective consumer support accordingly. Thus, we have a greater chance of choosing better food selections, specifically those from the perspective of integrating more sustainable choices in our everyday food selections.
