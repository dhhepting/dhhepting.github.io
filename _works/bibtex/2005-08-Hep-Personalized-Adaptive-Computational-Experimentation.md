abstract: >-
  Computational discovery is facilitated by tools that enable the researcher to focus on a problem and the making sense of results obtained, rather than on the idiosyncrasies of command syntax and the bookkeeping associated with repeated variable command invocations. In a search for insight, imagination should be encouraged more than patience should be required. The cogito software system is described, which allows any researcher a great deal of flexibility to personalize how computational experiments are conducted and how results are visualized. The system features an application programming interface that allows it to be adapted to a wide range of uses.
