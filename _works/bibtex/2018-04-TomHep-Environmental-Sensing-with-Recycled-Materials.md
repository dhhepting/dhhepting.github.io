abstract: >-
  Environmental sensing---the process of gathering information from ecological systems---is an essential part of ecology and sustainable agriculture. However, sensors can be expensive and difficult for citizen scientists to obtain, even though their parts are all around us, in the form of technological waste. When a gadget breaks, it is often easier and cheaper to throw it away and purchase a new one than to attempt to repair it. Citizen scientists can take advantage of this unfortunate by-product of ``throw away culture'' by harvesting the sensor technology that is often found in e-waste. In this article, we discuss an approach to the development of such sensors.
