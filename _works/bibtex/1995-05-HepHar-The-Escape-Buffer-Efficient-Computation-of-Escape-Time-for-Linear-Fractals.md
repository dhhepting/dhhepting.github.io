title: The Escape Buffer  Efficient Computation of Escape Time for Linear Fractals (1995)
abstract: >-
  The study of linear fractals has gained a great deal from the study quadratic fractals, despite important differences. Methods for classifying points in the complement of a fractal shape were originally developed for quadratic fractals, to provide insight into their underlying dynamics. These methods were later modified for use with linear fractals. This paper reconsiders one such classification, called escape time, and presents a new algorithm for its computation that is significantly faster and conceptually simpler. Previous methods worked backwards, by mapping pixels into classified regions, whereas the new forward algorithm uses an ``escape buffer'' to mapping classified regions onto pixels. The efficiency of the escape buffer is justified by a careful analysis of its performance on linear fractals with various properties.
