  We propose an interactive composition technique to facilitate the exploration of complex parameter spaces. More computer-aided composition than algorithmic composition, human aesthetic judgment is an integral part of the technique. From a set of central parameters, the composer chooses a mapping which allows the generation of both audio and video representations. Features from each representation are then extracted and used as parameters in an iterative re-render process, each step of which can be automated or respond to human input. With this technique, composers can see as well as hear their music as it develops, and can interact and follow paths through the parameter space, exploring sound spaces heretofore unavailable to standard compositional methods.
