title: DIY Game Console Development (2014)
abstract: >-
  Video games have become a driving force for innovation in many aspects of the entertainment industry and beyond. Since gaming may also be in a position to drive the emerging "maker movement", we consider the "DIY game industry". In this half-day course, attendees will be introduced to DIY Game Console construction and programming by building their own game console, based on a simple 12 LED and 4 button design, and then programming their console to play very simple, yet entertaining, games. Attendees will also be exposed to the tradeoffs in design between capabilities in gameplay and complexity of hardware and software.
