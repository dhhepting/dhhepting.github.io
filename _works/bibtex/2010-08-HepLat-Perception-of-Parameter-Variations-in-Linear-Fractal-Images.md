  Parametric images, defined by a small number of parameters, may help to democratize access to image creation because simple parameter manipulations can yield interesting variations. Foe example, many people appreciate the aesthetics of fractal images, but few are inclined to engage in the mathematics needed to create them. A perception-driven interface for fractal image creation could find a wide audience as people could use it as an outlet for their own creative expression. This paper discusses some first steps along that path, with a study and analysis of how participants perceived changes between smoothly varying images. Further steps towards a perception-driven interface are then laid out.
