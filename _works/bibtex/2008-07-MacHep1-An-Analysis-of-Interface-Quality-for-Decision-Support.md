  This paper examines the quality of user interfaces in an application to choose products. A high-quality interface should enable users to perform prescribed tasks quickly and without errors. The interface should also enable users to find products which match their personal values. A high-quality interface can especially empower those diverse users who might otherwise be overwhelmed by technology but who need information to ground their actions. By examining user performance in such regards, insight into the quality of interface may be acheived. For this purpose, we examined user performance while utilizing different interfaces for product selections. An analysis and discussion of the examination is presented, along with opportunities for future work.
