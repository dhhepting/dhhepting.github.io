abstract: >-
  We examined whether performance using scientific visualization software is influenced by verbal or pictoral format of the interface, as predicted if verbal overshadowing generalizes to the domain of computer software. With a pictoral interface, participants showed more complete coverage of the graphical search space, as well as more efficient performance.
