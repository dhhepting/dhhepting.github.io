11h36:
  talks:
      All right, so here's the updated version.
      That should be on the website
      soon. And
      this is from ours, our chat session on
      on Thursday.
      So I'm experimenting
      with the display so you can let me know what you think so I
      so DHH that's me
11h37:
  talks:
      In case you're wondering.
      So DHH Daryl H Hepting. You can call me Daryl R. Dr. Hepting.
      I'd like you to pick one of those two.
      So this is the way that I presented it. So anything that was sent to me
      I have not included
      so what I've done is I
      What am I gonna say But
      so, the identifiers are consistent so every time the students student who said
      hello as 1129 on Thursday rota write something they'll come in.
11h38:
  talks:
      we can
      keep track of people but not
      by names.
      This is a good thing or
      or not
11h40:
  talks:
      Thanks to Sam who points out everyone should have gotten a note that the meeting
      is recorded.
      So I just wanted to
      let you know that
      why I'm recording it so that
      we had so we're not going to share. I'm not going to share the video with you
      I'll make the
      audio recording available
      to be accessible through the
      through the
      meeting blanks
11h41:
  talks:
      Then I can also get a
      which I'll
      so am I sharing the
      zoom chat for meeting
      or not
11h42:
  talks:
      Okay, what am I sharing
11h43:
  talks:
      Okay, on the
11h44:
  talks:
      Okay, I'm gonna try and
      share the right window this time.
      look better
11h45:
  talks:
      Okay, so now I can make sense that I can ask a question again about any thoughts
      about the display of the transcript
11h46:
  talks:
      She can see now.
      Okay, so I think we have everybody in the room now
11h47:
  talks:
      Yeah, okay, so the couple of comments on the chat parents script.
      Okay, so let me say a few things. So the comment about recording the screen so
      I'm not interested in the video recording maybe I, I'll look at it to see if
      it's if it's possibly helpful.
      But that's not
      my reason for recording. My reason for recording is the audio and the
      automatic Transcript generation.
11h48:
  talks:
      Although the documentation says the transcript will be ready shortly after the
      video is ready, but in my case, the test I did on Thursday and Friday. It was a
      long time hours. So maybe we can expect to see the track transcript of our of
      the audio.
      Tomorrow, sometime
      so when we have the transcript of the audio,
      it might be helpful. It couldn't transcript on the transcript to the audio that
      might help to give context to chat. So you can see when things are going on.
11h49:
  talks:
      And so regarding
      de identified
      I was thinking of doing some editing on this.
      But then
      I thought just to let it go ahead and
      be an accurate representation of what
      For people said
      three people said hello and one person said Good morning at 1130 on Thursday,
11h50:
  talks:
      I would just
      be fine to represent that.
      So, I making the public version of this
      transcript available
      to help large class discussions.
      But I still have the names
      of people. So regarding missing the actual student names to me, that's a feature
11h51:
  talks:
      Such a feature but I have them
11h52:
  talks:
      So in terms of the length,
      this is possibly a
      helpful feature.
      We can close parts as well.
      And one of the times
      is it better to represent
      this is not, you don't have this is something to think about. Well, I could
      increase the usefulness of this in terms of
      the timestamps.
      So would it be helpful to have
11h53:
  talks:
      visual representation of the passage of time.
      So 1129 3031 and then have a gap
      between 31 and 35
      and so on and then 4445 4647 and then there was a gap until noon.
11h54:
  talks:
      So instead of suggestion is instead of time stamps
      the question prompted the responses.
      I think that's
      a worthy, worthy goal, to be able to have that
      It's a little bit hard to do.
11h55:
  talks:
      So I'm going to gonna hope that the transcript will
      help that
      provide that context.
      So the reason I didn't include seconds
      in the
      in the timestamp was to group
      common sense Same time.
11h56:
  talks:
      I didn't. I thought
      it might be helpful to have some grouping of them rather than
      just have each each
      timestamp, comment or chat message
      on its own
11h57:
  talks:
      Okay, so
      thank you think about
      how to use this.
      we can talk about somar
      on Thursday,
      but how can we use
      Okay, how can this data be
      as helpful as possible?
11h59:
  talks:
      So, if you're going to say,
      what do you think of that question? Think about for next day How could you
      present the chat data so that it is helpful as possible.
12h00:
  talks:
      Is that enough information?
      So something that happens happening here is there's a delay in
      the chat.
      Now just coming up on
      the chat are
      chat is an asynchronous communication form here
      because you can have that one
      and that's both a positive and a negative because we have to try and put things
      back together in terms of a threat.
12h01:
  talks:
      That's not unlike doing an
      instant messaging
      in some form or another,
      say if somebody if the person you're talking to asks two different questions
      before you can answer the first question.
      And maybe you start to talk about the first question
      before in more than one message before you get to
      question two.
      And so it seems to be not very hard to
      to have things diverge a bit.
12h02:
  talks:
      okay. So my hope is that
      to present the transcripts of the audio, that to say
      together in a similar format
      the chat
      I have a feeling
12h03:
  talks:
      Okay, so
      I'm gonna work on presenting
      for Thursday my homework will be to format the audio transcript in,
      in a way similar to the
      to the chat transcript.
      I have a suspicion though.
      The timestamp in the
      video is from the beginning of the recording notch. Not
      not the time of day that
      is being used in the chat. So, there might be an issue of synchronizing that
      although you think this is not a new problem, so
12h04:
  talks:
      I wonder if
      there's some ways to
      put them together.
      Anyway, I'll see what I get back. We could talk about this tomorrow on
      So is everyone able to get to access your courses now? All the 40 people in the
      zoom chat or the zoom meeting, can
12h05:
  talks:
      access your courses.
      Can you do a half a checkmark
      or an x? For Yes or no?
      See no if I try and add the question into the stream in the chat stream
12h06:
  talks:
      What I noticed is
      so we have 20 people voting yes
      if you're not able to 2122 23
      Sorry, I wasn't
12h07:
  talks:
      I asked her
      show, show check mark or
      exes for yes or no.
      I'm wondering should should we,
      you? Okay, so 28 out of 40 of your courses access. So if you don't have your
      courses x and a send me a note or an email, I'll get you sorted out. Okay.
      So I'm going to clear that.
      So the question next question is
12h08:
  talks:
      All questions.
12h09:
  talks:
      gained one and then we lost two.
      So here's the
      here's an interesting question. So I'm asking
      whether we should put responses into the chat.
      So when I asked her yes or no checkmarks
12h10:
  talks:
      So last time I asked her yes or no checkmarks I got a stream stream of yeses in
      the chat transcript when the chat window
      but now
      the people who are voting for
      holding it six to four
      none of the people who said yes in the chat said
12h11:
  talks:
      None of the positive responses
      are in the chat window.
      Okay, there's one.
      I stand corrected. There's at least one positive response. And I agree with them
      is a bit ambiguous even though we're just
      although it seems like a no.
      Here's a question.
      Who has seen the textbook?
      Yes or no
12h12:
  talks:
      Sorry I cleared the answer. So
12h14:
  talks:
      I think that's my cat.
      anyone remembers from anyone who was here in
      the cute looking one
      on my lap
12h15:
  talks:
      okay, so that was me reporting the results Okay.
12h16:
  talks:
      in the process of getting the textbook
12h18:
  talks:
      Oh, so I didn't hit return there between my report of the results and
      next class response to the question about online access, so
12h19:
  talks:
      Here it is, and I've put in the links. I've updated the links on the webpage
      there are
      available for each chapter.
12h20:
  talks:
      chapters one and two Fisher's thing
12h21:
  talks:
      I'm not sure whether the website is mobile friendly.
      I can't look at it right now.
      You can see whether
      how it appeared. Whether you have a good experience with that website on your
      mobile device
12h22:
  talks:
      I like the enthusiasm in the chat room with all the exclamation points
      flying around.
      Okay, so
12h23:
  talks:
      So I'm getting some reports that the website is working on low file.
      I would say that there's more to
      march working.
      There's more to it than just working.
      So working is the is the bottom rung
      on the list. So first of all,
      you can you're caught so that's the question is can you accomplish a given task
      with a website? And if you can answer yes.
      So then he might say that it's effective.
12h24:
  talks:
      If it's a little
      bit better to
      work with so that you can see
      how you might do other things, then things are well organized. And then the next
      step up is maybe
      comprehensible so that you can
      you can decide what actions come next.
      And then
      a step above that is whether it's satisfying.
      So what are some ways that we can think of being satisfying
12h25:
  talks:
      Don't have to think about what to do.
      We want to do is
      easily available.
      What are some other ways that we can think about being satisfying? So let's
      clear with what happens between
      if we have a goal in mind
      commands to achieve the goal are clear. And when we look at the state of the
      system, we can easily and correctly interpret the state and what needs to be
      done to go from the current state to our goals state. So I'm going to try and
      draw something
12h26:
  talks:
      with my iPad here. Give me a second.
12h27:
  talks:
      Okay, let me see if I can.
      That's my son handiwork. Here
12h28:
  talks:
      we can see some UCF
      All right, I'm ready to draw.
      Can you see that?
      Give me a yes or no.
      If you can see, okay.
12h29:
  talks:
      So I have human computer
      if I write
      single words maybe they're not too illegible
12h30:
  talks:
      Okay, so clicking back to our discussion last day about
      how to use those Chevron's to indicate
      progressive discovery.
      So I saw that that term was used in the Microsoft interface guidelines. And I've
      got a few links that I'll
      put up about that.
      So let's, let's see issue.
      So, if we point the arrow
      up or down, then can indicate the
12h31:
  talks:
      So we're either moving up or down to reveal more content than the question. So
      that makes more sense. I can understand the argument that makes more sense than
      having a sideways arrow and tip it down to display because of sideways because a
      direction that we're going off the screen and maybe that's appropriate for when
      for menus, and so on.
      But not necessarily from
      the idea that there's
      content to be displayed within in place.
      Then the question is
12h32:
  talks:
      keep them separate so the question is
      so just an aside here I've got,
      I don't you can see this.
      I've got to put a dialog box has come up and says, MP devices agent wants to use
      your confidential information in your key chain. I just seen I've just seen an
      ad from Apple about how
      they're big on privacy. So
      good. Good for them, too. To ask for permission, but there's no indication of
      what ANP devices agent
12h33:
  talks:
      is, and if it's
      what it wants to do with, like confidential information.
      So I'm gonna say, I have an idea about that. I'm gonna deny it for now. And you
      can still see it, I think, looks to me like you can.
      Alright, so
      So now the question is to use the app
      to use this to indicate
12h34:
  talks:
      The state or the command.
      So should we see it when
      this content is an
      extra content is displayed, indicating then that it's
      commands that we can use to
      to hide the content
      or should we see it when
      the content is closed and then that indicates the state of content hidden behind
      or below the
      or that can be revealed by clicking.
      So the same thing here
12h35:
  talks:
      So, Commander state that's a question that we see and we work with or we're
      dealing with and when we look at the computer and then
      we tried to make sense of it, we say
      I wonder what this
      is. So this is an example of how the process of evaluation
12h36:
  talks:
      And then you say, Well, I want to see more content.
      But till I do
      so I think I'm gonna press that
      inverted v up.
      The Chevron is pointing up to reveal more content.
      So this is my goal is to do more content I
12h37:
  talks:
      can decide, I think that this is the way to go about it
      and then I can see whether or not what I've done is helping the situation
      helping me to achieve my goal.
      So this is a pretty small example and
      so we can't get
      into too much trouble here
      if you think otherwise But
12h38:
  talks:
      so long as we have a representation. So let's see, the question is
      if we have these icons
      giving the feedback,
      then that's the question is really not as that command or is it representing the
      So we can't get
      too far away. But if if we have such choices which are for our less clear,
      let's say how do I
      display in
      the chat from Monday from Thursday's meeting
      related To
12h39:
  talks:
      the question about Chevron's
      and that's a little bit
      more involved. And
      if if we can
      go to the record for meeting one and see the chat transcript and then look
      through it, then that's a fairly strict and that seems like a reasonable thing
      to do.
      And we
      we don't have up too much chance to make
      mistakes. So
      yeah, as we're pointing at the screen
      out of habit
12h40:
  talks:
      Call from execution
      Can anyone
      fill in the blank here golf
      starts with any
      you have a put your hand up if you want to answer
12h41:
  talks:
      Okay, Richmond will turn your mic on
      stretching. I think
      it's catching inflammation.
      That's right. The inflammation. Yes. So starting with the knee, so
      it's our
      dealing with evaluation.
      Okay. Okay.
      Thanks. Sure. Sorry, I. So if I call on you there's also a way for you to think
      it's the spacebar to turn your own microphone on
12h42:
  talks:
      thank you for the answer.
      So coffer
      So if we have a satisfying experience these, these scoffs are small. And if we
      have a frustrating experience, the costs are large.
      Make sense?
      Like if you have to, if you're scratching your head and thinking about how do I
      accomplish my goal and then
      a very large golf
      well, golf that we're dealing with
12h43:
  talks:
      Okay, so it's
      two minutes left. Any questions or concerns that you want to
      So a question or Discord. Yeah, I just I'm going to figure that out. And I'll
      send an invitation. I'll put an invitation on your courses.
      Chris Harris
12h44:
  talks:
      So for office hours, I was thinking,
      I have a meeting at 3pm today so
      and it sir, it's quarter to one here. So about 130 to 230 today.
      And then
      11 to noon tomorrow
      130 to 230 on Thursday.
      And if you have questions outside of that you can
      send me and you know how to get ahold of me.
      You can use the URL courses or send me email to Derek there Hepting at URI
      gianna.ca. And I have a link on your courses page. Okay, so I'll post my
      artist's rendering of the concept of gulf of execution evaluation.
12h45:
  talks:
      And we'll
      so have a have a look at the
      first two chapters of material from the textbook beyond interaction, primary
      interaction design. And I didn't we didn't talk about my in plate, robot attack
      video, all 13 seconds of it. So if you can have a look at that, and we'll talk
      about that too, on Thursday. Okay, thanks very much for your time.
12h46:
  talks:
      See you on Thursday.
