		In short, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with (other) enthusiasts 
		for artificial intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant future 
		of cerebration to machines alone.  
		There will nevertheless be a fairly long interim during which the main 
		intellectual advances will be made by men and computers working together 
		in intimate association. 
		A multidisciplinary study group, examining future research and development 
		problems of the [United States] Air Force, estimated that it would be 1980 
		before developments in artificial intelligence make it possible for machines 
		alone to do much thinking or problem solving of military significance. 
		That would leave, say, five years to develop man-computer symbiosis
		and fifteen years to use it. 
		The fifteen may be ten or five hundred, but those years should
		be intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind.

		There are these two young fish swimming along, 
		and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, 
		who nods at them and says, &lsquo;Morning, boys, how's the water?&rsquo;
		And the two young fish swim on for a bit, 
		and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, 
		&lsquo;What the hell is water?&rsquo;

		When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is 
		and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. 
		Try not to bash into the walls too much. 
		Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money.
		That's a very limited life. 
		Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: 
		Everything around you that you call life was made up by people 
		that were no smarter than you and you can change it, 
		you can influence it, you can build your own things that other 
		people can use.
		Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.

		In our culture we spend a lot of time with the how. 
		We've become a culture of technocrats and all we do is become technicians 
		asking &lsquo;how do we do this?&rsquo;. 
		Nobody stands back and asks &lsquo;why?&rsquo;.
