	Abstract = {The quality of the natural environment has become one of the primary concerns in present society. 
In Canada, we have been asked to take on the ``One Tonne
Challenge'' to reduce personal household emissions by
1 tonne. However, very little has been done to illuminate
the various connections between our household
purchases and the effect they can have on the quality of
our health and environment. Several decision support
systems are available to assist consumers compare alternatives.
However, these systems do little to enhance
the consumer's experience. Correct clustering of consumers
in terms of their product attribute preferences
would enable the construction of personalized user interfaces
thus increase consumer satisfaction when interacting
with the system and increase the chance of
inspiring greener purchasing habits. This paper analyzes
a clustering technique that uses methods from
multivariate statistics, rough set theory, and machine
learning to cluster users in a web-based environmental
decision support system and test the success of the
clustering. Results from our analysis are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Despite the perceived value of DSS in informing environmental and natural resource management, DSS tools often fail to be adopted by intended end users. By drawing together the experience of a global group of EDSS developers, we have identified and assessed key challenges in EDSS development and offer recommendations to resolve them. Challenges related to engaging end users in EDSS development emphasise the need for a participatory process that embraces end users and stakeholders throughout the design and development process. Adoption challenges concerned with individual and organisational capacities to use EDSS and the match between EDSS and organisational goals can be overcome through the use of an internal champion to promote the EDSS at different levels of a target organisation; co-ordinate and build capacity within the organisation, and; ensure that developers maintain focus on developing EDSS which are relatively easy and inexpensive to use and update (and which are perceived as such by the target users). Significant challenges exist in relation to ensuring EDSS longevity and financial sustainability. Such business challenges may be met through planning and design that considers the long-term costs of training, support, and maintenance; revenue generation and licensing by instituting processes which support communication and interactions; and by employing software technology which enables easy model expansion and re use to gain an economy of scale and reduce development costs. A final group of perhaps more problematic challenges relate to how the success of EDSS ought to be evaluated. Whilst success can be framed relatively easily in terms of interactions with end users, difficulties of definition and measurability emerge in relation to the extent to which EDSS achieve intended outcomes. To tackle the challenges described, the authors provide a set of best practice recommendations concerned with promoting design for ease of use, design for usefulness, establishing trust and credibility, promoting EDSS acceptance, and starting simple and small in functionality terms. Following these recommendations should enhance the achievement of successful EDSS adoption, but more importantly, help facilitate the achievement of desirable social and environmental outcomes.},

	Abstract = {Farmers must now consider climate adaptation amongst other variables when they select crops for the coming year. A changing climate means traditional crop choices may not perform well. Yet, it may be difficult to trust recommendations about new crop choices provided without extensive local knowledge. This paper describes the design and implementation of a prototype tool to support Canadian farmers in their crop selections. However, authoritative data about growing conditions that maximize crop performance has been difficult to assemble. Therefore, we propose an extension to the prototype system that would allow farmers to submit reports of crop performance along with data that describes their growing conditions. With many farmers contributing these experience reports, the data in these reports could be mined to provide localized information about the performance of different crops and the conditions which best support each.},

	Abstract = {Information visualization, aided by ever more accessible computational resources, continues to grow in popularity and significance. The capability to generate complex imagery by computer is often necessary but not always sufficient to gain the desired insight. The success of a visual representation in a given context may be affected by many variables, not the least of which is the individual user's experience. Even if a precise relationship could be found between context and "best" visual representation, the complete articulation of a context is practically impossible. In other fields, this is known as sensitive dependence to initial conditions. A more feasible alternative is to begin with an incomplete articulation of a context and allow the user to interactively develop and refine it. Although most computer interfaces for information visualization tools are predominantly verbal, a predominantly visual interface can have significant advantages. Such an interface allows users to avoid the usual translations between visual and verbal modes and it removes users' need for a specialized visualization vocabulary. A visual interface can also shift the focus of the visualization process from the data towards the user These ideas are discussed in the context of a prototype tool, the design of which is illustrated with an example, and the evaluation of which has provided many positive results.},

	Abstract = {The activity of facial recognition is routine for most people; yet describing the process of recognition, or describing a face to be recognized reveals a great deal of complexity inherent in the activity. Eyewitness identification remains an important element in judicial proceedings. It is very convincing, yet it is not very accurate. We studied how people sorted a collection of facial photographs and found that individuals may have different strategies for similarity recognition. In our analysis of the data, we have identified two possible strategies. We apply rough set based attribute reduction methodology to this data in order to develop a test to identify which of these strategies an individual is likely to prefer. We hypothesize that by providing a personalized search and filter environment, individuals would be more adequately equipped to handle the complexity of the task, thereby increasing the accuracy of identifications. Furthermore, the rough set based analysis may help to more clearly identify the different strategies that individuals use for this task. This paper provides a description of the preliminary study, our computational approach that includes an important pre-processing step, discusses results from our evaluation, and provides a list of opportunities for future work.},

	Abstract = {The digital age has brought about new platforms for collaboration which have provided interesting and effective ways of enabling people to engage in a wide variety of socially-driven activities. One only needs to observe the many free/libre open source software projects on the web, where millions of connected individuals actively participate in the development and deployment of a wide range of software applications and tools. For many of us, there is a great appeal to this ideology, one comprising of a more transparent and open culture of collaboration. Such activities encourage freedom and shared learning which could be considered essential to human growth and innovation. In this paper we describe research with such goals. Specific to our research includes the development of online and mobile user interfaces for the visualization of food ''spimes'' (informationally-rich food-based data), seeking to understand how best to enable and encourage people to share information/knowledge, visualize/compare choices, and understand different aspects of food quality. By democratizing food knowledge in such respects, it is the goal that we develop a more satisfying food culture, enabling people to collectively realize more healthy, socially acceptable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective food choices.},

	Abstract = {There is presently a variety of methods by which to create visualizations, and many of these require a great deal
of manual intervention. Even with those methods by which it is easy to create a single visual representation,
understanding the range of possible visual representations and exploring amongst them is difficult. We present
a generalized interface, called cogito, that permits the user to control exploration of the visualization output of
various manual tools, all without the requirement to modify the original tool. Programming within the cogito
API is required to connect to each tool, but it is not onerous. We consider that the exploratory experience or
activity is valuable, and that it is possible to easily create this experience for standard tools that do not normally
permit exploration. We illustrate this approach with several examples from different kinds of manual interfaces
and discuss the requirements of each.},

	Abstract = {We propose an interactive composition technique to facilitate the exploration of complex parameter spaces. More computer-aided composition than algorithmic composition, human aesthetic judgment is an integral part of the technique. From a set of central parameters, the composer chooses a mapping which allows the generation of both audio and video representations. Features from each representation are then extracted and used as parameters in an iterative re-render process, each step of which can be automated or respond to human input. With this technique, composers can see as well as hear their music as it develops, and can interact and follow paths through the parameter space, exploring sound spaces heretofore unavailable to standard compositional methods.},

	Abstract = {As individuals are increasingly being called to act in environmentally-conscious ways, they will seek out any and all resources which might help to inform their actions. Unfortunately, a 2002 OECD report indicated that there seemed to be declining trust of environmental information sources and increasing confusion about which actions could be most beneficial. Environmental Software Systems can provide relief in this context, if the software design is user-centered. The very specialized nature of much environmental software may discourage these design practices, but this is a false economy. Instead of software that is based on technical models developed by environmental scientists, consider that which can acquire and adapt to changing end-user models of the particular domain. Such adaptation would certainly benefit users, but research could also benefit considerably from data that could prioritize actions of the environmental scientists, from analysis to education. This shift in emphasis agrees with recent trends toward personalization and democratization of software system functionality. If the number of people who could meaningfully explore a model of a particular ecosystem could increase thousand-fold, there could be considerable benefit realized in the level of discourse on environmental issues pertaining to that ecosystem. Such an increased usage would require the removal of barriers for direct user access to the software systems in order to create satisfying user experiences. For the user to be satisfied when confronting a large and complex information space, he or she must not be overwhelmed but able to easily specify and locate that which is of interest. The theoretical basis for such an approach is presented, along with some evidence thus far collected. Opportunities for improvement are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The study of linear fractals has gained a great deal from the study quadratic fractals, despite important differences. Methods for classifying points in the complement of a fractal shape were originally developed for quadratic fractals, to provide insight into their underlying dynamics. These methods were later modified for use with linear fractals. This paper reconsiders one such classification, called escape time, and presents a new algorithm for its computation that is significantly faster and conceptually simpler. Previous methods worked backwards, by mapping pixels into classified regions, whereas the new forward algorithm uses an ``escape buffer'' to mapping classified regions onto pixels. The efficiency of the escape buffer is justified by a careful analysis of its performance on linear fractals with various properties.},

	Abstract = {There is a large gap between attitude and action when it comes to consumer purchases of ethical food. Amongst the various aspects of this gap, this paper focuses on the difficulty in knowing enough about the various dimensions of food production, distribution and consumption to make an ethical food purchasing decision. There is neither one universal definition of ethical food. We suggest that it is possible to support consumers in operationalizing their own ethics of food with the use of appropriate information and communication technology. We consider eggs as an example because locally produced options are available to many people on every continent. We consider the dimensions upon which food ethics may be constructed, then discuss the information required to assess it and the tools that can support it. We then present an overview of opportunities for design of a new software tool. Finally, we offer some points for discussion and future work.},
