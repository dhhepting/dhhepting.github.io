@inproceedings{1995-05-HepHar,
	Abstract = {The study of linear fractals has gained a great deal from the study quadratic fractals, despite important differences. Methods for classifying points in the complement of a fractal shape were originally developed for quadratic fractals, to provide insight into their underlying dynamics. These methods were later modified for use with linear fractals. This paper reconsiders one such classification, called escape time, and presents a new algorithm for its computation that is significantly faster and conceptually simpler. Previous methods worked backwards, by mapping pixels into classified regions, whereas the new forward algorithm uses an ``escape buffer'' to mapping classified regions onto pixels. The efficiency of the escape buffer is justified by a careful analysis of its performance on linear fractals with various properties.},

	Abstract = {There is a large gap between attitude and action when it comes to consumer purchases of ethical food. Amongst the various aspects of this gap, this paper focuses on the difficulty in knowing enough about the various dimensions of food production, distribution and consumption to make an ethical food purchasing decision. There is neither one universal definition of ethical food. We suggest that it is possible to support consumers in operationalizing their own ethics of food with the use of appropriate information and communication technology. We consider eggs as an example because locally produced options are available to many people on every continent. We consider the dimensions upon which food ethics may be constructed, then discuss the information required to assess it and the tools that can support it. We then present an overview of opportunities for design of a new software tool. Finally, we offer some points for discussion and future work.},
