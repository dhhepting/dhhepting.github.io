	Abstract = {This paper describes an approach to match visual and acoustic parameters to produce an animated musical expression. Music may be generated to correspond to animation, as described here; imagery may be created to correspond to music; or both may be developed simultaneously. This approach is intended to provide new tools to facilitate both collaboration between visual artists and musicians and examination of perceptual issues between visual and acoustic media. As a proof-of-concept, a complete example is developed with linear fractals as a basis for the animation, and arranged rhythmic loops for the music. Since both visual and acoustic elements in the example are generated from concise specifications, the potential of this approach to create new works through parameter space exploration is accentuated, however, there are opportunities for application to a wide variety of source material. These additional applications are also discussed, along with issues encountered in development of the example.},

	Abstract = {Computational discovery is facilitated by tools that enable the researcher to focus on a problem and the making sense of results obtained, rather than on the idiosyncrasies of command syntax and the bookkeeping associated with repeated variable command invocations. In a search for insight, imagination should be encouraged more than patience should be required. The cogito software system is described, which allows any researcher a great deal of flexibility to personalize how computational experiments are conducted and how results are visualized. The system features an application programming interface that allows it to be adapted to a wide range of uses.},

	Abstract = {Card sorting was used to gather information about facial similarity judgments. A group of raters put a set of facial photos into an unrestricted number of different piles according to each rater's judgment of similarity. This paper proposes a linear model for 3-way analysis of similarity. An overall rating function is a weighted linear combination of ratings from individual raters. A pair of photos is considered to be similar, dissimilar, or divided, respectively, if the overall rating function is greater than or equal to a certain threshold, is less than or equal to another threshold, or is between the two thresholds. The proposed framework for 3-way analysis of similarity is complementary to studies of similarity based on features of photos.},

	Abstract = {The World of Warcraft (WoW) (Blizzard Entertainment, 2004) massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) provides users with extensive control over its user interface (UI), which has inspired the emergence of a large community devoted to developing UI modifications (UI modding). Through investigation of the members of the community of those who design and use UI modifications for WoW, we gather information that may aid in the creation of communities dedicated to modifying the interfaces of other software packages. The goal of this paper is to study the effect that user created interfaces have had on WoW and its community of users. To achieve this goal, we issued an online survey to WoW players that investigated four aspects of the community: (R1) the backgrounds of its members, (R2) their attitudes towards
modifications and the community itself, (R3) their use of UI modifications, (R4) the characteristics and motivations of users who create and share modifications. The survey results represented numerous unique viewpoints and shed light on the varied nature of the UIM
community of those who design and use WoW modifications. The results suggest that the interface of a videogame is best developed in concert with its players via UI modifications because the users of the system may be the best equipped to design or customize the interface to meet their needs. Since every user may have unique ideas about the perfect interface for a software package, perhaps the only way one could ever satisfy all users is to give them the ability to create their own.},

	Abstract = {There is significant interest in developing new methods to design more effective user interfaces for decision support tools in online shopping environments. Many online companies have already begun to provide their consumers with enhanced user interface options, such as the ability to customize and/or personalize their user interface. However, for these enhanced options to produce meaningful, useful results, consumers are often required to input substantial amounts of information, placing a strain on the consumers' cognitive decision-making abilities and disrupting their focus on their immediate decision task(s). In this paper, the authors describe a personalization technique to reduce the amount of consumer information required to develop and deploy systems providing these enhanced options. Over the course of the three experiments, the authors built upon each experiment utilizing a combination of traditional statistical methods and rough set theory. This paper will describe the refined technique and the procedures, algorithms, observations, and analysis of the experiments conducted. As well, a discussion detailing future work will be provided.},

	Abstract = {Integrated assessment models, decision support systems (DSS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are examples of a growing number of computer-based tools designed to provide decision and information support to people engaged in formulating and implementing environmental policy and management. It is recognised that environmental policy and management users are often not as receptive to using such tools as desired but that little research has been done to uncover and understand the reasons. There is a diverse range of environmental decision and information support tools (DISTs) with uses including organisational and participatory decision support, and scientific research. The different uses and users of DISTs each present particular needs and challenges to the tool developers. The lack of appreciation of the needs of end-users by developers has contributed to the lack of success of many DISTs. Therefore it is important to engage users and other stakeholders in the tool development process to help bridge the gap between design and use. Good practice recommendations for developers to involve users include being clear about the purpose of the tool, working collaboratively with other developers and stakeholders, and building social and scientific credibility.},

	Abstract = {On the Web, many popular e-commerce sites provide consumers with decision support tools to assist them in their commerce-related decision-making. Many consumers will rank the utility of these tools quite highly. Data obtained from web usage mining analyses, which may provide knowledge about a user's online experiences, could help indicate the utility of these tools. This type of analysis could provide insight into whether provided tools are adequately assisting consumers in conducting their online shopping activities or if new or additional enhancements need consideration. Although some research in this regard has been described in previous literature, there is still much that can be done. The authors of this paper hypothesize that a measurement of consumer decision accuracy, i.e. a measurement preferences, could help indicate the utility of these tools. This paper describes a procedure developed towards this goal using elements of rough set theory. The authors evaluated the procedure using two support tools, one based on a tool developed by the US-EPA and the other developed by one of the authors called cogito. Results from the evaluation did provide interesting insights on the utility of both support tools. Although it was shown that the cogito tool obtained slightly higher decision accuracy, both tools could be improved from additional enhancements. Details of the procedure developed and results obtained from the evaluation will be provided. Opportunities for future work are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores refinements to methods used in a procedure being developed by the authors to personalize user interfaces for online shopping support tools. In the authors' original procedure, classical methods in rough set theory are used in conjunction with traditional algorithms in web usage mining. This paper will explore an alternative approach, specifically the dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA), for use with the authors' original procedure. DRSA has its foundations in the classical rough set approach (CRSA). However unlike CRSA, DRSA considers feature/preference-ordered data. In web usage mining analyses, where elicitation of user preferences is a common task, feature/preference order is an important factor and may provide insights that classical/traditional approaches may omit. The authors discuss how DRSA may benefit and improve their original procedure and discuss how the information gained from DRSA analyses could be used to further build their original procedure by enabling item ordering and feature highlighting. This paper will describe the research process, outcomes, and outline opportunities for future work.},

	Abstract = {Donald Norman describes how reflection enables us to critically analyse and review details, compare and contrast situational outcomes, and aid in our general decision-making abilities. Furthermore, he explains how through reflection, we increase our awareness - become smarter - which inevitably enables us to conduct more satisfying decision-making analyses. In a day and age where information is abundant, the activity of reflection may prove more difficult. This is particularly the case for evaluating alternatives for health and environmentally preferable product selection. Key in supporting consumers in such regard is the design of the user interface, one where the interactions provide satisfying user experiences through support for reflective activities supplemented by high quality representations. This paper will discuss the importance of reflection and representation in such regard by describing a framework for system design. A detailed description of the framework is provided along with a discussion describing qualitative results from a recent usability evaluation. Future work is also provided.},

When a gadget breaks, it is often easier and cheaper to throw it away and purchase a new one than to attempt to repair it.

	Abstract = {Bruce Sterling defines spimes, in part, as extensively rich streams of data and information
about things. From a theoretical viewpoint, the concept of spimes is indeed interesting,
with seemingly endless possibilities for enriching our knowledge about the things all around us.
In terms of our everyday decision-making activities, spimes could have significant influence on
our behaviours, empowering us to make more informed choices. No where is this more true than
in topics relating to sustainability, especially in how sustainability relates to the selection of the
food that we eat. With vast amounts of information available, the issue of selecting good food can
be difficult and more adequate support is needed. This paper proposes a framework for design
by discussing a model of social interaction which encourages, engages, and motivates consumer
participation, enabling consumers to share experiences and bridge knowledge barriers. By developing
a framework for community support in such respects, we ensure information quality,
transparency, and potentially provide more effective consumer support accordingly. Thus, we
have a greater chance of choosing better food selections, specifically those from the perspective
of integrating more sustainable choices in our everyday food selections.},

	Abstract = {The quality of the natural environment has become one of the primary concerns in present society.
In Canada, we have been asked to take on the ``One Tonne
Challenge'' to reduce personal household emissions by
1 tonne. However, very little has been done to illuminate
the various connections between our household
purchases and the effect they can have on the quality of
our health and environment. Several decision support
systems are available to assist consumers compare alternatives.
However, these systems do little to enhance
the consumer's experience. Correct clustering of consumers
in terms of their product attribute preferences
would enable the construction of personalized user interfaces
thus increase consumer satisfaction when interacting
with the system and increase the chance of
inspiring greener purchasing habits. This paper analyzes
a clustering technique that uses methods from
multivariate statistics, rough set theory, and machine
learning to cluster users in a web-based environmental
decision support system and test the success of the
clustering. Results from our analysis are discussed.},

A high-quality interface should enable users to perform prescribed tasks quickly and without errors. The interface should also enable users to find products which match their personal values. A high-quality interface can especially empower those diverse users who might otherwise be overwhelmed by technology but who need information to ground their actions. By examining user performance in such regards, insight into the quality of interface may be acheived. For this purpose, we examined user performance while utilizing different interfaces for product selections.

	Abstract = {Despite the perceived value of DSS in informing environmental and natural resource management, DSS tools often fail to be adopted by intended end users. By drawing together the experience of a global group of EDSS developers, we have identified and assessed key challenges in EDSS development and offer recommendations to resolve them. Challenges related to engaging end users in EDSS development emphasise the need for a participatory process that embraces end users and stakeholders throughout the design and development process. Adoption challenges concerned with individual and organisational capacities to use EDSS and the match between EDSS and organisational goals can be overcome through the use of an internal champion to promote the EDSS at different levels of a target organisation; co-ordinate and build capacity within the organisation, and; ensure that developers maintain focus on developing EDSS which are relatively easy and inexpensive to use and update (and which are perceived as such by the target users). Significant challenges exist in relation to ensuring EDSS longevity and financial sustainability. Such business challenges may be met through planning and design that considers the long-term costs of training, support, and maintenance; revenue generation and licensing by instituting processes which support communication and interactions; and by employing software technology which enables easy model expansion and re use to gain an economy of scale and reduce development costs. A final group of perhaps more problematic challenges relate to how the success of EDSS ought to be evaluated. Whilst success can be framed relatively easily in terms of interactions with end users, difficulties of definition and measurability emerge in relation to the extent to which EDSS achieve intended outcomes. To tackle the challenges described, the authors provide a set of best practice recommendations concerned with promoting design for ease of use, design for usefulness, establishing trust and credibility, promoting EDSS acceptance, and starting simple and small in functionality terms. Following these recommendations should enhance the achievement of successful EDSS adoption, but more importantly, help facilitate the achievement of desirable social and environmental outcomes.},

Yet, it may be difficult to trust recommendations about new crop choices provided without extensive local knowledge. This paper describes the design and implementation of a prototype tool to support Canadian farmers in their crop selections. However, authoritative data about growing conditions that maximize crop performance has been difficult to assemble. Therefore, we propose an extension to the prototype system that would allow farmers to submit reports of crop performance along with data that describes their growing conditions. With many farmers contributing these experience reports, the data in these reports could be mined to provide localized information about the performance of different crops and the conditions which best support each.},

	Abstract = {Information visualization, aided by ever more accessible computational resources, continues to grow in popularity and significance. The capability to generate complex imagery by computer is often necessary but not always sufficient to gain the desired insight. The success of a visual representation in a given context may be affected by many variables, not the least of which is the individual user's experience. Even if a precise relationship could be found between context and "best" visual representation, the complete articulation of a context is practically impossible. In other fields, this is known as sensitive dependence to initial conditions. A more feasible alternative is to begin with an incomplete articulation of a context and allow the user to interactively develop and refine it. Although most computer interfaces for information visualization tools are predominantly verbal, a predominantly visual interface can have significant advantages. Such an interface allows users to avoid the usual translations between visual and verbal modes and it removes users' need for a specialized visualization vocabulary. A visual interface can also shift the focus of the visualization process from the data towards the user These ideas are discussed in the context of a prototype tool, the design of which is illustrated with an example, and the evaluation of which has provided many positive results.},

	Abstract = {The activity of facial recognition is routine for most people; yet describing the process of recognition, or describing a face to be recognized reveals a great deal of complexity inherent in the activity. Eyewitness identification remains an important element in judicial proceedings. It is very convincing, yet it is not very accurate. We studied how people sorted a collection of facial photographs and found that individuals may have different strategies for similarity recognition. In our analysis of the data, we have identified two possible strategies. We apply rough set based attribute reduction methodology to this data in order to develop a test to identify which of these strategies an individual is likely to prefer. We hypothesize that by providing a personalized search and filter environment, individuals would be more adequately equipped to handle the complexity of the task, thereby increasing the accuracy of identifications. Furthermore, the rough set based analysis may help to more clearly identify the different strategies that individuals use for this task. This paper provides a description of the preliminary study, our computational approach that includes an important pre-processing step, discusses results from our evaluation, and provides a list of opportunities for future work.},

	Abstract = {The digital age has brought about new platforms for collaboration which have provided interesting and effective ways of enabling people to engage in a wide variety of socially-driven activities. One only needs to observe the many free/libre open source software projects on the web, where millions of connected individuals actively participate in the development and deployment of a wide range of software applications and tools. For many of us, there is a great appeal to this ideology, one comprising of a more transparent and open culture of collaboration. Such activities encourage freedom and shared learning which could be considered essential to human growth and innovation. In this paper we describe research with such goals. Specific to our research includes the development of online and mobile user interfaces for the visualization of food ''spimes'' (informationally-rich food-based data), seeking to understand how best to enable and encourage people to share information/knowledge, visualize/compare choices, and understand different aspects of food quality. By democratizing food knowledge in such respects, it is the goal that we develop a more satisfying food culture, enabling people to collectively realize more healthy, socially acceptable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective food choices.},

	Abstract = {The card sorting problem involves the similarity judgments of pairs of photos, taken from a set of photos, by a group of participants. Given the lack of an objective standard for judging similarity, different participants may be using different strategies in judging the similarity of photos. It could be very useful to identify and study these strategies. In this paper, we present a framework for three-way analysis of judgments of similarity. Based on judgments by the set of participants, we divide all pairs of photos into three classes: a set of similar pairs that are judged by at least 60% of participants as similar; a set of dissimilar pairs that are judged by at least 60% of participants as dissimilar; and a set of undecidable pairs that have conflicting judgments. A more refined three-way classification method is also suggested based on a quantitative description of the quality of similarity judgments. The classification in terms of three classes provides an effective method to examine the notions of similarity, dissimilarity, and disagreement.},

a generalized interface, called cogito, that permits the user to control exploration of the visualization output of
various manual tools, all without the requirement to modify the original tool. Programming within the cogito
API is required to connect to each tool, but it is not onerous. We consider that the exploratory experience or
activity is valuable, and that it is possible to easily create this experience for standard tools that do not normally
permit exploration. We illustrate this approach with several examples from different kinds of manual interfaces
and discuss the requirements of each.},

More computer-aided composition than algorithmic composition, human aesthetic judgment is an integral part of the technique. From a set of central parameters, the composer chooses a mapping which allows the generation of both audio and video representations. Features from each representation are then extracted and used as parameters in an iterative re-render process, each step of which can be automated or respond to human input. With this technique, composers can see as well as hear their music as it develops, and can interact and follow paths through the parameter space, exploring sound spaces heretofore unavailable to standard compositional methods.},

Computer-graphical visualization is a natural and powerful addition to these tools used for the qualitative study of dynamical systems, especially for the study of invariant manifolds. The dynamics of two linearly coupled oscillators is the focus of this case study. With little or no coupling between the oscillators, an invariant torus is present but it breaks down for strong coupling. Visualization has been employed to gain a qualitative understanding of this breakdown process. The visualization has allowed key features of the tori to be recognized, and it has proven to be indispensable in developing and testing hypotheses about the tori.},

	Abstract = {As individuals are increasingly being called to act in environmentally-conscious ways, they will seek out any and all resources which might help to inform their actions. Unfortunately, a 2002 OECD report indicated that there seemed to be declining trust of environmental information sources and increasing confusion about which actions could be most beneficial. Environmental Software Systems can provide relief in this context, if the software design is user-centered. The very specialized nature of much environmental software may discourage these design practices, but this is a false economy. Instead of software that is based on technical models developed by environmental scientists, consider that which can acquire and adapt to changing end-user models of the particular domain. Such adaptation would certainly benefit users, but research could also benefit considerably from data that could prioritize actions of the environmental scientists, from analysis to education. This shift in emphasis agrees with recent trends toward personalization and democratization of software system functionality. If the number of people who could meaningfully explore a model of a particular ecosystem could increase thousand-fold, there could be considerable benefit realized in the level of discourse on environmental issues pertaining to that ecosystem. Such an increased usage would require the removal of barriers for direct user access to the software systems in order to create satisfying user experiences. For the user to be satisfied when confronting a large and complex information space, he or she must not be overwhelmed but able to easily specify and locate that which is of interest. The theoretical basis for such an approach is presented, along with some evidence thus far collected. Opportunities for improvement are also discussed.},

	Abstract = {The study of linear fractals has gained a great deal from the study quadratic fractals, despite important differences. Methods for classifying points in the complement of a fractal shape were originally developed for quadratic fractals, to provide insight into their underlying dynamics. These methods were later modified for use with linear fractals. This paper reconsiders one such classification, called escape time, and presents a new algorithm for its computation that is significantly faster and conceptually simpler. Previous methods worked backwards, by mapping pixels into classified regions, whereas the new forward algorithm uses an ``escape buffer'' to mapping classified regions onto pixels. The efficiency of the escape buffer is justified by a careful analysis of its performance on linear fractals with various properties.},

	Abstract = {Parametric images, defined by a small number of parameters, may help to democratize access to image creation because simple parameter manipulations can yield interesting variations. Foe example, many people appreciate the aesthetics of fractal images, but few are inclined to engage in the mathematics needed to create them. A perception-driven interface for fractal image creation could find a wide audience as people could use it as an outlet for their own creative expression. This paper discusses some first steps along that path, with a study and analysis of how participants perceived changes between smoothly varying images. Further steps towards a perception-driven interface are then laid out.},

	Abstract = {In an open card sorting study of 356 facial photographs, each of 25 participants created an unconstrained number of piles. We consider all 63,190 possible pairs of photos: if both photos are in the same pile for a participant, we consider them as rated similar; otherwise we consider them as rated dissimilar. Each pair of photos is an attribute in an information system where the participants are the objects. We consider whether the attribute values permit accurate classification of the objects according to binary decision classes, without loss of generality. We propose a discernibility coefficient to measure the support of an attribute for classification according to a given decision class pair. We hypothesize that decision class pairs with the support of many attributes are more representative of the data than those with the support of few attributes. We present some computational experiments and discuss opportunities for future work.},

@inproceedings{1991-12-HepPruSau,
	Abstract = {This paper describes rendering methods for iterated function systems (IFS's). The rendering process consists of the generation of a field of data using an IFS and its visualization by means of computer graphics. Two groups of methods are presented: 1. Rendering of the attractor A of an IFS. These attracting methods may visualize the geometry and additionally the invariant measure supported by the attractor. 2. Rendering the complement of the attractor. There are three approaches, namely methods representing Euclidean distance from A; repelling methods, computing the escape time of a point from A, and methods using (electrostatic) potential functions of the attractor. The last of these methods calculates integrals with respect to the invariant measure of the attractor. An algorithm which generates an approximation of such integrals with prescribed tolerance is presented. This provides an alternative to the usual approach based on Elton's ergodic theorem and time average of trajectories generated by the ``chaos game'', where no error bound is available. Algorithms specifying the details of all methods are presented, some of them in the form of pseudocode. Examples of images obtained using these algorithms are given. The relationship to previously developed methods for visualizing Mandelbrot and Julia sets is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {There is a large gap between attitude and action when it comes to consumer purchases of ethical food. Amongst the various aspects of this gap, this paper focuses on the difficulty in knowing enough about the various dimensions of food production, distribution and consumption to make an ethical food purchasing decision. There is neither one universal definition of ethical food. We suggest that it is possible to support consumers in operationalizing their own ethics of food with the use of appropriate information and communication technology. We consider eggs as an example because locally produced options are available to many people on every continent. We consider the dimensions upon which food ethics may be constructed, then discuss the information required to assess it and the tools that can support it. We then present an overview of opportunities for design of a new software tool. Finally, we offer some points for discussion and future work.},
