S12: It shows for me DHH: I have the chat window uo, but please raise your hand if you would like to speak or have a question. Audio DHH: So I'm just typing a message in the chat, as well here. So I have a chat. I'll try and keep an eye on the chat that if you have something to say there's a blue hand icon at the bottom of your your communication window http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h36 11h36 Chat S11: right Audio DHH: Okay, so the other can see how the yes and no http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h37 11h37 Audio DHH: Some directions or if I should go slower faster, probably you won't say to me go slower. They'll try and work on faster to get going here and then more you can give a thumbs up or thumbs down a wave and I guess either break or need some coffee. I have coffee with me. How many people have coffee with them? Do a yes for coffee. I include myself in a coffee. So for two to four 44 participants http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h38 11h38 Audio DHH: over half and half the know is taking it okay for any nose. Are you have you already had your coffee today and because it's already 1130 you're sufficiently caffeinated tea still 50% participation http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h39 11h39 Audio DHH: civil of half and half for coffee, okay, so I'm going to clear So the next question is, is even pressing yes or no icon on the interface, too much to ask for participation from computer science students yes or no. Realize like, there was one yes. I realized that if I get a yes answer there. You're http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h40 11h40 Audio DHH: torn between clicking yes is too much and not participate well. Anyway some ideas about I'll try and get the other other half the class engaged somehow okay http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h41 11h41 Audio DHH: So I'm doing an audio recording of this for myself, which all I'll post later. So, in past when we've had in person meetings, taken pictures of the lightboard and so on, to go along with the media from our meetings. So I'm going to see what having the audio recordings of our sessions posted as usual, but then maybe the chat or some notes that I type in we'll figure out how to http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h42 11h42 Audio DHH: To best present the topic flow of our discussion so I promise semester I had my iPad hooked up for drying. Like I was drying on the board and class. People asked me to stop doing that because it was too hard to read. Even more difficult to the whiteboard http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h43 11h43 Audio DHH: Okay, so everybody, Did everybody get a message in your courses? Do you know of anybody who is not getting who thinks they're registered and who didn't get a about the zoom link if there's http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h44 11h44 Chat S10: I'm not aware of anyone, but I don't know anyone else in this class :| S13: there is a 0% complete bar on the dashboard Audio DHH: Anybody here who's not registered? Who doesn't have a URL of your courses? access to Port 28 and a 28 page. Does that make sense? anyone willing to give me a yes or no for? Does that make sense? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h45 11h45 Chat S13: under the course Audio DHH: so I think you're seeing the your courses page now. That's being shared with you. let's see, from Shawn. There's a zero percent complete vironment that dashboard. Okay. Your courses dashboard http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h46 11h46 Chat DHH: https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084 S13: it's fine I have access so I guess it doesn't matter. DHH: OK Audio DHH: Yeah, I'm I'm not listed. Can everybody find this page to course ID, you should be able to go to this directly and I put it in the chat. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h47 11h47 Chat S11: no S14: No S02: No S15: No I think it is accessible S16: No S17: No S05: the course is under past courses fall 2019 S18: I see it under past courses Audio DHH: Any problems getting to the URL courses page http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h48 11h48 Audio DHH: Well, we'll get we'll get that sorted out that you can you can get to the course directly from here. So let me unclutter my desktop of it here. I was experimenting over the past few days with the idea of having my Mac take dictation of what I'm saying. But in the as far as I can tell, it needs to have input focus. Not even work then so http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h49 11h49 Audio DHH: It's still a work in progress in terms of getting a transcript of our discussion. So, let's go let's pause us to our next day. I mean http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h50 11h50 Audio DHH: I just upgraded to and I've learned that I can have a sec use my iPad as a second screen so I'm gonna work on that as well because my 13 inch MacBook Air. It's nice. It's so hard to clear space for everything. When I have zoom going in, I have http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h51 11h51 Audio DHH: See 12344 including the screenshare windows assumed going here http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h52 11h52 Audio DHH: Okay, so these should all work. So this is Yeah. So Shawn had the comment about the zero percent progress bar and I think that's related to your progress tracking so he can see your progress here. That's what's going on. So here's the URL courses student User Guide, if you have questions about your courses so here's my website. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h53 11h53 Audio DHH: So let me go to that. Oh, I see. Maybe because I did the try to open its own tab and it just opened the tab with the link Instead of going there directly, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h54 11h54 Audio DHH: come back to that. Let's see if this one goes directly or less. So here's the link. The DHH link on my schedule is the link for the class on my webpage and URC is your courses link. So I'm doing things in turn with my site is being built with Jekyll which is so how many people have heard of Jekyll before http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h55 11h55 Audio DHH: Okay, so it's a tool for static Website Builder. And it's the one that goes with GitHub Pages. So if you create, if you have a GitHub account, you can get a web there are some easy ways to use the tracker app. So way to build the website and have it appear on github.io http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h56 11h56 Audio DHH: So I've been working on this for a little bit, my webpage and I've taken some other suggestions from past semesters and I'm open to your suggestions as well. I'm doing this http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h57 11h57 Audio DHH: The website using bootstrap how many people have heard of bootstrap 4.2 Twitter. So that's a mobile first web web design. So it's a toolkit, library, JavaScript and CSS and all these different web technologies to make to support responsive design. So let's go to this is about a mobile phone sighs can see that Work http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h58 11h58 Audio DHH: reasonably well. So, today's so the question topic we're going to be exploring this semester in general is what makes a good interface and then how do we design an interface for, for people, for humans. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#11h59 11h59 Audio DHH: Here we go. So how many of you How many people think that I'm using the chevron correctly here? So should it be closed? Should it be closed like, like it is, or should it be pointing down when it's closed, and then pointing straight up when it's So I know how many people notice the use of the chevron and on Wikipedia http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h00 12h00 Chat S05: yes I agree with that Audio DHH: To me this makes more sense that here's here it is being closed. But there's more content here. So I can open it and access it. Because and to me, it seems like if it's pointing down or pointing up, it's a little bit less clear to me whether it's open or closed. Because I could see that if it's pointing up it could mean that it's closed or http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h01 12h01 Audio DHH: It's a question of is it closed? Or do I need to click on it to close it? Whereas if it's pointing to the side I know that it's not Oh, I, I have a sense of a stronger sense that it's closed and it's going to be opened. If I click on that link take a quick poll. Okay, so the question is http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h02 12h02 Audio DHH: Have a phrase the question is yes you know, do you like do you prefer so Wikipedia is is the example that comes to mind most quickly but then there's other other ones as well. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h03 12h03 Chat DHH: Do you prefer Wikipedia’s use of chevrons (^, v) to mine (&gt;,v) Audio DHH: So don't worry about hurting my feelings. So you can say yes. For Wikipedia and no for for me For mine, the example that's shown here on my http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h04 12h04 Chat S13: Yours works S02: Im thinking this one is good enough... S14: Wikipedia S07: I prefer yours S19: Yours Audio DHH: I realize I can't see him here. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h05 12h05 Chat S15: Yours S04: yours S02: Yours S11: in my opinion as long as it is consistent in a group of chevrons and makes sense, users gets use to it. S10: I would prefer to use a symbol like '-' for folded. and then use a down-arrow for unfolded. or '+' for folded, and '-' for unfolded. Audio DHH: Okay, so I'm getting a couple. So we have about 5050 for those who are participating and that, that's fine. So if you want to actually speak and unmute your microphone, you can do that. Just put your hand up so I could acknowledge you http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h06 12h06 Chat S05: - and + easy to understand Audio DHH: Okay, so as it's written in the chat, if you would prefer to use a symbol like Linus refolded or collapsed and then a down arrow for showing her request for collapsed and minus for uncollapse are shown. So that's another another set of choices. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h07 12h07 Audio DHH: So of the seven people who said yes to Wikipedia, why do you think that works? Well, I just the Wikipedia way of doing it work. Let's see. I'm doing http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h08 12h08 Chat S17: To me, it's because it's like it's the \"direction\" that the relevant content is going to move, with the right arrow that direction doesn't match the arrow in that layout at least Audio DHH: So I see that nothing has collapsed here let's see what happens if we go to a mobile site. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h09 12h09 Chat S11: it works on mobile device S12: To me its more intuitive, the v mean to drop down(expand) the content and then the ^ means the opposite to condense the content upwards S15: https://www.wikipedia.org we can see chevrons here Audio DHH: Okay, so not my purpose wasn't to try and test out Wikipedia. If you go to the Wikipedia page on Wikipedia on your mobile device http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h10 12h10 Chat S13: I think Wikipedia way works is because it follows conventional logic. So does the + and - symbols. S13: by testing Audio DHH: I don't see a way to switch to the mobile app site. So how do we So Mitra has identified the word that I was going to explore this more intuitive. So how do we develop intuition? How do we say that an interface is intuitive or not? This is just happened by magic so to speak. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h11 12h11 Chat S17: Also, theoretically, up and down arrows are more universal, where a right arrow would be pointing \"backwards\" in right-to-left languages S10: I think intuitiveness in interface comes from the existence of real worldanalogues S05: users response or users understanding S20: Familiarity. S21: From experience over time S14: It is coming from the day to day life S03: Intuition comes from past experiences and what we expect from them? S12: I think partly from past experiences. Audio DHH: So, where to From where does intuition come? I'm not going to ask for people to use the microphone if they're not comfortable. But Can somebody reply in the chat question about intuition. Maybe you have already http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h12 12h12 Chat S07: I think intuition is developed from user knowledge, understanding and experience S11: general understanding S09: maybe something like instinct, i.e. liking shiny things from once relating that to water Audio DHH: Okay, so something's familiar. past experience analytics. Yeah, so we have the idea of it doesn't necessarily agree with word processors, we don't have a, we don't come up with the idea of cut and paste is Ctrl V and control. Pardon me Ctrl C and Ctrl V or Command C and Command V on a Mac on an apple platform. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h13 12h13 Audio DHH: So we don't come up with those ideas just to start us in here, but because they've become popularized and adopted in other interfaces. So we get our intuition about how things work on the computer. from our experience with other pieces of computer software, it's one thing and then when we're dealing with a new piece of software to do new things, we do look for and we can help the user to, to develop intuition by connecting it with something they've had experience with In the http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h14 12h14 Audio DHH: real world, so to speak. we can encourage a metaphor. For example, a standard or common example for a metaphor maybe trying to connect people who have done haven't been online shopping before to connect that experience with going to a store a bricks and mortar store and doing some shopping. So, you might well, let me let me pose it as a question for some further discussion next day http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h15 12h15 Audio DHH: What are the things that are familiar that would help somebody understand how to do online shopping online shopping that can be connected to a bricks and mortar store kind of experience. let's we'll have a full a discussion online and and our next meeting http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h16 12h16 Chat S11: exactly. Audio DHH: So I understand just thinking about Stephen Colbert talking about playing to an audience and how difficult it's been to record shows at his home looking into a screen on its own screen on this computer or camera and not having any Not like I'm well, not to compare myself too much to Stephen Colbert except I can identify with that. So, my thought is that we could more of a http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h17 12h17 Audio DHH: This can be more of a sort of flipped classroom so that we'd have things to look at between meetings and then the next meeting we can talk about them and work through problems and discuss. That seemed like it might be a good way to to go http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h18 12h18 Audio DHH: So here's another question. For the people who aren't clicking yes or no. Can you? Is there a way that you could see yourselves being comfortable and participating in these sorts of discussions in class? Should we set up should we use groups and breakout rooms I haven't done breakout rooms into But should we have some some problems to deal with and then work in small groups. Okay http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h19 12h19 Chat S14: yes we can S13: it's on S22: We can hear S23: I can hear her S09: yeah I can hear you S21: I can hear you Audio DHH: so I'm looking in the chat the exact timestamp the carry on said exactly so that's a good general response flickable too many questions okay Harry i'll go ahead should be ready to be able to come microphone should be on http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h20 12h20 Chat S02: We can hear you Audio DHH: Did you mean to put it on? Yeah, go ahead. Okay, well, thank you for for putting your hand up and demonstrating to class that it's not. Not not too onerous to do that. Not yet. They're 46 people here http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h21 12h21 Chat S10: I like verbal discussions, but also I like chat discussions since you never miss your chance to reply to something you're interested. I remember especially during the classes, we would get some pretty heated discussions, but the conversation needed to be cutoff so class could continue. We had forums, but once we were out of class, we didn't necessarily maintain the same passion for it later. Audio DHH: are nervous about that. But yeah. Well, so I was going to talk about that as well. I took a class, a math class on semester long ago when I was an undergraduate. And we spent the semester studying wallpaper There are 17 different ways in this will be with me for the rest of my day is that there are seven Ways to have a wallpaper pattern. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h22 12h22 Chat S11: thank you guys for the response Audio DHH: And my favorite, I think, is the glide reflection. But I'm not going to talk about all paper patterns. But what, what I wanted to say about that is, when we're studying the you can become immersed in that in the subject. So when I was in that class I was looking at every time I saw a wallpaper, and see what kind of symmetry it had. I would be much more attuned to it. So now that we're talking about human computer communications, and how to develop that are centered on people. So I'd like you to take off http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h23 12h23 Audio DHH: Being that much more observant about the software and the other interfaces you encounter in your daily lives and then we can discuss them. So if you have screenshots or descriptions of on the web or in your in on your computers, or things that you encounter in daily life like the getting a parking ticket, not paying for a parking spot for example, or that's it. Maybe using an elevator http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h24 12h24 Audio DHH: that's a pretty standard interface coffeemakers whatever else and we'll talk about the the principles give those six kinds of examples. Okay, Shivam has his hand up. Oh, I see what I did. I put your hand down first and then I tried to unmute your microphone and then you went back to alphabetical order. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h25 12h25 Audio DHH: Oh, oh, okay. All right. Let me go back to my web page here. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h26 12h26 Audio DHH: Yeah, so I'm just reading the chat here from Ezra and I do see times now. Anyway so that's good to know http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h27 12h27 Audio DHH: Let me just if you're looking at my website on desktop, it's it's not very pretty. It looks like a bunch of lines. The headings are are not arranged nicely, they just go from top to bottom. But this is designed so I'm thinking about you having your phone with you. So here are the meeting site. You can you can click to get to different meetings. And the title of the meeting is the date for a meeting. So our next meeting is Tuesday, September. And then so on and so forth. So we're meeting 26 times. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h28 12h28 Audio DHH: And I have the need when you come to this page for the class. I have the meetings open, as we've talked about already. So then here's some information and I'm trying a few different things. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h29 12h29 Audio DHH: So the dates here are wrong, but they're approximately correct. I put in the current semester but I didn't change the dates yet. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h44 12h44 Chat S11: thank you http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/01_Thu-03-Sep-2020.html#12h45 12h45 Chat S02: Thank you and you too S24: Thank you!

Outline for Today Concluding Thoughts Transcript from Meeting http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h27 11h27 Audio DHH: So can everyone hear me all right? Come on yeses. Okay. How's everyone doing today? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h29 11h29 Audio DHH: So just as we're getting people into the meeting, Maybe you didn't hear the notice about this meeting being recorded. In my own attempt to record last day's meeting, my recording cut out partway through and I've been experimenting with zoom to have it produce a transcript, so that a transcript is available of each meeting. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h33 11h33 Chat S01: I can't hear you. is it just me who is having this problem ? S02: Same here S03: Same I can't hear either S04: No I can’t as well http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h34 11h34 Chat S05: Last thing I heard was about the potential of a transcript for the class? S01: yes S05: yep S02: yes S03: Yes I can hear now Audio DHH: To begin with, you can see beside my name in the list of participants is a little cloud with a dot on it that says it's recording. So the idea is that we can have an audio recording and a transcript of it for each meeting. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h35 11h35 Audio DHH: Alright, so there are lots of things going on here. What I want to do first of all is to start sharing my screen and we can look at the (my) website for this course. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h36 11h36 Chat DHH: As we get people into the meeting, a reminder that the meeting is being recorded so that we can have audio and a transcript of the meeting. I will not keep your names in the transcript of the meeting. Audio DHH: Alright, so here's the updated version that should be published on the public website soon. This screen is from the chat recorded during Thursday's meeting. I'm experimenting with the display so you can let me know what you think. So DHH, that's me. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h37 11h37 Chat S05: There was a prompt when entering into the meeting that it was begin recorded. Audio DHH: In case you're wondering, the DHH is Daryl H. Hepting. You can call me Daryl or Dr. Hepting [or, as Zoom transcribed it, Dr. Happening], but I'd like you to pick one of those two. So this is the way that I presented the chat and anything that was sent to me privately has been excluded. The identifiers are consistent throughout the chat session. For example, any contribution from the student who typed 'hello!' at 11h29 during Thursday's meeting will be labelled as S03. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h38 11h38 Audio DHH: We can keep track of people, but not by names. This is a good thing or a bad thing in different situations. It is an example of a tradeoff. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h40 11h40 Chat DHH: Any thoughts about the display of the chat transcript? Audio DHH: Student, who points out that everyone should have gotten a note that the meeting is recorded, I just wanted to let you know why I'm recording it. We are not going to share (I'm not going to share the video with you) but I'll make the audio recording available and accessible. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h41 11h41 Chat S05: You aren't displaying the transcript, just the info for today's lecture. Audio DHH: Then I can also get a transcript of the audio and the zoom text chat for each meeting. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h42 11h42 Chat S07: No S01: not on display S08: no S09: if you record through zoom, it only records the screen shared part S03: Can't see it here. I had to go to the site to see it http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h43 11h43 Chat S07: your website S01: screen to the meetings, information, assignment page S10: We can see the cs428 website and chrome. S05: CS 428+828 in 202030 is the title http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h45 11h45 Chat S05: Yep S08: yes S01: yes Audio DHH: OK, so now it makes sense that I can ask a question again about any thoughts about the display the chat transcript. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h46 11h46 Chat S07: yes S11: Yes S02: Yes S12: yes S13: yes Audio DHH: Okay. I think we have everybody in the room now. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h47 11h47 Chat S05: It looks good. Only some comments lack context. Audio DHH: A couple of comments and chat transcripts. Let me say a few things about recording the screen. I'm not interested in the video recording. Maybe I will look at it and see if it's possibly helpful. But that's not my reason for recording. My reason for recording is the audio and the automatic transcript generation. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h48 11h48 Chat S14: This looks better, but when you want to evaluate class interaction of the students and give them grades. At that time, providing students first/last name in chat transcript, would help you in evaluation S01: with time stamps in blocks, i think it will be a lengthy document Audio DHH: Although the documentation says that the transcript will be ready shortly after the video is ready. But in my case, with the tests that I did on Thursday and Friday. It was a long time. Hours. So maybe you can expect to see the transcript of the audio tomorrow, sometime. So when we have a transcript of the audio, it might be helpful for the audio transcript to give context to the chat so you can see what things are going on. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h49 11h49 Chat S07: transcript is missing the actual student names Audio DHH: And so regarding the de-identified students, I was thinking of doing some editing on the chat transcript. But then I thought to let it go ahead and be an 'accurate' representation of what happened. So, if a few people wrote 'hello' and one person wrote 'good morning' at 11h30 on Thursday, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h50 11h50 Audio DHH: then I would just be fine to represent that. So I'm making the public version of this chat transcript available to help start class discussions. I still have the names of people who contributed even though the actual names have been removed from the public transcript. This seems like it could be a helpful feature. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h52 11h52 Chat DHH: No student names is a feature, but I have them still in the raw data S07: This seems great . Good to know S14: Sounds good! Audio DHH: We can close parts of the transcript as well. And what about the times? Is it better to represent the passage of time? This is something to think about. Could we increase the usefulness of this transcript in terms of the timestamps? Would it be helpful to have a visual representation of the passage of time? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h53 11h53 Audio DHH: So there is activity at 11h29 and then a gap until 11h33 then activity each minute until 11h38. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h54 11h54 Chat S05: Instead of time, have question that prompted the responses S12: Yes it will keep the track of topic of discussion S15: How about we just skip the time when we had no responses or chats? Helps in optimizing Audio DHH: So instead of time stamps, perhaps the question that prompted the responses? I think that's a worthy goal to be able to have that connection. It may be a little bit hard to do. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h55 11h55 Chat S16: I think having the time is still important, cuz then you can go and get the context within the video and see if something is missing. S10: It feels like some are close together, could group close ones together since they will be on similar topics. Like group ones that are 2 or less minutes apart maybe. Though they open easy so we can infer that ourselves as well. If the questions grouping are easy to implement I support that option as well that's helpful for context. S01: it will be complex to have the topic from the audio. but if questions were put in chat, that the convenient way Audio DHH: I'm going to hope that the transcript will help provide that context, by grouping together things that happened at the same time. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h56 11h56 Chat S07: I think it will be good to have it in standard time format HH:MM:SS. It seems to be more descriptive. Audio DHH: I didn't. I thought that it might be helpful to have some grouping of them. Rather than just have each each timestamp, comment, or chat message on its own. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h57 11h57 Chat S07: Oh sorry I did not mean to include SS . I mean to have it in standard time format like HH:MM S17: Maye we can change the way we formulate the question in the chat, students can take the extra effort of using Q1) and then post it, people can answer or discuss on it. It would be easy to group it then? Audio DHH: Think about how to use this transcript, and we can talk about it some more on Thursday. How can we use this data, or how can this data be made as helpful as possible? \" http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h59 11h59 Chat S02: If we include the question that raises the responses then it will be same as the forum nit the chat. I think time is important to include in the chat and subject to the response can be added before replying to the chat. S02: not* Audio DHH: So, if you're going to say that you want to do X then what kind of interface supports X? What do you think of that question? Think about for next day. How could you present the chat data so that it is as helpful as possible? \" http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#12h00 12h00 Chat S17: That seems a fair point. DHH: To think about for next day, how could you present the chat data so that it is as helpful as possible? S14: What I think is it might be very difficult to track question numbers for students, sometimes we end up mentioning wrong question number and it can introduce challenges for the person who is referring the chat later Audio DHH: Is that enough information? So something that happens happening here is that there's a delay in the chat. Answers coming up on the chat are responses to something typed (much) earlier. Chat is an asynchronous communication form. And that's both positive and negative because we have to try and put things back together in terms of a thread. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#12h01 12h01 Audio DHH: \" But that's not unlike doing an interview instant messaging. in some form or another. Say, somebody person you're talking to. Two different questions before you can answer the first question. And maybe still want to talk about the first question. Before In more than one message before you get to question two. And so it seems to be not very hard to To have things to verge of it. \" http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#12h02 12h02 Chat S01: there is always a delay between putting our thoughts in words and the upcoming messages on chat S16: If you could have the audio/video/transcript in a box nearby, and the timestamps linked directly to the part the class where it happened, that would help a lot Audio DHH: \" The Transcript the audio at the same Together in a similar format. With The chat. I have a feeling \" http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#12h03 12h03 Chat S12: I agree with Farial that it happens most of time S14: May be, professor can add the chat title for each meeting chat transcript, and a brief introduction about topic being covered and what understanding can be gained. After that, time title can be a good choice. This both things may help to refer chat transcript later Audio DHH: \" Okay, so I'm going to work on presenting for Thursday my Homework will be to format the audio transcript. In In a way similar to the To the chat transcript. I have a suspicion, though. The timestamp and the video is From the beginning of the recording not Not Not the time of day that Is being used in the chat.

It isn't necessary.

I want to see whether I can get the transcript more quickly if I have the app on my phone. I see that I have 40 minutes of transcription available with the free account, but it seems to be transcribing okay. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h40 11h40 Audio DHH: And it looks like I'll have to upgrade to a premium subscription to get more features that we can try next day. I want to talk about Zoom and these remote classes. This isn't the easiest thing in the world for me and I don't know how you feel about it. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h41 11h41 Audio DHH: I've turned on polling so let me see if I can add a question to the poll. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h45 11h45 Audio DHH: Okay, so I'm actually going to launch the poll now to see how it works. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h46 11h46 Audio DHH: Okay, so 90% is a pretty good response rate so I'm going to end the poll now. The 3 people who haven't voted, now's your chance! Last person. Great. So I end the poll. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h47 11h47 Audio DHH: So this seems like a good way of asking questions. Well, it's also good to ask questions of users, so that we don't pretend to know what they want, just because we're the interface designers, right? The question one eye is a Likert scale question. It's named after the person who first developed it. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h48 11h48 Audio DHH: And so the idea is that we have the statements be symmetrical about the middle. So there is 'Very well' and then 'Very not well'. 'Well', and 'Not well'. In the middle is 'Okay'. Here in this case I've given a 'fence to sit on' so to speak. Is anyone familiar with that idiom? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h49 11h49 Audio DHH: Okay, so I'm using the waiting room and so as soon as I see that you're in the waiting room I'm gonna admit you. So, never sure. Well, not. I'll, I'll let you in as soon as possible. Okay, so does that make sense so lacquered quest Likert scales. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h50 11h50 Chat DHH: Likert scaleOK? S04: yes Audio DHH: So the idea is. So that's symmetrical so that we have. So we have matching items so we have a strongly agree and we have a strongly disagree. So that that's one part. So, and the other thing is that they're perceptually equidistant. So it's symmetrical the meet the middle is, it's okay so the the fence to sit on so to speak is, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h51 11h51 Audio DHH: sort of, no strong opinion. So something that would be equal to, not equal to. So, if I said it's going. First one is going great. It's going well. It's okay. And then, I'm a little. It's not going as well as I hoped. Or it could be better. So, for example, those aren't. Those aren't equally distant equidistant around. So, if they are equidistant, we can http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h52 11h52 Audio DHH: assign these numbers and and go from and make some comparisons and and gather some data so this is a way to get some empirical data from users. So I've also turned on an exit survey now, so you can give me a thumbs up or a thumbs down about what goes well and what doesn't go so well. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h53 11h53 Audio DHH: I'm checking on my. So the transcript running app on my phone seems to be doing all http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h54 11h54 Audio DHH: So I want to do. And an icebreaker. So I'm gonna ask you the question. And then I'm gonna. Well, I don't want to put people on the spot, either. So my question for you today is what what http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h55 11h55 Audio DHH: what is a good or bad interface experience that you've had or the it's very memorable. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h56 11h56 Chat S18: In general, the mobile websites of things that have apps are terrible because they you to download the app S18: they want you* Audio DHH: So I've added it into the chat. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h57 11h57 Chat S06: Bad experience: Went to cineplex where I was buying tickets from self serve kiosk the touch response is very poor user can't use scroll functionality. DHH: What is a memorable (good or bad) interface experience? Audio DHH: So does anyone who feels like speaking today. Put your hand up. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h58 11h58 Chat S19: I went to Walmart in North Battleford, and during the self checkout experience, and all through the store, screens with cameras on them are shoved in the face. It feels like not welcome there. S04: the article site where the ad repeatedly appears after every few lines. S06: Bad experience: Went to cineplex where I was buying tickets from self serve kiosk the touch response is very poor user can't use scroll functionality. There is only tap S20: Bad interface. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#11h59 11h59 Chat S21: A good experience I've had recently so its on my mind is getting used to the ArcMap GIS software. An interesting thing it does is data files cant be dragged around projects directly, must be explicitly cut/copy pasted to help prevent users from making mistakes and accidentally breaking their file structure for the project which would do Bad Things. I thought that was a good design moment. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h00 12h00 Chat S02: Grocery website: always provided me the results of unrelated items unless the same keyword in not inserted. It had a VERY BAD SEARCHING ALGORITHM which failed most of the times S03: I tried enhanced version of Microsoft Teams meetings which was released in back July. It came with new features like large gallery view, together mode etc. It was pretty cool. S11: A good user interface.. recently I used a app name ‘world remit’ which has a pretty good interface with nice user experience …. DHH: Was it easy to discover the proper way to do things? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h01 12h01 Chat S08: A good experience for me was GitBook. I use it to take notes and the interface was vey easy to use/understand how to do things. S22: I like the new UOFR Webmail interface. New interface is user friendly and easier to locate folders etc. S15: The interface of checkout at HomeDepot is pretty Bad, it takes 5-6 seconds to show the scanned item on the page which is a pretty bad link between the database and the front end. Even the touch response is not great. S10: Bad experience with UR Courses. Sometimes when you log in, then it would show us the desktop image if any random course and then again we have to back to log in page and refresh the site. Audio DHH: Okay, so I see nobody's putting their hand up to talk. And I guess that's okay. I'm just wondering if there's a way to to get for you to feel like you're engaged in the discussion. Because it's hard for me looking at a screen with a little picture of me. And talking to I don't know who or where. I know there's an audience out there somewhere, but you might be doing other things too. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h02 12h02 Audio DHH: Okay, Student, go ahead and share. SAA: Good, thanks. Yeah, so I had two experiences. One was with Home Depot, where, when you scan an item and self checkout it usually takes like 5 or 6 seconds for it to pop up on the actual screen, which is like a bad connection to the front end from the database, and the other one was bizarre or newer courses Student already mentioned it in chat. When we log in. It usually produces just some image. And then you need to go back and again log in to get to the actual page you're searching for the dashboard. These two are linked pretty bad experiences I had. DHH: Anyone else like to share? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h03 12h03 Audio DHH: and marry. Sorry if. Yes, sir. Hello everyone, so I wanted to share like I was like shopping for Grassi online so that the website. the searching algorithm of that website was very bad like if I want to get like any item I would like need to insert proper spelling and all the keywords they are using for the searching operation. So like, I didn't find it reliable to use, like we don't know what keywords they have. So it was very difficult for me at that time and a good experience was with top hat. So I like the interface http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h04 12h04 Audio DHH: of that application and their website was liquid reliable, and it was easy to understand and learn like top head is can be used as an alternative of zoom also. So like I'm taking using their application in the semester for one of the course. Thank you. So how do you feel about paying for top hat. Yeah, I'm paying for it but I think like the money is worth for I feel that, yeah. So anyone else. And let's see if I can. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h05 12h05 Audio DHH: needs another window. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h06 12h06 Audio DHH: So, a pet peeve of mine is when this happens a few places they say. Click here for more information. And the link goes to a generic page, but doesn't take me to the thing that the question to answer the question I was wanting to answer. So somewhere on the page there might be some information that will help me answer my question, but they've not put me in the place where I can easily answer that easily find the answer to my question. And so now, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h07 12h07 Audio DHH: and takes me to another place to to add another poll. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h08 12h08 Chat S19: Another thing I hate, is it seems like finding pricing for modern websites is a chore.

If you can say something to me privately, then it's not going to get. I'm not going to transcribe that into the chat file that gets distributed. It gets put back onto the website. But, so the the addition was Skype. And I use Skype for years. Seemed like years anyway. And that was seems like years ago. because now it doesn't work on my Mac. And even the when I've upgraded to a previous version on my Mac it doesn't seem to work. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h24 12h24 Audio DHH: So I've given up on it.

If somehow I get connected then there is always problem with either video or audio. it is not easy to chat and talk at the same time Audio DHH: Alright, thank you for that. So, there are four responses. I think an issue there is that the checkmarks show up beside the names don't say the checkmarks so is it better. This one so I haven't used these polls before, but they seem to do a better job of getting interaction because they're anonymous, or they can be anonymous. For next day, I'll have polls prepared. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h27 12h27 Audio DHH: So you won't have to go through my typing. And the silence of like concentrate on typing correctly spelled words. And that may encourage everyone to participate, a little more freely. So would you like me to play videos during zoom or have or have them to do to free to put the links up for you to review. And then discuss them in our, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h28 12h28 Chat S11: But Skype does work on my Mac. But ya that’s true I face connection problem during audio and video chat… Audio DHH: our session so that's that's the way the the flipped classroom would work that we have the material to review outside of our meeting time and then our zoom meeting time would be four questions and working on stuff. Working on activities. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h29 12h29 Chat S19: I'd prefer to watch on my own.

That's it seems like problem of a 13 inch screen and having windows pop up everywhere. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h32 12h32 Audio DHH: can't believe how many windows I have to choose from here. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h33 12h33 Audio DHH: So, In part this semester is going to be. We're going to be talking about having experiences with HCI issues and theory and design. In terms of collaboration and communication asynchronous and synchronous and we have learning outcomes. So, there are more topics. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h34 12h34 Audio DHH: Let's see. So if we go to this page here. So I'm. I'm working on a better way to organize things on my web page. so I have a plan for today, which may move after administration. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h35 12h35 Audio DHH: so we'll talk about your courses and go through your courses and assignments. Next day, and the attendance is not going to be new our courses but. Which to me was not a great way to do it. But through, through zoom, I believe. So these are a little bit in flux still. So it's, it's an opportunity to see how we can http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h36 12h36 Audio DHH: make clear. The things you the issues you want to talk about, and then link them to our discussions and so making the online resources available. So the synchronous and asynchronous resources available that help you feel comfortable and engaged in this difficult situation with zoom and COVID-19. So anyway I want to hear because I have a link to the video. Inside here. So don't blink or you'll miss it but here's, Here's the way my oven timer behaves. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h37 12h37 Chat S04: -++ Audio DHH: So let me ask a quick poll question. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h38 12h38 Audio DHH: So the question I'm going to ask is, am I being reasonable with my outrage, my resistance to giving up this tiny piece of my humanity? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h41 12h41 Chat S19: It's efinitely not optimal :p http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h43 12h43 Audio DHH: Does this as a question makes sense? I hope so. My take on this is that the timer is telling me that my thinking of time in terms of minutes, when I could be using hours as well, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h44 12h44 Chat S24: yeah especially since ur input was right S06: yes Audio DHH: is not correct and it's an error in my behavior that I should correct. Whereas I disagree. If the timer just took 60 minutes as input and only converted that to 1 hour, that would be fine. It doesn't have to tell me that I'm making an error of style, essentially. The timer is programmed to knows that 60 minutes is equal to 1 hour and to do the conversion correctly. It is also programmed to criticize my behaviour. Perhaps to start an argument with me? That's my perspective on why I'm outraged. My first impulse when I posted that video was to call it, 'Attack of the Killer Robots, 1st wave'. I wrote in the notes about the video I said that killer robots (that can kill people) are a serious topic of their own. We can talk about that some more next day. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h45 12h45 Audio DHH: And I'll do an office hour in Zoom from 14h00-15h00. You can give me some feedback about the times for my office availability. I'll get Discord set up as well. So with that, I'll say goodbye for today. Have a good weekend and stay well. And we'll see each other on Tuesday. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/03_Thu-10-Sep-2020.html#12h46 12h46 Chat S15: Thank you professor S04: thank you. enjoy the weekend.

So let's engage in a discussion because I can, so I can identify ways to improve the presentation of information in the transcript and otherwise so that we http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#11h42 11h42 Audio DHH: get the most the most benefit from it. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#11h43 11h43 Audio DHH: I'm going to ah to close the poll to make another one http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#11h44 11h44 Audio DHH: I'm going to type a question into the chat Do you think http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#11h46 11h46 Audio DHH: Can you?

Atleast better than trying to scrub through video as long as the transcript is accurate S03: chat transcript can serve as the true happenings of the meeting. we can re live the meeting. apparently it looks good, but I always think may be we can make the interface more compact. not the lengthy one.

S25: It opens the whole transcript at once so we're able to search it all at once http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h26 12h26 Chat S25: It functionally does \"expand all\" and \"collapse all\" I'd just forgotten how it worked exactly S25: If the individual timestamps are collapsible, would we be given an option to collapse and expand all as well? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h27 12h27 Chat S16: yes http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h28 12h28 Chat S16: we talked about that and it went into how best to search about things http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h30 12h30 Audio DHH: Okay, how did everyone enjoy that? Me it's gonna work. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h32 12h32 Audio DHH: So if you can vote in the next minute http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h33 12h33 Audio DHH: Okay, five more people to vote so close in 30 seconds http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h34 12h34 Audio DHH: Okay, so anyone have any particular comments if you had, if you strongly disagreed if you didn't think they were useful or if you strongly agreed or anything in between any observations about the So remember, our discussion will wallpaper the other day wallpaper patterns. And so when I was taking that class about wallpaper patterns than I was looking at analyze every piece of wallpaper I saw. So I'm asking us to be aware of the interfaces that exist around you. And think about http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h35 12h35 Audio DHH: you know, are they usable? Do you have a good user experience from them? So there's just a note somewhere on my webpage, there's a story about these two fish. Or these two young fish we're talking one day and Neil and then older Fish Lamb Bye. Hey, boys. How's the water? And then after a minute, the two younger fish look at each other and say, What the hell is water. So this is sort of, to me, that means that I recover, becoming aware of the environment in which we're immersed in. So there are interfaces, there are interactions that happen all around us. And I'm asking http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h36 12h36 Audio DHH: you to become more sensitive to them. And think about them and the client, make notes about what is good about them and what is bad about them. So that means breakout rooms, zoom classroom, the transcripts that I had. Okay, so enough NASA that any comments about or any reports back from the break rooms about the question about transcript display so long question, but http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h38 12h38 Audio DHH: Okay, does anyone have like to speak for their company about the discount tell us about the discussions you've had in your breakout room about the transcript display. So you can so I'm looking at the chat transcript, and I thought that group chats weren't being put into the main chat. Because what I saw when I looked back at the main chat was the last thing that I wrote that there is no indication that there's messages below what I had last written. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h39 12h39 Audio DHH: So I was trying to use the chat window as thinking that the latest chat was displayed. The latest chat messages are displayed. I click it to mean that breaker room chats didn't go to the main chat, but it looks like that wasn't the case. So okay. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h40 12h40 Chat S03: yes I have seen that chat was limited to the group in breakout room S02: I only had the option to message people individually in the breakout room Audio DHH: Okay, so we, oh let you respond yourself to that. So when I thought about What I've experimented with in the past is encouraging students to do annotations at the meeting. This is sort of a summary of having a summary of what was done in class and maybe adding a bit more detail to things. So in keeping with that, I wonder what seemed to me to be useful is well, so having the transcript of the meeting would be useful as a way to focus on certain aspects or certain questions. And then I thought http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h41 12h41 Chat DHH: Reports from breakout rooms? S03: we have decided that we'll stick to our opinions in the chat we have put before. And a little bit of our own introduction. S10: 12:08:11 From ayinde B : anyone in the breakout room ? Audio DHH: perhaps if I'm make an For the different timestamps that you could refer to them in your discussions or annotations about http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h42 12h42 Audio DHH: If you wanted to make reference to the ideas in the in the meeting, discussion then they could use an anchor http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h43 12h43 Audio DHH: so any other thoughts about http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h44 12h44 Audio DHH: So there's a common from a student have to conclude the breakout discussion we had a similar thought of a chat and voice transcripts. We have a shared opinion of breakout rooms and how it could be beneficial for each group and then for the little So quarter one already. Let's see that we'll take that up at the beginning of our meeting next time. So think about how you would use the breakout rooms what was good about This is how you would use the breakout rooms. And well, I guess so. We'll see you on Thursday. And we'll talk more about assignments and things then. Okay, thank you for today. See you on Thursday. And I have an office hour today from two to three. I also put a link on your http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/04_Tue-15-Sep-2020.html#12h45 12h45 Audio DHH: Okay. So thanks again. Have a good day.

But that's perfectly fine if you just want to chat http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h33 11h33 Chat S08: Good morning Audio DHH: Let me share my screen a seeing the course information now. The course web page looks http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h34 11h34 Chat S05: no S09: no, just \"site can't be reached\" Audio DHH: Okay so I think that has it now http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h35 11h35 Chat S01: Can see it now S10: Works now. S06: yes S09: yep S11: Yes Audio DHH: So I'm gonna create a poll here is the waiting room a good idea http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h36 11h36 Chat S12: does the course show up on anyone’s ur courses ? S01: Yes it shows up for me Audio DHH: Make sure that we have everybody in the room before I publish it http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h37 11h37 Chat S02: yes it does Audio DHH: Only 78% voted so don't you go ahead and vote please if you can. The reason I'm thinking about waiting rooms and sending links out just before class is to to maximize security because some of you remember being zoom bombed with me in winter so I'm I'm leery of that happening again. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h38 11h38 Chat S13: It shows up for me, though under past courses on the left despite urcourses saying it's fall 2020 like the rest S02: the dates are not updated so I guess that is why S12: ok thanks everyone Audio DHH: I'm not sure that the waiting room is a is a good support for that or not? So because I have to keep I have to admit people when I noticed them and then I'm kind of relying on the fact that people have people have a link to request to join the meeting. So http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h39 11h39 Chat S13: The zoom bomb was probably because we used a link that was posted publicly on the university webpage, your common changing of the links is more than strong enough protection professor. Waiting room isn't a big trouble though. Audio DHH: 60% Yes, 40% No. So this brings to mind one other question that I'm going to ask in a poll as well. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h41 11h41 Audio DHH: Okay, so another option for me to do security is to let you register ahead of or send you an email to register for the http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h43 11h43 Chat S14: Hello professor, Audio DHH: Okay, So has anyone you can answer in your in the chat if you like or put your hand. Has anyone done that experience with the registration process? Go ahead, Matthew. DHH: I haven't had experience with the registration process. That's her haven't answered the poll XML. I'm not sure what you mean by register ahead of time, but he does tell me a bit about what that would actually look like. DHH: Well, as far as I understand, it would send you there's an extra step ahead of time to http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h44 11h44 Chat S14: Can you please record a lecture? and upload it on UR courses. Audio DHH: Where you would? I'm not sure what it looks like I was just reading about it. I didn't try it. So, perhaps we can try it for our next meeting and then we can discuss. So I should have added an option for this question. Let me see if I can. So I think it's like saying that you're going to, you're going to RSVP to the meeting. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h45 11h45 Chat S10: Isn't this already being recorded? I had to consent to recording before I continued in. Audio DHH: So what I believe registration is essentially doing okay, so C d c, the zoo options right now http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h46 11h46 Chat S02: yes it is being recorded. you can clearly see the red button at the left corner in top for recording Audio DHH: Go ahead, sorry. Oh, DHH: thank you professor. Like the question says, we can join the meeting directly in that does this mean with registration there will be no waiting room. That's the only DHH: I'm just I'm just weighing different options. I don't want to http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h47 11h47 Chat S09: Huh, 53/50? That is an interesting ratio.... S15: I really only voted yes as in it is better than the waiting room Audio DHH: Make it too onerous. For for everyone to be engaged in class. We're also sort of thinking about the interfaces here. Because we're talking about human computer communications. So we want to think about the interface in general, so I'm not sure that I'm answering the question directly, but so I'm good. I'm gonna set up our next meeting with registration and then we'll talk about your experience with it then. Okay, so registration and no way didn't vote for next. next meeting. Thank you. You're welcome. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h48 11h48 Audio DHH: So yes, 53% to 50%. Is this a strange result? That was noted in the chat? So I'm going to show you Okay, so my question is, do you see the zoom window or the all right As my webpage in the as a shared screen. Okay, that's enough. Thank you. So that's not as difficult as they thought. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h49 11h49 Chat S02: we can see the zoom window S01: Zoom window S16: Zoom window S10: Zoom window. S05: zoom window Audio DHH: Okay, so I talked to you about recording. So I think I have a reasonable process now. So I'm going to show you first the screen from meeting to with the transcript so the transcript opens to the The card it collapses, but it's open to begin with that so that the anchors will work. So you can sort of go down to the bottom. So I've added chat and audio to make them clear. So he has comments about the formatting. And when there's when there's only one of the two. Then I leave it blank like that 1201 here. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h50 11h50 Audio DHH: Okay, so let's say http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h51 11h51 Chat S02: transcript looks interesting now Audio DHH: We want to link this tool tip that says copy timestamps like so I haven't tried this yet. And then in a new window see see what the fragment at the end after the pound sign? Hashtag etc http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h52 11h52 Chat S17: It looks like a lot of work, but also vey useful for review or missed classes. Audio DHH: We can get to a point. So a lot of work well. Now the work is done. I think I want to show you talking about how to get this audio transcript. So, on the one hand zoom does an audio transcription and I have, they're using this program or service from odd otter.ai They have noticed that the transcript from zoom is less accurate than the one from otter AI directly. So, my process now is to record the meeting and zoom and then get a transcript from and then pass the audio file to otter.ai. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h53 11h53 Audio DHH: Here, here it is. Here's the result from Tuesday's meeting. So you notice that http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h54 11h54 Chat S10: It actually looks kind of helpful, this transcript thing. Audio DHH: So this is time differently it's just time from the start recording. So I'm not sure whether I'm okay to share this with you directly or not. So if I, if I get approval to share this link to you, I can just post that on your courses, and then I'll edit it. So I'm working on my thought is that http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h55 11h55 Audio DHH: My thought with this is that I'm talking in class. And I pause like William Shatner does perhaps. Or if I have a few, and doors are anyway I don't state the ideas quite clearly as I would like in the transcript, but I know that it's there at, let's say 1159 or now it's 1156 for today's meeting. So then I would prefer to clean That text event, so maybe it's not a transcript. But it's a record of the meeting. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h56 11h56 Audio DHH: Neither I don't think so what I noticed about the zoom transcript is it's better at http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h57 11h57 Audio DHH: Zoom is better at identifying speakers Where is everything I think we had some of the speakers here. So when I noticed them all just put a generic idea there like I did for the chat window. So, this one is from the start of the video http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h58 11h58 Audio DHH: Are started the recording, it's not quite so clear when it happens in in real time. And the chat is recorded and like the time of day. So what I've done is I in the script that I'm using to convert the format is to put the starting time of the audio transcript or the audio recording so that the times are adjusted. So they get one on one time with no seconds as a timestamp, so it matches up pretty well. It could be it. It could be asked by a little bit http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#11h59 11h59 Chat S02: so the how is the student audio transcript being handled ? Audio DHH: All right, so any reports scan we have so we had a breakout rooms the other day talking about what? Okay, so before we get into the breakout rooms from the last day, the question is so how is the student audio transcript being handled so What I http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h00 12h00 Audio DHH: what I intend to do is that's in the in the public web page that I'm going to take out names of students and put in student or FSS or some some generic identifier just to understand that there's a different speaker. But all good. I'll see if I can go through and see if the zoom transcription is correctly identified the different speakers and I'll make note of them as I'm making note of them for the chat room, so I'll keep a private So who's been speaking and interacting? But then I will http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h01 12h01 Chat S02: yes. thank you Audio DHH: D identify students in public presentation of the information that makes sense. And the reason I can do it exactly like with the chat room stuff where it's all written out and the names or the names come up so it's easy for me to Take those out and make make a substitution for a name. Substitute a name for an identifier, a generic a, de identify an anonymous identifier because the speaker identification in the audio transcript isn't isn't so great. And the two transcripts so the one I get from the one that I'm showing you now and the one I get from zoom http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h02 12h02 Audio DHH: they don't always match up. In terms of where the brakes are, so it makes it even more difficult. So, I'm just trying, I'm gonna just try and do my best with identifying student student voices in the transcript and the audio transcript. Okay, any other http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h03 12h03 Audio DHH: Any any discussions that happen in break rooms that you'd like to talk about? Okay, so seeing The version on Tuesday and the version today for the the transcript interface. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h04 12h04 Audio DHH: do two more things seem possible? Okay, so I had a private question of where I will upload the lectures, lecture recordings. So the idea is, well, you're gonna be on Dropbox, and some of them are already. I started doing that but I'm it's taken me a little more. Well, I was focusing on the transcript stuff a little bit more than that. I haven't put everything up yet. But they'll be on Dropbox for this semester, and they'll be available through the meeting pages. So if we go to http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h05 12h05 Audio DHH: the end and I think the end Yeah. So here's the image. There's that sketch that I drew the other day. So there are more images http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h06 12h06 Audio DHH: They would show all the images for a particular meeting would be here and then I think I have a recording a second my piece of audio. Anyways, there'll be a link when there's curve for images And audio come up so well, I will put the audio files into that Dropbox directory. And then I have a little script that creates a sharing link and then rewrites the name so you don't have to see the dropbox interface. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h07 12h07 Audio DHH: Now so the so the recording everything associated with a meeting will appear on the meeting page. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h08 12h08 Audio DHH: anyone with some thoughts about making use of chat as a way to http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h09 12h09 Chat S02: does the private chat is also included in transcript ? Audio DHH: I'm answering a chat question so this is a private chat also including the transcript. So know anything about that http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h10 12h10 Audio DHH: Anything if the word privately so you can see this. This is sent to me privately but if they're sent to a particular person then it'll say from so on from student to me and then the fog I read in parentheses privately. So when I'm processing this to put on my webpage, ay, ay ay ay. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h11 12h11 Chat S02: right S02: yes Audio DHH: Any ideas about using the transcript http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h12 12h12 Audio DHH: Okay, well I don't want to belabor the point. So I'll have some some. I'll have some input things implemented for Tuesday as examples of how I think they might be. It might be useful. Or that's my hope. I'll get something marked up to show you. So we're meeting five and so I want to think about assignments. So There'll be some individual assignments. And then there'll be some projects that are done in groups. So the groups can be, as I say, we'll say ideally four people in a group. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h13 12h13 Audio DHH: So you can make up your own groups. If you like. If you want to have some conversations with people about that. You can do that. And then maybe on Tuesday, we'll check back in on that and see how people are doing And then we'll have some time we'll get the crews formalized and http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h14 12h14 Audio DHH: and have some time to start working on the project. So the first assignment for the project that might be due in two weeks is to find a website that you're your group agrees with your group to find one that you agree to agree on that you'd like to examine. And then think about ways are opportunity He's to improve the website. So if they do something badly, or if you have some poor experience with it and there's some opportunities for redesign http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h15 12h15 http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h16 12h16 Audio DHH: So how many people have in mind? Okay with yeses, and noes. Go ahead and ask him. How big should the groups be? Well, I'm thinking ideally for people ideal. Okay, thank you, but it isn't need may need to be five or three would work as well in a pinch, I think. Okay. Thank you, sir. Oh, you're very welcome. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h17 12h17 Audio DHH: And maybe that's easier than putting your hand up to unmute yourself. And then I can see when you're when you're talking or when your mic is active, even though maybe you're not talking yet. I can see that and then I can call on you. Just a thought. Okay, so I've been thinking about what would make a good group and so in the text it talks about cognitive diversity. Anyone so at the university here we talk we talk a lot about equity, diversity and inclusion, inclusion. So, cognitive diversity should fit right into that. Do you think? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h18 12h18 Audio DHH: So? Now, I'm not sure how much cognitive diversity we get amongst computer science students. What do you think are some sources of cognitive diversity? So what does that mean to you and what do you think are some sources of it You want to type in the chat or talk? That would be fine with me. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h19 12h19 Chat S18: accessibility concerns Audio DHH: Let's consult Google http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h20 12h20 Chat S10: I suppose, groups with a lot of interdisciplinary connections. So from different degrees, for example. I'm in a sci-fi English class right now and there's a lot of people from different degrees. A surprising amount of CS majors as well. S17: The catalyst for our computer science careers can be totally different. These differing catalysts mean that our specializations and generalizations can vary wildly. Audio DHH: Yeah, okay, so I say everyone who's answered is, is, is on the right track, I think. So to me, it just means having different ways of looking at things or thinking about things. And that might come from. We saw, as one said, I said, pardon me out, well, in a new light, I'll be, I'll be studying computer science. So we come to it from different perspectives. And I remember my first year of undergraduate, I thought, Hmm, maybe I could Say political science. So then I put in I took CS one or two years it was called back then and I really enjoyed it. We http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h21 12h21 Audio DHH: did basic it's a computer language not an insult. I think it's supposed to be it's an insult, right? In the modern parlance, but basically is an acronym. Which means it's an abbreviation that spells at work. So as beginners all purpose symbolic instruction code. Anyway, yes, so everyone may have a different perspective. So it used to be that People have talked about the Myers Briggs type indicators because that's that's gone out of favor because there's a history behind it is http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h22 12h22 Audio DHH: it seems to be not such a rigorous tool, although it seems refused to provide reasonable results. Anyone heard of the Myers Briggs stuff? Yes or no? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h23 12h23 Chat S10: There's also enneagrams, for example. But part of the problem with MBTI is it can be a self-fulfilling thing, where people read it and try to fit themselves into that mold. S16: no S19: no Audio DHH: So I'll put a link to it. I'll add a link to that material. Anyway, so that so there are different kinds of tests we can take that might show different styles of thinking or different styles of learning. We're not going to do that officially, I suppose, serve our backgrounds where we've grown up and shape our perspective on things. So I was born and raised in Regina http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h24 12h24 Chat S09: @rafael, that's every single thing though. astrology to mbti to ennegrams. S09: you tell people they fit a box, and some people will try to stay in that box. Audio DHH: So sorry I got a sign up the chat there. Anyway. So, me being born and raised in China, I spent some years in the states up to a year and a half in the States. And then I was at FSU for a while in the lower mainland of British Columbia. For a while, then I came back so I was away from China for 10 years. So that's given me my own perspective on things. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h25 12h25 Audio DHH: So we can think about different ways that you might approach problems or it's very rare that we can ask one question see, they're really seen the mighty pythons the Holy Grail. Now so easily there's, there's two kinds of people you can say. People have seen the movie and those who haven't. Or maybe there's more people have seen it and didn't like it and people saw it and liked it And anyway, getting off on a little bit of a tangent here. So I was looking for icebreakers on zoom and I come across social distancing, bingo. I haven't read too much about it yet. But um, get that sorted out for Tuesday so we can http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h26 12h26 Chat S10: Well, that's a way to look at it. Likening Myers-Briggs to astrology makes it sound even more wishy-washy. Audio DHH: talk about that and get Sunday is broken and http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h27 12h27 Chat S02: physical distancing nd social solidarity Audio DHH: And then have some ideas about groups. I'll put up a couple of videos to for you to look at for next time and then we can talk about http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h28 12h28 Chat S10: That sounds like a solid plan. Audio DHH: So carry on. He said physical distancing and social solidarity DHH: like, social distancing, it's like we are not socially distant. We are close together in terms of our ideas, our notions, our emotions, but we have to keep up physical distance. We shouldn't make it like between our communications are like that. DHH: Yeah, okay. I understand. So some days I have some issues being here. Well, my kids are both away from home now. So my wife and I are empty nesters. And perhaps I'm driving my wife crazy a little bit by being at home. But it's also http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h29 12h29 Audio DHH: Yeah, that we don't keep the we don't let the physical distance distances socially. So thank you for that opposite that that an important explanation. clarification. Okay, so talk about that attack of the annoying or the impolite robot video Do you think that's going to go on to become a viral sensation and everybody had a chance to see it. I think we watched it in our meeting. But let me http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h30 12h30 Chat S09: Not necessarily. Ennegrams are okay because they promote change. But unless you actually mention that as an aspect of the thing, it just turns into a what stereotype are you most like? MBTI is a bit more rigid, and based on testing. But you can pull in colour theory too, which is also got some science (ish) backing. we try to organize people into like categories, some are more based in fact than others. Audio DHH: let me go back and since it's only 15 seconds, I can play it here. can see here I'm pausing before I admit defeat. So I like to use as colorful language. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h31 12h31 Chat S17: You need pointlessly upbeat music and over-simplified text if you want it to go viral :P Audio DHH: About Attack of the killer robots and so on. I know it's not as serious as that but the same time. At the same time it's it's time has been programmed. So as you made a comment about any pointless cfpwv music and for simplified text if you want to go viral. So I was watching Kroger last night and if any of you who watch COVID But he did a dance video to Trump's recording of him downplaying the virus. Oh, yes. clickbait titles. Yeah. Yeah Attack of the inflate robots doesn't quite http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h32 12h32 Chat S10: Important to use CLICKBAIT titles like I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT THIS ROBOT DID TO ME!??? Audio DHH: quite grab it. This isn't quite magnet for clicks maybe. So I like your suggestion for the title rafail anyway last night so they did a video dance video about Trump's audio recording with Woodward saying that, oh, I would like to downplay the virus and then you Talking with and when President Trump was on a town hall the other night, he had a question about downplaying the virus. And he said, Oh, no, actually, I have played it. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h33 12h33 Chat S10: Don't forget the thumbnail of your angry face and a lens flare on the robot's display. Audio DHH: So they did a video. I'm not sure if that's on. So we try and see if it's available on YouTube. Let's try that and see if it's gotten any. Maybe we can help it to go viral as an experiment. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h34 12h34 Chat S02: game of words. the real popular series in actual world. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h35 12h35 Audio DHH: So it seems like it's Well, anyway, it might be there may not be there. But that the comment about a dance video seemed to have a bit of auto tune and so on. That made me think is a video that it showed last http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h36 12h36 Chat S17: I haven't watched last night's ep yet Audio DHH: Okay, so getting back to the non viral video that I put up http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h37 12h37 Audio DHH: All right, so what about this interface? So do you think there's room for improvement? here to design here to redesign this interface? All right, is there a reason to redesign this interface http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h38 12h38 http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h39 12h39 Audio DHH: put up a poll, should we redesign the timer and see if we can get more than 50% more than 100% turnout http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h40 12h40 Audio DHH: So it's interesting 5050 I wouldn't have thought it would be so evenly split. last five people are interested in voting will close it at two minutes. So, in 20 seconds, I'll close for Paul. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h41 12h41 Audio DHH: Okay, so we had 60 4018 to 30 plus voters. So let's so Can somebody who voted yes. Talk about why. Why yes. Sure wanna good. Okay stereo. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h42 12h42 Chat S09: what would be interesting to see is how peoples learning and interacting styles view the timer? Audio DHH: The first thing that comes to my mind is 60 minutes. 60 minutes is quite legitimate, so it should take that as an input. And the second thing is like I knew everybody, almost no 60 minutes in one hour, but San Dimas, somebody is following a recipe that says like he should make for a cook for 60 minutes altogether. So I think they must have the layers to exactly go with that and not to get confused why it's not taking another DHH: Yeah. Yeah, my thought is if it had, it's the blinking the air. So it seems to understand how to convert 60 minutes to one hour but then it tells me an error. So it's like a once to start in our argument with me. Exactly, is a passive aggressive response. Well, you entered it wrong but I'll correct it for you. So I've been known to have arguments with Siri for my for my kids enjoyment. So they get it they also think get a kick out of me. taking issue with the stove timer Okay, thanks. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h43 12h43 Audio DHH: Now from the no side. Quiet Why would you say it? What's the reason to not redesign the timer http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h44 12h44 Audio DHH: You can type in the chat or if you like. So 12 people voted no. So here's my theory and you can disagree or agree with us is that people. So when people are looking at software interfaces are different kinds of computer interfaces They don't have a clear view of Pardon me. They don't think that they don't have an expectation that the interface should augment their abilities rather, it's up to them to interact with stove and the way that it likes to be interacted with. So if it's not convenient, then people can take that on that extra http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h45 12h45 Audio DHH: responsibility to make sure to say save for 90 minutes. Don't type in 90 minutes but type in one hour and 30 minutes. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h46 12h46 Chat S02: yes. humans have adaptability :) Audio DHH: Anyone agree with that? explanation? Anyway, it's tired. Time's up today so I'll get offend you some video things to look at and we'll guide our discussion next day. And if you have, I'll have an office hour from two to three today. And that's it then. So we'll try and get more work focused or more activities going forward in our meetings, so it's not Anyway, I'm just gonna on time. So you can make the most of the time you get together to work on things and discuss things. get work done. Okay. Anyway, thank you very much for today. Have a good weekend. And stay well. And we'll talk to you on Tuesday, or perhaps 2pm today and I'll catch up on my email as well. Okay, thanks again. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/05_Thu-17-Sep-2020.html#12h47 12h47 Chat S17: cya next week! S08: Thank you!

S04: Good morning Audio Unknown: See also don't Daryl Hepting: know. Good morning, everybody. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h32 11h32 Chat S05: good morning S06: Good morning S07: Good morning S08: Good morning all S09: morning guys S01: It was easy DHH: How was the registration process? S05: painless Audio Daryl Hepting: I'm asking this in the chat as well as your registration process. So I noticed I included that link. So anyone have any issues in getting registered with the desktop app? Because http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h33 11h33 Chat S11: good morning S04: It was pretty straight forward S08: It was good. S12: It was okay! not a hassle for the user. I had no issues getting registered S03: easy straight forward S02: quick but time consuming for me :) S02: I have S13: That was fine and easy! S02: desktop app Audio Daryl Hepting: everyone has the desktop app installed. I think that's the that was the only requirement that okay. So when I created it this morning, I went to my zoom app, my desktop application to create it. And when I created the meeting, I realized that I didn't have the option to register or require registration. So then I finished creating that meeting. I thought, well, maybe I could edit it, to add it later on. But that wasn't the case. And so I went to that help file. And it said, go to the web client. Which seems somewhat ironic, because you can't register with a web client. But anyway, so it was a http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h34 11h34 Chat S08: how about muting everyone on joining the meeting? S14: Wasn't too bad. I'm not clear how it prevents zoombombing stuff since it basically just generates a link for you anyway, lol Audio Daryl Hepting: web client, I got a different interface. And I was able to create the meeting. So then I had two meetings. And I thought, well, it'll be clear which one is requiring registration and which one isn't? But that was not the case. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h35 11h35 Audio Daryl Hepting: So it's, maybe that's a feature maybe maybe people don't think that. To me, it seems like that would be a an important thing and that registrate and the invitation to say registration is required. But http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h36 11h36 Audio Daryl Hepting: So to answer some, a couple questions that came up in at the bottom of the chat here that I can see how about muting everyone on joining the meeting? Yes, I thought I had done that. Let me see. I can do that from here. So there we go. Now you're all muted.

I think that that is that in itself, it wouldn't prevent it. It gives me a record of who I can get a record of who was registered for the meeting. So if there's some issues later on, I can revisit that list. And I think between having registration and a waiting room it seems like maybe registration is an easier way to go. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h38 11h38 Audio Daryl Hepting: Any thoughts about that? nimish Kumar Go ahead.

If they're too far in advance, then the links might get shared.

Audio Daryl Hepting: Can you Well, okay. Unknown: So that's why I need a few more minutes Daryl Hepting: than say something again. Unknown: Even if it's like three minutes before or five minutes before, it's not about the time the registration date is about the time. I can register I can have sufficient time to register. Daryl Hepting: That's strange that I'm not able to get the audio http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h45 11h45 Audio Daryl Hepting: okay. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h46 11h46 Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, can I? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h47 11h47 Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, sorry. I'll try again, please. Hello, professor. Yeah, no, I can hear you. Unknown: Sir, do you want me to repeat what I've said? I can do that that's quicker than typing. Daryl Hepting: Sure, if you don't mind. Unknown: Okay. I just wanted to let everybody know like, Yes, that was a quick step like may even have taken minute taken a minute or less than that. But for me like, my kid just woke up, I have to be like running around with him to change his diaper and this for the same time. I was wondering, oh, I must have missed the registration. So for me, that was a very small and tight window. Daryl Hepting: Okay. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h48 11h48 Audio Unknown: Yeah, just to let everybody know. Yes, that was quick, but not for everyone. Daryl Hepting: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I appreciate that. Thank you. You're welcome. Krishna, you have like, say something. Professor. So, regarding the registration link, I actually when I registered, I even before I got the email, as similarly mentioned in the chat, I directly got the link displayed on my webpage itself. I got an email A minute later, but even before that, I got the link directly on the webpage. So I could even directly join from there. Okay, so I think I think because the timing years are close to the meeting time that it just gave you a link to join him. That might happen five minutes before the meeting. Okay. I'm gonna guess that so I mean, there, there are lots of things cuz I'm guessing out here. Okay, maybe that was the reason Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for your comment. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#11h49 11h49 Chat S02: yes i agree with Krishna, that is what i could see there too Audio Daryl Hepting: So we talked about getting into groups for an assignment for for the project.

Sometimes alternates from month to month. Audio Daryl Hepting: So if you can think about both Amazon and Netflix. So are there differences? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h07 12h07 Chat S18: Netflix and amazon DHH: If you can you think about netflix and amazon, are there differences between usability and user experience? S22: More preferable Netflix, and even Amazon works for me S03: Netflix has good ux compared to Amazon Audio Daryl Hepting: experience? Okay, any other thoughts about user experience? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h08 12h08 Chat S20: amazon has the neat bts facts on their app. plus they show a lot of bts stuff S15: One thing about prime video is that they mix in titles on the main page that you need to rent to stream which I don't like. S22: I feel Netflix is better for user experience S27: I believe Amazon only recently added the ability to have multiple users under one account. Something Netflix has had for ages. S20: Behind the scene S19: depends on what platform youre using it on. used to have Netflix through SaskTel, and the program was janky S03: behind the scene S01: Netflix browsing UI is better but Amazon has a cool menu when you are watching and can see who the actors are in that particular scene Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so I'm not sure VPS http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h09 12h09 Chat S20: as u play an episode on prime they will have trivia to the side if u open the ui S28: Amazon Prime Video features a familiar interface with side-scrolling categories for content. Netflix has made the UI very much user friendly and flawless. S18: For me Netflix gives me better experience Than amazon…. S03: sometime I feel that amazon provide so much information than it is needed Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so for me, I'll tell you about my experience. So I have access communications. And I have a Netflix app. Next looks button on the remote control, which works fine. Then I can also do prime with going through the apps. Once I press the TiVo button, go to apps and then select prime and that works. So I can get to them both. Without having to go through too much. Too much hassle. My feeling is see, so the controls seem to work less well for Amazon compared to Netflix and I want to rewind it that I seem to not be able to have very fine control over that. And an Amazon the way things are phrased http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h10 12h10 Chat S18: I can see a quick trailor early just hovering on the movie or series… Audio Daryl Hepting: see Amazon customers have also watched The show or something or the show is available with prime but to me it seems like everything's either you have prime or you don't so there's a feeling that I get from using Amazon is not like I'm I'm welcomed as more than a customer paying for Amazon Prime http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h11 12h11 Audio Daryl Hepting: so I feel more comfortable as if you were on Netflix http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h12 12h12 Chat S27: Amazon has lots of extra \"channels\" that you can subscribe to. Which kind of makes it look like you get more with Prime than you actually do. Audio Daryl Hepting: so that's definitely a user experience kind of thing because it's about how I feel about using the application so it's not necessarily about weather I can do the things I'd like to do but it's about how I feel about them so I noticed there's lots of ads for Milan lately before before the coverage for the negative curvature the movie said that it's available on Disney plus and then it seemed indicate Disney plus was not close enough because you had to be a premium member to see it http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h13 12h13 Chat S19: yeah, you have to pay extra to rent(?) it? S20: you had to pay 30usd on top of the membership to watch it Audio Daryl Hepting: So this seems to be to me this is a bit like looking at Amazon the store and seeing the items but then realizing they're not being sold by Amazon directly there there's third party sellers who are listed http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h14 12h14 Chat S05: the Crave + HBO thing is similarly frustrating/seemingly misleading S14: Going to bow out on this, I straight up do not use streaming subscription services. Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, tell me more about your experience with crave frustration with crave plus HBO channel China either in chat or with the microphone. Unknown: Well, just that they seem to keep adding tears that you keep having to pay more money for and at one point crave was kind of everything and now you're increasingly you're not really a creative customer, you're a low level customer until you get money Daryl Hepting: kind of like Unknown: you're you're mentioning with Disney plus, and you have to give them more money to be a premium member to get Milan or that was never really part of the original deal. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h15 12h15 Audio Daryl Hepting: Yeah, so they kept I think they kept the name creative, but then they got rid of the movie central or something. And then that became It was your get reorganized a bit to get a list of movies I think I hadn't thought about them is different, but Yes, that's true. I can see I can see and find that. I just crave. crave doesn't get you all the HBO stuff like Game of Thrones or turn off showing my own interests there. Okay. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h16 12h16 Chat S19: the university has a database of films open to students. from movies that have officially been released to 1930s S26: nope S20: I haven't watched a tv in two years Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so we've been talking about streaming services. What about TV and possibly with DVR, so anyone have cable? TV? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h17 12h17 Chat S14: Oh man, CRTs. The PERFECT thing to play your retro games on. S19: my apartment has a choice between better internet or cable. guess which one I chose... S15: I also haven't had a TV in 10 or so years S05: We have tvs but they're all hooked up to consoles Audio Daryl Hepting: So that's another interesting question to ask. I think, who has a TV I used to have a CRT TV. That was huge. When I bought it in the early 90s asked if I could get a TV without the tuner. So those just be like a monitor. And that was gonna be a lot more money. So the idea of building the tuner into the TV was that's what the market http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h18 12h18 Chat S17: I have a TV, but I only use it for streaming and video games S03: I have TV hooked up to console S02: i have a tv and cable too but never used. we have a device for the our native regional shows and news access too. and actually we don't use that as well. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h19 12h19 Audio Daryl Hepting: so I'm going to put these questions together in a quiz on your courses, and then I'll send you a link to it. So we can do that and then maybe next time me http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h20 12h20 Audio Daryl Hepting: let me share my screen. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h21 12h21 Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so this is the list of 10 heuristics for user interface design. So if you notice the date here, they are first published in 1994. And yet, they're still relevant. So you can see that they're not. There's some basic principles that they're getting at griffeys heuristics that stand the test of time. So I should be http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h22 12h22 Audio Daryl Hepting: so late. So we can see that they're listening to topics and heuristic evaluation of human computer interaction and web usability. So I'm going to, in the project, I'm going to ask you in groups, to look for a website. It can be an application as well, but it's something that you agree upon as needing some redesign. And then we're going to go through the steps of getting http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h23 12h23 Audio Daryl Hepting: going through identifying the opportunity for design, proposing a new solution, and prototyping it in in a low fidelity way, and slightly higher fidelity way. So you can see the benefit of applying and and these statistics are a good place to start. So maybe he can, you can let me know whether you can identify with ease. So visibility of system status. That's something that you can think about is http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h24 12h24 Audio Daryl Hepting: being a feature of a good design or frustration when it's lacking in a poor design. So maybe that's just a yes or no. So any anyone can identify with lack of visibility system status as being an issue. You're the usability of an application or webpage that you're dealing with. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h25 12h25 Audio Daryl Hepting: Make sense? three minute video on the disability here a sec. And see how it goes and watch the 15 second video. Let's try a three minute video. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h26 12h26 Chat S02: yes S18: yaap S05: yes S24: yes S13: yes S14: yep!

But maybe people couldn't hear it very well. Or just softly. So I'm not sure what the issue with volume is. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h29 12h29 Chat S02: i have read the captions. S02: yes Audio Daryl Hepting: Anyway, does that make sense about system status? So if you remember that diagram, let's see Christina and the computer, we had the arrows going between the user and the computer and the computer and the user. So, which of those two directions does two arrows or the information flow between the human using the computer and the computer as it is affected by the visibility system status http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h30 12h30 Chat S02: execution. computer to human i guess Audio Daryl Hepting: from what to http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h31 12h31 Chat DHH: from _______ to _______ is affected by visibility heuristic S14: human to computer also works S14: it's a two-way thing S20: computer to user S18: I think computer to user Audio Daryl Hepting: Any other responses? Okay, so execution is human to computer http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h32 12h32 Chat DHH: execution: human --&gt; computer DHH: evaluation: computer —&gt; human Audio Daryl Hepting: evaluation. So. So I mean, they're both involved in this. But primarily if we're talking about the visibility of system status, we don't get feedback about what the command was, but the impact of the command we just issued. So I would say that's primarily an issue of evaluation, or going from the computer to the human. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h33 12h33 Chat S02: yes S25: yes Audio Daryl Hepting: That makes sense. So because we're not clear about our feedback, the system, let's be clear about, we don't receive clear feedback about the state in which the system is now in, that affects the commands that we're going to issue from the human to the computer. So it impacts that is as well. So let's recycle. So there's the two aren't independent. Okay, so let's go. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h34 12h34 Chat DHH: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/ Audio Daryl Hepting: Let's go back to our heuristic number two, we won't do videos that include this link, well even posted in the chat, but I'll put it in our in more detail in the record of our meeting today. So the match between the system and the real world. So the system should speak the user's language with words, phrases, concepts familiar to the user rather than system oriented terms. It should follow real world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h35 12h35 Audio Daryl Hepting: So when we're communicating when the system provides information to the user, it should be understandable by the human using that computer even using the interface. Who's ever seen error messages? Like oh, err minus 18 3762? Has anyone ever seen an a message like that on the screen? Nobody? Yes. Okay, one person http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h36 12h36 Chat S20: On website? S14: All the time, and it's not even error codes that bother me S05: yup S14: But the fact that when I look them up someone just does terrible troubleshooting on whatever online support handles it. Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so it's where in whatever interface. So when that. Okay, so that's one example of a mismatch between the system and the real world, when the error codes don't make sense in terms of when the error that comes up doesn't make sense in the context of what the person is doing. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h37 12h37 Audio Daryl Hepting: To use your control and freedom number three. So users often choose system functions by mistake. And when neither clearly marked emergency exits leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialog and support, Undo and Redo. So that's one, one x. One expression of user freedom is the ability to try something and then undo it. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h38 12h38 Audio Daryl Hepting: As an example of when it's people don't have freedom is when there's a command that's unclear about what its impact would be. You're not always in charge. Unless you do something. And then it's not clear what this there isn't feedback. telling you what happened when we executed this command you're not sure about and that's compounding the difficulty. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h39 12h39 Audio Daryl Hepting: So consistency and standard is number four. Users should not have to wonder whether different words situations actions in the same thing. So to me, the progressive disclosure mechanism that we talked about, whether it's better to have the arrow or if we're going to use an arrow which should represent more information to disclose and where they should operate. That should be http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h40 12h40 Audio Daryl Hepting: the opposite case. So we talked about up arrows or the chevron pointing up or down or sideways. And so, once we agree on to use that symbol in a way in the interface, then we should always use that and use it in that fashion. So that if we see and Chevron pointing to the side We know it's going to be, we click on it. And there's going to be more information. And if we see an arrow pointing down, that means this is showing extra information, and we can hide some of it by clicking on it again. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h41 12h41 Audio Daryl Hepting: So number five, even better than good error messages is carefully designed to prevent a problem from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error prone conditions or check for them and present users with confirmation option before they commit the action. Make sense? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h42 12h42 Audio Daryl Hepting: So it's just it's not just enough to have a good error message. Which would cover which we covered in the heuristic to having a strong match between the system and the real world. But error prevention means that we're trying to think about what people are wanting to accomplish, and designing it so they can do that without errors. Okay, six theistic is recognition rather than recall. So the it's basically, you want to give people, you want to let people recognize options rather than trying to recall the command X to perform some function, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h43 12h43 Audio Daryl Hepting: flexibility and efficiency of use. So that people who are familiar they can use accelerators. The power users can have command key equivalent to the menu options, for example. So maybe we'll cut and paste. So I am, I'm very habituated in to not do just to doing Ctrl C, or Command C, and Command V, to copy and paste. But I noticed that sometimes now the application requires me to go to the Edit menu to pull down, like the menu command is a more powerful version than the keyboard shortcut. So that's a little bit disconcerting. And just like when I was talking about setting up the meeting, and then I could see it couldn't see the requirement to register for the meeting, in the meeting http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h44 12h44 Audio Daryl Hepting: invitation. And that two interfaces between the desktop client and the web client are different. So http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h45 12h45 Audio Daryl Hepting: that's more of a consistency thing then. But if it's, it also affects flexibility and efficiency of use, if I'm sure that I can create a meaningless registration on the desktop, or I don't know that and then know that I can't. And I choose the wrong one. And then I'm stuck in that loop between humans human in the computer. So I see it's 1245 already. So I thought we did well with that. And getting people engaged. So I'm going to take that chat information and put it together in a quiz that we can do before next meeting, and next meeting. We'll http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h46 12h46 Chat S14: Sounds good. S22: Thank you! S03: Thank you!! S18: Thank you prof S24: Thank you Audio Daryl Hepting: talk about creating groups through the project and having some time to work on that. Okay. Thank you for today. See you on Thursday. And I have an office hour, two to three today. Okay. Anything before we go? Okay. Looks like a nice day. I'm not sure if it was going to be as nice as yesterday, but sun shining anyway. So I hope you have a good day. And stay well and we'll see you next time. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/06_Tue-22-Sep-2020.html#12h47 12h47 Chat S02: thank you. bye.

S06: Hello Everyone Audio Daryl Hepting: Hello, everybody not everybody yet but we'll see. Hear me okay. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h31 11h31 Chat DHH: can you hear me? S08: Yes S09: yes S03: yes S10: yep S01: yes S11: yes S06: Yes, I got the link Audio Daryl Hepting: So I did push the invitation to Discord. I'll post it here too. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h32 11h32 Chat DHH: As some of you have seen, I have posted an invitation to discord. DHH: https://discord.gg/BuB4sf S12: yes S09: i don't know why ut it says invalid invite for me DHH: From last day: https://www.google.com/search?q=who%27s+on+first Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, I mean so there's something on the clipboard. Here's the link to who's on first. Let me see if I got the right http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h33 11h33 Chat DHH: Try this link: https://discord.gg/wzW4yd Audio Daryl Hepting: answer surprised that I had that up on the clipboard. So let me just check the invite. Okay, so the first link to Google search, who's on first that gives you the page to vote aveline Costello's routine. Famous routine about confusing. Well, the players names on the baseball team are easily confused with http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h34 11h34 Audio Daryl Hepting: with answers to this question. clarification says question. Who's on first? Yes, that's right. You don't often think that the person be named who anyway So without me trying to suck the humor out of it, let's look at that webpage if you're interested, and then there's some links to explore. I don't have my video on, I feel like at least one of us should have video on. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h35 11h35 Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so let me share my screen. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h36 11h36 Audio Daryl Hepting: They sound like I'm coming from, from outer space, like on the International Space Station or something, as in a meeting yesterday and they said, Well, it sounds like you're, you're in space. And I thought it was because I didn't just have a floating head here at the back of the block room. And he said, knows the audio. And I said, well, gee whiz, they should advertise. That is a feature of these headphones. It could sound like look around the space station. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h37 11h37 Audio Daryl Hepting: So there's another video, it's a five minute video. I know I promised to put links in ahead of time. So the harder for me than I realized Fletcher, five minute video now. What I'd like to do is think about what they're saying in this video with the discussion we had last day about the heuristics for usability. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h39 11h39 Chat S02: yes S12: yes S13: Yes, But no audio. Audio Daryl Hepting: So can you see the whole screen Okay, so I've got a couple yeses so I just want to make sure because not part of the screen is blocked my blocked with the participants window in the chat window. So Okay, here we go. Let's Let's even restart it. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h40 11h40 Chat S14: No audio S13: No audio Audio Daryl Hepting: Hello sir, so please a snow dog is going to check for us http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h41 11h41 Chat S09: his headphones has the audio so probably ha can't listen to you right now Audio Daryl Hepting: and our professor redos, Not Audible Hello http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h42 11h42 Chat DHH: Better? S03: no S14: No prof S15: nah S13: no S01: no S12: no http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h43 11h43 Chat S16: no http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h44 11h44 Chat S17: no http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h45 11h45 Chat S14: Prof can you give us the link in chat? S09: yes S18: Yes we could not hear anything Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so you can only hear me. Yeah. Okay. So are the subtitles helpful? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h46 11h46 Chat S15: right S09: yes they were S12: yes S02: yes they were S19: Can only hear your irl audio, not computer audio :/ subtitles are good though yes Audio Daryl Hepting: Anyway and the link is there for you to look at later. So that's another reason to avoid videos in zoom at least until I figure out why the audio is not not cooperating. So do you see any connection between these doors that are hard to open? And this heuristics that we discussed last day http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h47 11h47 Audio Daryl Hepting: Feel free to put your hand up and talk or just or write into the chat. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h48 11h48 Chat DHH: Any thoughts about how these doors relate to the heuristics that we discussed last day? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h49 11h49 Chat S10: yes and no. I believe there are certain regulations on front doors (that they always have to be pull when you enter, and push when you leave), but for inside doors, some are more difficult to figure out than others. Audio Daryl Hepting: Yes, very Oh Unknown: yes, I think the thing we have seen is the consistency and the standards we usually follow we are used to how we open the door and that's a very trivial thing in our everyday life. So, consistency and standard I think it It must be there. Daryl Hepting: Okay. So consistency is good. But if we If we have doors with pull handles on both sides, that's the consistency of the check mark for consistency. But it's not, it's also not clear which side to push and which side to pull. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h50 11h50 Audio Unknown: Is I'm following that idea. Like, if it's a flat side, we only have to like push as it's a handle. we'd certainly have in mind we have to pull. Daryl Hepting: Yeah. Yeah. So that that's that's the pattern that we'd like to see. Standardized. So that's more maybe aspirational? Because there's lots of doors that don't follow that pattern. Yes, that's right. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h51 11h51 Audio Daryl Hepting: So, okay, so good for the positive cases. heuristics relate to good doors? And how do we see the heuristics play out when we have less less good doors? Unknown: He has one thing, like, at the caption of the video, like it says, pull and it also has a handle to pull. Adding there, they are more like doing that. Error prevention, error handling. And like what they did, without pushed or they have a handle. So they put the sign over there. Like, rather than pulling, you should push. So rather than proving their design, they put a passage over there for people to Okay, handle it like this way? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h52 11h52 Audio Daryl Hepting: Yeah. And so like, so that's, that's part of help and documentation. But better than having documentation of how to operate the door. It's better to make it clear what to do with the door to begin with. Yes, you're right. So anyone else has thank you for your comments. Anyone else like to contribute to the discussion? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h53 11h53 Audio Daryl Hepting: So you can either put your hand up or think unmute your microphone, and I'll see a little information. Okay, Sam, go ahead. Unknown: So from what I understand, there's actually regulations involved, at least with front doors, where it's, you actively have to have the majority of the doors as pull when you come in, and then push when you're going out just for concerned about stampeding purposes. And there's like regulations for like, the size of the hallway going into it and all this, that and the other thing. So there are like rules and regulations in place. It's just a matter of like, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h54 11h54 Chat S20: Yea pulling from the inside is a danger in case of a fire Audio Unknown: they're not obvious sometimes. Daryl Hepting: Mm hmm. Unknown: And it's independent of the visual visuals of the door itself. Daryl Hepting: Yeah. So one thing I find frustrating is that well, there's many things I find frustrating, but I try and use the right hand door as I approach sir. Like stick keep right is the rule in North America. Right. I know the one point We're keep left signs in the UK. I don't know if they are so much there anymore. But it would be nice if we had keep rate signs here, I think so trying to enter the door on the right side or exit or exit using the opposite door on my right. Sometimes http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h55 11h55 Audio Daryl Hepting: there are two doors, but only one is open, and then they have an extra latch to push. This is a problem for me. So I'm aware that there are other. There are other issues involved. I mean, there are regulations involved, but it's still I think that we should not well. So let's see what we can find for the regulations regarding entry doors, and see how well they they match up with design guidelines. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h56 11h56 Chat S14: The door completely reflect the usability mistakes of heuristics UI desighn. Its confusing all the time…no consistenc and visibility of which way should we open, etc. Audio Daryl Hepting: So for the web, in it, as an example, the web has lots of ARIA http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h57 11h57 Chat S09: even there are some clear glass doors that people can not perceive to be a door and hence bumps into them. S09: so no handles, no clear hints to be a door Audio Daryl Hepting: not to name. The words to go a few abbreviations are escaping me at the moment. But there's a standards for rich internet applications. But they switched internet applications that are there, but then it's it's whether or not people follow them, or whether it's easy for them to follow them. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h58 11h58 Audio Daryl Hepting: So if if the regulations you're talking about are going against the design guidelines, or would make for Norman doors instead of invisible doors, so to speak. And then and we need a nice to be a conversation about that. Would you agree? Unknown: Yes or No, um, I get the rationale for it. But my understanding is it's like the fire code, which circumvents entirely any design flaws, or any design choices in the matter, because it's regulation has to be there. Otherwise, it doesn't get permission to be built or to continue to be used. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#11h59 11h59 Audio Daryl Hepting: So is there something to it if it's a fire code example where the regulations are part of the fire code? The fire code is the intention to keep people safe. So if there was an issue with the door that cause people that have problems opening it in an emergency then that would be An issue of safety that should could be addressed in the in the guidelines and the or in the fire code. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h00 12h00 Chat S09: yes that is true http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h01 12h01 Audio Daryl Hepting: commercial buildings http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h02 12h02 Chat S21: Three points to that. 1. This doesn't necessarily apply to interior doors, in which case things again become ambiguous. 2. People then need to be informed of these standards at some point, which is then documentation. 3. I'm not sure that these standards are consistent internationally, which reintroduces ambiguity. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h03 12h03 Chat S21: I'm not sure that our schools teach fire code regulations to elementary school kids, for example. DHH: let’s do some research about building and fire code regulations for commercial or multiple occupant buildings in Saskatchewan or Canada… and see what constraints we have to work with (or internationally) Audio Daryl Hepting: so Shannon, just to read your cut your chat post made me check what else? Yeah, so speaking of clear doors there in research and innovation center there's the Regina integrative cognitive experimentation lab race for short. Which, which predated the name of which predated the name of the buildings, so it's not like we just added the need to wreck. But anyway, as a design choice, the builders put the lock for the door at the bottom of http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h04 12h04 Audio Daryl Hepting: the bottom outside corner. So not only so that you had to get down on your knees to open the open the lock, and then try and get the animal. It be down at the floor with tea and have your other hand On the handle to jiggle it to see when it's open, because sometimes a lock would stick. So that was not a not a pleasing experience. Anyway. So Shannon's commerce doesn't say Apply to interior doors, which case things can become ambiguous. People then need to be informed of the standards at some point, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h05 12h05 Audio Daryl Hepting: which is then documentation. Not sure that these sounds are consistent or nationally, which reinforces ambiguity. I'm not sure that our schools teach fire code regulations to all the school kids, for example. So these are all good points. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h06 12h06 Audio Daryl Hepting: So let's try a breakout room activity about the doors. So let's do let's do some. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h07 12h07 Chat S10: that's kind of part of the code though? it helps us out when we don't notice it. S10: the only people who have to be taught are the people who check it and have to build according to it. Audio Daryl Hepting: So yes, that's true. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h09 12h09 Chat DHH: Yes, that’s true that the fire code helps people invisibly, so to speak. But are there cases when the code works against people? S09: if a new normal has to be introduced, users are the ones to be taught. for example, the differences internationally Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so I think there may be cases When, when, when there are things that aren't quite okay, so not to stick with a main group discussion, but I'll make up some breakout rooms again. So I'll just put you in terms of four or five and then you can http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h10 12h10 Audio Daryl Hepting: Do some research and some discuss with each other about consistency of issue find some examples of fairs where the building code is at odds with good design choices or windy weather building codes support Norman doors or or support invisible doors and you don't necessarily have it you can use examples from there but related fields and other related parts of building codes for example so I just give you some freedom to go where your discussion takes you. And then if http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h11 12h11 Audio Daryl Hepting: if someone in the group can let's see. Concerned take some notes and then I think there's a way to share a file at the end, let's say 10 minutes Okay, check in with you in 10 minutes. BREAKOUT Research, discuss, and make notes about the relationship between building regulations and the design of doors http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h12 12h12 Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay. We should be working now joining http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h13 12h13 Audio Daryl Hepting: so I have a feeling that the people who aren't all right moving on may not be at the computer or a step away from the computer so so last day when we did breakout rooms, I was trying to chat with a few people and get them to find out what the problem was tonight and later occurred to me that it might be just that they weren't. Anyway, that's it computers or phones. Okay, so the question is Hello http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h32 12h32 Audio Daryl Hepting: Everybody http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h33 12h33 Chat S22: Had trouble finding proper information on fire code regulations, the official national guide requires you to pay for it http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h34 12h34 Chat DHH: How did that go? Could you hear my audio in the break out rooms and see the messages? I didn’t see any new chat posts during the activity S10: I found some basic info on electronic doors specifically: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/laws-regulations/labour/interpretations-policies/044.html S09: it was good. have pondered over the 10 heuristic points. how there are differences in places. S09: we can not hear you in the rooms but could see the message from you S10: audio - not heard, messages - seen separately from chat window S06: We couldn’t’t hear but your message was showing on the screen for few seconds. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h35 12h35 Chat S09: at the top of the window, not in our chat window S06: We couldn’t see any option to reply to your message there S08: we were not able to hear you but we have seen message from you as a pop-up http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h36 12h36 Chat S12: yaa DHH: So, we can also apply the heuristics to other things, like zoom. Audio Daryl Hepting: Okay, so, let me try talking in terms of in terms of feedback, I guess we can think about me sending messages. So it gave me the option to broadcast a message to everyone. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h37 12h37 Chat S02: We can't take any action on received message Audio Daryl Hepting: So there wasn't there wasn't feedback about the messages were received or there is no idea about how the messages messages were received. And similarly for you either receive them differently than in the chat window. But there's no way to reply to them. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h38 12h38 Chat S09: so no user control on our end S23: I wasn't even aware you sent a global message. Zoom didn't even flash to tell me there was a message, like it usually does when one shows in the chat window. S02: we can't even copy the message to clipboard Audio Daryl Hepting: And then also, there is no way for me to speak to all the breakout rooms so it's not you One would think that would be possible since first or not. If I can write a text message to all the rooms and I would expect that there is a way for me to speak to all the rooms because when I went around and joined the rooms the other day so I have it set up to save the chat room. So I think when I created the breakout rooms, and I'll see what it looks like today after the meeting, but my feeling is that it created a separate copy of the chat room for each breakout of the chat session for each breakout room without indicating which chat http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h39 12h39 Chat S09: it was just a pop up without a window that disappeared in a few seconds Audio Daryl Hepting: which messages belong to which breakout room so ended up with about 10 or 12 messages because 10 or 12 safe chats because this is I understood it anyway, is that creating the room created, creating the breakout room caused a new chat to be saved. But it wasn't any different than the other chats, it was just up to a certain point was saved. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h40 12h40 Audio Daryl Hepting: So in terms of being able to understand, make use of new features as these a little bit to be desired. And I think a lot of things, least leave things to be desired. Not designs are perfect. Or some, some are more perfect than others. Some have smaller goals, so the execution and evaluation and others. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h41 12h41 Audio Daryl Hepting: I think as people we get stuck thinking that it's up to us to figure out how to work with a bad design. And that reflects positively on us. Or maybe it's a badge of honor to be able to, to operate a certain difficult control or interface. Rather than saying, No, that's a design issue. And that we shouldn't, we shouldn't demand better designs. Because we can figure them out. And in terms of the designers or the builders, or the programmers who create software or physical devices, if they're not considered if they're not taking the user into account in a meaningful way, then http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h42 12h42 Audio Daryl Hepting: we get things that rely on assumptions that are faulty and that end up frustrating us so they're not usable in don't lead to satisfactory satisfactory satisfactory experiences. So they might be able you might be able to accomplish a task using them but not http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h43 12h43 Chat S09: though breakout rooms create a question of scope and reachability but certainly enforces privacy and integrity within the groups. Audio Daryl Hepting: sorry, I got off track. So anyway, getting back to the idea of invisibility, whether the door is invisible or now another example is hammering nails, and you're you're hammering a nail smoothly not bending at you not hitting your fingers and you know the tooth the tool the hammer disappears. In a sense it becomes invisible. Once you hit your thumb or you get a bent nail or anything out of the ordinary then the tool becomes present. And especially hit your thumb then that sensation of frustration of bending the nail. So a lot http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h44 12h44 Audio Daryl Hepting: more or visit when you hit your thumb and so on. So I should ask, does anyone use the hammer before I'm kidding, I'm kidding a little bit, because now they have these Brad nailers that work with an air compressor. So that the prevalence of hammers and nails is decreasing a bit anyway, as much as typewriters, and so on, and http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h45 12h45 Audio Daryl Hepting: so forth a door to be invisible, to hear the example of when you need to push this a flat plate on one side. So that's clear. So you don't even realize that you're opening it. So it's clear that the door affords pushing, pushing open when there's a flat plate, so we could talk about the idea of affordances. So, when the action is clear, action supported by the interface or feature the command available through the interface is clear. And then, and then you can think about those as affordances, if http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h46 12h46 Chat DHH: affordances Audio Daryl Hepting: that makes sense. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h47 12h47 Chat S23: On the topic of hammers, it's not like you can do anything about the risk of bending a nail. A nail has to have that design to be able to hold the object together once nailed in, and the hammer has to have that ability to project force onto the nail. S23: So it's more about the fault tolerance we're willing to accept when it comes to a UI. And for doors, I think it should be MUCH lower than a hammer and nail. Audio Daryl Hepting: interesting about the interplay between the hammer and the nail, and so on, when I bend, given bend a nail for it goes straight in. Before it's all the way in. I'm, I think that is user error on my part. Because I haven't hit a prop straight or something else. So it's interesting to think that. So I've been thinking about people not accepting support interfaces, but then I didn't even question that is our nail interface. This is a way to, to improve it, so that the experience is more positive for more http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h48 12h48 Audio Daryl Hepting: people. Anyway, I was just typing a door with a flat panel. flat plate. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h49 12h49 Chat DHH: a door with a flat plate affords pushing. Audio Daryl Hepting: Oh, boy, it's already much later than I realized. I'm sorry for taking extra time today. So by Tuesday, I either have groups made up or be ready to be put into a group. Okay, and I just think about interfaces in those ways, using the heuristics that we've discussed and applied today. If you have notes from your breakout room that you can share with me, you can send them by email or post them to the forum in your courses. Okay. Thanks a lot. Have a great weekend. Sorry for keeping you longer today. Take care, they will. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h50 12h50 Chat S24: cya next week! S09: thank you. enjoy the weekend. S11: Thank you sir S21: thanks S16: thank you! S02: you have great weekend S23: Have a good weekend. S14: See you next prof.. thanks S06: Thank you Audio Daryl Hepting: And I have an office hour at two o'clock today. It's not like I need you need to come and keep me company but you're welcome to. Okay, bye http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/07_Thu-24-Sep-2020.html#12h51 12h51 Chat DHH: Thanks! S12: thankyou",

    "title": "Newspaper Copy that People Must Read",
    "text": "Newspaper Copy that People Must Read ADVERTISING’S RELATION TO THE GROWTH OF READING ABILITY — THE THUNDERSTORM AND “YELLOW” JOURNALISM — AN EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF COMPARISON IN WRITING By Arthur Brisbane. [NOTE. — The following are extracts from an address by Mr. Brisbane, editor of the New York Evening Journal, before the Syracuse (N. Y.) Advertising Club.] Advertising men should remember with pride and satisfaction that this is the first generation that can read. When I was a boy on the farm the servant that could read was the exception. I had a colored servant recently who could neither read nor write, but his brother was valedictorian at college. The person who cannot read now is almost a curiosity. Advertising men represent our speech on a big scale. Publicity, advertising, is to the human race what speech is to the individual. For many ages man lived with out speech. The individuals learned by experience and then died, and the next had to learn all over again. Then man acquired the art of speech, and the art of printing and finally the art of reading. Newspapers are in their infancy — they have only just begun. The most difficult and the most useful thing, whether in an editorial or an advertisement, is that it be such as the man who reads must understand, not can understand, but must. Tell the story quickly. Speaking of yellow journalism, I once addressed a body of Presbyterian clergymen, who admitted they did not like black type, red ink and colored supplements. I referred them to a storm which had gathered and children who had heeded the black cloud and scampered away to shelter. “That sky was being edited by a great journalist,” I told them; “He used black type” “Do vou see that black cloud?” I asked. “It’s the blackest I ever saw. The editor of that is in earnest. Soon you will see streaks of light. That’s our red ink. Then comes the rainbow. That’s our colored supplement. I only regret that I cannot put the thunder on the front page.” Let me tell you of the value of comparison: If I show you a picture of a pebble half an inch high on a magazine page and ask you how high it is, you cannot tell. But if I put a housefly beside it twice as large as the pebble, you say it is a grain of sand. If I take out the fly and put a man on horseback on top of the pebble you say it is a bowlder. If I take out the horse and man and paint a sea with ship which appears small beside it, you say it is a mountain. When you write and can find an exact comparison, you give an exact idea. I don’t like to talk in the abstract, and God forbid that I should ever be called scholarly. Use a picture. It’s worth a thousand words. Use a picture with five words, a comparison in thirty words. Here are ten lines from “Macbeth,” the most striking example of comparison I know: To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle, Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more; it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. That’s the way to write stuff. If you can write like that, your name is Shakespeare.",

    "text": "“One Look is Worth a Thousand Words” So said a famous Japanese philosopher, and he was right — nearly everyone likes to “read” pictures. “Buttersweet is Good to Eat” is a very short phrase but it will sell more goods if presented, with an appetizing picture of the product, to many people morning, noon and night, every day in the year than a thousand word advertisement placed before the same number of people only a limited number of times during the year. Good advertising for a trade marked product is nothing more nor less than the delivery of favorable impressions for it, and it does not make any difference whether they are delivered through newspaper, magazine or street car advertising. No man or woman ever picks up a newspaper or magazine or enters a street car wondering what Heinz, Postum, Campbell, or Cream of Wheat is offering — all the national advertiser can hope for is that his advertisement will be bumped into accidentally. It is simply the preponderance of favorable impressions for a meritorious product that reminds the consumer to buy it again and again. We deliver many millions of advertising impressions every day. The cars on our list carry more than 10,000,000,000 passengers a year. F. R. Barnard National Advertising Manager STREET RAILWAYS ADVERTISING CO.

It reminded all mothers every day of a sure way to give a treat to their own children. And hundreds of thousands got an extra thrill with their next cake making because of the happy expression of the boy on the car card. The moral of the story is that the same influence could not be created even with the same picture in any other advertising medium. In the magazines, the reminder would not be often enough to change the average housewife’s baking habit. In the newspapers, with no color, there would be no appetite appeal. On a twenty-four sheet poster, seen only for a few seconds at a time, the great appeal of the expression on the boy’s face would be lost.",

    "text": "PARC Algorithmic Art Show (1994) (from http://www.parc.xerox.com/csl/members/bern/algoart.html) Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier, JFK-MM Algorithmic Art Algorithmic art is rule-based art, usually made with the aid of a computer. Algorithmic visual art sits somewhere between mathematical art and computer graphics. Mathematical artists usually show individual timeless objects, such as topological models, whereas algorithmic artists focus on process, the sequence of steps used to create the work. Computer artists usually use standard algorithms (for example, those available in Photoshop), whereas algorithmic artists invent new algorithms and leave them quite visible. Computer artists typically cede less, or at least later, control to automatic processes than do algorithmic artists. Xerox PARC hosted an algorithmic art show in 1994 with about 20 artists from four different countries. Computer scientist Donald Knuth showed pictures of Leaper graphs, generalizations of a knight’s tour. Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier created JFK-MM, shown above, with a computer program that found “optimal” placements of Marilyn Monroe pixels within an image of John F. Kennedy. Anna Campbell Bliss showed Jumping Koi at Lake Truchet, a nice blend of algorithmic and “manual” art in which a random Truchet tiling (squares with two quarter-circles apiece) represents a lake. Yoshiyuki Abe showed LS-51, which was made by ray-tracing a scene with many light sources and then separately remaindering R, G, and B values by a modulus. Yoshiyuki Abe, LS-51 The PARC jury (Marshall Bern, Paul DeMarinis, Andrew Glassner, Rich Gold, and Natalie Jeremijenko) tried to avoid fractals — too cliche! — but we found Daryl Hepting’s dragons and Eleanor Kent’s fractal knit baby blankets irresistible. Similarly, we accepted a number of Stewart McSherry’s ray-traced pictures, even though we thought his work fit the category of computer graphics more closely than algorithmic art. Finally, we included some art about algorithms, rather than made by algorithms. George Legrady’s Equivalents II converted keywords into clouds. Kerny McLaughlin’s Portrait of TKM gave a well-defined algorithm for turning a person into a golf course. The illustration shows the result of running the algorithm on the artist’s father, and the calligraphed text below gives pseudocode. Portrait of TKM quietly exploded our preconceptions of “algorithmic art”. Kerny McLaughlin, Portrait of TKM This page updated September 1998 / bern@parc.xerox.com",

    "title": "MATH-ART at SFU Teck Gallery (1995)",
    "text": "In honour of the 1995 Canadian Math Society Winter Meeting, Simon Fraser University presents: MATH-ART: 9 December 1995 — 24 January 1996 Scroll down for more information about the exhibit (those images on a yellow background have extra information about how they were created). Postcard advertising events on opening day: December 9, 1995 Introduction Mandates of art galleries are many, but the mandate that immediately defines a university gallery is the mandate that a gallery demonstrates the aesthetic dimensions of academic disciplines. It was to this end that Simon Fraser Gallery mounted its first math art exhibition, EXPLORING THE IMAGE WORLD OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS works by Daryl Hepting (and others from the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab in the School of Computing Science), in the W.A.C. Bennett Gallery, May 30 to July 26, 1994. Daryl Hepting, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Computing Science and one of the four curators of this exhibition, knows the connections between computers and aesthetics as few in Simon Fraser University can. He takes us on a short course on math art in the notes on these digital graphics. Other members of Simon Fraser University who joined me in curating this exhibition were Dr. Katherine Heinrich, Chair of Mathematics &amp; Statistics and Dr. Malgorzata Dubiel of the same department. These eighteen images were selected from scores of possible images so as to represent the complexities and contrasts of visual aesthetics that are possible in digital graphics. They were also selected to represent the images that are available from three sources on the WORLD WIDE WEB (internet): computer art exhibits, pioneer publications, and computer images created by Daryl Hepting of Simon Fraser University. Simon Fraser Gallery is grateful for the assistance of Gallery staff, Daryl Hepting and the other curators for making this exhibition possible. It is also grateful to the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab for production assistance. The Teck and Simon Fraser Galleries are honoured to support the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics in hosting the Canadian Mathematical Society 1995 Winter Meeting. Dr. Edward Gibson, Director, December 1995. Notes on Exhibition The majority of works in this exhibition represent a collection which rely on the computer for their existence. And the computer involves mathematics to describe, manipulate, and translate even the simplest scenes into the forms we see here. The involvement of mathematics plays a greater role in these works — it provides the inspiration and the foundation upon which they are constructed. A prominent feature of the exhibit is its display of fractals, objects from a non-Euclidean geometry. Fractals — sharing a root with fracture and fraction &amp;dash; have been called the geometry of nature by Mandelbrot, who discovered their capability to describe the non-smooth world in which we live. Fractal geometry, which is new to us, has shed light on old things — things like the historical record of water levels in the Nile river for instance. And in its turn the computer has shed light on fractals, allowing the underlying beauty of what may seem to be dry-as-dust mathematics to shine through. Works like Blessed State or Steps to Infinity provide evidence of the profound connection that seems to exist between fractals and the natural world. It is fitting that this collection of computer-related art comes to us in large part through the internet (the World Wide Web). Although Daryl Hepting is now at SFU, his works are distributed widely across the internet. In addition to Hepting’s collaborations with Musgrave (George Washington University), Prusinkiewicz (University of Calgary), Saupe (University of Freiburg), and Snider (University of Regina), the computer-based works come from: Contours of the Mind: A Celebration of Fractals, Feedback and Chaos SITO: the operative term is “stimulate” The Fractals Calendar The other pieces in this exhibit remind the viewer that the computer is responsible for only a portion of all mathematical art. The works of M. C. Escher and Marjorie Rice offer a beautiful expression of this fact. Partial financial support for the exhibit at Harbour Centre was provided by the British Columbia Ministry for Employment and Investment. Fiery Dragon by Daryl H. Hepting Martin Gardener tells the story of how this curve, first discovered by John E. Heighway, used by William G. Harter as a decoration symbolic of cryptic structure, and later analysed by them and another colleague, Bruce A. Banks. Though its final structure is complex, its description is not. The following two transformations are required to generate this shape: xform scale { sqrt(2)/2 } rotate -45 xform scale { sqrt(2)/2 } rotate 135 translate 1.0 0.0 Beginning with a single point, the whole curve can be generated by repeated application of these two transformations. This specification of the shape in terms of contractive, affine transformations is called an iterated function system (IFS). This image of a dragon curve was created by covering with disks (spheres) the parts of the plane which do not include the fractal. These parts are determined by computing the minimum distance from a point P to the fractal. If this distance is d, then a disk of radius d can be drawn about the point P and all points inside that disk are known not to belong to the fractal. Like many of my other works, I've used rayshade to ray-trace this image. This process creates the final image (which you see above) by simulating a camera inside the computer. Dragon Mesa (1989) by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Dietmar Saupe, and Daryl H. Hepting Steps to Infinity (1994) by Daryl H. Hepting and F. Kenton Musgrave The steps in this image come from a dragon curve, like the one seen on the poster for this event (and described in the notes for Fiery Dragon. Below, I show two different colourings for a dragon curve in the plane. The curve is made up of smaller and smaller copies of itself, as the colourings indicate. There are two transformations which define the dragon curve each small dragon seen above can be described by a sequence of these two transformations. To create the steps, I've assigned a unique height to each small dragon. Below, I show the steps inside a white sphere, which represents the sky. It doesn't look much like a very believable sky here, but I'll fix that. The lighting I've used here is much simpler than in the final image and it shows. If you look carefully at Steps to Infinity, you will notice (part of) a Mandelbrot set in the sky, amongst the clouds. I began with a portion of the Mandelbrot set, shown below. It may be familiar to you from Ken Musgrave's image on the cover of the 1994 Fractals Calendar. In this case, I've changed to colours more appropriate for a blue sky. For the next step, I've mapped the square image onto the inside of a white sphere, which will represent the dome of the sky in the model of my scene. Notice that this image is considerably lighter than the first, and this is due only to the white colour of the original sphere. I create some clouds for the sky by using a fractal texture function which selects blues and whites for each pixel based on something called fractional Brownian motion. When the clouds are combined with the Mandelbrot set image, the final Mandelbrot sky image comes to life. And the final image once again... Desktop Tetrahedron (1990) by Daryl H. Hepting and Allan Snider Carrot in Blue (1991) by Daryl H. Hepting and Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz Fractal Emblem (1992) by Daryl H. Hepting Splash (1993) by F. Kenton Musgrave The Great Fern Dune (1994) by Daryl H. Hepting Blessed State (1988) by F. Kenton Musgrave Captivating Rhythm (1995) by Daryl H. Hepting This image is based on a fractal which is similar to the one used to create Fiery Dragon and Steps to Infinity. This curve is also defined by two transformations, but with slightly different parameters: xform scale 0.618 /* Dragon scales by approximately .7071 */ rotate -137.5 xform scale -0.618 rotate 137.5 translate 1.0 0.0 This image is an interpretation of the process by which the points of the plane are captured by the transformations in the description of the curve to form the actual curve. I've assigned an initial point to each of the two transformations and I apply the transformations to their respective points and then to the results, over and over again. As I compose the transformations into longer and longer strings, the contractivity of each composite transformation increases. These \"stronger\" transformations capture more and more of the plane. As the strength of a transformation increases, a cone under that transformation gets wider and shorter. The upper black and white image above shows one possible colouring for the image used to construct Captivating Rhythm. Each band corresponds to a different level of \"capture\", increasing away from the curve. The reverse of \"capture\" (lower left above) is \"escape\" (lower right above). Notice how the arrangement of disks differs between them. The image below shows another way to view the same data, ultimately selected for the final image. Here, I have broken up what were solid bands in the earlier image by using information about which transformation was applied at a particular time. In creating the final image, I applied a fractional Brownian motion texture and added an outline of the fractal. Untitled by Stan Ostoja-KotkowskI Fractal World (1994) by L.

It is possible for someone without formal credentials to make contributions to mathematics. Well-known artist M.C. Escher and unknown homemaker Marjorie Rice both tackled mathematical problems, developing unorthodox notation that was essential to their methodical investigations. Each worked alone, essentially in secret, rewarded by the exhilaration of finding answers to a large puzzle.

    "title": "1995 Fractals Calendar",
    "text": "1995 About the cover: Floating in space, this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity. At once, it appears natural and yet somehow unnatural, perhaps a testament to the familiarity of fractals. Amidst the fractal clouds, the sky reveals part of the omnipresent Mandelbrot set. I edited the 1995 Fractals / 1996 The Art of Fractals calendar as a Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University. The calendar featured contributed images from Danielle Bercel, Michael Field, Martin Golubitsky, John C. Hart, F. Kenton Musgrave, and Lewis N. Siegel. This calendar was completed with the assistance of the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics and the Graphics and Multimedia Research Laboratory at Simon Fraser University. Earlier work was done at the University of Regina and at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. There are many to whom I continue to be grateful, but especially B. Mandelbrot, K. Musgrave, P. Prusinkiewicz, D. Saupe, and R. Voss. January: Snowflake in Winter by Daryl H. Hepting von Koch's snowflake curve, an early mathematical monster, is depicted here in friendlier surroundings. The blue visible amidst the spheres is what remains after an algorithm to cover the complement of the fractal is applied. It works by finding the minimum distance of d of a point x from the fractal then drawing a disk of radius (maybe less than) d centered at x. Since any point already inside a disk cannot be part of the fractal, the algorithm progresses quickly as the complement is covered by disks. The spheres are the three-dimensional extensions of those disks. A fractal texture is applied to the spheres to create snowballs &mdash; the making of which is a common pastime during long Canadian winters. The snowflake curve is based on an equilateral triangle, of which each side is divided into three parts then replaced by four parts of the same length, and so on. February: Chaotic Quilt by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky Although chaos would seem to be the antithesis of symmetry, it is possible to find elaborate symmetric patterns in chaotic processes. Shown here is a hexagonal pattern similar to those that sometimes appear on quilts. This image is produced by iterating a map with hexagonal symmetry. Although the iteration possesses all the features of chaos, a surprisingly detailed and intricate symmetric pattern appears when we take a very large number of iterations &mdash; in this case about six billion &mdash; and color each pixel according to the number of times it is visited during iteration. In this sense we are computing an averaged picture. The colors themselves were chosen for their artistic effect. Note that the detail inside each of the hexagons happens to resemble a flower. The fractal quality of the picture is to some extent represented by the reappearance of the hexagonal symmetry on ever-decreasing scales. March: The Great Fern Dune by Daryl H. Hepting This fern dune is one of the natural wonders on this distant world. The fern leaf is defined by a set of linear transformations, sometimes called an iterated function system. The sand dune which surrounds the leaf was created by evaluating a so-called escape-time function for the fern and subsequently interpreting the values as heights. The escape-time function works by determining whether a point escapes membership in the fern, and if so then how quickly. The fern shape at the top of the dune reveals the accuracy with which that question was answered here. More points are included than might otherwise be expected since it is easier to exclude points than verify their membership. The scene is made more believable by the use of fractal textures for the clouds, moon and sand. The technique for interpreting function values as heights is effective for adding a third dimension to two-dimensional data, and has been employed to great advantage in many earlier fractal images. April: Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing, Variation #1 by Danielle Bercel This image is the result of a two-year metamorphosis from the image shown below [not shown], entitled Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing. The title of these images is a partial quote from Karen Blixen's novel Out of Africa. From inspection, one may see that both pictures depict the same fractal and that they share virtually all the same coordinates and parameters. The roles of color and black (or monotones) between the two images are reversed. Areas black in Variation #1 were colored according to logarithmic function in the original and monotone areas in the original received an algorithmic coloring. The form of the original is still visible in Variation #1, but it has been de-emphasized. The images are based on a variation of the usual formula describing Julia sets: zn+1 = zn2 + c, where one may adjust the value of c (a complex number) as a parameter to obtain different images. In the variation, a function is added to the mix and becomes another parameter for manipulation: zn+1 = f(zn) + zn2 + c. For these images, the conjugate of a cosine function was used. While I still prefer the original picture, as a parent might feel for a child, it appears that almost everyone who has seen both of these pictures prefers Variation #1. May: Mandelbloom by Lewis N. Siegel (with thanks to Randy Hudson and Daryl H. Hepting) It has been observed, by Mandelbrot and others,that fractal forms are found abundantly in nature. In this spirit, Mandelbloom shows natural forms occurring in a fractal. The image was created with a method used to show how the Mandelbrot set evolves over time. To create an image of the Mandelbrot set, points in the complex plane are iterated according to the well known function Zn+1 = Zn2 + C. The structure in Mandelbloom comes from an attempt to capture the movement of these points at a particular moment in time. In traditional renderings of the Mandelbrot set, each point in the plane is iterated until it escapes from the neighborhood of the origin, or reaches an upper limit. The number of iterations is then utilized to generate a color for the pixel which represents that point. In Mandelbloom, each point is instead iterated exactly the same number of times, and each point's location in the plane is used to color the pixel. With this method, a procedural texture is used to associate a color with every point in the complex plane. Rather than calculating colors for the pattern, color values are read from bitmaps of either the stem or the rose. June: Humble Aspirations by Daryl H. Hepting (with thanks to F. David Fracchia) In the midst of the harsh surroundings, a lone tree struggles for life. Each element of the scene modeled here employs fractals to shift attention from the mathematical details of the model to the illusion which it creates. The terrain is created from instances of a height field derived from a planar linear fractal, [not] shown below. The density of the fog which covers this desolate land is modulated by a fractal function. The tree, though idealized, does incorporate some observations from nature which, along with a wood texture, add to its realism. Every branch in the tree is created by linearly transforming the trunk. Beginning with a very concise description, the model is expanded to include over 150,000 primitives for rendering. July: Untitled #7 by Danielle Bercel This image takes a portion of the standard Mandelbrot set as its starting point. The portion chosen, shown at a relatively low magnification factor of 414 in Untitled #7 n-2 (top image below [not shown]), seems rather boring with little to recommend it. However, at a magnification factor of about 40,000, as seen in Untitled #7 n-1 (bottom image below [not shown]), this same location reveals the familiar shape of the Mandelbrot set and its lake. Even at relatively low magnifications, images of fractals can be made more interesting by bringing out other details and the main image is the result applying one such technique. Points outside the Mandelbrot set will \"escape\" to infinity after some number of iterations, and this number is usually called the escape time (points which have not escaped after the maximum allowed number of iterations are considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set). Traditionally in images of the Mandelbrot set each point represented in the image is colored according to this value, but I have also experimented with several alternatives. One may determine the color by making use of the real component of the location at which the point was deemed to have escaped (the Mandelbrot set resides on the complex plane and so each point on the plane has both real and imaginary components). Another technique which can be used to determine color is based on the quadrant of the complex plane in which escaped points first land. The result is a sort of curved-space checkerboarding of color, as points belonging to a single contour may take on any one of four colors depending on the point of departure for the escaping point. To this, an additional logarithmic coloring algorithm is applied to produce smooth color transitions. August: Fractal Quilt by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky Fractals can be created to mimic the real world and they can also be used as a source of pattern generation. Combining fractal methods with symmetry leads to a method for creating many kinds of repeating patterns. The seventeen different symmetry types of planar repeating patterns were classified formally by Federov in 1891 &mdash; but their existence has been known for centuries. Indeed, each of these patterns appears in the Alhambra, a group of buildings overlooking the city of Granada that was constructed by the Moors in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Only more recently have mathematicians considered how many different ways there are to construct two-color planar repeating patterns &mdash; there are forty-six possibilities. A two-color repeating pattern is one in which half the symmetries of the figure preserve the colors while half the symmetries interchange colors. Fractal methods have been used to create this large two-color fractal quilt. It is amusing to check whether you can, in fact, identify all of the symmetries in this figure. (Besides the translations, there are eight symmetries &mdash; four preserve colors and four interchange them.) September: A Crop Circle on the Palouse by John C. Hart (with thanks to Gordon Farrell and Philip Peterson) This image demonstrates recent advances in computer graphics at modeling supernatural phenomena. This crop circle, that might have otherwise been the result of a UFO encounter, as actually created using a technique called procedural geometric instancing. It allows a new representation for procedural models, which are typically translated into simpler polygonal representations for rendering. The usual unorganized polygonal representations can be unmanageable due to size. Procedural geometric instancing encapsulates procedural components into the geometric representation, which are evaluated on demand during rendering. The crop circle, containing over 100 million primitives, was specified by a short description file which represents the field of wheat with a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) hierarchy of instances of a single wheat stalk which may or may not bend over, depending on the location into which it is instanced. Given this position, a simple lookup in a low-resolution \"crop map\" of the Mandelbrot set determines whether the UFO should bend the stalk or not. October: Dragon's Lair by Daryl H. Hepting A dragon curve is captured here in what may be its natural habitat. The brooding dragon curve remains after its complement has been covered by the blocks which form the walls which enclose it. The primitives are not spheres, as before, since the Manhattan distance function is used in place of the usual Euclidean. This means that distance is calculated x+y rather than x2 + y2 and so diamonds in the Manhattan metric fill the same role as circles in the Euclidean metric. To create the third dimension in this image, boxes with height proportional to the size of the original diamonds were used. The sharpness of these boxes and their shadows provide an interesting contrast to the apparent roughness of the dragon curve, created with a fractal texture. November: Barque by F. Kenton Musgrave A shortcoming of computer-generated images is often that they lack the level of visual complexity of a photograph or a painting. An impressionist painting, for instance, can have a rich variety of color in each brush stroke; furthermore, paintings always have a textured surface, and a painter is likely to modulate the color of an otherwise flat field of color, such as a blue sky. In Barque a variety of fractal methods are used to obtain similar visual complexity. First, we start with a fractal mountain and fractal water, as seen in the image [not shown] below. Then a fractal color perturbation, as seen in the second image below, is applied to the mountain and to the sky. Finally, a fractal post-processing filter is applied to the image to create a pointillist effect. This filter samples the color of the image at a particular location, perturbs that color with a fractal distribution, then replaces a small area with a spot of the perturbed color. December: Steps to Infinity by Daryl H. Hepting and F. Kenton Musgrave Floating in space, this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity. Each step in the staircase is both a small copy of the whole shape and a collection of many smaller copies of itself, which illustrates the key concept of self-similarity. The fractal, called a dragon curve, is formed by iteration of just two linear transformations. Each step in the staircase can be identified by a common sequence of transformation applications. By labeling the transformations with 0 and 1 and recording how they are applied, one can associate a binary number with each step &mdash; used here to assign heights. The staircase looks somehow natural but the shape is more regular than would be found in nature. Like many fractal objects, it possesses a sense of familiarity. The clouds in the sky are also fractal, but they represent an example of stochastic fractals &mdash; in contrast to deterministic fractals like the staircase or the omnipresent Mandelbrot set.",

    "title": "A Path to Fractals",
    "text": "A Path to Fractals Nature is filled with a beauty easily perceived at many levels. Trees and forests, rocks and mountains, streams and mighty rivers, wisps of fog and great billowing clouds all contribute to an immediate, undeniable impression upon our visual sense. Although the impression may be hard to quantify, it is no less real. Artists often use poetry, paintings, or photographs in an attempt to communicate this impression of beauty. All these forms share in that they are patterns — of words, pigment or light — which gain permanence as they are connected with ideas. In this way, mathematicians also make patterns with permanence. To understand nature, we must also understand the language with which it speaks to us. Galileo said that this language is mathematics “its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.” The attempt to understand nature on the basis of mathematical patterns has a long tradition, which includes Pythagoras and Kepler. Though scientists since may have generally agreed with Galieo’s statement, they found the triangles and circles of Euclid’s geometry to be limiting. Mandelbrot acknowledged that: clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line … and he provided an alternative with fractal geometry. Mandelbrot coined the word fractal from the Latin root fractus to capture the rough, broken and irregular characteristics of the objects he intended to describe. In fact, this roughness can be present at all scales, which distinguishes fractals from Euclidean shapes. In the twenty-odd years since its introduction, fractal geometry has found a wide purview. Fractals seem to be everywhere, as the word fractal is now used to describe the universe and some of the very smallest things in it. Fractals, which belong to Galileo’s realm of “other geometrical figures,” add a very rich vocabulary for describing nature concisely. Now, the ruggedness of a coastline and the roughness of a rock can be quantified. ——— This calendar celebrates the deep symbiotic relationship between fractal geometry and computer graphics, which has grown as each nascent field has developed. The use of computer graphics for the study of fractals represents one of the first applications in the now popular realm of scientific visualization. As mathematical objects of infinite complexity, the detail of fractals can only be appreciated with the help of computers and this dependence represents the epitomy of scientific visualization’s goal to see the unseen. Apart from fractals with geometric constructions, the computer is also essential in the study of systems which exhibit fractal behavior over time. Here, computer-generated fractal images provide a glimpse of nature not so easily seen, one filled with deterministic chaos. Many physical systems are governed by deterministic laws, yet behave unpredictably. The unpredictability comes from sensitive dependence on initial conditions — two states which begin arbitrarily close together may become arbitrarily far apart after a finite period of time. Though the rules which define them are exceedingly simple, the complexity of shape is derived from repetition of those rules at a level that only the computer can manage. Computer graphics allows the communication of this complexity, with an eloquence not possible through words alone. Surprisingly, even these abstract images can appear organic and natural. Many of those who know of fractals were introduced to them through this application of computer graphics. With the increase of available computing power, the rewards and dangers of exploring the Mandelbrot set have become more evident. Arthur C. Clarke, in Ghost of the Grand Banks, speculates that in the future, Mandelmania will become a serious affliction for many. A sense of fractals can be gained without the computer, as nature abounds with forms possessing fractal characteristics. Although the largest and smallest examples of these cannot be seen by the naked eye, many remain easily accessible. More formally, fractals can be seen as abstractions of the natural qualities found in mountains, trees, and clouds. This process of abstraction leads to algorithms which allow computer graphics to produce astounding forgeries of nature that capture our impressions. One hopes that the result of the computer graphics process, approached from either of the above perspectives, is a pleasing picture. Each image may be created with a different purpose in mind, but ultimately the pictures are a means for effective communication of the material. And if the picture is pretty enough, it may even help to convince some of the beauty in mathematics. After seeing computer-generated pictures of fractals, some people will ask if there are any real uses of fractal geometry. In this case, it is important to emphasize the connection of the images to the reality just beyond the computer screen. There are many examples of the struggle to evaluate and apply the new idea of fractals and acceptance has not been unanimous. Mandelbrot gave a tentative mathematical definition for his discovery, but many have been concerned by its lack of precision. Then again, who could argue with the beautiful images, produced from simple equations, like the famous: Zn+1 = Zn2 + C which defines the Mandelbrot set. Natural objects possess detail at several levels but manufactured objects generally do not. In becoming focused on or bound to a particular scale, an important connection with nature is lost. Self-similarity is the key to much of the detail in natural forms. Similarity, in a mathematical sense, means that objects may differ only in size or position but not shape. Self-similarity means then that parts have the same shape as the whole. Fractals may also possess the self-similarity in a statistical or approximate sense, as many natural objects do. In its simplest form, fractal dimension can be said to measure the degree of this similarity. Experience has shown that it is difficult to be precise when defining fractals. Mandelbrot’s original definition based solely on dimension was considered too narrow, but Falconer has tried to capture the essence of what it is to be fractal. He has done this by adopting the approach of the biologist who would define life — most living things possess certain properties, most of the time. In the case of fractals, these properties are: a fine structure, too much irregularity to be described in traditional geometric language, both locally and globally, some form of self-similarity, perhaps approximate or statistical, a “fractal dimension”(somehow defined) which is greater than its topological dimension, and a simple definition, perhaps recursive. The connection to the definition of life seems appropriate, since fractals have been linked at many levels with nature and life. Even the human body exhibits fractals in its most basic functions, both spatially and temporally: in the circulatory system, the respiratory system, and at the cellular level across nerve membranes. It is remarkable that fractal geometry, born in an abstract mathematical universe, has come to have such an impact in our own physical one. Although one may appreciate equally the beauty of the Mandelbrot set and a mountainous landscape, it is not always easy to see a unifying theme if it even exists. One may understand the recipes for generating images of the Mandelbrot set, but it is quite another matter to see fractals when looking away from the computer screen. It is revolutionary to think that fractals really are much more than the pictures which represent them and it may be more reasonable to view fractals only as isolated curiosities. Is fractal geometry a set of techniques for computer graphics or a new way to look at the world? Many of those involved with fractal geometry advocate the latter, but in order to arrive there from the former position, a significant transition must take place. Several paths may be followed, for example: abandon the need for a precise definition of fractal. Considering Falconer’s list of properties, fractals elude any narrow characterization which may be applied. view an image of the Mandelbrot set as a symbol for the processes which created it. Simple rules, applied recursively, yield complex results. examine Mandelbrot’s early work (soon to be available in his Selecta) which did not have the benefit of elaborate graphics to show its beauty. From the diversity of his early studies, one can grasp the connections that Mandelbrot made which prompted him to define the new geometry. begin to see the self-similarity in nature which plants, trees, mountains and clouds exhibit, and find fractals represented therein. Once the process has begun, it becomes possible to develop an eye for fractals. Although fractals are used mainly in physics, they have appeared of late in such diverse areas as aesthetics and psychology, indicating again that fractals are a very powerful idea. As researchers have struggled with the implications of fractals and chaos, so too have philosophers and artists. Just as the flapping of a single butterfly’s wings may affect global weather patterns, the actions of any individual may have far-reaching implications. These changes in world view are already being echoed in the arts. Historically, the introduction of a new geometry has been inspirational for artists. Although fractal geometry is significantly different from Euclid’s, the challenge may be to understand how these different puzzle pieces fit together. Fractal art is in a unique position since computers wait to become a widely accepted artistic medium. The procedural, or algorithmic nature of fractal art places it at a crossroads between mathematics and art — a fertile ground waiting to be fully explored. But more than just in visual arts, fractals are being actively explored in books, television, motion pictures, dance, theatre and music. In fact, a great deal of music exhibits the fractal distribution of 1/f noise over time, a sort of middle ground between unstructured white noise and highly structured brown noise. It contains enough structure to be regular, and enough variation to be surprising. An early example of fractally-informed music with computer-generated fractal imagery was Mandelbrot and Wuorinen’s experimental performance entitled New York Notes. Fractals, as a language of nature, give a new understanding of the finite world around us and provide a glimpse of infinity. Represented in this calendar is a collection of exciting and diverse fractal images. The Mandelbrot set is depicted in some interesting new ways. Both deterministic and random fractals are represented — some closely related to their mathematical roots. I hope you will be encouraged to explore fractals in new ways.",

    "text": "Evaluation of Teaching I take my teaching seriously and I am always willing to hear from students about ways that I can improve. As a sign of this commitment, I provide a link to my reviews on ratemyprofessors.com . If you are interested in learning about me and my teaching, please read on. I give my students the opportunity to provide their written feedback to me at exam times (midterms and final), using my own feedback instrument There are nine 5-level Likert items , with which students are invited to evaluate statements about me as the instructor, on the dimension of frequency. For example, the statement &ldquo;The instructor is well-prepared for class.&rdquo; can be rated as follows: Value Label [implied] Comment 5Alwaysvery positive 4[Mostly]positive 3[Sometimes]neutral 2[Rarely]negative 1Neververy negative The levels of each Likert item are symmetrical (equal number of positive and negative levels around the neutral centre) and balanced (there is equal perceptual distance from the centre, &lsquo;Sometimes&rsquo;, for the pairs &lsquo;Always&rsquo; and &lsquo;Never&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mostly&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rarely&rsquo;) There are also three open-ended questions that students are invited to complete. Midterm feedback is formative (I will look at these results immediately and discuss them with my students) and final feedback is summative (I will not look at these until my grades have been submitted). The Faculty of Science also collects summative feedback about my teaching. My goal is to post to this website all the feedback response data that I receive. I provide a numerical summary of the Likert items and I transcribe responses to each of the open-ended questions. I compute a single number that is the percentage of agreement, over those nine Likert items, with the rating &lsquo;Always&rsquo;.

CLICK HERE to toggle details finding flaws in terrible designs professor's way about explaining topics with fun and informative examples the student involvement level and the nature of the course the class is more interactive and we can gain more knowledge about the course interactivity this course is more interactive. So it leads to involvement of many people and which in turn makes other students to open up the class is interesting best is the way instructor make it interesting for the student by providing some activities. Instructor doesn't make the course boring the instructor give practical example of design and videos I like to this course because professor show us some related video to help to understand topic NA the TED talks and other videos it is interactive this course lets me breathe. It is a highly relevant and important topic and still is presented in a simple and pleasing manner. Does not put limits and restrictions on thoughts and allows the students to interact with each other and the professor helping everyone to learn and understand everything required, together interactive classes, discussions, opinions are asked the interactive nature of the course. There are always topics and scenarios to discuss in class everything providing the practical example interaction on different topics during class the discussions and participation this course not focuses only on software or computer and also focus on other devices and machine or can be applied to practical things except technology the ability to think outside the box, creatively evaluate different situations and think up scenarios NA is practical more than theory-oriented videos, discussions, and professor's way of teaching understanding the different approaches of design; how to be more creative and why it is interesting and practical it is not theory-oriented but it is practical the materials and instructor guidance discussions NA learning about design is fun the hands on experience on real services it is very free form. I like the discussion and the use of different teaching aids good discussions happen; interesting content it really gives perspective on what good design is and how to create it the class discussion NA the occasional video demonstration. Impossible to comprehend interaction design ideas without watching a video of the ideas the class discussion and the online forum no piazza. That is amazing. No, really! That is hilarious. We use URcourses and your site. That's it! I like it! the subject matter is interesting and relevant content it enhances our creative thinking and makes us aware of the bad designs and ways to improve them NA incorporates real-world examples of design some aspects can be fun / interesting it correlates to the real time technology which makes interesting and easy to understand this course gives an insight into interface design the class is interactive, real world examples help understand problem better. Asks for our opinion is good. What would you like to change about this course? CLICK HERE to toggle details no group work; clearer instructions and requirements for assignments NA NA NA NA nothing none I found nothing to be changed till now topic should be given a day before lecture so student can prepare I need to change when we are writing in the exam paper, please remove this box format NA more notes on the board please more scenarios the instructor could ask the students to read about something relevant to topic that is to be discussed in class, before coming to the class so that everyone will be able to relate to the discussions happening in class and contribute more chapter-oriented lecture is needed NA NA nothing nothing, it's perfect (just kidding). I think the course lacks a proper format on what is to be taught in every lecture rather than just discussing different topics (that doesn't mean that I don't like discussions) more info about the group project (e.g. past projects) nothing nothing for now NA don't feel any necessity of modification to class nothing more discussion for cognitive pyschology; more recent example and studies rather than old nothing don't feel any changes for this course nothing be more clear and concise on materials the online is full of outdated things such as dates NA nothing pertinent allowing less off-topic discussion. Allowing comedians to have the floor instead of trying to keep everyone on track more clear assignments with more explanation, especially with marking schemes more modern examples nothing have class end on time more often nothing nothing it is just as good as it is. Just don't break it, okay?? more time on subject matter, less time going over assignments and evaluation; going through more design from 'scratch' rather than always critiquing assignments it could have been more practical based NA NA more involved activities / smaller classes there would be no changes that can be done for the course presentation or slide show could be included weight of midterm should be more than 10% What do think are the instructor's greatest strengths? CLICK HERE to toggle details asking thought provoking questions ability to communicate with his students well prepared and high teaching skills and abilities; respects students the instructor is more knowledgeable and taught the course in a way the students can understand this course NA the smile and interactive nature treats students with respect. The instructor clearly communicates his expectations for student preparation instuctor's greatest strength is the students' feedback and how we interact in the class experience of his life instructor's greatest strength is he always teach us well and also helping to the student and find out our comments NA his energy, his calm demeanor, and his preparedness listening and encourage students to participate the instructor encourages students to actively participate in class and discuss on topics. The instructor listens to the views of all students and does not undermine their ideas but provides a better way of thinking that the students might not have thought about he is cool drives participation of students in class as well as online his capability to connect people communicating with students to force students to think rather than just learning course material humour; thought-provoking; aware of the `dank memes' best utilization of URcourses by providing forums for student. Also keeping all lectures recorded with images on URcourses knowledge about several fields NA his teaching philosophy of challenging students to think out-of-the-box and develop his perspective encourages for a good discussion/brainstorm; calmly listen to the student question and help him to deeply assess it he is awesome he explains the topic clearly and have discussions at the end he explains thoroughly each point fostering discussion NA respectful, relays the material well, generous. He tries to stimulate discussion but loses the room easily interaction with students dedication to the topic and respect for the students. Never unwilling to have a discussion starting discussions; thinking differently to give different perspectives provides interesting thoughts and topics stimulating class discussion and involving students in class good vocabulary the ability to maintain the grasp on students' attention starting a good discussion; caring for the students passion in HCI; critique of interfaces good at finding flaws in designs and encouraging critique. Knowledgeable on the subject clear understanding of the course content he encourages participation not only in class but also on UR Self Serve / URcourses NA fun environment for discussion of the material NA the level of patience in elaborating the every single question asked by student and has a great knowledge about updating technology the instructor is clear in his way of teaching and he backs it up with real life examples makes the class participate in lecture and examination questions Likert Item 5 Always 4 [Mostly] 3 [Sometimes] 2 [Rarely] 1 Never Total 1.

CLICK HERE to toggle details This course more on practical aspects and gives chance to interact with other students NA Deals with real world things I enjoy the content of this course Class is slow and clear The course encourages critical thinking and forces us to examine the notion of what is a good design. As well, as point out some of the pit falls of good design NA He explains each concept profoundly Out of box thinking and the creative disscussion The topics This course helps to learn how to produce a product that is user focused The content (material) disscused in the course UI issues solving The material presented, it is interest and unique for a CS class, much appreciated Well, I am pretty bad designer and as web programmer it is necesary for me to create UI. The faults and issue, I am facing is being covered and give knowledge about how to create a respective design This course changes my thinking towards the design. Previously I didn't notice about the design, after this course, I started notice everything from designing perspective Dr. Hepting is passionate about his course work &amp; introduces new intuitive ways of teaching All the things in this course are practical and can be applied in different fields The group work has been pretty good so far Class gives in depth analysis how any one should start the UI design of the any website The content covered in the course The way instructor teachs the lesson makes it interesting The course relates to real life examples that helps me to understand how much efforts are required to build a software system Good discussion Involvement of students and professor in the class Learning the thought process of interface designing Able to learn the interaction between real world devices and humans, Also learned to see the devices with critical eyes I like the explanations given by instructor and the perception of the students which make the students to understand the project completely The website content Professor always shows us real life example that will be matching the topic that he is teaching. This makes learning interactive &amp; easy to understand Engaging students in discussions INTERACTION PRACTICALITY I was expecting some useful content. Really have to do this course just because I have already paid for it NA Feels good &amp; interactive; material &amp; notes is very easily accessible &amp; great interface to help students Participation in the class and making things funny and interesting The way instructor explain the topic is clearly with real-world example. Because of this, it become easy for the student to comprehend Well it is a good course with lots of new things to learn, Dr. Hepting treats everyone with respect and is always happy to solve our doubts NA The website which is updated by the instructor; the annotations option in URcourses the way it is designed to evaluate real world models; how there is no right or wrong answer in the exam - based on user's discretion; the video lots of video presentations are exciting to watch; relatable topics the course is mostly practical the new ideas introduced in every lecture this course gives general knowledge about the outer world; it's very interesting course content; instruction/teaching style in less time we can get more knowledge about the subjects explain with example assignments which are based on real life scenarios teacher; student interaction; teaching with good and visual examples new design related ideas like how to build a website; keeping users' perspective in mind lecture program and the subject (content) as it deals with design interface; I like learning different ways to implement interfaces in a best way this course focuses on practical knowledge rather than just focusing on theory part this course is not programming and application based, that's why I like this the organized material the best thing about this course is that it is more of practical rather than theoretical so we get to know more about things which can be helpful in the future encourages student participation and interactive I like the way of assigning the tasks (project and assignments) and the good way of teaching it encourages a user to be a good designer in every aspect of life. \\\"The user is king\\\" I like this course very much as there is a interaction between the teacher and the student the professor not only uses white board for teaching, but also videos that are informative. Moreover, interaction of students and annotation makes the student more attentive I like the content of the course. I love web designing but I never thought about interfaces in this way this course is all about design thinking and human interaction with computer and I like it the most because it encourages me to learn something new this course is very interactive and can teach you technology and its usefulness the course is helpful to understand the communication medium between system and users design thinking; interactive design and many more that prior I did not know these things so I am happy to learn them now it is interesting to learn how much an effort is kept for designing an interface NA the content of the course is so knowledgable and applicable to almost all the fields of computer science or in life explanation with example NA provides good information about the user experience the class is very interactive and real world scenarios are used for better understanding of concepts being explained NA What would you like to change about this course? CLICK HERE to toggle details Nothing NA NA I enjoy the course but I wish assignment details were better worded I've had trouble with assignment expectations Temperature in the room is sometimes too low Make the assignment descriptions a little more clear NA Nothing Nothing Less group assignments :) Nothing Easier marking schemes Theory A little less class disscusion, our class is very quiet! can slow us down Nothing much, more practical knowledge along with theory Assignments should be less slightly Class is way too crowded Items in urcourses are confusing, for example, self attendance is good but if someone forgets to do it then that day he is missing This course does not work well as a seminar style course. CS students are not normally very good at discussions and debates so there is a lot of dead air Just the some structure in the URcourse To see more examples of how the concepts have been applied in real world To be more louder Bringing more group activities with some design implementations can help having a picture of design problems of each and every student NA Everything is good for now Please provide clear instructions for assignments and also about mid term. I still do not know what materials to study for the mid-term NA In my opinion, professor provides his complete assistance so no more changes to be required Nothing Everything is good in this course, so I don't see anything that needs to be changed Maybe add PDF slide with the topics of this course NOTHING Course content has to be changed Pacing. Classes seem to move slowly. I'm usually uncertain of the main goal or take away from a given lecture A reduction in the number of assignments (overall 5 will be good); increase in the marks for individual assignments NA Nothing everything is perfect Nothing NA maybe some examples on how to do assignments nothing really - I really enjoy it good and in-depth study material to be provided; good picture quality should be uploaded on professor's website nothing I wish there was more activities to get experience of being a user and developer nothing, everything is perfect ppt or study material nothing marking criteria is very strict. Does not ensure good marks NA too many assignments NA at the time of the test we couldn't understand exactly what to prepare. Some clear guidance regarding that; And can be more loud so that everyone can follow extend time slot everything in the course is good and perfect to make class little more interesting no nothing; everything is good can be a little more competitive I would like to change the deadlines of the tasks there should be course slides for immediate follow up on class teaching activity nothing much I prefer to change regarding this course nothing! Everything is perfect it would be better if we get the slides or pdf's in a organized way. There should be proper documentation of classes nothing nothing nothing I think everything is almost OK but one thing that we need is less assignments and more time and make sure that the marker knows the concepts or subject or it would be better if the prof marks the papers or assignments himself because I think that the marker needs more guidance it would have been more interesting if it involved developing application based on the design principles NA the time of the class. I wish it could have started at 5pm or could have a different section at different timings marking scheme is strict. Even doing good does not ensure good marks NA there should be more discussion about the topics which require attention the class and its content are well structured. More study materials can be recommended for students to provide guidance just get outline/syllabus of entire course What do think are the instructor's greatest strengths? CLICK HERE to toggle details Preparation NA NA I think the instructor does a good job of answering questions his students have He is showing great effort in preparing and teaching the Class He encouages class disscussion and is willing to try to clarify where there is confusion (though sometimes he causes more confusion) NA His ability to give students an understanding about how things are Creativity and the use of words Giving lots of examples His knowledge on subject His knowledge of the course; ability to provoke disscusion Giving practical examples Presentation style; desire to improve material for students; accessability; content discussion In depth knowledge, vast experience and good communication (friendly) with students His perspective towards designing, we usually not think like he thinks towards the design His understanding of subject and implicative knowledge of the practical real world scenarios Explains questions and answer students concerns well. All the examples given in the class are practical and not some fictional things in textbook He clearly cares about the course material and good design Everytime open for suggestons and improvement His interest in the topics Make students participate in the class. Strength in the course HCC. Convincing students to have a deep thought about the implementation details Friendly Discussion - strengths, apart from that professor try to teach everything with proper and live example He is immensly knowledgable about interface design philosophy and providing relatable examples Able to communicate with students effectively Explanations; opinions about students thought process; respectful nature. Explaining concepts Professor is very practical, thats his greatest strength Using audio visual mediums such as videos INVOLVING AUDIENCE Nice and kind person treat everyone with respect patience his good personality Class discussion and involvement helps with interpreting and relating information to other classes and aspects of life Great patience; very friendly &amp; his humour is a lot relieving in class; very kind professor Communicate with students, giving respect to student Engage the student in performing task His knowledge with the course I think NA He can start discussions and encourage students to indulge in it his knowledge in showing videos and narrating his own experience in the class; uploading meeting minutes is perfect.

CLICK HERE to toggle details the instructor is so generous and kind about many things annotations the fact that it was hands on and every single aspect of the class was implemented via assignments and projects the assignments and project are well structured. The informative notes of each class and the constant use of real-life, relatable scenarios contain of the course and instructor's teaching method this course change my entire point of view for software design user interface design NA the pictures on website NA it is easy compared to other course it really helps to learn about designing interfaces NA the step by step process in completing the final project interesting topics NA I met cool people in my group project! no definitions TED talks lots of interesting videos the course has helped me to understand the basic concepts of HCI and has greatly intrigued me to study further the different aspects of HCI out of box thinking the interactiveness in the class I thought the assignment was fun and interesting his indepth knowledge mostly, viewing design and how to create it is what I liked the most the large group assignment to redesign a webpage was interesting the nature of the instructor to encourage students in participation it's fun to be a part of this class. Lots of learning towards user centric design I enjoyed the varying content as it was engaging and brought new perspectives to CS, and I enjoyed Dr. Hepting's presentation style and respect for students. Also continuous activities like website modification the way of thinking towards different system NA NA NA this course is very interactive and can gain a lot of knowledge from discussions in the class I love the way this course is laid out with the step by step approach in doing project, redesigning and discussing about various topics. Since this course is totally new to me I enjoyed the concepts and the class too assignments used in this course are real-time scenarios course content active participation that I learned about design thinking it is very interactive course it is related to everyday life. The best part is that we have to thinnk out of box NA practical knowledge which can be applied to different courses inclusion of student on and off lectures and availability of materials in a central repository created by professor class participation and materials the topics tht we covered, mainly how to design an effective website the interaction of the instructor the lectures were informative the qualitative answers of the questions responded from professor everything the instructor provides freedom of choice to students watching lots of cool video on designing, etc., group projects, video project is fun, interactive class, no right or wrong answers class participation and human centric discussions interaction with the professor it gives us a more knowledge course content, assignments, exam questions - according to study in class practical work on the project learnt many thing that are important for designing 'anything' by keeping humans feeling, emotions in mind the course content and how he relates it to his own work this course is based on logical and analytical thinking assignments and grouptasks -&gt; relevant and very productive recognition rather than recall, discussion I did not expect this course to be this informative and effective, it certainly uses more practical approach to make us learn things and helps to see the real-world interface design it's very easy to follow the course. All classes are easy to revise from the website the website and the content on the website it helps to engage real people and get user's perspective from testing results NA the best thing about the course is the content itself. Every programmer/designer should have good knowledge about the interactions between human and computers assignments are good and the class is more of practical knowledge than theoretical it gave me the full understanding of what it takes to be a good interface designer. I never knew it was a career to pursue. Now I know. course has given brief knowledge about how user interact with product/website/app creativity in designing a thing it's very interactive combination of theory and real-time project the assignment and project NA it was a fun course for a 400 elective What would you like to change about this course? CLICK HERE to toggle details it is good the way it is in almost everything; there could be a change (reduction) in the total number of assignments this subject should have lots of team activities in the class unfortunately, I came across some videos that were very good for lo-fidelity and hi-fidelity prototyping. The prof could have shared them. It'd have cleared many doubts the project should carry more marks and more emphasis should be on the project than the mid-term or exams nothing NA theory NA there should be videos of prof doing work instead of just audio NA nothing... nothing NA nothing nothing NA the final project for individual and group being due at the same time was difficult N/A group assignments / readings / making a video maybe less number of assignments that are worth more I would like to increase the span of the lecture timings more false NA the assignments were generally slightly vague and hard to interpret nothing the group project should have been real-time implementation of hi-fi prototype and also there should be testing on that instead of paper review having a seminar style course in Computer Science is a challenge. Many students do not have English as a first language so getting discussions going was hard class-strength, too crowded nothing I would like more class activities like the card sorting or board drawing of interfaces, since it promoted participation from all, even nervous people nothing NA NA NA the course is very simple, interactive, and helpful. I would prefer to choose a presentation slides which can be more helpful for the students while preparing for their exams as of now I think there is no need of changes for the course. Everything is on good front right now midterm marks can be integrated to URcourses easy grading scheme number of assignments of group task with different groups our instructor's communication is not clear enough the course is perfect. I would like not to change anything NA NA all good from professor, but the class feels a bit crowded at times can give less assignments less group work or making a member the leader so there can be more focus with what needs to be done I would suggest that tasks fir assignment should be minimal the teacher could speak faster NA nothing, everything is perfect NA more quality content, proper slides as professor's handwriting is illegible NA due dates are very close I don't think to improve anything assignments not till end. Marking should be done early (taking a lot of time to get marks) everything is good this course is already the best course NA nothing course material can be made available in documents very slow paced longer lectures, just kidding assignments are graded after a long time from the submission. Quick grading will be very helpful nothing nothing. Everything is good NA all good too many assignments the syllabus has to be defined theoretically. By this I mean the different HCI content should be covered step by step according to the book used for the course everything is on point and perfect implemenation of a application maybe the delivery at the beginning of the course N/A no recommended NA maybe make it more clear how a topic fits into the overall course. I spent most of the time wondering what I just learnt fits into a larger picture What do think are the instructor's greatest strengths?

    "text": "Group Work The mark awarded for each group assignment is shared by all group members. However, you have the ability to communicate extra information about your the performance of your group members to your group members, to the marker, and to me. For each group assignment, you are encouraged (but not required) to rate your group members by allocating 100 (or 99, in the case of a group with 3 members contributing equally) points amongst them (including yourself). Allocating points for a group assignment will provide evidence of your participation in the course. If all group members contribute equally, allocate the points equally to each group member. If you feel that all members of your group have not contributed equally, allocate the 100 points unequally and explain why you have done this. If you provide a group rating, please be thoughtful as you undertake this activity. If you decide to not provide a rating, it will be as if you had made an equal allocation of your 100 points. The points allocated to each group member are summed. The point total for each group member is divided by the largest total, to give a rating between 0.5 and 1 (any rating that is calculated to be less than 0.5 is set to 0.5). The group member who was allocated the most points will receive a rating of 1, which means 100% of the earned mark for the group assignment. If all group members have the same point total, all will receive 100% of the earned mark for the group assignment. The lowest rating allowed is 0.5 and that means the group member should receive 50% of the earned mark for the group assignment. The ratings are suggestions to me and information to you about your involvement in your group. Use the “Rate your group on…” link on URcourses, for the appropriate assignment, and use the form provided here to help you to format your submission. You can see your rating from the group in URcourses via the link labelled “See Your Rating From Group”.

    "title": "A Picture’s Worth",
    "text": "A Picture’s Worth What does the phrase “A picture is worth ten thousand words” mean to you? Does it become more or less meaningful if it was written by an advertising executive, a newspaper publisher, or an ancient sage? I embarked on an exploration into the origins of this phrase in 1999 as part of my doctoral work (A New Paradigm for Exploration in Computer-Aided Visualization). It was important for me to use the phrase correctly and so I wanted to know whether a picture was worth 1,000 or 10,000 words. Various versions of the phrase, and stories about its origin, are in circulation. This page seeks to trace its history. For their help with the original version of the page, I thank Dona Bubelis of the Seattle Public Library, Ellen Chamberlain of the University of South Carolina, and Dr. Paul Lester of California State University Fullerton ( A Picture’s Worth a Thousand Words?). In 1999, credit for the phrase seemed to belong to Frederick R. Barnard, National Advertising Manager for the Street Railways Advertising Company (offices then in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco). The maxim which is popular today seemed to originate as “One look is worth a thousand words”, and appeared in a 1921 advertisement by Barnard. He chose to modify the saying for a 1927 advertisement, where it took on its more famous form. The two advertisements appeared in the advertising trade journal called Printers’ Ink (now known as Marketing/Communications). March 10, 1927 (pp. 114-115) &ldquo;One Picture is Worth Ten Thousand Words&rdquo;. This advertisement uses the specific example of a baking soda ad campaign seemingly done by Barnard's firm. The basic message is the same as the earlier ad, though perhaps Barnard hoped it would be more compelling as a Chinese proverb. December 8, 1921 (pp. 96-97) &ldquo;One Look is Worth A Thousand Words&rdquo;. This advertisement talks generally about the benefits about advertising with pictures on street cars. Confusion between whether a picture is worth 1,000 or 10,000 words may stem from a 1948 entry in The MacMillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims and Famous Phrases ( formerly known as the The Home Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Familiar Phrases ) is an early and very informative source about the phrase. Editor Burton Egbert Stevenson made the following entry on page 2611 of that volume: One look is worth a thousand words. Fred R. Barnard, in Printers' Ink, 8 Dec., 1921, p. 96. He changed it to &ldquo;One picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; in Printers' Ink, 10 March 1927, p. 114, and called it &ldquo;a Chinese proverb&rdquo;, so that people would take it seriously. It was immediately credited to Confucious. This entry establishes the link between the two advertisements, but this source misquotes the 1927 advertisement and thereby creates “One picture is worth a thousand words”. Familiar Quotations: a collection of passages, phrases, and proverbs traced to their sources in ancient and modern literature by John Bartlett also provides information. Stevenson’s error is repeated on page 782 of the 16th edition (edited by Justin Kaplan and published by Little, Brown in 1992) where it credits “One picture is worth a thousand words” as a misattributed “Chinese proverb” and references part of the entry from the 1948 edition edited by Stevenson. “Nice guys finish seventh”: false phrases, spurious sayings, and familiar misquotations by Ralph Keyes and published in 1992 by HarperCollins has a similar account to that of Stephenson. Keyes, however, adds his own twists to the story because the phrase “One picture is worth a thousand words” does not appear anywhere in the 1921 ad: Calling an orphan saying a Chinese proverb gives it a cachet with very little risk that its actual source will be discovered. A deliberate exploitation of this syndrome involved the proverb `One picture is worth a thousand words.' This saying first appeared in a 1921 ad in Printer's Ink [sic] which was written by publicist Frederick Barnard. Barnard headlined his ad `One look is worth a thousand words.' He attributed this maxim to `a famous Japanese philosopher.' Six years later, Barnard revised the saying to read `One picture is worth ten thousand words,' and then republished it in the same magazine as a `Chinese proverb.' Barnard thought his ploy would give his words added weight. He was right. For a time, Bartlett's identified Barnard's line as `a Chinese proverb.' Other sources attributed his proverb to Confucius. The Macmillan Dictionary of Quotations had it both ways. They cited Barnard as the maxim's author, adding `Ascribed to Chinese origin.' Keyes’ book identified several rules of misquotation and the one of which he and several others have been guilty he calls numbernesia: getting the words right but the numbers wrong. The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase, Saying, and Quotation is one reference which has the correct attribution (but without any of the story). The phrase has endured to become an American proverb, appearing on page 465 of A Dictionary of American Proverbs, edited by Mieder, Kingsbury, and Harder and published by the Oxford University Press in 1992. Current opinion would remove Mr. Barnard from the picture (pun intended). There is now a wikipedia article entitled “A picture is worth a thousand words” that is focused much more broadly than this page. In updating this page, I came across a wonderful account of the history of this expression written by William Safire for his column On Language for the New York Times Magazine. Worth a Thousand Words was published on 7 April 1996. If you have more information about the origins of this quotation (or the stories that surround it), please send me e-mail and I will update this page accordingly.

    "text": "Knowledge Areas Algorithms and Complexity (AL) Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software engineering. The real-world performance of any software system depends on: (1) the algorithms chosen and (2) the suitability and efficiency of the various layers of implementation. Good algorithm design is therefore crucial for the performance of all software systems. Moreover, the study of algorithms provides insight into the intrinsic nature of the problem as well as possible solution techniques independent of programming language, programming paradigm, computer hardware, or any other implementation aspect. An important part of computing is the ability to select algorithms appropriate to particular purposes and to apply them, recognizing the possibility that no suitable algorithm may exist. This facility relies on understanding the range of algorithms that address an important set of welldefined problems, recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, and their suitability in particular contexts. Efficiency is a pervasive theme throughout this area. This knowledge area defines the central concepts and skills required to design, implement, and analyze algorithms for solving problems. Algorithms are essential in all advanced areas of computer science: artificial intelligence, databases, distributed computing, graphics, networking, operating systems, programming languages, security, and so on. Algorithms that have specific utility in each of these are listed in the relevant knowledge areas. Cryptography, for example, appears in the new Knowledge Area on Information Assurance and Security (IAS), while parallel and distributed algorithms appear the Knowledge Area in Parallel and Distributed Computing (PD). As with all knowledge areas, the order of topics and their groupings do not necessarily correlate to a specific order of presentation. Different programs will teach the topics in different courses and should do so in the order they believe is most appropriate for their students. Basic Analysis &starf; &starf; Core &starf; Core AL / Basic Analysis Topics Learning Outcomes Algorithmic Strategies &starf; &starf; Core &starf; Core AL / Algorithmic Strategies Topics Learning Outcomes Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms &starf; &starf; Core &starf; Core AL / Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms Topics Learning Outcomes Basic Automata, Computability and Complexity &starf; &starf; Core &starf; Core AL / Basic Automata, Computability and Complexity Topics Learning Outcomes Advanced Computational Complexity Elective AL / Advanced Computational Complexity Topics Learning Outcomes Advanced Automata Theory and Computability Elective AL / Advanced Automata Theory and Computability Topics Learning Outcomes Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, and Analysis Elective AL / Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, and Analysis Topics Learning Outcomes Architecture and Organization (AR) Computing professionals should not regard the computer as just a black box that executes programs by magic. The knowledge area Architecture and Organization builds on Systems Fundamentals (SF) to develop a deeper understanding of the hardware environment upon which all computing is based, and the interface it provides to higher software layers. Students should acquire an understanding and appreciation of a computer system’s functional components, their characteristics, performance, and interactions, and, in particular, the challenge of harnessing parallelism to sustain performance improvements now and into the future. Students need to understand computer architecture to develop programs that can achieve high performance through a programmer’s awareness of parallelism and latency. In selecting a system to use, students should be able to understand the tradeoff among various components, such as CPU clock speed, cycles per instruction, memory size, and average memory access time. The learning outcomes specified for these topics correspond primarily to the core and are intended to support programs that elect to require only the minimum 16 hours of computer architecture of their students. For programs that want to teach more than the minimum, the same AR topics can be treated at a more advanced level by implementing a two-course sequence. For programs that want to cover the elective topics, those topics can be introduced within a two-course sequence and/or be treated in a more comprehensive way in a third course.

Interaction between users and computational artefacts occurs at an interface that includes both software and hardware. Thus interface design impacts the software life-cycle in that it should occur early; the design and implementation of core functionality can influence the user interface — for better or worse. Because it deals with people as well as computational systems, as a knowledge area HCI demands the consideration of cultural, social, organizational, cognitive and perceptual issues. Consequently it draws on a variety of disciplinary traditions, including psychology, ergonomics, computer science, graphic and product design, anthropology and engineering Foundations &starf; &starf; Core HCI / Foundations Motivation For end-users, the interface is the system. So design in this domain must be interaction-focused and human-centered. Students need a different repertoire of techniques to address this than is provided elsewhere in the curriculum. Topics Contexts for HCI (anything with a user interface, e.g., webpage, business applications, mobile applications, and games)&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Processes for user-centered development, e.g., early focus on users, empirical testing, iterative design&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Different measures for evaluation, e.g., utility, efficiency, learnability, user satisfaction&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Usability heuristics and the principles of usability testing&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Physical capabilities that inform interaction design, e.g., color perception, ergonomics&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Cognitive models that inform interaction design, e.g., attention, perception and recognition, movement, and memory; gulfs of expectation and execution&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Social models that inform interaction design, e.g., culture, communication, networks and organizations&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Principles of good design and good designers; engineering tradeoffs&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Accessibility, e.g., interfaces for differently-abled populations (e.g., blind, motion-impaired)&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Interfaces for differently-aged population groups (e.g., children, 80+)&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Learning Outcomes Discuss why human-centered software development is important.

[Familiarity]&nbsp; Detail the processes of design appropriate to specific design orientations. [Familiarity]&nbsp; Apply a variety of design methods to a given problem. [Usage]&nbsp; Information Management (IM) one two Platform-Based Development (PBD) one two Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) While technical issues are central to the computing curriculum, they do not constitute a complete educational program in the field. Students must also be exposed to the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of the relevant social, ethical, legal and professional issues. This need to incorporate the study of these non-technical issues into the ACM curriculum was formally recognized in 1991, as can be seen from the following excerpt [2] Undergraduates also need to understand the basic cultural, social, legal, and ethical issues inherent in the discipline of computing. They should understand where the discipline has been, where it is, and where it is heading. They should also understand their individual roles in this process, as well as appreciate the philosophical questions, technical problems, and aesthetic values that play an important part in the development of the discipline.Students also need to develop the ability to ask serious questions about the social impact of computing and to evaluate proposed answers to those questions. Future practitioners must be able to anticipate the impact of introducing a given product into a given environment. Will that product enhance or degrade the quality of life? What will the impact be upon individuals, groups, and institutions?Finally, students need to be aware of the basic legal rights of software and hardware vendors and users, and they also need to appreciate the ethical values that are the basis for those rights. Future practitioners must understand the responsibility that they will bear, and the possible consequences of failure. They must understand their own limitations as well as the limitations of their tools. All practitioners must make a longterm commitment to remaining current in their chosen specialties and in the discipline of computing as a whole. As technological advances continue to significantly impact the way we live and work, the critical importance of social issues and professional practice continues to increase; new computer-based products and venues pose ever more challenging problems each year. It is our students who must enter the workforce and academia with intentional regard for the identification and resolution of these problems. Computer science educators may opt to deliver this core and elective material in stand-alone courses, integrated into traditional technical and theoretical courses, or as special units in capstone and professional practice courses. The material in this familiarity area is best covered through a combination of one required course along with short modules in other courses. On the one hand, some units listed as Core Tier-1 (in particular, Social Context, Analytical Tools, Professional Ethics, and Intellectual Property) do not readily lend themselves to being covered in other traditional courses. Without a standalone course, it is difficult to cover these topics appropriately. On the other hand, if ethical and social considerations are covered only in the standalone course and not “in context,” it will reinforce the false notion that technical processes are void of these other relevant issues. Because of this broad relevance, it is important that several traditional courses include modules with case studies that analyze the ethical, legal, social and professional considerations in the context of the technical subject matter of the course. Courses in areas such as software engineering, databases, computer networks, information assurance and security, and introduction to computing provide obvious context for analysis of ethical issues. However, an ethics-related module could be developed for almost any course in the curriculum. It would be explicitly against the spirit of the recommendations to have only a standalone course. Running through all of the issues in this area is the need to speak to the computing practitioner’s responsibility to proactively address these issues by both moral and technical actions. The ethical issues discussed in any class should be directly related to and arise naturally from the subject matter of that class. Examples include a discussion in the database course of data aggregation or data mining, or a discussion in the software engineering course of the potential conflicts between obligations to the customer and obligations to the user and others affected by their work. Programming assignments built around applications such as controlling the movement of a laser during eye surgery can help to address the professional, ethical and social impacts of computing. Computing faculty who are unfamiliar with the content and/or pedagogy of applied ethics are urged to take advantage of the considerable resources from ACM, IEEE-CS, SIGCAS (special interest group on computers and society), and other organizations. It should be noted that the application of ethical analysis underlies every subsection of this Social and Professional knowledge area in computing. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) provides guidelines that serve as the basis for the conduct of our professional work. The General Moral Imperatives provide an understanding of our commitment to personal responsibility, professional conduct, and our leadership roles.",

    "text": "Funding NSERC Discovery Grants Personalization of interaction based on discovered constructs (2012-2016) Summary Eyewitness identification is often highly regarded by the legal system, yet it is not always accurate. An identification may be compromised if the words used to describe the target face impair the witness' memory of that face (verbal overshadowing) or if the witness sees so many photos that he or she may identify a photo as the target face when it is actually similar to one of the early photos viewed (inaccurate source attribution). Faces of a race different than the witness may cause additional difficulties (cross-race effect). In order to improve the accuracy of eyewitness identification, these sources of inaccuracies must be mitigated. Verbal overshadowing may be addressed by using only non-verbal means to ask for recognition, rather than recall, of the target face. Inaccurate source attribution may be ameliorated by reducing the number of candidate photos presented to a witness. In order to meaningfully achieve this reduction, it is necessary to understand how a particular witness judges similarity between photos so that a computer-based presentation can be personalized accordingly. My research to date indicates that people employ one of at least two different strategies when judging facial similarities. I seek to democratize accurate identification of faces by: understanding the different strategies that people may use to judge facial similarity; developing a concise means of testing which strategy a witness is likely to apply; developing a computer interface that makes use of a witness' identified strategy to allow accurate identification of the target face, while viewing as few candidate photos as possible; and developing an extensible system to manage and store candidate photos for use with the interface. My research to date has used a set of 356 photos (178 Caucasian and 178 First Nations to allow for examination of cross-race effect), which participants have sorted based on how they each judge similarity. This work will contribute to eyewitness identification by providing better tools for witnesses and by providing a basis for understanding which faces may be more or less easy to identify. The same techniques can be used to study interaction with fractal images, which has applications for democratization of multimedia composition. &nbsp; Democratization and personalization for information access (2006-2010) Summary Computer software should conform to its users and not the other way around. Although this phrase is often repeated, it seems to carry little weight today: users are regularly told of the need to use standard processes and software. My research explores an alternative view: let software deal with each user on their own terms and then let it manage the translation of each user's work into the terms of the others with whom he or she needs to collaborate. Democratization means that any user will be able to have satisfying and meaningful interactions and explorations of their chosen problem domains. Personalization means that each user is able to interact with the tool in a way that mirrors his or her own concept of the problem. Knowledge acquisition techniques will be used to discover each user's concept of a problem without requiring its explicit naming with a possibly unfamiliar vocabulary. User experiences will be more satisfying, hence more helpful to democratization, if the personalization phase can be as short as possible. I have developed applications in the areas of information visualization, recipe browsing, environmental decision support systems, eyewitness identification, and multimedia composition. I am seeking techniques to understand, as directly and as efficiently as possible, how any given individual conceives of a problem. I plan to take this understanding or knowledge and make it available for manipulation by that individual through my software, called cogito. This interface is intended to allow and support a user's exploration of that information, enabling him or her to manage and even transform the space (by changing the order in which decisions are made, for example) until the desired results are obtained. People will bring their diverse applications or problems to the cogito system and they will have satisfying experiences exploring them. Technology can, I believe, be more powerfully used when it augments individuals seeking personally-creative solutions and helps those individuals to communicate those ideas to others. &nbsp; Conceptual spaces: theory and tools (2002-2005) Summary In 1960, J. C. R. Licklider looked to a time when humans and computers would work in intimate association and saw it as being \"intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind.\" Back then, Licklider found that up to 85% of his \"’thinking’ time was devoted mainly to activities that were essentially clerical or mechanical ... operations that can be performed more effectively by machines than by men.\" Although many of these tasks are now done by computers, many software programs still keep their users from their work by requiring them to be tooinvolved in clerical or mechanical details. In an era when so much is done by computers, humans are still needed to deal with the problems that require their personal creative input. These problems are harder to deal with, and as such only experts are likely to tackle them. My research focuses on developing appropriate computer-based tools to support the experts in working on these problems, and to encourage more participation from more people in exploring and evaluating alternative solutions to these hard problems. The tools in which I am particularly interested use visual interfaces to remove the requirement of computer expertise from their users and to explore and evaluate all the available solutions. Such interfaces address the problem when a user, searching for a solution, says \"I’ll know it when I see it\" but has no other way to specify it. The notion of a conceptual space, defined with the help of a programmer, is a way for the user to build a vocabulary to talk about his or her problem. In this way, my work seeks to change the relationship between users and programmers rather than put programmers out of work. To develop these tools, I will rely on the study of software users to refine my own software and ideas. Widespread acceptance and use of this type of tool will go a long way to realizing Licklider’s vision, meaning that computer use will become more productive and more rewarding.",

    "text": "Inspirations In short, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with (other) enthusiasts for artificial intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant future of cerebration to machines alone. There will nevertheless be a fairly long interim during which the main intellectual advances will be made by men and computers working together in intimate association. A multidisciplinary study group, examining future research and development problems of the [United States] Air Force, estimated that it would be 1980 before developments in artificial intelligence make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving of military significance. That would leave, say, five years to develop man-computer symbiosis and fifteen years to use it. The fifteen may be ten or five hundred, but those years should be intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind. &nbsp; J. C. R. Licklider in Man-Computer Symbiosis, 1960 &nbsp; When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe. &nbsp; John Muir in My First Summer in the Sierra, 1911 &nbsp; There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, &lsquo;Morning, boys, how's the water?&rsquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, &lsquo;What the hell is water?&rsquo; &nbsp; David Foster Wallace in This is Water, 2005 &nbsp; When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again. &nbsp; Steve Jobs in Video interview from Santa Clara Valley Historical Association, 1995 &nbsp; In our culture we spend a lot of time with the how.

However, you have the ability to communicate extra information about your group members’ performance to your group members, to the marker, and to me. For each group assignment, you are encouraged to allocate 100 points amongst your group members (including yourself). The place to do this is a link in URcourses labelled something like “Submit Group Rating”, just below the link for the assignment that you have just submitted. If all group members contribute equally, you would distribute the points equally to each group member. If some group members contribute more or less than others, you would reflect this in the amount of points allocated to each group member. Please undertake this activity responsibly and explain why you have not allocated points equally. The total points that you allocate amongst your group members should equal 100. If a group member does not providing a rating, their allocation of points is taken as equal. However, allocating points for each portion of group work will provide evidence of your participation. The points allocated to each group member are summed. The point sum for each group member is divided by the largest sum, so the group member who was allocated the most points will receive the full mark earned for the assignment. If all group members were allocated the same number of points, all will receive the full mark earned for the assignment. The lowest rating allowed is 0.5, even if the calculated would be lower. You can see your rating from the group in URcourses via the entry labelled “See Your Rating From Group”. The value available there corresponds to the “Computed Rating from Group” in the examples below. Following the examples, a calculator form is provided.

The celebration was originally planned for November 3, close to the birthdate, but circumstances dictated a change in plans. Now we will celebrate the 50th birthday of the Computer Science Department along with the 112th birthday of Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, computer pioneer and Basterfield Lecturer from November 1974 by moving the date to Thursday, December 6, 2018 — part of CSEdWeek 2018, which was established to recognize Admiral Hopper’s birthday (December 9). #UR50CS Facebook Event Blog",

    "title": "Teaching Philosophy",
    "text": "Philosophy Short version Challenge my students to think deeply and behave ethically. (inspired by the story of Martina Fitzgerald’s recollections about Gord Downey and their high school English teacher[for good measure, on web.archive.org]) Longer version My objectives as a teacher are simple. I seek to: inspire students to see that the subject itself is worthy of study and critical reflection and not just for a good mark in the course. To this end, I often share with students the following excerpt of a commencement speech given by David Foster Wallace: “There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, ‘Morning, boys, how’s the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, ‘What the hell is water?’”. I encourage students to ask “why?” as well as “how?”. provide students with application knowledge of the subject, that goes beyond rote knowledge. I seek to use current examples that we discuss and work through together. make a connection with every student. I know that in any class, there will be those who will pass or fail despite whatever I may do. I also know that in each class there are people with whom I can make a difference and for them especially, I create a friendly atmosphere that is supportive of learning. provide a concrete structure for students in terms of well-defined expectations and within this structure; I work to find opportunities for innovation. encourage my students to take responsibility for their classroom experience respect and honour the perspective of each student “The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life” is the title of a book written by Parker J. Palmer. I can see myself when Palmer writes that “most of us arrive at a sense of self and vocation only after a long journey through alien lands”. Palmer also writes that “good teaching cannot be reduced to technique; good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher”. As I progress on my own journey, I have been able to take these words to heart. I remain open to new alternatives for the design of my course meetings and I appreciate Palmer’s use of paradoxes to design teaching and learning spaces that: are bounded and open; are hospitable and “charged”; invite the voice of the individual and the voice of the group; honour the “little” stories of the students and the “big” stories of the disciplines and tradition; support solitude and surround it with the resources of the community; and welcome both silence and speech. I love teaching. My goal is to “challenge my students to think deeply and behave ethically”. In order to assess my success in achieving this goal I use my own instrument to collect student evaluations of my teaching (to get formative feedback at midterm and summative feedback at the end of term). However I have understood my limitations, I have worked to get past them. As I have understood the concept of a growth mindset, I have worked to adopt it. Carol Dweck, who conducted the research and developed the concept, gave a wonderful presentation: “The Power of Believing That You Can Improve”. Steve Jobs, in a 1995 interview from the Santa Clara Valley Historical Association, demonstrates a growth mindset: “When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you’re life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.” In my experience, vulnerability (see Brené Brown on “The Power of Vulnerability”) and confidence are required. In “How to Build Your Creative Confidence”, David Kelley connects the two. I don’t know when, or if, any student will the attach adjective “good” to my teaching, but I know that my journey is on the right path.",

    "text": "Three public events take place on December 9 at Simon Fraser University at Harbour Centre, 515 West Hastings Street. For more information or to reserve seats at the lecture, call 291-5100. An exhibition of art based on mathematical principles and ideas. Fractals, more so than other areas of mathematics, are visually exciting in a very real way. Fractals are a language with which to describe the geometry of nature. Images of fractals can be an important access to mathematics and surrounding philosophical questions. Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Teck Gallery (Room 1305). Interactive computer displays for visitors to experiment with making their own fractal designs; investigate E-Gems, a project to design math and science electronic games (Counting on Frank, one of their products, was chosen by PC Magazine as one of the top 100 CD-ROMs for 1995); and check out the math education and art resources available on the Internet. Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Segal Centre (Room 1430). Ingenious mathematical amateurs. It is possible for someone without formal credentials to make contributions to mathematics. Well-known artist M.C. Escher and unknown homemaker Marjorie Rice both tackled mathematical problems, developing unorthodox notation that was essential to their methodical investigations. Each worked alone, essentially in secret, rewarded by the exhilaration of finding answers to a large puzzle. Lecture by Dr. Doris Schattschneider, Professor (Emerita) of Mathematics, Moravian College. 5 &dash; 6 pm in the Fletcher Challenge Canada Theatre (Room 1900). We'd like to thank our sponsors, Simon Fraser University, the Canadian Mathematical Society, and the British Columbia Ministry of Employment and Investment. The fractal on this postcard is Fiery Dragon (1990), by Daryl H. Hepting.",
