Outline for Today Concluding Thoughts Zoom Chat from Meeting 11h09 DHH: Greetings. I’m here early today. I hope that you are well and ready for the new semester. We will start at 11:30. 11h29 S02: Hello S03: hello! 11h30 S04: hello..! S05: hello S05: good morning ! S06: Hello 11h31 S07: Good morning ! S08: Hello All 11h35 S02: Just asking, CS428 is still not showing on my urcourse, am I the only one？ S09: I also do not have it S10: I have it S11: might be. as I have it on mine. S12: It shows for me DHH: I have the chat window uo, but please raise your hand if you would like to speak or have a question. 11h36 S11: right 11h44 S10: I'm not aware of anyone, but I don't know anyone else in this class :| S13: there is a 0% complete bar on the dashboard 11h45 S13: under the course 11h46 DHH: https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084 S13: it's fine I have access so I guess it doesn't matter. DHH: OK 11h47 S11: no S14: No S02: No S15: No I think it is accessible S16: No S17: No S05: the course is under past courses fall 2019 S18: I see it under past courses 12h00 S05: yes I agree with that 12h03 DHH: Do you prefer Wikipedia’s use of chevrons (^, v) to mine (&gt;,v) 12h04 S13: Yours works S02: Im thinking this one is good enough... S14: Wikipedia S07: I prefer yours S19: Yours 12h05 S15: Yours S04: yours S02: Yours S11: in my opinion as long as it is consistent in a group of chevrons and makes sense, users gets use to it. S10: I would prefer to use a symbol like '-' for folded. and then use a down-arrow for unfolded. or '+' for folded, and '-' for unfolded. 12h06 S05: - and + easy to understand 12h08 S17: To me, it's because it's like it's the 'direction' that the relevant content is going to move, with the right arrow that direction doesn't match the arrow in that layout at least 12h09 S11: it works on mobile device S12: To me its more intuitive, the v mean to drop down(expand) the content and then the ^ means the opposite to condense the content upwards S15: https://www.wikipedia.org we can see chevrons here 12h10 S13: I think Wikipedia way works is because it follows conventional logic. So does the + and - symbols. S13: by testing 12h11 S17: Also, theoretically, up and down arrows are more universal, where a right arrow would be pointing 'backwards' in right-to-left languages S10: I think intuitiveness in interface comes from the existence of real worldanalogues S05: users response or users understanding S20: Familiarity. S21: From experience over time S14: It is coming from the day to day life S03: Intuition comes from past experiences and what we expect from them? S12: I think partly from past experiences. 12h12 S07: I think intuition is developed from user knowledge, understanding and experience S11: general understanding S09: maybe something like instinct, i.e. liking shiny things from once relating that to water 12h16 S11: exactly. 12h19 S14: yes we can S13: it's on S22: We can hear S23: I can hear her S09: yeah I can hear you S21: I can hear you 12h20 S02: We can hear you 12h21 S10: I like verbal discussions, but also I like chat discussions since you never miss your chance to reply to something you're interested. I remember especially during the classes, we would get some pretty heated discussions, but the conversation needed to be cutoff so class could continue. We had forums, but once we were out of class, we didn't necessarily maintain the same passion for it later. 12h22 S11: thank you guys for the response 12h44 S11: thank you 12h45 S02: Thank you and you too S24: Thank you! S09: bye :) S23: Thank you sir S21: Thanks= S08: Thank you prof S05: thank you !! S06: Thank You S25: Thank you. Bye S15: Have a good day , sir S26: Thank You!

Outline for Today Concluding Thoughts Transcript from Meeting http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h27 11h27 Audio DHH: So can everyone hear me all right? Come on yeses. Okay. How's everyone doing today? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h29 11h29 Audio DHH: So just as we're getting people into the meeting, Maybe you didn't hear the notice about this meeting being recorded. In my own attempt to record last day's meeting, my recording cut out partway through and I've been experimenting with zoom to have it produce a transcript, so that a transcript is available of each meeting. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h33 11h33 Chat S01: I can't hear you. is it just me who is having this problem ? S02: Same here S03: Same I can't hear either S04: No I can’t as well http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h34 11h34 Chat S05: Last thing I heard was about the potential of a transcript for the class? S01: yes S05: yep S02: yes S03: Yes I can hear now Audio DHH: To begin with, you can see beside my name in the list of participants is a little cloud with a dot on it that says it's recording. So the idea is that we can have an audio recording and a transcript of it for each meeting. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h35 11h35 Audio DHH: Alright, so there are lots of things going on here. What I want to do first of all is to start sharing my screen and we can look at the (my) website for this course. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h36 11h36 Chat DHH: As we get people into the meeting, a reminder that the meeting is being recorded so that we can have audio and a transcript of the meeting. I will not keep your names in the transcript of the meeting. Audio DHH: Alright, so here's the updated version that should be published on the public website soon. This screen is from the chat recorded during Thursday's meeting. I'm experimenting with the display so you can let me know what you think. So DHH, that's me. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h37 11h37 Chat S05: There was a prompt when entering into the meeting that it was begin recorded. Audio DHH: In case you're wondering, the DHH is Daryl H. Hepting. You can call me Daryl or Dr. Hepting [or, as Zoom transcribed it, Dr. Happening], but I'd like you to pick one of those two. So this is the way that I presented the chat and anything that was sent to me privately has been excluded. The identifiers are consistent throughout the chat session. For example, any contribution from the student who typed 'hello!' at 11h29 during Thursday's meeting will be labelled as S03. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h38 11h38 Audio DHH: We can keep track of people, but not by names. This is a good thing or a bad thing in different situations. It is an example of a tradeoff. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h40 11h40 Chat DHH: Any thoughts about the display of the chat transcript? Audio DHH: Student, who points out that everyone should have gotten a note that the meeting is recorded, I just wanted to let you know why I'm recording it. We are not going to share (I'm not going to share the video with you) but I'll make the audio recording available and accessible. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h41 11h41 Chat S05: You aren't displaying the transcript, just the info for today's lecture. Audio DHH: Then I can also get a transcript of the audio and the zoom text chat for each meeting. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h42 11h42 Chat S07: No S01: not on display S08: no S09: if you record through zoom, it only records the screen shared part S03: Can't see it here. I had to go to the site to see it http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h43 11h43 Chat S07: your website S01: screen to the meetings, information, assignment page S10: We can see the cs428 website and chrome. S05: CS 428+828 in 202030 is the title http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h45 11h45 Chat S05: Yep S08: yes S01: yes Audio DHH: OK, so now it makes sense that I can ask a question again about any thoughts about the display the chat transcript. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h46 11h46 Chat S07: yes S11: Yes S02: Yes S12: yes S13: yes Audio DHH: Okay. I think we have everybody in the room now. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h47 11h47 Chat S05: It looks good. Only some comments lack context. Audio DHH: A couple of comments and chat transcripts. Let me say a few things about recording the screen. I'm not interested in the video recording. Maybe I will look at it and see if it's possibly helpful. But that's not my reason for recording. My reason for recording is the audio and the automatic transcript generation. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h48 11h48 Chat S14: This looks better, but when you want to evaluate class interaction of the students and give them grades. At that time, providing students first/last name in chat transcript, would help you in evaluation S01: with time stamps in blocks, i think it will be a lengthy document Audio DHH: Although the documentation says that the transcript will be ready shortly after the video is ready. But in my case, with the tests that I did on Thursday and Friday. It was a long time. Hours. So maybe you can expect to see the transcript of the audio tomorrow, sometime. So when we have a transcript of the audio, it might be helpful for the audio transcript to give context to the chat so you can see what things are going on. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h49 11h49 Chat S07: transcript is missing the actual student names Audio DHH: And so regarding the de-identified students, I was thinking of doing some editing on the chat transcript. But then I thought to let it go ahead and be an 'accurate' representation of what happened. So, if a few people wrote 'hello' and one person wrote 'good morning' at 11h30 on Thursday, http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h50 11h50 Audio DHH: then I would just be fine to represent that. So I'm making the public version of this chat transcript available to help start class discussions. I still have the names of people who contributed even though the actual names have been removed from the public transcript. This seems like it could be a helpful feature. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h52 11h52 Chat DHH: No student names is a feature, but I have them still in the raw data S07: This seems great . Good to know S14: Sounds good! Audio DHH: We can close parts of the transcript as well. And what about the times? Is it better to represent the passage of time? This is something to think about. Could we increase the usefulness of this transcript in terms of the timestamps? Would it be helpful to have a visual representation of the passage of time? http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h53 11h53 Audio DHH: So there is activity at 11h29 and then a gap until 11h33 then activity each minute until 11h38. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h54 11h54 Chat S05: Instead of time, have question that prompted the responses S12: Yes it will keep the track of topic of discussion S15: How about we just skip the time when we had no responses or chats? Helps in optimizing Audio DHH: So instead of time stamps, perhaps the question that prompted the responses? I think that's a worthy goal to be able to have that connection. It may be a little bit hard to do. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h55 11h55 Chat S16: I think having the time is still important, cuz then you can go and get the context within the video and see if something is missing. S10: It feels like some are close together, could group close ones together since they will be on similar topics. Like group ones that are 2 or less minutes apart maybe. Though they open easy so we can infer that ourselves as well. If the questions grouping are easy to implement I support that option as well that's helpful for context. S01: it will be complex to have the topic from the audio. but if questions were put in chat, that the convenient way Audio DHH: I'm going to hope that the transcript will help provide that context, by grouping together things that happened at the same time. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h56 11h56 Chat S07: I think it will be good to have it in standard time format HH:MM:SS. It seems to be more descriptive. Audio DHH: I didn't. I thought that it might be helpful to have some grouping of them. Rather than just have each each timestamp, comment, or chat message on its own. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h57 11h57 Chat S07: Oh sorry I did not mean to include SS . I mean to have it in standard time format like HH:MM S17: Maye we can change the way we formulate the question in the chat, students can take the extra effort of using Q1) and then post it, people can answer or discuss on it. It would be easy to group it then? Audio DHH: Think about how to use this transcript, and we can talk about it some more on Thursday. How can we use this data, or how can this data be made as helpful as possible? \" http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#11h59 11h59 Chat S02: If we include the question that raises the responses then it will be same as the forum nit the chat. I think time is important to include in the chat and subject to the response can be added before replying to the chat. S02: not* Audio DHH: So, if you're going to say that you want to do X then what kind of interface supports X? What do you think of that question? Think about for next day. How could you present the chat data so that it is as helpful as possible? \" http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#12h00 12h00 Chat S17: That seems a fair point. DHH: To think about for next day, how could you present the chat data so that it is as helpful as possible? S14: What I think is it might be very difficult to track question numbers for students, sometimes we end up mentioning wrong question number and it can introduce challenges for the person who is referring the chat later Audio DHH: Is that enough information? So something that happens happening here is that there's a delay in the chat. Answers coming up on the chat are responses to something typed (much) earlier. Chat is an asynchronous communication form. And that's both positive and negative because we have to try and put things back together in terms of a thread. http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#12h01 12h01 Audio DHH: \" But that's not unlike doing an interview instant messaging. in some form or another. Say, somebody person you're talking to. Two different questions before you can answer the first question. And maybe still want to talk about the first question. Before In more than one message before you get to question two. And so it seems to be not very hard to To have things to verge of it. \" http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#12h02 12h02 Chat S01: there is always a delay between putting our thoughts in words and the upcoming messages on chat S16: If you could have the audio/video/transcript in a box nearby, and the timestamps linked directly to the part the class where it happened, that would help a lot Audio DHH: \" The Transcript the audio at the same Together in a similar format. With The chat. I have a feeling \" http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/meetings/02_Tue-08-Sep-2020.html#12h03 12h03 Chat S12: I agree with Farial that it happens most of time S14: May be, professor can add the chat title for each meeting chat transcript, and a brief introduction about topic being covered and what understanding can be gained. After that, time title can be a good choice. This both things may help to refer chat transcript later Audio DHH: \" Okay, so I'm going to work on presenting for Thursday my Homework will be to format the audio transcript. In In a way similar to the To the chat transcript. I have a suspicion, though. The timestamp and the video is From the beginning of the recording not Not Not the time of day that Is being used in the chat.

S09: yes 11h56 S10: In general, the mobile websites of things that have apps are terrible because they you to download the app S10: they want you* 11h57 S11: Bad experience: Went to cineplex where I was buying tickets from self serve kiosk the touch response is very poor user can't use scroll functionality. DHH: What is a memorable (good or bad) interface experience? 11h58 S12: I went to Walmart in North Battleford, and during the self checkout experience, and all through the store, screens with cameras on them are shoved in the face. It feels like not welcome there. S09: the article site where the ad repeatedly appears after every few lines. S11: Bad experience: Went to cineplex where I was buying tickets from self serve kiosk the touch response is very poor user can't use scroll functionality. There is only tap S13: Bad interface. 11h59 S14: A good experience I've had recently so its on my mind is getting used to the ArcMap GIS software. An interesting thing it does is data files cant be dragged around projects directly, must be explicitly cut/copy pasted to help prevent users from making mistakes and accidentally breaking their file structure for the project which would do Bad Things. I thought that was a good design moment. 12h00 S15: Grocery website: always provided me the results of unrelated items unless the same keyword in not inserted. It had a VERY BAD SEARCHING ALGORITHM which failed most of the times S16: I tried enhanced version of Microsoft Teams meetings which was released in back July. It came with new features like large gallery view, together mode etc. It was pretty cool. S02: A good user interface.. recently I used a app name ‘world remit’ which has a pretty good interface with nice user experience …. DHH: Was it easy to discover the proper way to do things? 12h01 S17: A good experience for me was GitBook. I use it to take notes and the interface was vey easy to use/understand how to do things. S18: I like the new UOFR Webmail interface. New interface is user friendly and easier to locate folders etc. S01: The interface of checkout at HomeDepot is pretty Bad, it takes 5-6 seconds to show the scanned item on the page which is a pretty bad link between the database and the front end. Even the touch response is not great. S19: Bad experience with UR Courses. Sometimes when you log in, then it would show us the desktop image if any random course and then again we have to back to log in page and refresh the site. 12h08 S12: Another thing I hate, is it seems like finding pricing for modern websites is a chore. A recent example is DoNotPay, where they didn't show the price until I was at the step of signing up. 12h09 S12: If they can't be honest with your payment methods, it makes me suspicious. So of course I didn't sign up. 12h12 S09: it only takes one option for the radio buttons 12h14 DHH: I’ll edit the poll. What is the “other”? S11: Google meet S12: Slack 12h15 S15: Slate 12h16 S05: Microsoft teams 12h26 S04: Skype does not work on my Mac too. If somehow I get connected then there is always problem with either video or audio. it is not easy to chat and talk at the same time 12h28 S02: But Skype does work on my Mac. But ya that’s true I face connection problem during audio and video chat… 12h29 S12: I'd prefer to watch on my own. S20: post the link then discuss about it on our session S11: Agree with Dr Hepting about invert class rooms. S17: Same I'd rather the links be posted so we can watch whenever. 12h30 S04: I agree S09: not seen the video yet S13: Yes 12h31 S20: Saw it S21: yes saw it 12h37 S09: -++ 12h41 S12: It's efinitely not optimal :p 12h44 S21: yeah especially since ur input was right S11: yes 12h46 S01: Thank you professor S09: thank you. enjoy the weekend.

    "title": "Newspaper Copy that People Must Read",
    "text": "Newspaper Copy that People Must Read ADVERTISING’S RELATION TO THE GROWTH OF READING ABILITY — THE THUNDERSTORM AND “YELLOW” JOURNALISM — AN EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF COMPARISON IN WRITING By Arthur Brisbane. [NOTE. — The following are extracts from an address by Mr. Brisbane, editor of the New York Evening Journal, before the Syracuse (N. Y.) Advertising Club.] Advertising men should remember with pride and satisfaction that this is the first generation that can read. When I was a boy on the farm the servant that could read was the exception. I had a colored servant recently who could neither read nor write, but his brother was valedictorian at college. The person who cannot read now is almost a curiosity. Advertising men represent our speech on a big scale. Publicity, advertising, is to the human race what speech is to the individual. For many ages man lived with out speech. The individuals learned by experience and then died, and the next had to learn all over again. Then man acquired the art of speech, and the art of printing and finally the art of reading. Newspapers are in their infancy — they have only just begun. The most difficult and the most useful thing, whether in an editorial or an advertisement, is that it be such as the man who reads must understand, not can understand, but must. Tell the story quickly. Speaking of yellow journalism, I once addressed a body of Presbyterian clergymen, who admitted they did not like black type, red ink and colored supplements. I referred them to a storm which had gathered and children who had heeded the black cloud and scampered away to shelter. “That sky was being edited by a great journalist,” I told them; “He used black type” “Do vou see that black cloud?” I asked. “It’s the blackest I ever saw. The editor of that is in earnest. Soon you will see streaks of light. That’s our red ink. Then comes the rainbow. That’s our colored supplement. I only regret that I cannot put the thunder on the front page.” Let me tell you of the value of comparison: If I show you a picture of a pebble half an inch high on a magazine page and ask you how high it is, you cannot tell. But if I put a housefly beside it twice as large as the pebble, you say it is a grain of sand. If I take out the fly and put a man on horseback on top of the pebble you say it is a bowlder. If I take out the horse and man and paint a sea with ship which appears small beside it, you say it is a mountain. When you write and can find an exact comparison, you give an exact idea. I don’t like to talk in the abstract, and God forbid that I should ever be called scholarly. Use a picture. It’s worth a thousand words. Use a picture with five words, a comparison in thirty words. Here are ten lines from “Macbeth,” the most striking example of comparison I know: To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle, Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more; it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. That’s the way to write stuff. If you can write like that, your name is Shakespeare.",

    "title": "“One Look is Worth a Thousand Words”",
    "text": "“One Look is Worth a Thousand Words” So said a famous Japanese philosopher, and he was right — nearly everyone likes to “read” pictures. “Buttersweet is Good to Eat” is a very short phrase but it will sell more goods if presented, with an appetizing picture of the product, to many people morning, noon and night, every day in the year than a thousand word advertisement placed before the same number of people only a limited number of times during the year. Good advertising for a trade marked product is nothing more nor less than the delivery of favorable impressions for it, and it does not make any difference whether they are delivered through newspaper, magazine or street car advertising. No man or woman ever picks up a newspaper or magazine or enters a street car wondering what Heinz, Postum, Campbell, or Cream of Wheat is offering — all the national advertiser can hope for is that his advertisement will be bumped into accidentally. It is simply the preponderance of favorable impressions for a meritorious product that reminds the consumer to buy it again and again. We deliver many millions of advertising impressions every day. The cars on our list carry more than 10,000,000,000 passengers a year. F. R. Barnard National Advertising Manager STREET RAILWAYS ADVERTISING CO.

It reminded all mothers every day of a sure way to give a treat to their own children. And hundreds of thousands got an extra thrill with their next cake making because of the happy expression of the boy on the car card. The moral of the story is that the same influence could not be created even with the same picture in any other advertising medium. In the magazines, the reminder would not be often enough to change the average housewife’s baking habit. In the newspapers, with no color, there would be no appetite appeal. On a twenty-four sheet poster, seen only for a few seconds at a time, the great appeal of the expression on the boy’s face would be lost.",

    "text": "PARC Algorithmic Art Show (1994) (from http://www.parc.xerox.com/csl/members/bern/algoart.html) Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier, JFK-MM Algorithmic Art Algorithmic art is rule-based art, usually made with the aid of a computer. Algorithmic visual art sits somewhere between mathematical art and computer graphics. Mathematical artists usually show individual timeless objects, such as topological models, whereas algorithmic artists focus on process, the sequence of steps used to create the work. Computer artists usually use standard algorithms (for example, those available in Photoshop), whereas algorithmic artists invent new algorithms and leave them quite visible. Computer artists typically cede less, or at least later, control to automatic processes than do algorithmic artists. Xerox PARC hosted an algorithmic art show in 1994 with about 20 artists from four different countries. Computer scientist Donald Knuth showed pictures of Leaper graphs, generalizations of a knight’s tour. Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier created JFK-MM, shown above, with a computer program that found “optimal” placements of Marilyn Monroe pixels within an image of John F. Kennedy. Anna Campbell Bliss showed Jumping Koi at Lake Truchet, a nice blend of algorithmic and “manual” art in which a random Truchet tiling (squares with two quarter-circles apiece) represents a lake. Yoshiyuki Abe showed LS-51, which was made by ray-tracing a scene with many light sources and then separately remaindering R, G, and B values by a modulus. Yoshiyuki Abe, LS-51 The PARC jury (Marshall Bern, Paul DeMarinis, Andrew Glassner, Rich Gold, and Natalie Jeremijenko) tried to avoid fractals — too cliche! — but we found Daryl Hepting’s dragons and Eleanor Kent’s fractal knit baby blankets irresistible. Similarly, we accepted a number of Stewart McSherry’s ray-traced pictures, even though we thought his work fit the category of computer graphics more closely than algorithmic art. Finally, we included some art about algorithms, rather than made by algorithms. George Legrady’s Equivalents II converted keywords into clouds. Kerny McLaughlin’s Portrait of TKM gave a well-defined algorithm for turning a person into a golf course. The illustration shows the result of running the algorithm on the artist’s father, and the calligraphed text below gives pseudocode. Portrait of TKM quietly exploded our preconceptions of “algorithmic art”. Kerny McLaughlin, Portrait of TKM This page updated September 1998 / bern@parc.xerox.com",

    "title": "MATH-ART at SFU Teck Gallery (1995)",
    "text": "In honour of the 1995 Canadian Math Society Winter Meeting, Simon Fraser University presents: MATH-ART: 9 December 1995 — 24 January 1996 Scroll down for more information about the exhibit (those images on a yellow background have extra information about how they were created). Postcard advertising events on opening day: December 9, 1995 Introduction Mandates of art galleries are many, but the mandate that immediately defines a university gallery is the mandate that a gallery demonstrates the aesthetic dimensions of academic disciplines. It was to this end that Simon Fraser Gallery mounted its first math art exhibition, EXPLORING THE IMAGE WORLD OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS works by Daryl Hepting (and others from the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab in the School of Computing Science), in the W.A.C. Bennett Gallery, May 30 to July 26, 1994. Daryl Hepting, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Computing Science and one of the four curators of this exhibition, knows the connections between computers and aesthetics as few in Simon Fraser University can. He takes us on a short course on math art in the notes on these digital graphics. Other members of Simon Fraser University who joined me in curating this exhibition were Dr. Katherine Heinrich, Chair of Mathematics &amp; Statistics and Dr. Malgorzata Dubiel of the same department. These eighteen images were selected from scores of possible images so as to represent the complexities and contrasts of visual aesthetics that are possible in digital graphics. They were also selected to represent the images that are available from three sources on the WORLD WIDE WEB (internet): computer art exhibits, pioneer publications, and computer images created by Daryl Hepting of Simon Fraser University. Simon Fraser Gallery is grateful for the assistance of Gallery staff, Daryl Hepting and the other curators for making this exhibition possible. It is also grateful to the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab for production assistance. The Teck and Simon Fraser Galleries are honoured to support the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics in hosting the Canadian Mathematical Society 1995 Winter Meeting. Dr. Edward Gibson, Director, December 1995. Notes on Exhibition The majority of works in this exhibition represent a collection which rely on the computer for their existence. And the computer involves mathematics to describe, manipulate, and translate even the simplest scenes into the forms we see here. The involvement of mathematics plays a greater role in these works — it provides the inspiration and the foundation upon which they are constructed. A prominent feature of the exhibit is its display of fractals, objects from a non-Euclidean geometry. Fractals — sharing a root with fracture and fraction &amp;dash; have been called the geometry of nature by Mandelbrot, who discovered their capability to describe the non-smooth world in which we live. Fractal geometry, which is new to us, has shed light on old things — things like the historical record of water levels in the Nile river for instance. And in its turn the computer has shed light on fractals, allowing the underlying beauty of what may seem to be dry-as-dust mathematics to shine through. Works like Blessed State or Steps to Infinity provide evidence of the profound connection that seems to exist between fractals and the natural world. It is fitting that this collection of computer-related art comes to us in large part through the internet (the World Wide Web). Although Daryl Hepting is now at SFU, his works are distributed widely across the internet. In addition to Hepting’s collaborations with Musgrave (George Washington University), Prusinkiewicz (University of Calgary), Saupe (University of Freiburg), and Snider (University of Regina), the computer-based works come from: Contours of the Mind: A Celebration of Fractals, Feedback and Chaos SITO: the operative term is “stimulate” The Fractals Calendar The other pieces in this exhibit remind the viewer that the computer is responsible for only a portion of all mathematical art. The works of M. C. Escher and Marjorie Rice offer a beautiful expression of this fact. Partial financial support for the exhibit at Harbour Centre was provided by the British Columbia Ministry for Employment and Investment. Fiery Dragon by Daryl H. Hepting Martin Gardener tells the story of how this curve, first discovered by John E. Heighway, used by William G. Harter as a decoration symbolic of cryptic structure, and later analysed by them and another colleague, Bruce A. Banks. Though its final structure is complex, its description is not. The following two transformations are required to generate this shape: xform scale { sqrt(2)/2 } rotate -45 xform scale { sqrt(2)/2 } rotate 135 translate 1.0 0.0 Beginning with a single point, the whole curve can be generated by repeated application of these two transformations. This specification of the shape in terms of contractive, affine transformations is called an iterated function system (IFS). This image of a dragon curve was created by covering with disks (spheres) the parts of the plane which do not include the fractal. These parts are determined by computing the minimum distance from a point P to the fractal. If this distance is d, then a disk of radius d can be drawn about the point P and all points inside that disk are known not to belong to the fractal. Like many of my other works, I've used rayshade to ray-trace this image. This process creates the final image (which you see above) by simulating a camera inside the computer. Dragon Mesa (1989) by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Dietmar Saupe, and Daryl H. Hepting Steps to Infinity (1994) by Daryl H. Hepting and F. Kenton Musgrave The steps in this image come from a dragon curve, like the one seen on the poster for this event (and described in the notes for Fiery Dragon. Below, I show two different colourings for a dragon curve in the plane. The curve is made up of smaller and smaller copies of itself, as the colourings indicate. There are two transformations which define the dragon curve each small dragon seen above can be described by a sequence of these two transformations. To create the steps, I've assigned a unique height to each small dragon. Below, I show the steps inside a white sphere, which represents the sky. It doesn't look much like a very believable sky here, but I'll fix that. The lighting I've used here is much simpler than in the final image and it shows. If you look carefully at Steps to Infinity, you will notice (part of) a Mandelbrot set in the sky, amongst the clouds. I began with a portion of the Mandelbrot set, shown below. It may be familiar to you from Ken Musgrave's image on the cover of the 1994 Fractals Calendar. In this case, I've changed to colours more appropriate for a blue sky. For the next step, I've mapped the square image onto the inside of a white sphere, which will represent the dome of the sky in the model of my scene. Notice that this image is considerably lighter than the first, and this is due only to the white colour of the original sphere. I create some clouds for the sky by using a fractal texture function which selects blues and whites for each pixel based on something called fractional Brownian motion. When the clouds are combined with the Mandelbrot set image, the final Mandelbrot sky image comes to life. And the final image once again... Desktop Tetrahedron (1990) by Daryl H. Hepting and Allan Snider Carrot in Blue (1991) by Daryl H. Hepting and Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz Fractal Emblem (1992) by Daryl H. Hepting Splash (1993) by F. Kenton Musgrave The Great Fern Dune (1994) by Daryl H. Hepting Blessed State (1988) by F. Kenton Musgrave Captivating Rhythm (1995) by Daryl H. Hepting This image is based on a fractal which is similar to the one used to create Fiery Dragon and Steps to Infinity. This curve is also defined by two transformations, but with slightly different parameters: xform scale 0.618 /* Dragon scales by approximately .7071 */ rotate -137.5 xform scale -0.618 rotate 137.5 translate 1.0 0.0 This image is an interpretation of the process by which the points of the plane are captured by the transformations in the description of the curve to form the actual curve. I've assigned an initial point to each of the two transformations and I apply the transformations to their respective points and then to the results, over and over again. As I compose the transformations into longer and longer strings, the contractivity of each composite transformation increases. These \"stronger\" transformations capture more and more of the plane. As the strength of a transformation increases, a cone under that transformation gets wider and shorter. The upper black and white image above shows one possible colouring for the image used to construct Captivating Rhythm. Each band corresponds to a different level of \"capture\", increasing away from the curve. The reverse of \"capture\" (lower left above) is \"escape\" (lower right above). Notice how the arrangement of disks differs between them. The image below shows another way to view the same data, ultimately selected for the final image. Here, I have broken up what were solid bands in the earlier image by using information about which transformation was applied at a particular time. In creating the final image, I applied a fractional Brownian motion texture and added an outline of the fractal. Untitled by Stan Ostoja-KotkowskI Fractal World (1994) by L.

    "title": "1995 Fractals Calendar",
    "text": "1995 About the cover: Floating in space, this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity. At once, it appears natural and yet somehow unnatural, perhaps a testament to the familiarity of fractals. Amidst the fractal clouds, the sky reveals part of the omnipresent Mandelbrot set. I edited the 1995 Fractals / 1996 The Art of Fractals calendar as a Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University. The calendar featured contributed images from Danielle Bercel, Michael Field, Martin Golubitsky, John C. Hart, F. Kenton Musgrave, and Lewis N. Siegel. This calendar was completed with the assistance of the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics and the Graphics and Multimedia Research Laboratory at Simon Fraser University. Earlier work was done at the University of Regina and at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. There are many to whom I continue to be grateful, but especially B. Mandelbrot, K. Musgrave, P. Prusinkiewicz, D. Saupe, and R. Voss. January: Snowflake in Winter by Daryl H. Hepting von Koch's snowflake curve, an early mathematical monster, is depicted here in friendlier surroundings. The blue visible amidst the spheres is what remains after an algorithm to cover the complement of the fractal is applied. It works by finding the minimum distance of d of a point x from the fractal then drawing a disk of radius (maybe less than) d centered at x. Since any point already inside a disk cannot be part of the fractal, the algorithm progresses quickly as the complement is covered by disks. The spheres are the three-dimensional extensions of those disks. A fractal texture is applied to the spheres to create snowballs &mdash; the making of which is a common pastime during long Canadian winters. The snowflake curve is based on an equilateral triangle, of which each side is divided into three parts then replaced by four parts of the same length, and so on. February: Chaotic Quilt by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky Although chaos would seem to be the antithesis of symmetry, it is possible to find elaborate symmetric patterns in chaotic processes. Shown here is a hexagonal pattern similar to those that sometimes appear on quilts. This image is produced by iterating a map with hexagonal symmetry. Although the iteration possesses all the features of chaos, a surprisingly detailed and intricate symmetric pattern appears when we take a very large number of iterations &mdash; in this case about six billion &mdash; and color each pixel according to the number of times it is visited during iteration. In this sense we are computing an averaged picture. The colors themselves were chosen for their artistic effect. Note that the detail inside each of the hexagons happens to resemble a flower. The fractal quality of the picture is to some extent represented by the reappearance of the hexagonal symmetry on ever-decreasing scales. March: The Great Fern Dune by Daryl H. Hepting This fern dune is one of the natural wonders on this distant world. The fern leaf is defined by a set of linear transformations, sometimes called an iterated function system. The sand dune which surrounds the leaf was created by evaluating a so-called escape-time function for the fern and subsequently interpreting the values as heights. The escape-time function works by determining whether a point escapes membership in the fern, and if so then how quickly. The fern shape at the top of the dune reveals the accuracy with which that question was answered here. More points are included than might otherwise be expected since it is easier to exclude points than verify their membership. The scene is made more believable by the use of fractal textures for the clouds, moon and sand. The technique for interpreting function values as heights is effective for adding a third dimension to two-dimensional data, and has been employed to great advantage in many earlier fractal images. April: Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing, Variation #1 by Danielle Bercel This image is the result of a two-year metamorphosis from the image shown below [not shown], entitled Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing. The title of these images is a partial quote from Karen Blixen's novel Out of Africa. From inspection, one may see that both pictures depict the same fractal and that they share virtually all the same coordinates and parameters. The roles of color and black (or monotones) between the two images are reversed. Areas black in Variation #1 were colored according to logarithmic function in the original and monotone areas in the original received an algorithmic coloring. The form of the original is still visible in Variation #1, but it has been de-emphasized. The images are based on a variation of the usual formula describing Julia sets: zn+1 = zn2 + c, where one may adjust the value of c (a complex number) as a parameter to obtain different images. In the variation, a function is added to the mix and becomes another parameter for manipulation: zn+1 = f(zn) + zn2 + c. For these images, the conjugate of a cosine function was used. While I still prefer the original picture, as a parent might feel for a child, it appears that almost everyone who has seen both of these pictures prefers Variation #1. May: Mandelbloom by Lewis N. Siegel (with thanks to Randy Hudson and Daryl H. Hepting) It has been observed, by Mandelbrot and others,that fractal forms are found abundantly in nature. In this spirit, Mandelbloom shows natural forms occurring in a fractal. The image was created with a method used to show how the Mandelbrot set evolves over time. To create an image of the Mandelbrot set, points in the complex plane are iterated according to the well known function Zn+1 = Zn2 + C. The structure in Mandelbloom comes from an attempt to capture the movement of these points at a particular moment in time. In traditional renderings of the Mandelbrot set, each point in the plane is iterated until it escapes from the neighborhood of the origin, or reaches an upper limit. The number of iterations is then utilized to generate a color for the pixel which represents that point. In Mandelbloom, each point is instead iterated exactly the same number of times, and each point's location in the plane is used to color the pixel. With this method, a procedural texture is used to associate a color with every point in the complex plane. Rather than calculating colors for the pattern, color values are read from bitmaps of either the stem or the rose. June: Humble Aspirations by Daryl H. Hepting (with thanks to F. David Fracchia) In the midst of the harsh surroundings, a lone tree struggles for life. Each element of the scene modeled here employs fractals to shift attention from the mathematical details of the model to the illusion which it creates. The terrain is created from instances of a height field derived from a planar linear fractal, [not] shown below. The density of the fog which covers this desolate land is modulated by a fractal function. The tree, though idealized, does incorporate some observations from nature which, along with a wood texture, add to its realism. Every branch in the tree is created by linearly transforming the trunk. Beginning with a very concise description, the model is expanded to include over 150,000 primitives for rendering. July: Untitled #7 by Danielle Bercel This image takes a portion of the standard Mandelbrot set as its starting point. The portion chosen, shown at a relatively low magnification factor of 414 in Untitled #7 n-2 (top image below [not shown]), seems rather boring with little to recommend it. However, at a magnification factor of about 40,000, as seen in Untitled #7 n-1 (bottom image below [not shown]), this same location reveals the familiar shape of the Mandelbrot set and its lake. Even at relatively low magnifications, images of fractals can be made more interesting by bringing out other details and the main image is the result applying one such technique. Points outside the Mandelbrot set will \"escape\" to infinity after some number of iterations, and this number is usually called the escape time (points which have not escaped after the maximum allowed number of iterations are considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set). Traditionally in images of the Mandelbrot set each point represented in the image is colored according to this value, but I have also experimented with several alternatives. One may determine the color by making use of the real component of the location at which the point was deemed to have escaped (the Mandelbrot set resides on the complex plane and so each point on the plane has both real and imaginary components). Another technique which can be used to determine color is based on the quadrant of the complex plane in which escaped points first land. The result is a sort of curved-space checkerboarding of color, as points belonging to a single contour may take on any one of four colors depending on the point of departure for the escaping point. To this, an additional logarithmic coloring algorithm is applied to produce smooth color transitions. August: Fractal Quilt by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky Fractals can be created to mimic the real world and they can also be used as a source of pattern generation. Combining fractal methods with symmetry leads to a method for creating many kinds of repeating patterns. The seventeen different symmetry types of planar repeating patterns were classified formally by Federov in 1891 &mdash; but their existence has been known for centuries. Indeed, each of these patterns appears in the Alhambra, a group of buildings overlooking the city of Granada that was constructed by the Moors in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Only more recently have mathematicians considered how many different ways there are to construct two-color planar repeating patterns &mdash; there are forty-six possibilities. A two-color repeating pattern is one in which half the symmetries of the figure preserve the colors while half the symmetries interchange colors. Fractal methods have been used to create this large two-color fractal quilt. It is amusing to check whether you can, in fact, identify all of the symmetries in this figure. (Besides the translations, there are eight symmetries &mdash; four preserve colors and four interchange them.) September: A Crop Circle on the Palouse by John C. Hart (with thanks to Gordon Farrell and Philip Peterson) This image demonstrates recent advances in computer graphics at modeling supernatural phenomena. This crop circle, that might have otherwise been the result of a UFO encounter, as actually created using a technique called procedural geometric instancing. It allows a new representation for procedural models, which are typically translated into simpler polygonal representations for rendering. The usual unorganized polygonal representations can be unmanageable due to size. Procedural geometric instancing encapsulates procedural components into the geometric representation, which are evaluated on demand during rendering. The crop circle, containing over 100 million primitives, was specified by a short description file which represents the field of wheat with a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) hierarchy of instances of a single wheat stalk which may or may not bend over, depending on the location into which it is instanced. Given this position, a simple lookup in a low-resolution \"crop map\" of the Mandelbrot set determines whether the UFO should bend the stalk or not. October: Dragon's Lair by Daryl H. Hepting A dragon curve is captured here in what may be its natural habitat. The brooding dragon curve remains after its complement has been covered by the blocks which form the walls which enclose it. The primitives are not spheres, as before, since the Manhattan distance function is used in place of the usual Euclidean. This means that distance is calculated x+y rather than x2 + y2 and so diamonds in the Manhattan metric fill the same role as circles in the Euclidean metric. To create the third dimension in this image, boxes with height proportional to the size of the original diamonds were used. The sharpness of these boxes and their shadows provide an interesting contrast to the apparent roughness of the dragon curve, created with a fractal texture. November: Barque by F. Kenton Musgrave A shortcoming of computer-generated images is often that they lack the level of visual complexity of a photograph or a painting. An impressionist painting, for instance, can have a rich variety of color in each brush stroke; furthermore, paintings always have a textured surface, and a painter is likely to modulate the color of an otherwise flat field of color, such as a blue sky. In Barque a variety of fractal methods are used to obtain similar visual complexity. First, we start with a fractal mountain and fractal water, as seen in the image [not shown] below. Then a fractal color perturbation, as seen in the second image below, is applied to the mountain and to the sky. Finally, a fractal post-processing filter is applied to the image to create a pointillist effect. This filter samples the color of the image at a particular location, perturbs that color with a fractal distribution, then replaces a small area with a spot of the perturbed color. December: Steps to Infinity by Daryl H. Hepting and F. Kenton Musgrave Floating in space, this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity. Each step in the staircase is both a small copy of the whole shape and a collection of many smaller copies of itself, which illustrates the key concept of self-similarity. The fractal, called a dragon curve, is formed by iteration of just two linear transformations. Each step in the staircase can be identified by a common sequence of transformation applications. By labeling the transformations with 0 and 1 and recording how they are applied, one can associate a binary number with each step &mdash; used here to assign heights. The staircase looks somehow natural but the shape is more regular than would be found in nature. Like many fractal objects, it possesses a sense of familiarity. The clouds in the sky are also fractal, but they represent an example of stochastic fractals &mdash; in contrast to deterministic fractals like the staircase or the omnipresent Mandelbrot set.",

    "title": "A Path to Fractals",
    "text": "A Path to Fractals Nature is filled with a beauty easily perceived at many levels. Trees and forests, rocks and mountains, streams and mighty rivers, wisps of fog and great billowing clouds all contribute to an immediate, undeniable impression upon our visual sense. Although the impression may be hard to quantify, it is no less real. Artists often use poetry, paintings, or photographs in an attempt to communicate this impression of beauty. All these forms share in that they are patterns — of words, pigment or light — which gain permanence as they are connected with ideas. In this way, mathematicians also make patterns with permanence. To understand nature, we must also understand the language with which it speaks to us. Galileo said that this language is mathematics “its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.” The attempt to understand nature on the basis of mathematical patterns has a long tradition, which includes Pythagoras and Kepler. Though scientists since may have generally agreed with Galieo’s statement, they found the triangles and circles of Euclid’s geometry to be limiting. Mandelbrot acknowledged that: clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line … and he provided an alternative with fractal geometry. Mandelbrot coined the word fractal from the Latin root fractus to capture the rough, broken and irregular characteristics of the objects he intended to describe. In fact, this roughness can be present at all scales, which distinguishes fractals from Euclidean shapes. In the twenty-odd years since its introduction, fractal geometry has found a wide purview. Fractals seem to be everywhere, as the word fractal is now used to describe the universe and some of the very smallest things in it. Fractals, which belong to Galileo’s realm of “other geometrical figures,” add a very rich vocabulary for describing nature concisely. Now, the ruggedness of a coastline and the roughness of a rock can be quantified. ——— This calendar celebrates the deep symbiotic relationship between fractal geometry and computer graphics, which has grown as each nascent field has developed. The use of computer graphics for the study of fractals represents one of the first applications in the now popular realm of scientific visualization. As mathematical objects of infinite complexity, the detail of fractals can only be appreciated with the help of computers and this dependence represents the epitomy of scientific visualization’s goal to see the unseen. Apart from fractals with geometric constructions, the computer is also essential in the study of systems which exhibit fractal behavior over time. Here, computer-generated fractal images provide a glimpse of nature not so easily seen, one filled with deterministic chaos. Many physical systems are governed by deterministic laws, yet behave unpredictably. The unpredictability comes from sensitive dependence on initial conditions — two states which begin arbitrarily close together may become arbitrarily far apart after a finite period of time. Though the rules which define them are exceedingly simple, the complexity of shape is derived from repetition of those rules at a level that only the computer can manage. Computer graphics allows the communication of this complexity, with an eloquence not possible through words alone. Surprisingly, even these abstract images can appear organic and natural. Many of those who know of fractals were introduced to them through this application of computer graphics. With the increase of available computing power, the rewards and dangers of exploring the Mandelbrot set have become more evident. Arthur C. Clarke, in Ghost of the Grand Banks, speculates that in the future, Mandelmania will become a serious affliction for many. A sense of fractals can be gained without the computer, as nature abounds with forms possessing fractal characteristics. Although the largest and smallest examples of these cannot be seen by the naked eye, many remain easily accessible. More formally, fractals can be seen as abstractions of the natural qualities found in mountains, trees, and clouds. This process of abstraction leads to algorithms which allow computer graphics to produce astounding forgeries of nature that capture our impressions. One hopes that the result of the computer graphics process, approached from either of the above perspectives, is a pleasing picture. Each image may be created with a different purpose in mind, but ultimately the pictures are a means for effective communication of the material. And if the picture is pretty enough, it may even help to convince some of the beauty in mathematics. After seeing computer-generated pictures of fractals, some people will ask if there are any real uses of fractal geometry. In this case, it is important to emphasize the connection of the images to the reality just beyond the computer screen. There are many examples of the struggle to evaluate and apply the new idea of fractals and acceptance has not been unanimous. Mandelbrot gave a tentative mathematical definition for his discovery, but many have been concerned by its lack of precision. Then again, who could argue with the beautiful images, produced from simple equations, like the famous: Zn+1 = Zn2 + C which defines the Mandelbrot set. Natural objects possess detail at several levels but manufactured objects generally do not. In becoming focused on or bound to a particular scale, an important connection with nature is lost. Self-similarity is the key to much of the detail in natural forms. Similarity, in a mathematical sense, means that objects may differ only in size or position but not shape. Self-similarity means then that parts have the same shape as the whole. Fractals may also possess the self-similarity in a statistical or approximate sense, as many natural objects do. In its simplest form, fractal dimension can be said to measure the degree of this similarity. Experience has shown that it is difficult to be precise when defining fractals. Mandelbrot’s original definition based solely on dimension was considered too narrow, but Falconer has tried to capture the essence of what it is to be fractal. He has done this by adopting the approach of the biologist who would define life — most living things possess certain properties, most of the time. In the case of fractals, these properties are: a fine structure, too much irregularity to be described in traditional geometric language, both locally and globally, some form of self-similarity, perhaps approximate or statistical, a “fractal dimension”(somehow defined) which is greater than its topological dimension, and a simple definition, perhaps recursive. The connection to the definition of life seems appropriate, since fractals have been linked at many levels with nature and life. Even the human body exhibits fractals in its most basic functions, both spatially and temporally: in the circulatory system, the respiratory system, and at the cellular level across nerve membranes. It is remarkable that fractal geometry, born in an abstract mathematical universe, has come to have such an impact in our own physical one. Although one may appreciate equally the beauty of the Mandelbrot set and a mountainous landscape, it is not always easy to see a unifying theme if it even exists. One may understand the recipes for generating images of the Mandelbrot set, but it is quite another matter to see fractals when looking away from the computer screen. It is revolutionary to think that fractals really are much more than the pictures which represent them and it may be more reasonable to view fractals only as isolated curiosities. Is fractal geometry a set of techniques for computer graphics or a new way to look at the world? Many of those involved with fractal geometry advocate the latter, but in order to arrive there from the former position, a significant transition must take place. Several paths may be followed, for example: abandon the need for a precise definition of fractal. Considering Falconer’s list of properties, fractals elude any narrow characterization which may be applied. view an image of the Mandelbrot set as a symbol for the processes which created it. Simple rules, applied recursively, yield complex results. examine Mandelbrot’s early work (soon to be available in his Selecta) which did not have the benefit of elaborate graphics to show its beauty. From the diversity of his early studies, one can grasp the connections that Mandelbrot made which prompted him to define the new geometry. begin to see the self-similarity in nature which plants, trees, mountains and clouds exhibit, and find fractals represented therein. Once the process has begun, it becomes possible to develop an eye for fractals. Although fractals are used mainly in physics, they have appeared of late in such diverse areas as aesthetics and psychology, indicating again that fractals are a very powerful idea. As researchers have struggled with the implications of fractals and chaos, so too have philosophers and artists. Just as the flapping of a single butterfly’s wings may affect global weather patterns, the actions of any individual may have far-reaching implications. These changes in world view are already being echoed in the arts. Historically, the introduction of a new geometry has been inspirational for artists. Although fractal geometry is significantly different from Euclid’s, the challenge may be to understand how these different puzzle pieces fit together. Fractal art is in a unique position since computers wait to become a widely accepted artistic medium. The procedural, or algorithmic nature of fractal art places it at a crossroads between mathematics and art — a fertile ground waiting to be fully explored. But more than just in visual arts, fractals are being actively explored in books, television, motion pictures, dance, theatre and music. In fact, a great deal of music exhibits the fractal distribution of 1/f noise over time, a sort of middle ground between unstructured white noise and highly structured brown noise. It contains enough structure to be regular, and enough variation to be surprising. An early example of fractally-informed music with computer-generated fractal imagery was Mandelbrot and Wuorinen’s experimental performance entitled New York Notes. Fractals, as a language of nature, give a new understanding of the finite world around us and provide a glimpse of infinity. Represented in this calendar is a collection of exciting and diverse fractal images. The Mandelbrot set is depicted in some interesting new ways. Both deterministic and random fractals are represented — some closely related to their mathematical roots. I hope you will be encouraged to explore fractals in new ways.",

Recall the diagram that illustrated the article about Design Thinking from the Nielsen Norman Group. We are now moving to the explore phase. The focus now shifts from understanding the problems to proposing solutions for those problems. Using the results from the last project assignment (and considering the feedback that you will receive from your critique group), state the task that the user will perform. If you had many tasks in the last project assignment, please focus at this stage on 1 substantial task that accomplishes a meaningful goal for the user Then consider how the user will do the task: which interface metaphors (see Sections 3.4 and 12.3 in textbook) would be suitable to help users understand the activities which interaction type(s) (see Section 3.5 in textbook) would best support the users’ activities whether different interface types suggest alternative design insights or options Choose 2 different metaphors and design an interface for each of the metaphors that you choose. For both interfaces: Create a low-fidelity prototype (see Section 12.2 in textbook) Write a scenario (see Section 11.5 in textbook) that includes details of the information presented and interaction undertaken Analyze your scenario for positive and negative aspects and iterate your low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios to minimize the negative aspects and maximize the positive aspects Submission submit a pdf document (1 per group) Grading Grade penalties will be applied in the following situations for assignment submissions: on time but the written instructions for the submission were not followed: deduct 10% of the earned grade late (but within 48 hours of the due date and time): deduct 10% of the earned grade late by more than 48 hours: deduct 50% of the earned grade academic dishonesty: deduct 100% of the earned grade This assignment is worth 6 marks, according to the following rubric: Rubric DePaul Univerity’s Center for Teaching and Learning has a useful resource describing the process of creating rubrics.

Recall the diagram that illustrated the article about Design Thinking from the Nielsen Norman Group. We are now moving to the materialize phase. The focus now shifts to testing your low-fidelity prototypes. Each member of your group will conduct 1 test with each of your group’s 2 low-fidelity interface prototypes. The tests will be arranged from within your evaluation (Eval) groups. Each Eval group has 3 members. Use URcourses to coordinate with your Eval group members. For illustrative purposes, consider a group with Bob, Fanhua, and Premla. Each of them will arrange 2 meetings: Bob and Fanhua arrange to meet: Bob tests his group’s Interface A with Fanhua Fanhua tests his group’s Interface B with Bob Bob and Premla arrange to meet: Bob tests his group’s Interface B with Premla Premla tests her group’s Interface A with Bob Fanhua and Premla arrange to meet: Fanhua tests his group’s Interface A with Premla Premla tests her group’s Interface B with Fanhua IMPORTANT: Your Eval group should not have any other members from your Project group In your tests, you are asking someone to take on a role as your user and then complete the task for which you are redesigning the interface. Explain the task and ask your participant to perform the task, without giving instructions about how to do it. This information will be recorded in a script, that all group members will use to run their tests. Writing, and testing, the script is a group effort. Once you start testing with your participants, do not make any changes to your script. You may find the downloads related to the ZipCar website test useful During your tests, you will collect both quantitative and qualitative data. You will also have notes that you take during the test. You should submit all of your raw data and submit a summary of how it was collected: by whom, from whom, when, and where. Each of your group members will collect data from 1 test of your Interface A and 1 test of your Interface B. Both tests will use the same script and other materials. Provide an analysis of your data. Did the data that you collected from your participants reveal any agreement or disagreement about your interface designs? Were the results surprising in any way? Submission submit a pdf document (1 per group) Grading Grade penalties will be applied in the following situations for assignment submissions: on time but the written instructions for the submission were not followed: deduct 10% of the earned grade late (but within 48 hours of the due date and time): deduct 10% of the earned grade late by more than 48 hours: deduct 50% of the earned grade academic dishonesty: deduct 100% of the earned grade This assignment is worth 6 marks, according to the following rubric: Rubric DePaul Univerity’s Center for Teaching and Learning has a useful resource describing the process of creating rubrics.

We are in the materialize phase. Based on your experience with your project and your testing of your low-fidelity prototypes, create a single high-fidelity design of your interface that combines the best features from your two low-fidelity prototypes. This high-fidelity prototype should be somehow (using your choice of tool) executable on a computer and create an interactive simulation of your interface to perform only your task (and NOT all functionality). You are not writing code for the application per se, rather you are simulating the operation of the software or website for which you are redesigning the interface. There are 2 parts to this assignment: present the choices you made, along with your rationale, in deciding on the interface you designed following your low-fidelity prototypes A and B. provide the means for the instructor and marker to view and interact with your high-fidelity prototype, or a demonstration of your simulation with a video as a fallback. Include directions for viewing your work in the document that describes your design choices.

As a sign of this commitment, I provide a link to my reviews on ratemyprofessors.com . If you are interested in learning about me and my teaching, please read on. I give my students the opportunity to provide their written feedback to me at exam times (midterms and final), using my own feedback instrument There are nine 5-level Likert items , with which students are invited to evaluate statements about me as the instructor, on the dimension of frequency. For example, the statement &ldquo;The instructor is well-prepared for class.&rdquo; can be rated as follows: Value Label [implied] Comment 5Alwaysvery positive 4[Mostly]positive 3[Sometimes]neutral 2[Rarely]negative 1Neververy negative The levels of each Likert item are symmetrical (equal number of positive and negative levels around the neutral centre) and balanced (there is equal perceptual distance from the centre, &lsquo;Sometimes&rsquo;, for the pairs &lsquo;Always&rsquo; and &lsquo;Never&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mostly&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rarely&rsquo;) There are also three open-ended questions that students are invited to complete. Midterm feedback is formative (I will look at these results immediately and discuss them with my students) and final feedback is summative (I will not look at these until my grades have been submitted). The Faculty of Science also collects summative feedback about my teaching. My goal is to post to this website all the feedback response data that I receive. I provide a numerical summary of the Likert items and I transcribe responses to each of the open-ended questions. I compute a single number that is the percentage of agreement, over those nine Likert items, with the rating &lsquo;Always&rsquo;.

CLICK HERE to toggle details finding flaws in terrible designs professor's way about explaining topics with fun and informative examples the student involvement level and the nature of the course the class is more interactive and we can gain more knowledge about the course interactivity this course is more interactive. So it leads to involvement of many people and which in turn makes other students to open up the class is interesting best is the way instructor make it interesting for the student by providing some activities. Instructor doesn't make the course boring the instructor give practical example of design and videos I like to this course because professor show us some related video to help to understand topic NA the TED talks and other videos it is interactive this course lets me breathe. It is a highly relevant and important topic and still is presented in a simple and pleasing manner. Does not put limits and restrictions on thoughts and allows the students to interact with each other and the professor helping everyone to learn and understand everything required, together interactive classes, discussions, opinions are asked the interactive nature of the course. There are always topics and scenarios to discuss in class everything providing the practical example interaction on different topics during class the discussions and participation this course not focuses only on software or computer and also focus on other devices and machine or can be applied to practical things except technology the ability to think outside the box, creatively evaluate different situations and think up scenarios NA is practical more than theory-oriented videos, discussions, and professor's way of teaching understanding the different approaches of design; how to be more creative and why it is interesting and practical it is not theory-oriented but it is practical the materials and instructor guidance discussions NA learning about design is fun the hands on experience on real services it is very free form. I like the discussion and the use of different teaching aids good discussions happen; interesting content it really gives perspective on what good design is and how to create it the class discussion NA the occasional video demonstration. Impossible to comprehend interaction design ideas without watching a video of the ideas the class discussion and the online forum no piazza. That is amazing. No, really! That is hilarious. We use URcourses and your site. That's it! I like it! the subject matter is interesting and relevant content it enhances our creative thinking and makes us aware of the bad designs and ways to improve them NA incorporates real-world examples of design some aspects can be fun / interesting it correlates to the real time technology which makes interesting and easy to understand this course gives an insight into interface design the class is interactive, real world examples help understand problem better. Asks for our opinion is good. What would you like to change about this course? CLICK HERE to toggle details no group work; clearer instructions and requirements for assignments NA NA NA NA nothing none I found nothing to be changed till now topic should be given a day before lecture so student can prepare I need to change when we are writing in the exam paper, please remove this box format NA more notes on the board please more scenarios the instructor could ask the students to read about something relevant to topic that is to be discussed in class, before coming to the class so that everyone will be able to relate to the discussions happening in class and contribute more chapter-oriented lecture is needed NA NA nothing nothing, it's perfect (just kidding). I think the course lacks a proper format on what is to be taught in every lecture rather than just discussing different topics (that doesn't mean that I don't like discussions) more info about the group project (e.g. past projects) nothing nothing for now NA don't feel any necessity of modification to class nothing more discussion for cognitive pyschology; more recent example and studies rather than old nothing don't feel any changes for this course nothing be more clear and concise on materials the online is full of outdated things such as dates NA nothing pertinent allowing less off-topic discussion. Allowing comedians to have the floor instead of trying to keep everyone on track more clear assignments with more explanation, especially with marking schemes more modern examples nothing have class end on time more often nothing nothing it is just as good as it is. Just don't break it, okay?? more time on subject matter, less time going over assignments and evaluation; going through more design from 'scratch' rather than always critiquing assignments it could have been more practical based NA NA more involved activities / smaller classes there would be no changes that can be done for the course presentation or slide show could be included weight of midterm should be more than 10% What do think are the instructor's greatest strengths? CLICK HERE to toggle details asking thought provoking questions ability to communicate with his students well prepared and high teaching skills and abilities; respects students the instructor is more knowledgeable and taught the course in a way the students can understand this course NA the smile and interactive nature treats students with respect. The instructor clearly communicates his expectations for student preparation instuctor's greatest strength is the students' feedback and how we interact in the class experience of his life instructor's greatest strength is he always teach us well and also helping to the student and find out our comments NA his energy, his calm demeanor, and his preparedness listening and encourage students to participate the instructor encourages students to actively participate in class and discuss on topics. The instructor listens to the views of all students and does not undermine their ideas but provides a better way of thinking that the students might not have thought about he is cool drives participation of students in class as well as online his capability to connect people communicating with students to force students to think rather than just learning course material humour; thought-provoking; aware of the `dank memes' best utilization of URcourses by providing forums for student. Also keeping all lectures recorded with images on URcourses knowledge about several fields NA his teaching philosophy of challenging students to think out-of-the-box and develop his perspective encourages for a good discussion/brainstorm; calmly listen to the student question and help him to deeply assess it he is awesome he explains the topic clearly and have discussions at the end he explains thoroughly each point fostering discussion NA respectful, relays the material well, generous. He tries to stimulate discussion but loses the room easily interaction with students dedication to the topic and respect for the students. Never unwilling to have a discussion starting discussions; thinking differently to give different perspectives provides interesting thoughts and topics stimulating class discussion and involving students in class good vocabulary the ability to maintain the grasp on students' attention starting a good discussion; caring for the students passion in HCI; critique of interfaces good at finding flaws in designs and encouraging critique. Knowledgeable on the subject clear understanding of the course content he encourages participation not only in class but also on UR Self Serve / URcourses NA fun environment for discussion of the material NA the level of patience in elaborating the every single question asked by student and has a great knowledge about updating technology the instructor is clear in his way of teaching and he backs it up with real life examples makes the class participate in lecture and examination questions Likert Item 5 Always 4 [Mostly] 3 [Sometimes] 2 [Rarely] 1 Never Total 1.

CLICK HERE to toggle details This course more on practical aspects and gives chance to interact with other students NA Deals with real world things I enjoy the content of this course Class is slow and clear The course encourages critical thinking and forces us to examine the notion of what is a good design. As well, as point out some of the pit falls of good design NA He explains each concept profoundly Out of box thinking and the creative disscussion The topics This course helps to learn how to produce a product that is user focused The content (material) disscused in the course UI issues solving The material presented, it is interest and unique for a CS class, much appreciated Well, I am pretty bad designer and as web programmer it is necesary for me to create UI. The faults and issue, I am facing is being covered and give knowledge about how to create a respective design This course changes my thinking towards the design. Previously I didn't notice about the design, after this course, I started notice everything from designing perspective Dr. Hepting is passionate about his course work &amp; introduces new intuitive ways of teaching All the things in this course are practical and can be applied in different fields The group work has been pretty good so far Class gives in depth analysis how any one should start the UI design of the any website The content covered in the course The way instructor teachs the lesson makes it interesting The course relates to real life examples that helps me to understand how much efforts are required to build a software system Good discussion Involvement of students and professor in the class Learning the thought process of interface designing Able to learn the interaction between real world devices and humans, Also learned to see the devices with critical eyes I like the explanations given by instructor and the perception of the students which make the students to understand the project completely The website content Professor always shows us real life example that will be matching the topic that he is teaching. This makes learning interactive &amp; easy to understand Engaging students in discussions INTERACTION PRACTICALITY I was expecting some useful content. Really have to do this course just because I have already paid for it NA Feels good &amp; interactive; material &amp; notes is very easily accessible &amp; great interface to help students Participation in the class and making things funny and interesting The way instructor explain the topic is clearly with real-world example. Because of this, it become easy for the student to comprehend Well it is a good course with lots of new things to learn, Dr. Hepting treats everyone with respect and is always happy to solve our doubts NA The website which is updated by the instructor; the annotations option in URcourses the way it is designed to evaluate real world models; how there is no right or wrong answer in the exam - based on user's discretion; the video lots of video presentations are exciting to watch; relatable topics the course is mostly practical the new ideas introduced in every lecture this course gives general knowledge about the outer world; it's very interesting course content; instruction/teaching style in less time we can get more knowledge about the subjects explain with example assignments which are based on real life scenarios teacher; student interaction; teaching with good and visual examples new design related ideas like how to build a website; keeping users' perspective in mind lecture program and the subject (content) as it deals with design interface; I like learning different ways to implement interfaces in a best way this course focuses on practical knowledge rather than just focusing on theory part this course is not programming and application based, that's why I like this the organized material the best thing about this course is that it is more of practical rather than theoretical so we get to know more about things which can be helpful in the future encourages student participation and interactive I like the way of assigning the tasks (project and assignments) and the good way of teaching it encourages a user to be a good designer in every aspect of life. \\\"The user is king\\\" I like this course very much as there is a interaction between the teacher and the student the professor not only uses white board for teaching, but also videos that are informative. Moreover, interaction of students and annotation makes the student more attentive I like the content of the course. I love web designing but I never thought about interfaces in this way this course is all about design thinking and human interaction with computer and I like it the most because it encourages me to learn something new this course is very interactive and can teach you technology and its usefulness the course is helpful to understand the communication medium between system and users design thinking; interactive design and many more that prior I did not know these things so I am happy to learn them now it is interesting to learn how much an effort is kept for designing an interface NA the content of the course is so knowledgable and applicable to almost all the fields of computer science or in life explanation with example NA provides good information about the user experience the class is very interactive and real world scenarios are used for better understanding of concepts being explained NA What would you like to change about this course? CLICK HERE to toggle details Nothing NA NA I enjoy the course but I wish assignment details were better worded I've had trouble with assignment expectations Temperature in the room is sometimes too low Make the assignment descriptions a little more clear NA Nothing Nothing Less group assignments :) Nothing Easier marking schemes Theory A little less class disscusion, our class is very quiet! can slow us down Nothing much, more practical knowledge along with theory Assignments should be less slightly Class is way too crowded Items in urcourses are confusing, for example, self attendance is good but if someone forgets to do it then that day he is missing This course does not work well as a seminar style course. CS students are not normally very good at discussions and debates so there is a lot of dead air Just the some structure in the URcourse To see more examples of how the concepts have been applied in real world To be more louder Bringing more group activities with some design implementations can help having a picture of design problems of each and every student NA Everything is good for now Please provide clear instructions for assignments and also about mid term. I still do not know what materials to study for the mid-term NA In my opinion, professor provides his complete assistance so no more changes to be required Nothing Everything is good in this course, so I don't see anything that needs to be changed Maybe add PDF slide with the topics of this course NOTHING Course content has to be changed Pacing. Classes seem to move slowly. I'm usually uncertain of the main goal or take away from a given lecture A reduction in the number of assignments (overall 5 will be good); increase in the marks for individual assignments NA Nothing everything is perfect Nothing NA maybe some examples on how to do assignments nothing really - I really enjoy it good and in-depth study material to be provided; good picture quality should be uploaded on professor's website nothing I wish there was more activities to get experience of being a user and developer nothing, everything is perfect ppt or study material nothing marking criteria is very strict. Does not ensure good marks NA too many assignments NA at the time of the test we couldn't understand exactly what to prepare. Some clear guidance regarding that; And can be more loud so that everyone can follow extend time slot everything in the course is good and perfect to make class little more interesting no nothing; everything is good can be a little more competitive I would like to change the deadlines of the tasks there should be course slides for immediate follow up on class teaching activity nothing much I prefer to change regarding this course nothing! Everything is perfect it would be better if we get the slides or pdf's in a organized way. There should be proper documentation of classes nothing nothing nothing I think everything is almost OK but one thing that we need is less assignments and more time and make sure that the marker knows the concepts or subject or it would be better if the prof marks the papers or assignments himself because I think that the marker needs more guidance it would have been more interesting if it involved developing application based on the design principles NA the time of the class. I wish it could have started at 5pm or could have a different section at different timings marking scheme is strict. Even doing good does not ensure good marks NA there should be more discussion about the topics which require attention the class and its content are well structured. More study materials can be recommended for students to provide guidance just get outline/syllabus of entire course What do think are the instructor's greatest strengths? CLICK HERE to toggle details Preparation NA NA I think the instructor does a good job of answering questions his students have He is showing great effort in preparing and teaching the Class He encouages class disscussion and is willing to try to clarify where there is confusion (though sometimes he causes more confusion) NA His ability to give students an understanding about how things are Creativity and the use of words Giving lots of examples His knowledge on subject His knowledge of the course; ability to provoke disscusion Giving practical examples Presentation style; desire to improve material for students; accessability; content discussion In depth knowledge, vast experience and good communication (friendly) with students His perspective towards designing, we usually not think like he thinks towards the design His understanding of subject and implicative knowledge of the practical real world scenarios Explains questions and answer students concerns well. All the examples given in the class are practical and not some fictional things in textbook He clearly cares about the course material and good design Everytime open for suggestons and improvement His interest in the topics Make students participate in the class. Strength in the course HCC. Convincing students to have a deep thought about the implementation details Friendly Discussion - strengths, apart from that professor try to teach everything with proper and live example He is immensly knowledgable about interface design philosophy and providing relatable examples Able to communicate with students effectively Explanations; opinions about students thought process; respectful nature. Explaining concepts Professor is very practical, thats his greatest strength Using audio visual mediums such as videos INVOLVING AUDIENCE Nice and kind person treat everyone with respect patience his good personality Class discussion and involvement helps with interpreting and relating information to other classes and aspects of life Great patience; very friendly &amp; his humour is a lot relieving in class; very kind professor Communicate with students, giving respect to student Engage the student in performing task His knowledge with the course I think NA He can start discussions and encourage students to indulge in it his knowledge in showing videos and narrating his own experience in the class; uploading meeting minutes is perfect.

CLICK HERE to toggle details the instructor is so generous and kind about many things annotations the fact that it was hands on and every single aspect of the class was implemented via assignments and projects the assignments and project are well structured. The informative notes of each class and the constant use of real-life, relatable scenarios contain of the course and instructor's teaching method this course change my entire point of view for software design user interface design NA the pictures on website NA it is easy compared to other course it really helps to learn about designing interfaces NA the step by step process in completing the final project interesting topics NA I met cool people in my group project! no definitions TED talks lots of interesting videos the course has helped me to understand the basic concepts of HCI and has greatly intrigued me to study further the different aspects of HCI out of box thinking the interactiveness in the class I thought the assignment was fun and interesting his indepth knowledge mostly, viewing design and how to create it is what I liked the most the large group assignment to redesign a webpage was interesting the nature of the instructor to encourage students in participation it's fun to be a part of this class. Lots of learning towards user centric design I enjoyed the varying content as it was engaging and brought new perspectives to CS, and I enjoyed Dr. Hepting's presentation style and respect for students. Also continuous activities like website modification the way of thinking towards different system NA NA NA this course is very interactive and can gain a lot of knowledge from discussions in the class I love the way this course is laid out with the step by step approach in doing project, redesigning and discussing about various topics. Since this course is totally new to me I enjoyed the concepts and the class too assignments used in this course are real-time scenarios course content active participation that I learned about design thinking it is very interactive course it is related to everyday life. The best part is that we have to thinnk out of box NA practical knowledge which can be applied to different courses inclusion of student on and off lectures and availability of materials in a central repository created by professor class participation and materials the topics tht we covered, mainly how to design an effective website the interaction of the instructor the lectures were informative the qualitative answers of the questions responded from professor everything the instructor provides freedom of choice to students watching lots of cool video on designing, etc., group projects, video project is fun, interactive class, no right or wrong answers class participation and human centric discussions interaction with the professor it gives us a more knowledge course content, assignments, exam questions - according to study in class practical work on the project learnt many thing that are important for designing 'anything' by keeping humans feeling, emotions in mind the course content and how he relates it to his own work this course is based on logical and analytical thinking assignments and grouptasks -&gt; relevant and very productive recognition rather than recall, discussion I did not expect this course to be this informative and effective, it certainly uses more practical approach to make us learn things and helps to see the real-world interface design it's very easy to follow the course. All classes are easy to revise from the website the website and the content on the website it helps to engage real people and get user's perspective from testing results NA the best thing about the course is the content itself. Every programmer/designer should have good knowledge about the interactions between human and computers assignments are good and the class is more of practical knowledge than theoretical it gave me the full understanding of what it takes to be a good interface designer. I never knew it was a career to pursue. Now I know. course has given brief knowledge about how user interact with product/website/app creativity in designing a thing it's very interactive combination of theory and real-time project the assignment and project NA it was a fun course for a 400 elective What would you like to change about this course? CLICK HERE to toggle details it is good the way it is in almost everything; there could be a change (reduction) in the total number of assignments this subject should have lots of team activities in the class unfortunately, I came across some videos that were very good for lo-fidelity and hi-fidelity prototyping. The prof could have shared them. It'd have cleared many doubts the project should carry more marks and more emphasis should be on the project than the mid-term or exams nothing NA theory NA there should be videos of prof doing work instead of just audio NA nothing... nothing NA nothing nothing NA the final project for individual and group being due at the same time was difficult N/A group assignments / readings / making a video maybe less number of assignments that are worth more I would like to increase the span of the lecture timings more false NA the assignments were generally slightly vague and hard to interpret nothing the group project should have been real-time implementation of hi-fi prototype and also there should be testing on that instead of paper review having a seminar style course in Computer Science is a challenge. Many students do not have English as a first language so getting discussions going was hard class-strength, too crowded nothing I would like more class activities like the card sorting or board drawing of interfaces, since it promoted participation from all, even nervous people nothing NA NA NA the course is very simple, interactive, and helpful. I would prefer to choose a presentation slides which can be more helpful for the students while preparing for their exams as of now I think there is no need of changes for the course. Everything is on good front right now midterm marks can be integrated to URcourses easy grading scheme number of assignments of group task with different groups our instructor's communication is not clear enough the course is perfect. I would like not to change anything NA NA all good from professor, but the class feels a bit crowded at times can give less assignments less group work or making a member the leader so there can be more focus with what needs to be done I would suggest that tasks fir assignment should be minimal the teacher could speak faster NA nothing, everything is perfect NA more quality content, proper slides as professor's handwriting is illegible NA due dates are very close I don't think to improve anything assignments not till end. Marking should be done early (taking a lot of time to get marks) everything is good this course is already the best course NA nothing course material can be made available in documents very slow paced longer lectures, just kidding assignments are graded after a long time from the submission. Quick grading will be very helpful nothing nothing. Everything is good NA all good too many assignments the syllabus has to be defined theoretically. By this I mean the different HCI content should be covered step by step according to the book used for the course everything is on point and perfect implemenation of a application maybe the delivery at the beginning of the course N/A no recommended NA maybe make it more clear how a topic fits into the overall course. I spent most of the time wondering what I just learnt fits into a larger picture What do think are the instructor's greatest strengths?

    "text": "Group Work The mark awarded for each group assignment is shared by all group members. However, you have the ability to communicate extra information about your the performance of your group members to your group members, to the marker, and to me. For each group assignment, you are encouraged (but not required) to rate your group members by allocating 100 (or 99, in the case of a group with 3 members contributing equally) points amongst them (including yourself). Allocating points for a group assignment will provide evidence of your participation in the course. If all group members contribute equally, allocate the points equally to each group member. If you feel that all members of your group have not contributed equally, allocate the 100 points unequally and explain why you have done this. If you provide a group rating, please be thoughtful as you undertake this activity. If you decide to not provide a rating, it will be as if you had made an equal allocation of your 100 points. The points allocated to each group member are summed. The point total for each group member is divided by the largest total, to give a rating between 0.5 and 1 (any rating that is calculated to be less than 0.5 is set to 0.5). The group member who was allocated the most points will receive a rating of 1, which means 100% of the earned mark for the group assignment. If all group members have the same point total, all will receive 100% of the earned mark for the group assignment. The lowest rating allowed is 0.5 and that means the group member should receive 50% of the earned mark for the group assignment. The ratings are suggestions to me and information to you about your involvement in your group. Use the “Rate your group on…” link on URcourses, for the appropriate assignment, and use the form provided here to help you to format your submission. You can see your rating from the group in URcourses via the link labelled “See Your Rating From Group”.

    "title": "A Picture’s Worth",
    "text": "A Picture’s Worth What does the phrase “A picture is worth ten thousand words” mean to you? Does it become more or less meaningful if it was written by an advertising executive, a newspaper publisher, or an ancient sage? I embarked on an exploration into the origins of this phrase in 1999 as part of my doctoral work (A New Paradigm for Exploration in Computer-Aided Visualization). It was important for me to use the phrase correctly and so I wanted to know whether a picture was worth 1,000 or 10,000 words. Various versions of the phrase, and stories about its origin, are in circulation. This page seeks to trace its history. For their help with the original version of the page, I thank Dona Bubelis of the Seattle Public Library, Ellen Chamberlain of the University of South Carolina, and Dr. Paul Lester of California State University Fullerton ( A Picture’s Worth a Thousand Words?). In 1999, credit for the phrase seemed to belong to Frederick R. Barnard, National Advertising Manager for the Street Railways Advertising Company (offices then in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco). The maxim which is popular today seemed to originate as “One look is worth a thousand words”, and appeared in a 1921 advertisement by Barnard. He chose to modify the saying for a 1927 advertisement, where it took on its more famous form. The two advertisements appeared in the advertising trade journal called Printers’ Ink (now known as Marketing/Communications). March 10, 1927 (pp. 114-115) &ldquo;One Picture is Worth Ten Thousand Words&rdquo;. This advertisement uses the specific example of a baking soda ad campaign seemingly done by Barnard's firm. The basic message is the same as the earlier ad, though perhaps Barnard hoped it would be more compelling as a Chinese proverb. December 8, 1921 (pp. 96-97) &ldquo;One Look is Worth A Thousand Words&rdquo;. This advertisement talks generally about the benefits about advertising with pictures on street cars. Confusion between whether a picture is worth 1,000 or 10,000 words may stem from a 1948 entry in The MacMillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims and Famous Phrases ( formerly known as the The Home Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Familiar Phrases ) is an early and very informative source about the phrase. Editor Burton Egbert Stevenson made the following entry on page 2611 of that volume: One look is worth a thousand words. Fred R. Barnard, in Printers' Ink, 8 Dec., 1921, p. 96. He changed it to &ldquo;One picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; in Printers' Ink, 10 March 1927, p. 114, and called it &ldquo;a Chinese proverb&rdquo;, so that people would take it seriously. It was immediately credited to Confucious. This entry establishes the link between the two advertisements, but this source misquotes the 1927 advertisement and thereby creates “One picture is worth a thousand words”. Familiar Quotations: a collection of passages, phrases, and proverbs traced to their sources in ancient and modern literature by John Bartlett also provides information. Stevenson’s error is repeated on page 782 of the 16th edition (edited by Justin Kaplan and published by Little, Brown in 1992) where it credits “One picture is worth a thousand words” as a misattributed “Chinese proverb” and references part of the entry from the 1948 edition edited by Stevenson. “Nice guys finish seventh”: false phrases, spurious sayings, and familiar misquotations by Ralph Keyes and published in 1992 by HarperCollins has a similar account to that of Stephenson. Keyes, however, adds his own twists to the story because the phrase “One picture is worth a thousand words” does not appear anywhere in the 1921 ad: Calling an orphan saying a Chinese proverb gives it a cachet with very little risk that its actual source will be discovered. A deliberate exploitation of this syndrome involved the proverb `One picture is worth a thousand words.' This saying first appeared in a 1921 ad in Printer's Ink [sic] which was written by publicist Frederick Barnard. Barnard headlined his ad `One look is worth a thousand words.' He attributed this maxim to `a famous Japanese philosopher.' Six years later, Barnard revised the saying to read `One picture is worth ten thousand words,' and then republished it in the same magazine as a `Chinese proverb.' Barnard thought his ploy would give his words added weight. He was right. For a time, Bartlett's identified Barnard's line as `a Chinese proverb.' Other sources attributed his proverb to Confucius. The Macmillan Dictionary of Quotations had it both ways. They cited Barnard as the maxim's author, adding `Ascribed to Chinese origin.' Keyes’ book identified several rules of misquotation and the one of which he and several others have been guilty he calls numbernesia: getting the words right but the numbers wrong. The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase, Saying, and Quotation is one reference which has the correct attribution (but without any of the story). The phrase has endured to become an American proverb, appearing on page 465 of A Dictionary of American Proverbs, edited by Mieder, Kingsbury, and Harder and published by the Oxford University Press in 1992. Current opinion would remove Mr. Barnard from the picture (pun intended). There is now a wikipedia article entitled “A picture is worth a thousand words” that is focused much more broadly than this page. In updating this page, I came across a wonderful account of the history of this expression written by William Safire for his column On Language for the New York Times Magazine. Worth a Thousand Words was published on 7 April 1996. If you have more information about the origins of this quotation (or the stories that surround it), please send me e-mail and I will update this page accordingly.

    "text": "Knowledge Areas Algorithms and Complexity (AL) Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software engineering. The real-world performance of any software system depends on: (1) the algorithms chosen and (2) the suitability and efficiency of the various layers of implementation. Good algorithm design is therefore crucial for the performance of all software systems. Moreover, the study of algorithms provides insight into the intrinsic nature of the problem as well as possible solution techniques independent of programming language, programming paradigm, computer hardware, or any other implementation aspect. An important part of computing is the ability to select algorithms appropriate to particular purposes and to apply them, recognizing the possibility that no suitable algorithm may exist. This facility relies on understanding the range of algorithms that address an important set of welldefined problems, recognizing their strengths and weaknesses, and their suitability in particular contexts. Efficiency is a pervasive theme throughout this area. This knowledge area defines the central concepts and skills required to design, implement, and analyze algorithms for solving problems. Algorithms are essential in all advanced areas of computer science: artificial intelligence, databases, distributed computing, graphics, networking, operating systems, programming languages, security, and so on. Algorithms that have specific utility in each of these are listed in the relevant knowledge areas. Cryptography, for example, appears in the new Knowledge Area on Information Assurance and Security (IAS), while parallel and distributed algorithms appear the Knowledge Area in Parallel and Distributed Computing (PD). As with all knowledge areas, the order of topics and their groupings do not necessarily correlate to a specific order of presentation. Different programs will teach the topics in different courses and should do so in the order they believe is most appropriate for their students. Basic Analysis &starf; &starf; Core &starf; Core AL / Basic Analysis Topics Learning Outcomes Algorithmic Strategies &starf; &starf; Core &starf; Core AL / Algorithmic Strategies Topics Learning Outcomes Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms &starf; &starf; Core &starf; Core AL / Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms Topics Learning Outcomes Basic Automata, Computability and Complexity &starf; &starf; Core &starf; Core AL / Basic Automata, Computability and Complexity Topics Learning Outcomes Advanced Computational Complexity Elective AL / Advanced Computational Complexity Topics Learning Outcomes Advanced Automata Theory and Computability Elective AL / Advanced Automata Theory and Computability Topics Learning Outcomes Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, and Analysis Elective AL / Advanced Data Structures, Algorithms, and Analysis Topics Learning Outcomes Architecture and Organization (AR) Computing professionals should not regard the computer as just a black box that executes programs by magic. The knowledge area Architecture and Organization builds on Systems Fundamentals (SF) to develop a deeper understanding of the hardware environment upon which all computing is based, and the interface it provides to higher software layers. Students should acquire an understanding and appreciation of a computer system’s functional components, their characteristics, performance, and interactions, and, in particular, the challenge of harnessing parallelism to sustain performance improvements now and into the future. Students need to understand computer architecture to develop programs that can achieve high performance through a programmer’s awareness of parallelism and latency. In selecting a system to use, students should be able to understand the tradeoff among various components, such as CPU clock speed, cycles per instruction, memory size, and average memory access time. The learning outcomes specified for these topics correspond primarily to the core and are intended to support programs that elect to require only the minimum 16 hours of computer architecture of their students. For programs that want to teach more than the minimum, the same AR topics can be treated at a more advanced level by implementing a two-course sequence. For programs that want to cover the elective topics, those topics can be introduced within a two-course sequence and/or be treated in a more comprehensive way in a third course.

Interaction between users and computational artefacts occurs at an interface that includes both software and hardware. Thus interface design impacts the software life-cycle in that it should occur early; the design and implementation of core functionality can influence the user interface — for better or worse. Because it deals with people as well as computational systems, as a knowledge area HCI demands the consideration of cultural, social, organizational, cognitive and perceptual issues. Consequently it draws on a variety of disciplinary traditions, including psychology, ergonomics, computer science, graphic and product design, anthropology and engineering Foundations &starf; &starf; Core HCI / Foundations Motivation For end-users, the interface is the system. So design in this domain must be interaction-focused and human-centered. Students need a different repertoire of techniques to address this than is provided elsewhere in the curriculum. Topics Contexts for HCI (anything with a user interface, e.g., webpage, business applications, mobile applications, and games)&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Processes for user-centered development, e.g., early focus on users, empirical testing, iterative design&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Different measures for evaluation, e.g., utility, efficiency, learnability, user satisfaction&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Usability heuristics and the principles of usability testing&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Physical capabilities that inform interaction design, e.g., color perception, ergonomics&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Cognitive models that inform interaction design, e.g., attention, perception and recognition, movement, and memory; gulfs of expectation and execution&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Social models that inform interaction design, e.g., culture, communication, networks and organizations&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Principles of good design and good designers; engineering tradeoffs&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Accessibility, e.g., interfaces for differently-abled populations (e.g., blind, motion-impaired)&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Interfaces for differently-aged population groups (e.g., children, 80+)&nbsp;&starf;&starf; Learning Outcomes Discuss why human-centered software development is important.

[Familiarity]&nbsp; Detail the processes of design appropriate to specific design orientations. [Familiarity]&nbsp; Apply a variety of design methods to a given problem. [Usage]&nbsp; Information Management (IM) one two Platform-Based Development (PBD) one two Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) While technical issues are central to the computing curriculum, they do not constitute a complete educational program in the field. Students must also be exposed to the larger societal context of computing to develop an understanding of the relevant social, ethical, legal and professional issues. This need to incorporate the study of these non-technical issues into the ACM curriculum was formally recognized in 1991, as can be seen from the following excerpt [2] Undergraduates also need to understand the basic cultural, social, legal, and ethical issues inherent in the discipline of computing. They should understand where the discipline has been, where it is, and where it is heading. They should also understand their individual roles in this process, as well as appreciate the philosophical questions, technical problems, and aesthetic values that play an important part in the development of the discipline.Students also need to develop the ability to ask serious questions about the social impact of computing and to evaluate proposed answers to those questions. Future practitioners must be able to anticipate the impact of introducing a given product into a given environment. Will that product enhance or degrade the quality of life? What will the impact be upon individuals, groups, and institutions?Finally, students need to be aware of the basic legal rights of software and hardware vendors and users, and they also need to appreciate the ethical values that are the basis for those rights. Future practitioners must understand the responsibility that they will bear, and the possible consequences of failure. They must understand their own limitations as well as the limitations of their tools. All practitioners must make a longterm commitment to remaining current in their chosen specialties and in the discipline of computing as a whole. As technological advances continue to significantly impact the way we live and work, the critical importance of social issues and professional practice continues to increase; new computer-based products and venues pose ever more challenging problems each year. It is our students who must enter the workforce and academia with intentional regard for the identification and resolution of these problems. Computer science educators may opt to deliver this core and elective material in stand-alone courses, integrated into traditional technical and theoretical courses, or as special units in capstone and professional practice courses. The material in this familiarity area is best covered through a combination of one required course along with short modules in other courses. On the one hand, some units listed as Core Tier-1 (in particular, Social Context, Analytical Tools, Professional Ethics, and Intellectual Property) do not readily lend themselves to being covered in other traditional courses. Without a standalone course, it is difficult to cover these topics appropriately. On the other hand, if ethical and social considerations are covered only in the standalone course and not “in context,” it will reinforce the false notion that technical processes are void of these other relevant issues. Because of this broad relevance, it is important that several traditional courses include modules with case studies that analyze the ethical, legal, social and professional considerations in the context of the technical subject matter of the course. Courses in areas such as software engineering, databases, computer networks, information assurance and security, and introduction to computing provide obvious context for analysis of ethical issues. However, an ethics-related module could be developed for almost any course in the curriculum. It would be explicitly against the spirit of the recommendations to have only a standalone course. Running through all of the issues in this area is the need to speak to the computing practitioner’s responsibility to proactively address these issues by both moral and technical actions. The ethical issues discussed in any class should be directly related to and arise naturally from the subject matter of that class. Examples include a discussion in the database course of data aggregation or data mining, or a discussion in the software engineering course of the potential conflicts between obligations to the customer and obligations to the user and others affected by their work. Programming assignments built around applications such as controlling the movement of a laser during eye surgery can help to address the professional, ethical and social impacts of computing. Computing faculty who are unfamiliar with the content and/or pedagogy of applied ethics are urged to take advantage of the considerable resources from ACM, IEEE-CS, SIGCAS (special interest group on computers and society), and other organizations. It should be noted that the application of ethical analysis underlies every subsection of this Social and Professional knowledge area in computing. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics) provides guidelines that serve as the basis for the conduct of our professional work. The General Moral Imperatives provide an understanding of our commitment to personal responsibility, professional conduct, and our leadership roles.",

The mastery levels are defined as: Familiarity: The student understands what a concept is or what it means. This level of mastery concerns a basic awareness of a concept as opposed to expecting real facility with its application. It provides an answer to the question “What do you know about this?” Usage: The student is able to use or apply a concept in a concrete way. Using a concept may include, for example, appropriately using a specific concept in a program, using a particular proof technique, or performing a particular analysis. It provides an answer to the question “What do you know how to do?” Assessment: The student is able to consider a concept from multiple viewpoints and/or justify the selection of a particular approach to solve a problem. This level of mastery implies more than using a concept; it involves the ability to select an appropriate approach from understood alternatives. It provides an answer to the question “Why would you do that?” Topics and Learning Outcomes with: 2 stars ( &starf; &starf; ) appear in the CS2013 report as Core-Tier1 1 star ( &starf; ) appear in the CS2013 report as Core-Tier2 0 stars appear in the CS2013 report as Elective grey text are not covered in this course offering Semester Plan Thu-03-Sep-2020 &bull; Introduction to Human Computer Communication HCI / Foundations Topics: Contexts for HCI (anything with a user interface, e.g., webpage, business applications, mobile applications, and games) Learning Outcomes: Discuss why human-centered software development is important.

An identification may be compromised if the words used to describe the target face impair the witness' memory of that face (verbal overshadowing) or if the witness sees so many photos that he or she may identify a photo as the target face when it is actually similar to one of the early photos viewed (inaccurate source attribution). Faces of a race different than the witness may cause additional difficulties (cross-race effect). In order to improve the accuracy of eyewitness identification, these sources of inaccuracies must be mitigated. Verbal overshadowing may be addressed by using only non-verbal means to ask for recognition, rather than recall, of the target face. Inaccurate source attribution may be ameliorated by reducing the number of candidate photos presented to a witness. In order to meaningfully achieve this reduction, it is necessary to understand how a particular witness judges similarity between photos so that a computer-based presentation can be personalized accordingly. My research to date indicates that people employ one of at least two different strategies when judging facial similarities. I seek to democratize accurate identification of faces by: understanding the different strategies that people may use to judge facial similarity; developing a concise means of testing which strategy a witness is likely to apply; developing a computer interface that makes use of a witness' identified strategy to allow accurate identification of the target face, while viewing as few candidate photos as possible; and developing an extensible system to manage and store candidate photos for use with the interface. My research to date has used a set of 356 photos (178 Caucasian and 178 First Nations to allow for examination of cross-race effect), which participants have sorted based on how they each judge similarity. This work will contribute to eyewitness identification by providing better tools for witnesses and by providing a basis for understanding which faces may be more or less easy to identify. The same techniques can be used to study interaction with fractal images, which has applications for democratization of multimedia composition. &nbsp; Democratization and personalization for information access (2006-2010) Summary Computer software should conform to its users and not the other way around. Although this phrase is often repeated, it seems to carry little weight today: users are regularly told of the need to use standard processes and software. My research explores an alternative view: let software deal with each user on their own terms and then let it manage the translation of each user's work into the terms of the others with whom he or she needs to collaborate. Democratization means that any user will be able to have satisfying and meaningful interactions and explorations of their chosen problem domains. Personalization means that each user is able to interact with the tool in a way that mirrors his or her own concept of the problem. Knowledge acquisition techniques will be used to discover each user's concept of a problem without requiring its explicit naming with a possibly unfamiliar vocabulary. User experiences will be more satisfying, hence more helpful to democratization, if the personalization phase can be as short as possible. I have developed applications in the areas of information visualization, recipe browsing, environmental decision support systems, eyewitness identification, and multimedia composition. I am seeking techniques to understand, as directly and as efficiently as possible, how any given individual conceives of a problem. I plan to take this understanding or knowledge and make it available for manipulation by that individual through my software, called cogito. This interface is intended to allow and support a user's exploration of that information, enabling him or her to manage and even transform the space (by changing the order in which decisions are made, for example) until the desired results are obtained. People will bring their diverse applications or problems to the cogito system and they will have satisfying experiences exploring them. Technology can, I believe, be more powerfully used when it augments individuals seeking personally-creative solutions and helps those individuals to communicate those ideas to others. &nbsp; Conceptual spaces: theory and tools (2002-2005) Summary In 1960, J. C. R. Licklider looked to a time when humans and computers would work in intimate association and saw it as being \"intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind.\" Back then, Licklider found that up to 85% of his \"’thinking’ time was devoted mainly to activities that were essentially clerical or mechanical ... operations that can be performed more effectively by machines than by men.\" Although many of these tasks are now done by computers, many software programs still keep their users from their work by requiring them to be tooinvolved in clerical or mechanical details. In an era when so much is done by computers, humans are still needed to deal with the problems that require their personal creative input. These problems are harder to deal with, and as such only experts are likely to tackle them. My research focuses on developing appropriate computer-based tools to support the experts in working on these problems, and to encourage more participation from more people in exploring and evaluating alternative solutions to these hard problems. The tools in which I am particularly interested use visual interfaces to remove the requirement of computer expertise from their users and to explore and evaluate all the available solutions. Such interfaces address the problem when a user, searching for a solution, says \"I’ll know it when I see it\" but has no other way to specify it. The notion of a conceptual space, defined with the help of a programmer, is a way for the user to build a vocabulary to talk about his or her problem. In this way, my work seeks to change the relationship between users and programmers rather than put programmers out of work. To develop these tools, I will rely on the study of software users to refine my own software and ideas. Widespread acceptance and use of this type of tool will go a long way to realizing Licklider’s vision, meaning that computer use will become more productive and more rewarding.",

    "text": "Inspirations In short, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with (other) enthusiasts for artificial intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant future of cerebration to machines alone. There will nevertheless be a fairly long interim during which the main intellectual advances will be made by men and computers working together in intimate association. A multidisciplinary study group, examining future research and development problems of the [United States] Air Force, estimated that it would be 1980 before developments in artificial intelligence make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving of military significance. That would leave, say, five years to develop man-computer symbiosis and fifteen years to use it. The fifteen may be ten or five hundred, but those years should be intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind. &nbsp; J. C. R. Licklider in Man-Computer Symbiosis, 1960 &nbsp; When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe. &nbsp; John Muir in My First Summer in the Sierra, 1911 &nbsp; There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, &lsquo;Morning, boys, how's the water?&rsquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, &lsquo;What the hell is water?&rsquo; &nbsp; David Foster Wallace in This is Water, 2005 &nbsp; When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again. &nbsp; Steve Jobs in Video interview from Santa Clara Valley Historical Association, 1995 &nbsp; In our culture we spend a lot of time with the how. We've become a culture of technocrats and all we do is become technicians asking &lsquo;how do we do this?&rsquo;.

    "text": "Group Work The mark awarded for each group assignment is shared by all group members. However, you have the ability to communicate extra information about your group members’ performance to your group members, to the marker, and to me. For each group assignment, you are encouraged to allocate 100 points amongst your group members (including yourself). The place to do this is a link in URcourses labelled something like “Submit Group Rating”, just below the link for the assignment that you have just submitted. If all group members contribute equally, you would distribute the points equally to each group member. If some group members contribute more or less than others, you would reflect this in the amount of points allocated to each group member. Please undertake this activity responsibly and explain why you have not allocated points equally. The total points that you allocate amongst your group members should equal 100. If a group member does not providing a rating, their allocation of points is taken as equal. However, allocating points for each portion of group work will provide evidence of your participation. The points allocated to each group member are summed. The point sum for each group member is divided by the largest sum, so the group member who was allocated the most points will receive the full mark earned for the assignment. If all group members were allocated the same number of points, all will receive the full mark earned for the assignment. The lowest rating allowed is 0.5, even if the calculated would be lower. You can see your rating from the group in URcourses via the entry labelled “See Your Rating From Group”. The value available there corresponds to the “Computed Rating from Group” in the examples below. Following the examples, a calculator form is provided.

    "text": "Philosophy Short version Challenge my students to think deeply and behave ethically. (inspired by the story of Martina Fitzgerald’s recollections about Gord Downey and their high school English teacher[for good measure, on web.archive.org]) Longer version My objectives as a teacher are simple. I seek to: inspire students to see that the subject itself is worthy of study and critical reflection and not just for a good mark in the course. To this end, I often share with students the following excerpt of a commencement speech given by David Foster Wallace: “There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, ‘Morning, boys, how’s the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, ‘What the hell is water?’”. I encourage students to ask “why?” as well as “how?”. provide students with application knowledge of the subject, that goes beyond rote knowledge. I seek to use current examples that we discuss and work through together. make a connection with every student. I know that in any class, there will be those who will pass or fail despite whatever I may do. I also know that in each class there are people with whom I can make a difference and for them especially, I create a friendly atmosphere that is supportive of learning. provide a concrete structure for students in terms of well-defined expectations and within this structure; I work to find opportunities for innovation. encourage my students to take responsibility for their classroom experience respect and honour the perspective of each student “The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher’s Life” is the title of a book written by Parker J. Palmer. I can see myself when Palmer writes that “most of us arrive at a sense of self and vocation only after a long journey through alien lands”. Palmer also writes that “good teaching cannot be reduced to technique; good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher”. As I progress on my own journey, I have been able to take these words to heart. I remain open to new alternatives for the design of my course meetings and I appreciate Palmer’s use of paradoxes to design teaching and learning spaces that: are bounded and open; are hospitable and “charged”; invite the voice of the individual and the voice of the group; honour the “little” stories of the students and the “big” stories of the disciplines and tradition; support solitude and surround it with the resources of the community; and welcome both silence and speech. I love teaching. My goal is to “challenge my students to think deeply and behave ethically”. In order to assess my success in achieving this goal I use my own instrument to collect student evaluations of my teaching (to get formative feedback at midterm and summative feedback at the end of term). However I have understood my limitations, I have worked to get past them. As I have understood the concept of a growth mindset, I have worked to adopt it. Carol Dweck, who conducted the research and developed the concept, gave a wonderful presentation: “The Power of Believing That You Can Improve”. Steve Jobs, in a 1995 interview from the Santa Clara Valley Historical Association, demonstrates a growth mindset: “When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you’re life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.” In my experience, vulnerability (see Brené Brown on “The Power of Vulnerability”) and confidence are required. In “How to Build Your Creative Confidence”, David Kelley connects the two. I don’t know when, or if, any student will the attach adjective “good” to my teaching, but I know that my journey is on the right path.",

For more information or to reserve seats at the lecture, call 291-5100. An exhibition of art based on mathematical principles and ideas. Fractals, more so than other areas of mathematics, are visually exciting in a very real way. Fractals are a language with which to describe the geometry of nature. Images of fractals can be an important access to mathematics and surrounding philosophical questions. Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Teck Gallery (Room 1305). Interactive computer displays for visitors to experiment with making their own fractal designs; investigate E-Gems, a project to design math and science electronic games (Counting on Frank, one of their products, was chosen by PC Magazine as one of the top 100 CD-ROMs for 1995); and check out the math education and art resources available on the Internet. Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Segal Centre (Room 1430). Ingenious mathematical amateurs. It is possible for someone without formal credentials to make contributions to mathematics. Well-known artist M.C. Escher and unknown homemaker Marjorie Rice both tackled mathematical problems, developing unorthodox notation that was essential to their methodical investigations. Each worked alone, essentially in secret, rewarded by the exhilaration of finding answers to a large puzzle.
