    "text": "# Newspaper Copy that People Must Read ADVERTISING'S RELATION TO THE GROWTH OF READING ABILITY &mdash; THE THUNDERSTORM AND &ldquo;YELLOW&rdquo; JOURNALISM &mdash; AN EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF COMPARISON IN WRITING By Arthur Brisbane. [NOTE. &mdash; The following are extracts from an address by Mr. Brisbane, editor of the New York Evening Journal, before the Syracuse (N. Y.) Advertising Club.] Advertising men should remember with pride and satisfaction that this is the first generation that can read. When I was a boy on the farm the servant that could read was the exception. I had a colored servant recently who could neither read nor write, but his brother was valedictorian at college. The person who cannot read now is almost a curiosity. Advertising men represent our speech on a big scale. Publicity, advertising, is to the human race what speech is to the individual. For many ages man lived with out speech. The individuals learned by experience and then died, and the next had to learn all over again. Then man acquired the art of speech, and the art of printing and finally the art of reading. Newspapers are in their infancy &mdash; they have only just begun. The most difficult and the most useful thing, whether in an editorial or an advertisement, is that it be such as the man who reads must understand, not can understand, but must. Tell the story quickly. Speaking of yellow journalism, I once addressed a body of Presbyterian clergymen, who admitted they did not like black type, red ink and colored supplements. I referred them to a storm which had gathered and children who had heeded the black cloud and scampered away to shelter. &ldquo;That sky was being edited by a great journalist,&rdquo; I told them; &ldquo;He used black type&rdquo; &ldquo;Do vou see that black cloud?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;It's the blackest I ever saw. The editor of that is in earnest. Soon you will see streaks of light. That's our red ink. Then comes the rainbow. That's our colored supplement. I only regret that I cannot put the thunder on the front page.&rdquo; Let me tell you of the value of comparison: If I show you a picture of a pebble half an inch high on a magazine page and ask you how high it is, you cannot tell. But if I put a housefly beside it twice as large as the pebble, you say it is a grain of sand. If I take out the fly and put a man on horseback on top of the pebble you say it is a bowlder. If I take out the horse and man and paint a sea with ship which appears small beside it, you say it is a mountain. When you write and can find an exact comparison, you give an exact idea. I don't like to talk in the abstract, and God forbid that I should ever be called scholarly. Use a picture. It's worth a thousand words. Use a picture with five words, a comparison in thirty words. Here are ten lines from &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; the most striking example of comparison I know: To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle, Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more; it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. That's the way to write stuff. If you can write like that, your name is Shakespeare.",

    "text": "# {{ page.breadcrumb }} So said a famous Japanese philosopher, and he was right &mdash; nearly everyone likes to &ldquo;read&rdquo; pictures. &ldquo;Buttersweet is Good to Eat&rdquo; is a very short phrase but it will sell more goods if presented, with an appetizing picture of the product, to many people morning, noon and night, every day in the year than a thousand word advertisement placed before the same number of people only a limited number of times during the year. Good advertising for a trade marked product is nothing more nor less than the delivery of favorable impressions for it, and it does not make any difference whether they are delivered through newspaper, magazine or street car advertising. No man or woman ever picks up a newspaper or magazine or enters a street car wondering what Heinz, Postum, Campbell, or Cream of Wheat is offering &mdash; all the national advertiser can hope for is that his advertisement will be bumped into accidentally. It is simply the preponderance of favorable impressions for a meritorious product that reminds the consumer to buy it again and again. We deliver many millions of advertising impressions every day.

The moral of the story is that the same influence could not be created even with the same picture in any other advertising medium. In the magazines, the reminder would not be often enough to change the average housewife's baking habit. In the newspapers, with no color, there would be no appetite appeal. On a twenty-four sheet poster, seen only for a few seconds at a time, the great appeal of the expression on the boy's face would be lost.",

    "text": "# {{ page.breadcrumb }} ##### (from http://www.parc.xerox.com/csl/members/bern/algoart.html) Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier, JFK-MM ### Algorithmic Art Algorithmic art is rule-based art, usually made with the aid of a computer. Algorithmic visual art sits somewhere between mathematical art and computer graphics. Mathematical artists usually show individual timeless objects, such as topological models, whereas algorithmic artists focus on process, the sequence of steps used to create the work. Computer artists usually use standard algorithms (for example, those available in Photoshop), whereas algorithmic artists invent new algorithms and leave them quite visible. Computer artists typically cede less, or at least later, control to automatic processes than do algorithmic artists. Xerox PARC hosted an algorithmic art show in 1994 with about 20 artists from four different countries. Computer scientist Donald Knuth showed pictures of Leaper graphs, generalizations of a knight's tour. Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier created JFK-MM, shown above, with a computer program that found \"optimal\" placements of Marilyn Monroe pixels within an image of John F. Kennedy. Anna Campbell Bliss showed Jumping Koi at Lake Truchet, a nice blend of algorithmic and \"manual\" art in which a random Truchet tiling (squares with two quarter-circles apiece) represents a lake. Yoshiyuki Abe showed LS-51, which was made by ray-tracing a scene with many light sources and then separately remaindering R, G, and B values by a modulus. Yoshiyuki Abe, LS-51 The PARC jury (Marshall Bern, Paul DeMarinis, Andrew Glassner, Rich Gold, and Natalie Jeremijenko) tried to avoid fractals &mdash; too cliche! &mdash; but we found Daryl Hepting's dragons and Eleanor Kent's fractal knit baby blankets irresistible. Similarly, we accepted a number of Stewart McSherry's ray-traced pictures, even though we thought his work fit the category of computer graphics more closely than algorithmic art. Finally, we included some art about algorithms, rather than made by algorithms. George Legrady's Equivalents II converted keywords into clouds. Kerny McLaughlin's Portrait of TKM gave a well-defined algorithm for turning a person into a golf course. The illustration shows the result of running the algorithm on the artist's father, and the calligraphed text below gives pseudocode. Portrait of TKM quietly exploded our preconceptions of \"algorithmic art\". Kerny McLaughlin, Portrait of TKM This page updated September 1998 / bern@parc.xerox.com",

    "title": "MATH-ART at SFU Teck Gallery (1995)",
    "text": "In honour of the 1995 Canadian Math Society Winter Meeting, Simon Fraser University presents: # MATH-ART: 9 December 1995 &mdash; 24 January 1996 Scroll down for more information about the exhibit (those images on a yellow background have extra information about how they were created). Postcard advertising events on opening day: December 9, 1995 ### Introduction Mandates of art galleries are many, but the mandate that immediately defines a university gallery is the mandate that a gallery demonstrates the aesthetic dimensions of academic disciplines. It was to this end that Simon Fraser Gallery mounted its first math art exhibition, EXPLORING THE IMAGE WORLD OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS works by Daryl Hepting (and others from the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab in the School of Computing Science), in the W.A.C. Bennett Gallery, May 30 to July 26, 1994. Daryl Hepting, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Computing Science and one of the four curators of this exhibition, knows the connections between computers and aesthetics as few in Simon Fraser University can. He takes us on a short course on math art in the notes on these digital graphics. Other members of Simon Fraser University who joined me in curating this exhibition were Dr. Katherine Heinrich, Chair of Mathematics &amp; Statistics and Dr. Malgorzata Dubiel of the same department. These eighteen images were selected from scores of possible images so as to represent the complexities and contrasts of visual aesthetics that are possible in digital graphics. They were also selected to represent the images that are available from three sources on the WORLD WIDE WEB (internet): computer art exhibits, pioneer publications, and computer images created by Daryl Hepting of Simon Fraser University. Simon Fraser Gallery is grateful for the assistance of Gallery staff, Daryl Hepting and the other curators for making this exhibition possible. It is also grateful to the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab for production assistance. The Teck and Simon Fraser Galleries are honoured to support the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics in hosting the Canadian Mathematical Society 1995 Winter Meeting. Dr. Edward Gibson, Director, December 1995. ### Notes on Exhibition The majority of works in this exhibition represent a collection which rely on the computer for their existence. And the computer involves mathematics to describe, manipulate, and translate even the simplest scenes into the forms we see here. The involvement of mathematics plays a greater role in these works &mdash; it provides the inspiration and the foundation upon which they are constructed. A prominent feature of the exhibit is its display of fractals, objects from a non-Euclidean geometry. Fractals &mdash; sharing a root with fracture and fraction &dash; have been called the geometry of nature by Mandelbrot, who discovered their capability to describe the non-smooth world in which we live. Fractal geometry, which is new to us, has shed light on old things &mdash; things like the historical record of water levels in the Nile river for instance. And in its turn the computer has shed light on fractals, allowing the underlying beauty of what may seem to be dry-as-dust mathematics to shine through. Works like Blessed State or Steps to Infinity provide evidence of the profound connection that seems to exist between fractals and the natural world. It is fitting that this collection of computer-related art comes to us in large part through the internet (the World Wide Web). Although Daryl Hepting is now at SFU, his works are distributed widely across the internet. In addition to Hepting's collaborations with Musgrave (George Washington University), Prusinkiewicz (University of Calgary), Saupe (University of Freiburg), and Snider (University of Regina), the computer-based works come from: - Contours of the Mind: A Celebration of Fractals, Feedback and Chaos - SITO: the operative term is \"stimulate\" - The Fractals Calendar The other pieces in this exhibit remind the viewer that the computer is responsible for only a portion of all mathematical art. The works of M. C. Escher and Marjorie Rice offer a beautiful expression of this fact. Partial financial support for the exhibit at Harbour Centre was provided by the British Columbia Ministry for Employment and Investment. Fiery Dragon by Daryl H. Hepting Martin Gardener tells the story of how this curve, first discovered by John E. Heighway, used by William G. Harter as a decoration symbolic of cryptic structure, and later analysed by them and another colleague, Bruce A. Banks. Though its final structure is complex, its description is not. The following two transformations are required to generate this shape: xform scale { sqrt(2)/2 } rotate -45 xform scale { sqrt(2)/2 } rotate 135 translate 1.0 0.0 Beginning with a single point, the whole curve can be generated by repeated application of these two transformations. This specification of the shape in terms of contractive, affine transformations is called an iterated function system (IFS). This image of a dragon curve was created by covering with disks (spheres) the parts of the plane which do not include the fractal. These parts are determined by computing the minimum distance from a point P to the fractal. If this distance is d, then a disk of radius d can be drawn about the point P and all points inside that disk are known not to belong to the fractal. Like many of my other works, I've used rayshade to ray-trace this image. This process creates the final image (which you see above) by simulating a camera inside the computer. Dragon Mesa (1989) by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Dietmar Saupe, and Daryl H. Hepting Steps to Infinity (1994) by Daryl H. Hepting and F. Kenton Musgrave The steps in this image come from a dragon curve, like the one seen on the poster for this event (and described in the notes for Fiery Dragon. Below, I show two different colourings for a dragon curve in the plane. The curve is made up of smaller and smaller copies of itself, as the colourings indicate. There are two transformations which define the dragon curve each small dragon seen above can be described by a sequence of these two transformations. To create the steps, I've assigned a unique height to each small dragon. Below, I show the steps inside a white sphere, which represents the sky. It doesn't look much like a very believable sky here, but I'll fix that. The lighting I've used here is much simpler than in the final image and it shows. If you look carefully at Steps to Infinity, you will notice (part of) a Mandelbrot set in the sky, amongst the clouds. I began with a portion of the Mandelbrot set, shown below. It may be familiar to you from Ken Musgrave's image on the cover of the 1994 Fractals Calendar. In this case, I've changed to colours more appropriate for a blue sky. For the next step, I've mapped the square image onto the inside of a white sphere, which will represent the dome of the sky in the model of my scene. Notice that this image is considerably lighter than the first, and this is due only to the white colour of the original sphere. I create some clouds for the sky by using a fractal texture function which selects blues and whites for each pixel based on something called fractional Brownian motion. When the clouds are combined with the Mandelbrot set image, the final Mandelbrot sky image comes to life. And the final image once again... Desktop Tetrahedron (1990) by Daryl H. Hepting and Allan Snider Carrot in Blue (1991) by Daryl H. Hepting and Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz Fractal Emblem (1992) by Daryl H. Hepting Splash (1993) by F. Kenton Musgrave The Great Fern Dune (1994) by Daryl H. Hepting Blessed State (1988) by F. Kenton Musgrave Captivating Rhythm (1995) by Daryl H. Hepting This image is based on a fractal which is similar to the one used to create Fiery Dragon and Steps to Infinity. This curve is also defined by two transformations, but with slightly different parameters: xform scale 0.618 /* Dragon scales by approximately .7071 */ rotate -137.5 xform scale -0.618 rotate 137.5 translate 1.0 0.0 This image is an interpretation of the process by which the points of the plane are captured by the transformations in the description of the curve to form the actual curve. I've assigned an initial point to each of the two transformations and I apply the transformations to their respective points and then to the results, over and over again. As I compose the transformations into longer and longer strings, the contractivity of each composite transformation increases. These \"stronger\" transformations capture more and more of the plane. As the strength of a transformation increases, a cone under that transformation gets wider and shorter. The upper black and white image above shows one possible colouring for the image used to construct Captivating Rhythm. Each band corresponds to a different level of \"capture\", increasing away from the curve. The reverse of \"capture\" (lower left above) is \"escape\" (lower right above). Notice how the arrangement of disks differs between them. The image below shows another way to view the same data, ultimately selected for the final image. Here, I have broken up what were solid bands in the earlier image by using information about which transformation was applied at a particular time. In creating the final image, I applied a fractional Brownian motion texture and added an outline of the fractal. Untitled by Stan Ostoja-KotkowskI Fractal World (1994) by L.

    "text": "# {{page.breadcrumb}} Nature is filled with a beauty easily perceived at many levels. Trees and forests, rocks and mountains, streams and mighty rivers, wisps of fog and great billowing clouds all contribute to an immediate, undeniable impression upon our visual sense. Although the impression may be hard to quantify, it is no less real. Artists often use poetry, paintings, or photographs in an attempt to communicate this impression of beauty. All these forms share in that they are patterns &mdash; of words, pigment or light &mdash; which gain permanence as they are connected with ideas. In this way, mathematicians also make patterns with permanence. To understand nature, we must also understand the language with which it speaks to us. Galileo said that this language is mathematics \"its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.\" The attempt to understand nature on the basis of mathematical patterns has a long tradition, which includes Pythagoras and Kepler. Though scientists since may have generally agreed with Galieo's statement, they found the triangles and circles of Euclid's geometry to be limiting. Mandelbrot acknowledged that: clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line ... and he provided an alternative with fractal geometry. Mandelbrot coined the word fractal from the Latin root fractus to capture the rough, broken and irregular characteristics of the objects he intended to describe. In fact, this roughness can be present at all scales, which distinguishes fractals from Euclidean shapes. In the twenty-odd years since its introduction, fractal geometry has found a wide purview. Fractals seem to be everywhere, as the word fractal is now used to describe the universe and some of the very smallest things in it. Fractals, which belong to Galileo's realm of \"other geometrical figures,\" add a very rich vocabulary for describing nature concisely. Now, the ruggedness of a coastline and the roughness of a rock can be quantified. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; This calendar celebrates the deep symbiotic relationship between fractal geometry and computer graphics, which has grown as each nascent field has developed. The use of computer graphics for the study of fractals represents one of the first applications in the now popular realm of scientific visualization. As mathematical objects of infinite complexity, the detail of fractals can only be appreciated with the help of computers and this dependence represents the epitomy of scientific visualization's goal to see the unseen. Apart from fractals with geometric constructions, the computer is also essential in the study of systems which exhibit fractal behavior over time. Here, computer-generated fractal images provide a glimpse of nature not so easily seen, one filled with deterministic chaos. Many physical systems are governed by deterministic laws, yet behave unpredictably. The unpredictability comes from sensitive dependence on initial conditions &mdash; two states which begin arbitrarily close together may become arbitrarily far apart after a finite period of time. Though the rules which define them are exceedingly simple, the complexity of shape is derived from repetition of those rules at a level that only the computer can manage. Computer graphics allows the communication of this complexity, with an eloquence not possible through words alone. Surprisingly, even these abstract images can appear organic and natural. Many of those who know of fractals were introduced to them through this application of computer graphics. With the increase of available computing power, the rewards and dangers of exploring the Mandelbrot set have become more evident. Arthur C. Clarke, in Ghost of the Grand Banks, speculates that in the future, Mandelmania will become a serious affliction for many. A sense of fractals can be gained without the computer, as nature abounds with forms possessing fractal characteristics. Although the largest and smallest examples of these cannot be seen by the naked eye, many remain easily accessible. More formally, fractals can be seen as abstractions of the natural qualities found in mountains, trees, and clouds. This process of abstraction leads to algorithms which allow computer graphics to produce astounding forgeries of nature that capture our impressions. One hopes that the result of the computer graphics process, approached from either of the above perspectives, is a pleasing picture. Each image may be created with a different purpose in mind, but ultimately the pictures are a means for effective communication of the material. And if the picture is pretty enough, it may even help to convince some of the beauty in mathematics. After seeing computer-generated pictures of fractals, some people will ask if there are any real uses of fractal geometry. In this case, it is important to emphasize the connection of the images to the reality just beyond the computer screen. *** There are many examples of the struggle to evaluate and apply the new idea of fractals and acceptance has not been unanimous. Mandelbrot gave a tentative mathematical definition for his discovery, but many have been concerned by its lack of precision. Then again, who could argue with the beautiful images, produced from simple equations, like the famous: Zn+1 = Zn2 + C which defines the Mandelbrot set. Natural objects possess detail at several levels but manufactured objects generally do not. In becoming focused on or bound to a particular scale, an important connection with nature is lost. Self-similarity is the key to much of the detail in natural forms. Similarity, in a mathematical sense, means that objects may differ only in size or position but not shape. Self-similarity means then that parts have the same shape as the whole. Fractals may also possess the self-similarity in a statistical or approximate sense, as many natural objects do. In its simplest form, fractal dimension can be said to measure the degree of this similarity. Experience has shown that it is difficult to be precise when defining fractals. Mandelbrot's original definition based solely on dimension was considered too narrow, but Falconer has tried to capture the essence of what it is to be fractal. He has done this by adopting the approach of the biologist who would define life &mdash; most living things possess certain properties, most of the time. In the case of fractals, these properties are: - a fine structure, - too much irregularity to be described in traditional geometric language, both locally and globally, - some form of self-similarity, perhaps approximate or statistical, - a \"fractal dimension\"(somehow defined) which is greater than its topological dimension, and - a simple definition, perhaps recursive. The connection to the definition of life seems appropriate, since fractals have been linked at many levels with nature and life. Even the human body exhibits fractals in its most basic functions, both spatially and temporally: in the circulatory system, the respiratory system, and at the cellular level across nerve membranes. It is remarkable that fractal geometry, born in an abstract mathematical universe, has come to have such an impact in our own physical one. *** Although one may appreciate equally the beauty of the Mandelbrot set and a mountainous landscape, it is not always easy to see a unifying theme if it even exists. One may understand the recipes for generating images of the Mandelbrot set, but it is quite another matter to see fractals when looking away from the computer screen. It is revolutionary to think that fractals really are much more than the pictures which represent them and it may be more reasonable to view fractals only as isolated curiosities. Is fractal geometry a set of techniques for computer graphics or a new way to look at the world? Many of those involved with fractal geometry advocate the latter, but in order to arrive there from the former position, a significant transition must take place. Several paths may be followed, for example: - abandon the need for a precise definition of fractal. Considering Falconer's list of properties, fractals elude any narrow characterization which may be applied. - view an image of the Mandelbrot set as a symbol for the processes which created it. Simple rules, applied recursively, yield complex results. - examine Mandelbrot's early work (soon to be available in his Selecta) which did not have the benefit of elaborate graphics to show its beauty. From the diversity of his early studies, one can grasp the connections that Mandelbrot made which prompted him to define the new geometry. - begin to see the self-similarity in nature which plants, trees, mountains and clouds exhibit, and find fractals represented therein. Once the process has begun, it becomes possible to develop an eye for fractals. Although fractals are used mainly in physics, they have appeared of late in such diverse areas as aesthetics and psychology, indicating again that fractals are a very powerful idea. As researchers have struggled with the implications of fractals and chaos, so too have philosophers and artists. Just as the flapping of a single butterfly's wings may affect global weather patterns, the actions of any individual may have far-reaching implications. These changes in world view are already being echoed in the arts. Historically, the introduction of a new geometry has been inspirational for artists. Although fractal geometry is significantly different from Euclid's, the challenge may be to understand how these different puzzle pieces fit together. Fractal art is in a unique position since computers wait to become a widely accepted artistic medium. The procedural, or algorithmic nature of fractal art places it at a crossroads between mathematics and art &mdash; a fertile ground waiting to be fully explored. But more than just in visual arts, fractals are being actively explored in books, television, motion pictures, dance, theatre and music. In fact, a great deal of music exhibits the fractal distribution of 1/f noise over time, a sort of middle ground between unstructured white noise and highly structured brown noise. It contains enough structure to be regular, and enough variation to be surprising. An early example of fractally-informed music with computer-generated fractal imagery was Mandelbrot and Wuorinen's experimental performance entitled New York Notes. *** Fractals, as a language of nature, give a new understanding of the finite world around us and provide a glimpse of infinity. Represented in this calendar is a collection of exciting and diverse fractal images. The Mandelbrot set is depicted in some interesting new ways. Both deterministic and random fractals are represented &mdash; some closely related to their mathematical roots. I hope you will be encouraged to explore fractals in new ways.",

    "text": "# {{ page.title }} I take my teaching seriously and I am always willing to hear from students about ways that I can improve. As a sign of this commitment, I provide a link to my reviews on ratemyprofessors.com . If you are interested in learning about me and my teaching, please read on. I give my students the opportunity to provide their written feedback to me at exam times (midterms and final), using my own feedback instrument There are nine 5-level Likert items , with which students are invited to evaluate statements about me as the instructor, on the dimension of frequency. For example, the statement &ldquo;The instructor is well-prepared for class.&rdquo; can be rated as follows: Value Label [implied] Comment 5Alwaysvery positive 4[Mostly]positive 3[Sometimes]neutral 2[Rarely]negative 1Neververy negative The levels of each Likert item are symmetrical (equal number of positive and negative levels around the neutral centre) and balanced (there is equal perceptual distance from the centre, &lsquo;Sometimes&rsquo;, for the pairs &lsquo;Always&rsquo; and &lsquo;Never&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mostly&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rarely&rsquo;) There are also three open-ended questions that students are invited to complete. Midterm feedback is formative (I will look at these results immediately and discuss them with my students) and final feedback is summative (I will not look at these until my grades have been submitted). The Faculty of Science also collects summative feedback about my teaching. My goal is to post to this website all the feedback response data that I receive. I provide a numerical summary of the Likert items and I transcribe responses to each of the open-ended questions. I compute a single number that is the percentage of agreement, over those nine Likert items, with the rating &lsquo;Always&rsquo;. {% include teaching/feedback-data.html %}",

    "text": "# {{ page.breadcrumb }} The mark awarded for each group assignment is shared by all group members. However, you have the ability to communicate extra information about your the performance of your group members to your group members, to the marker, and to me. For each group assignment, you are encouraged (but not required) to rate your group members by allocating 100 (or 99, in the case of a group with 3 members contributing equally) points amongst them (including yourself). Allocating points for a group assignment will provide evidence of your participation in the course. * If all group members contribute equally, allocate the points equally to each group member. * If you feel that all members of your group have not contributed equally, allocate the 100 points unequally and explain why you have done this. * If you provide a group rating, please be thoughtful as you undertake this activity. * If you decide to not provide a rating, it will be as if you had made an equal allocation of your 100 points. The points allocated to each group member are summed. The point total for each group member is divided by the largest total, to give a rating between 0.5 and 1 (any rating that is calculated to be less than 0.5 is set to 0.5). The group member who was allocated the most points will receive a rating of 1, which means 100% of the earned mark for the group assignment. If all group members have the same point total, all will receive 100% of the earned mark for the group assignment. The lowest rating allowed is 0.5 and that means the group member should receive 50% of the earned mark for the group assignment. The ratings are suggestions to me and information to you about your involvement in your group. * Use the \"Rate your group on...\" link on URcourses, for the appropriate assignment, and use the form provided here to help you to format your submission. * You can see your rating from the group in URcourses via the link labelled \"See Your Rating From Group\".

    "title": "A Picture’s Worth",
    "text": "# {{ page.breadcrumb }} What does the phrase &ldquo;A picture is worth ten thousand words&rdquo; mean to you? Does it become more or less meaningful if it was written by an advertising executive, a newspaper publisher, or an ancient sage? I embarked on an exploration into the origins of this phrase in 1999 as part of my doctoral work (A New Paradigm for Exploration in Computer-Aided Visualization). It was important for me to use the phrase correctly and so I wanted to know whether a picture was worth 1,000 or 10,000 words. Various versions of the phrase, and stories about its origin, are in circulation. This page seeks to trace its history. For their help with the original version of the page, I thank Dona Bubelis of the Seattle Public Library, Ellen Chamberlain of the University of South Carolina, and Dr. Paul Lester of California State University Fullerton ( A Picture's Worth a Thousand Words?). In 1999, credit for the phrase seemed to belong to Frederick R. Barnard, National Advertising Manager for the Street Railways Advertising Company (offices then in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco). The maxim which is popular today seemed to originate as &ldquo;One look is worth a thousand words&rdquo;, and appeared in a 1921 advertisement by Barnard. He chose to modify the saying for a 1927 advertisement, where it took on its more famous form. The two advertisements appeared in the advertising trade journal called Printers' Ink (now known as Marketing/Communications). March 10, 1927 (pp. 114-115) &ldquo;One Picture is Worth Ten Thousand Words&rdquo;. This advertisement uses the specific example of a baking soda ad campaign seemingly done by Barnard's firm. The basic message is the same as the earlier ad, though perhaps Barnard hoped it would be more compelling as a Chinese proverb. December 8, 1921 (pp. 96-97) &ldquo;One Look is Worth A Thousand Words&rdquo;. This advertisement talks generally about the benefits about advertising with pictures on street cars. Confusion between whether a picture is worth 1,000 or 10,000 words may stem from a 1948 entry in The MacMillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims and Famous Phrases ( formerly known as the The Home Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Familiar Phrases ) is an early and very informative source about the phrase. Editor Burton Egbert Stevenson made the following entry on page 2611 of that volume: One look is worth a thousand words. Fred R. Barnard, in Printers' Ink, 8 Dec., 1921, p. 96. He changed it to &ldquo;One picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; in Printers' Ink, 10 March 1927, p. 114, and called it &ldquo;a Chinese proverb&rdquo;, so that people would take it seriously. It was immediately credited to Confucious. This entry establishes the link between the two advertisements, but this source misquotes the 1927 advertisement and thereby creates &ldquo;One picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo;. Familiar Quotations: a collection of passages, phrases, and proverbs traced to their sources in ancient and modern literature by John Bartlett also provides information. Stevenson's error is repeated on page 782 of the 16th edition (edited by Justin Kaplan and published by Little, Brown in 1992) where it credits &ldquo;One picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; as a misattributed &ldquo;Chinese proverb&rdquo; and references part of the entry from the 1948 edition edited by Stevenson. \"Nice guys finish seventh\": false phrases, spurious sayings, and familiar misquotations by Ralph Keyes and published in 1992 by HarperCollins has a similar account to that of Stephenson. Keyes, however, adds his own twists to the story because the phrase \"One picture is worth a thousand words\" does not appear anywhere in the 1921 ad: Calling an orphan saying a Chinese proverb gives it a cachet with very little risk that its actual source will be discovered. A deliberate exploitation of this syndrome involved the proverb `One picture is worth a thousand words.' This saying first appeared in a 1921 ad in Printer's Ink [sic] which was written by publicist Frederick Barnard. Barnard headlined his ad `One look is worth a thousand words.' He attributed this maxim to `a famous Japanese philosopher.' Six years later, Barnard revised the saying to read `One picture is worth ten thousand words,' and then republished it in the same magazine as a `Chinese proverb.' Barnard thought his ploy would give his words added weight. He was right. For a time, Bartlett's identified Barnard's line as `a Chinese proverb.' Other sources attributed his proverb to Confucius. The Macmillan Dictionary of Quotations had it both ways. They cited Barnard as the maxim's author, adding `Ascribed to Chinese origin.' Keyes' book identified several rules of misquotation and the one of which he and several others have been guilty he calls numbernesia: getting the words right but the numbers wrong. The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase, Saying, and Quotation is one reference which has the correct attribution (but without any of the story). The phrase has endured to become an American proverb, appearing on page 465 of A Dictionary of American Proverbs, edited by Mieder, Kingsbury, and Harder and published by the Oxford University Press in 1992. Current opinion would remove Mr. Barnard from the picture (pun intended). There is now a wikipedia article entitled &ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; that is focused much more broadly than this page. In updating this page, I came across a wonderful account of the history of this expression written by William Safire for his column On Language for the New York Times Magazine. Worth a Thousand Words was published on 7 April 1996. If you have more information about the origins of this quotation (or the stories that surround it), please send me e-mail and I will update this page accordingly. ### Sources * [Newspaper Copy That People Must Read]({{\"/assets/projects/pdf/pw-printers-ink-1911-apr-20.pdf\" | relative_url}}) {%comment%}{% include project-related-works.html %}{% endcomment %}",

    "text": "# Funding ### NSERC Discovery Grants Personalization of interaction based on discovered constructs (2012-2016) Summary Eyewitness identification is often highly regarded by the legal system, yet it is not always accurate. An identification may be compromised if the words used to describe the target face impair the witness' memory of that face (verbal overshadowing) or if the witness sees so many photos that he or she may identify a photo as the target face when it is actually similar to one of the early photos viewed (inaccurate source attribution). Faces of a race different than the witness may cause additional difficulties (cross-race effect). In order to improve the accuracy of eyewitness identification, these sources of inaccuracies must be mitigated. Verbal overshadowing may be addressed by using only non-verbal means to ask for recognition, rather than recall, of the target face. Inaccurate source attribution may be ameliorated by reducing the number of candidate photos presented to a witness. In order to meaningfully achieve this reduction, it is necessary to understand how a particular witness judges similarity between photos so that a computer-based presentation can be personalized accordingly. My research to date indicates that people employ one of at least two different strategies when judging facial similarities. I seek to democratize accurate identification of faces by: understanding the different strategies that people may use to judge facial similarity; developing a concise means of testing which strategy a witness is likely to apply; developing a computer interface that makes use of a witness' identified strategy to allow accurate identification of the target face, while viewing as few candidate photos as possible; and developing an extensible system to manage and store candidate photos for use with the interface. My research to date has used a set of 356 photos (178 Caucasian and 178 First Nations to allow for examination of cross-race effect), which participants have sorted based on how they each judge similarity. This work will contribute to eyewitness identification by providing better tools for witnesses and by providing a basis for understanding which faces may be more or less easy to identify. The same techniques can be used to study interaction with fractal images, which has applications for democratization of multimedia composition. &nbsp; Democratization and personalization for information access (2006-2010) Summary Computer software should conform to its users and not the other way around. Although this phrase is often repeated, it seems to carry little weight today: users are regularly told of the need to use standard processes and software. My research explores an alternative view: let software deal with each user on their own terms and then let it manage the translation of each user's work into the terms of the others with whom he or she needs to collaborate. Democratization means that any user will be able to have satisfying and meaningful interactions and explorations of their chosen problem domains. Personalization means that each user is able to interact with the tool in a way that mirrors his or her own concept of the problem. Knowledge acquisition techniques will be used to discover each user's concept of a problem without requiring its explicit naming with a possibly unfamiliar vocabulary. User experiences will be more satisfying, hence more helpful to democratization, if the personalization phase can be as short as possible. I have developed applications in the areas of information visualization, recipe browsing, environmental decision support systems, eyewitness identification, and multimedia composition. I am seeking techniques to understand, as directly and as efficiently as possible, how any given individual conceives of a problem. I plan to take this understanding or knowledge and make it available for manipulation by that individual through my software, called cogito. This interface is intended to allow and support a user's exploration of that information, enabling him or her to manage and even transform the space (by changing the order in which decisions are made, for example) until the desired results are obtained. People will bring their diverse applications or problems to the cogito system and they will have satisfying experiences exploring them. Technology can, I believe, be more powerfully used when it augments individuals seeking personally-creative solutions and helps those individuals to communicate those ideas to others. &nbsp; Conceptual spaces: theory and tools (2002-2005) Summary In 1960, J. C. R. Licklider looked to a time when humans and computers would work in intimate association and saw it as being \"intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind.\" Back then, Licklider found that up to 85% of his \"’thinking’ time was devoted mainly to activities that were essentially clerical or mechanical ... operations that can be performed more effectively by machines than by men.\" Although many of these tasks are now done by computers, many software programs still keep their users from their work by requiring them to be tooinvolved in clerical or mechanical details. In an era when so much is done by computers, humans are still needed to deal with the problems that require their personal creative input. These problems are harder to deal with, and as such only experts are likely to tackle them. My research focuses on developing appropriate computer-based tools to support the experts in working on these problems, and to encourage more participation from more people in exploring and evaluating alternative solutions to these hard problems. The tools in which I am particularly interested use visual interfaces to remove the requirement of computer expertise from their users and to explore and evaluate all the available solutions. Such interfaces address the problem when a user, searching for a solution, says \"I’ll know it when I see it\" but has no other way to specify it. The notion of a conceptual space, defined with the help of a programmer, is a way for the user to build a vocabulary to talk about his or her problem. In this way, my work seeks to change the relationship between users and programmers rather than put programmers out of work. To develop these tools, I will rely on the study of software users to refine my own software and ideas. Widespread acceptance and use of this type of tool will go a long way to realizing Licklider’s vision, meaning that computer use will become more productive and more rewarding.",

    "text": "# Inspirations In short, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with (other) enthusiasts for artificial intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant future of cerebration to machines alone. There will nevertheless be a fairly long interim during which the main intellectual advances will be made by men and computers working together in intimate association. A multidisciplinary study group, examining future research and development problems of the [United States] Air Force, estimated that it would be 1980 before developments in artificial intelligence make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving of military significance. That would leave, say, five years to develop man-computer symbiosis and fifteen years to use it. The fifteen may be ten or five hundred, but those years should be intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind. &nbsp; J. C. R. Licklider in Man-Computer Symbiosis, 1960 &nbsp; When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe. &nbsp; John Muir in My First Summer in the Sierra, 1911 &nbsp; There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, &lsquo;Morning, boys, how's the water?&rsquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, &lsquo;What the hell is water?&rsquo; &nbsp; David Foster Wallace in This is Water, 2005 &nbsp; When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again. &nbsp; Steve Jobs in Video interview from Santa Clara Valley Historical Association, 1995 &nbsp; In our culture we spend a lot of time with the how. We've become a culture of technocrats and all we do is become technicians asking &lsquo;how do we do this?&rsquo;. Nobody stands back and asks &lsquo;why?&rsquo;. &nbsp; Joel Salatin in How to Eat Well AND Save Our Planet, 2008 &nbsp; There are no passengers on Spaceship Earth. We are all crew. &nbsp; Marshall McLuhan, 1911-1980",

    "text": "# {{ page.breadcrumb }} The mark awarded for each group assignment is shared by all group members. However, you have the ability to communicate extra information about your group members' performance to your group members, to the marker, and to me. For each group assignment, you are encouraged to allocate 100 points amongst your group members (including yourself). The place to do this is a link in URcourses labelled something like \"Submit Group Rating\", just below the link for the assignment that you have just submitted. If all group members contribute equally, you would distribute the points equally to each group member. If some group members contribute more or less than others, you would reflect this in the amount of points allocated to each group member. Please undertake this activity responsibly and explain why you have not allocated points equally. The total points that you allocate amongst your group members should equal 100. If a group member does not providing a rating, their allocation of points is taken as equal. However, allocating points for each portion of group work will provide evidence of your participation. The points allocated to each group member are summed. The point sum for each group member is divided by the largest sum, so the group member who was allocated the most points will receive the full mark earned for the assignment. If all group members were allocated the same number of points, all will receive the full mark earned for the assignment. The lowest rating allowed is 0.5, even if the calculated would be lower. You can see your rating from the group in URcourses via the entry labelled \"See Your Rating From Group\". The value available there corresponds to the \"Computed Rating from Group\" in the examples below. Following the examples, a calculator form is provided.

    "text": "# {{ page.breadcrumb }} ### Short version - Challenge my students to think deeply and behave ethically. ([inspired by the story of Martina Fitzgerald's recollections about Gord Downey and their high school English teacher](http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/fitzgerald-gord-downie-memories-1.3723317)[for good measure, on [web.archive.org]( http://web.archive.org/web/20160901030823/http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/fitzgerald-gord-downie-memories-1.3723317)]) ### Longer version My objectives as a teacher are simple. I seek to: - inspire students to see that the subject itself is worthy of study and critical reflection and not just for a good mark in the course. To this end, I often share with students the following excerpt of a commencement speech given by David Foster Wallace: “There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, ‘Morning, boys, how's the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, ‘What the hell is water?’”. I encourage students to ask “why?” as well as “how?”. - provide students with application knowledge of the subject, that goes beyond rote knowledge. I seek to use current examples that we discuss and work through together. - make a connection with every student. I know that in any class, there will be those who will pass or fail despite whatever I may do. I also know that in each class there are people with whom I can make a difference and for them especially, I create a friendly atmosphere that is supportive of learning. - provide a concrete structure for students in terms of well-defined expectations and within this structure; I work to find opportunities for innovation. - encourage my students to take responsibility for their classroom experience - respect and honour the perspective of each student \"The Courage to Teach: Exploring the Inner Landscape of a Teacher's Life\" is the title of a book written by Parker J. Palmer. I can see myself when Palmer writes that \"most of us arrive at a sense of self and vocation only after a long journey through alien lands\". Palmer also writes that \"good teaching cannot be reduced to technique; good teaching comes from the identity and integrity of the teacher\". As I progress on my own journey, I have been able to take these words to heart. I remain open to new alternatives for the design of my course meetings and I appreciate Palmer's use of paradoxes to design teaching and learning spaces that: are bounded and open; are hospitable and \"charged\"; invite the voice of the individual and the voice of the group; honour the \"little\" stories of the students and the \"big\" stories of the disciplines and tradition; support solitude and surround it with the resources of the community; and welcome both silence and speech. I love teaching. My goal is to \"challenge my students to think deeply and behave ethically\". In order to assess my success in achieving this goal I use my own instrument to collect student evaluations of my teaching (to get formative feedback at midterm and summative feedback at the end of term). However I have understood my limitations, I have worked to get past them. As I have understood the concept of a growth mindset, I have worked to adopt it. Carol Dweck, who conducted the research and developed the concept, gave a wonderful presentation: \"[The Power of Believing That You Can Improve](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)\". Steve Jobs, [in a 1995 interview from the Santa Clara Valley Historical Association](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw), demonstrates a growth mindset: \"When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.\" In my experience, vulnerability (see Brené Brown on \"[The Power of Vulnerability](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability?language=en)\") and confidence are required. In \"[How to Build Your Creative Confidence](https://www.ted.com/talks/david_kelley_how_to_build_your_creative_confidence?language=en)\", David Kelley connects the two. I don't know when, or if, any student will the attach adjective “good” to my teaching, but I know that my journey is on the right path.",

For more information or to reserve seats at the lecture, call 291-5100. An exhibition of art based on mathematical principles and ideas. Fractals, more so than other areas of mathematics, are visually exciting in a very real way. Fractals are a language with which to describe the geometry of nature. Images of fractals can be an important access to mathematics and surrounding philosophical questions. Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Teck Gallery (Room 1305). Interactive computer displays for visitors to experiment with making their own fractal designs; investigate E-Gems, a project to design math and science electronic games (Counting on Frank, one of their products, was chosen by PC Magazine as one of the top 100 CD-ROMs for 1995); and check out the math education and art resources available on the Internet. Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Segal Centre (Room 1430). Ingenious mathematical amateurs. It is possible for someone without formal credentials to make contributions to mathematics. Well-known artist M.C. Escher and unknown homemaker Marjorie Rice both tackled mathematical problems, developing unorthodox notation that was essential to their methodical investigations. Each worked alone, essentially in secret, rewarded by the exhilaration of finding answers to a large puzzle. Lecture by Dr. Doris Schattschneider, Professor (Emerita) of Mathematics, Moravian College. 5 &dash; 6 pm in the Fletcher Challenge Canada Theatre (Room 1900). We'd like to thank our sponsors, Simon Fraser University, the Canadian Mathematical Society, and the British Columbia Ministry of Employment and Investment.
