    "text": "Newspaper Copy that People Must Read ADVERTISING’S RELATION TO THE GROWTH OF READING ABILITY — THE THUNDERSTORM AND “YELLOW” JOURNALISM — AN EXAMPLE OF THE POWER OF COMPARISON IN WRITING By Arthur Brisbane. [NOTE. — The following are extracts from an address by Mr. Brisbane, editor of the New York Evening Journal, before the Syracuse (N. Y.) Advertising Club.] Advertising men should remember with pride and satisfaction that this is the first generation that can read. When I was a boy on the farm the servant that could read was the exception. I had a colored servant recently who could neither read nor write, but his brother was valedictorian at college. The person who cannot read now is almost a curiosity. Advertising men represent our speech on a big scale. Publicity, advertising, is to the human race what speech is to the individual. For many ages man lived with out speech. The individuals learned by experience and then died, and the next had to learn all over again. Then man acquired the art of speech, and the art of printing and finally the art of reading. Newspapers are in their infancy — they have only just begun. The most difficult and the most useful thing, whether in an editorial or an advertisement, is that it be such as the man who reads must understand, not can understand, but must. Tell the story quickly. Speaking of yellow journalism, I once addressed a body of Presbyterian clergymen, who admitted they did not like black type, red ink and colored supplements. I referred them to a storm which had gathered and children who had heeded the black cloud and scampered away to shelter. “That sky was being edited by a great journalist,” I told them; “He used black type” “Do vou see that black cloud?” I asked. “It’s the blackest I ever saw. The editor of that is in earnest. Soon you will see streaks of light. That’s our red ink. Then comes the rainbow. That’s our colored supplement. I only regret that I cannot put the thunder on the front page.” Let me tell you of the value of comparison: If I show you a picture of a pebble half an inch high on a magazine page and ask you how high it is, you cannot tell. But if I put a housefly beside it twice as large as the pebble, you say it is a grain of sand. If I take out the fly and put a man on horseback on top of the pebble you say it is a bowlder. If I take out the horse and man and paint a sea with ship which appears small beside it, you say it is a mountain. When you write and can find an exact comparison, you give an exact idea. I don’t like to talk in the abstract, and God forbid that I should ever be called scholarly. Use a picture. It’s worth a thousand words. Use a picture with five words, a comparison in thirty words. Here are ten lines from “Macbeth,” the most striking example of comparison I know: To-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow, Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time, And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle, Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more; it is a tale Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing. That’s the way to write stuff. If you can write like that, your name is Shakespeare.",

    "title": "“One Look is Worth a Thousand Words”",
    "text": "“One Look is Worth a Thousand Words” So said a famous Japanese philosopher, and he was right — nearly everyone likes to “read” pictures. “Buttersweet is Good to Eat” is a very short phrase but it will sell more goods if presented, with an appetizing picture of the product, to many people morning, noon and night, every day in the year than a thousand word advertisement placed before the same number of people only a limited number of times during the year. Good advertising for a trade marked product is nothing more nor less than the delivery of favorable impressions for it, and it does not make any difference whether they are delivered through newspaper, magazine or street car advertising. No man or woman ever picks up a newspaper or magazine or enters a street car wondering what Heinz, Postum, Campbell, or Cream of Wheat is offering — all the national advertiser can hope for is that his advertisement will be bumped into accidentally. It is simply the preponderance of favorable impressions for a meritorious product that reminds the consumer to buy it again and again. We deliver many millions of advertising impressions every day. The cars on our list carry more than 10,000,000,000 passengers a year. F. R. Barnard National Advertising Manager STREET RAILWAYS ADVERTISING CO.

It reminded all mothers every day of a sure way to give a treat to their own children. And hundreds of thousands got an extra thrill with their next cake making because of the happy expression of the boy on the car card. The moral of the story is that the same influence could not be created even with the same picture in any other advertising medium. In the magazines, the reminder would not be often enough to change the average housewife’s baking habit. In the newspapers, with no color, there would be no appetite appeal. On a twenty-four sheet poster, seen only for a few seconds at a time, the great appeal of the expression on the boy’s face would be lost.",

    "text": "PARC Algorithmic Art Show (1994) (from http://www.parc.xerox.com/csl/members/bern/algoart.html) Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier, JFK-MM Algorithmic Art Algorithmic art is rule-based art, usually made with the aid of a computer. Algorithmic visual art sits somewhere between mathematical art and computer graphics. Mathematical artists usually show individual timeless objects, such as topological models, whereas algorithmic artists focus on process, the sequence of steps used to create the work. Computer artists usually use standard algorithms (for example, those available in Photoshop), whereas algorithmic artists invent new algorithms and leave them quite visible. Computer artists typically cede less, or at least later, control to automatic processes than do algorithmic artists. Xerox PARC hosted an algorithmic art show in 1994 with about 20 artists from four different countries. Computer scientist Donald Knuth showed pictures of Leaper graphs, generalizations of a knight’s tour. Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier created JFK-MM, shown above, with a computer program that found “optimal” placements of Marilyn Monroe pixels within an image of John F. Kennedy. Anna Campbell Bliss showed Jumping Koi at Lake Truchet, a nice blend of algorithmic and “manual” art in which a random Truchet tiling (squares with two quarter-circles apiece) represents a lake. Yoshiyuki Abe showed LS-51, which was made by ray-tracing a scene with many light sources and then separately remaindering R, G, and B values by a modulus. Yoshiyuki Abe, LS-51 The PARC jury (Marshall Bern, Paul DeMarinis, Andrew Glassner, Rich Gold, and Natalie Jeremijenko) tried to avoid fractals — too cliche! — but we found Daryl Hepting’s dragons and Eleanor Kent’s fractal knit baby blankets irresistable. Similarly, we accepted a number of Stewart McSherry’s ray-traced pictures, even though we thought his work fit the category of computer graphics more closely than algorithmic art. Finally, we included some art about algorithms, rather than made by algorithms. George Legrady’s Equivalents II converted keywords into clouds. Kerny McLaughlin’s Portrait of TKM gave a well-defined algorithm for turning a person into a golf course. The illustration shows the result of running the algorithm on the artist’s father, and the calligraphed text below gives pseudocode. Portrait of TKM quietly exploded our preconceptions of “algorithmic art”. &lt;img class=\"img-fluid rounded\" style=\"height: 364px\" src=\"/~hepting/assets/projects/img/parc-golf.jpg\" alt=\"Portrait of TKM /&gt; Kerny McLaughlin, Portrait of TKM This page updated September 1998 / bern@parc.xerox.com",

    "title": "MATH-ART at SFU Teck Gallery (1995)",
    "text": "In honour of the 1995 Canadian Math Society Winter Meeting, Simon Fraser University presents: MATH-ART: 9 December 1995 — 24 January 1996 Scroll down for more information about the exhibit (those images on a yellow background have extra information about how they were created). Postcard advertising events on opening day: December 9, 1995 Introduction Mandates of art galleries are many, but the mandate that immediately defines a university gallery is the mandate that a gallery demonstrates the aesthetic dimensions of academic disciplines. It was to this end that Simon Fraser Gallery mounted its first math art exhibition, EXPLORING THE IMAGE WORLD OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS works by Daryl Hepting (and others from the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab in the School of Computing Science), in the W.A.C. Bennett Gallery, May 30 to July 26, 1994. Daryl Hepting, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Computing Science and one of the four curators of this exhibition, knows the connections between computers and aesthetics as few in Simon Fraser University can. He takes us on a short course on math art in the notes on these digital graphics. Other members of Simon Fraser University who joined me in curating this exhibition were Dr. Katherine Heinrich, Chair of Mathematics &amp; Statistics and Dr. Malgorzata Dubiel of the same department. These eighteen images were selected from scores of possible images so as to represent the complexities and contrasts of visual aesthetics that are possible in digital graphics. They were also selected to represent the images that are available from three sources on the WORLD WIDE WEB (internet): computer art exhibits, pioneer publications, and computer images created by Daryl Hepting of Simon Fraser University. Simon Fraser Gallery is grateful for the assistance of Gallery staff, Daryl Hepting and the other curators for making this exhibition possible. It is also grateful to the Graphics and Mulimedia Research Lab for production assistance. The Teck and Simon Fraser Galleries are honoured to support the Department of Mathematics &amp; Statistics in hosting the Canadian Mathematical Society 1995 Winter Meeting. Dr. Edward Gibson, Director, December 1995. Notes on Exhibition The majority of works in this exhibition represent a collection which rely on the computer for their existence. And the computer involves mathematics to describe, manipulate, and translate even the simplest scenes into the forms we see here. The involvement of mathematics plays a greater role in these works — it provides the inspiration and the foundation upon which they are constructed. A prominent feature of the exhibit is its display of fractals, objects from a non-Euclidean geometry. Fractals — sharing a root with fracture and fraction &amp;dash; have been called the geometry of nature by Mandelbrot, who discovered their capability to describe the non-smooth world in which we live. Fractal geometry, which is new to us, has shed light on old things — things like the historical record of water levels in the Nile river for instance. And in its turn the computer has shed light on fractals, allowing the underlying beauty of what may seem to be dry-as-dust mathematics to shine through. Works like Blessed State or Steps to Infinity provide evidence of the profound connection that seems to exist between fractals and the natural world. It is fitting that this collection of computer-related art comes to us in large part through the internet (the World Wide Web). Although Daryl Hepting is now at SFU, his works are distributed widely across the internet. In addition to Hepting’s collaborations with Musgrave (George Washington University), Prusinkiewicz (University of Calgary), Saupe (University of Freiburg), and Snider (University of Regina), the computer-based works come from: Contours of the Mind: A Celebration of Fractals, Feedback and Chaos SITO: the operative term is “stimulate” The Fractals Calendar The other pieces in this exhibit remind the viewer that the computer is responsible for only a portion of all mathematical art. The works of M. C. Escher and Marjorie Rice offer a beautiful expression of this fact. Partial financial support for the exhibit at Harbour Centre was provided by the British Columbia Ministry for Employment and Investment. Fiery Dragon by Daryl H. Hepting Martin Gardener tells the story of how this curve, first discovered by John E. Heighway, used by William G. Harter as a decoration symbolic of cryptic structure, and later analysed by them and another colleague, Bruce A. Banks. Though its final structure is complex, its description is not. The following two transformations are required to generate this shape: xform scale { sqrt(2)/2 } rotate -45 xform scale { sqrt(2)/2 } rotate 135 translate 1.0 0.0 Beginning with a single point, the whole curve can be generated by repeated application of these two transformations. This specification of the shape in terms of contractive, affine transformations is called an iterated function system (IFS). This image of a dragon curve was created by covering with disks (spheres) the parts of the plane which do not include the fractal. These parts are determined by computing the minimum distance from a point P to the fractal. If this distance is d, then a disk of radius d can be drawn about the point P and all points inside that disk are known not to belong to the fractal. Like many of my other works, I've used rayshade to ray-trace this image. This process creates the final image (which you see above) by simulating a camera inside the computer. Dragon Mesa by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz, Dietmar Saupe, and Daryl H. Hepting Steps to Infinity (1994) by Daryl H. Hepting and F. Kenton Musgrave The steps in this image come from a dragon curve, like the one seen on the poster for this event (and described in the notes for Fiery Dragon. Below, I show two different colourings for a dragon curve in the plane. The curve is made up of smaller and smaller copies of itself, as the colourings indicate. There are two transformations which define the dragon curve each small dragon seen above can be described by a sequence of these two transformations. To create the steps, I've assigned a unique height to each small dragon. Below, I show the steps inside a white sphere, which represents the sky. It doesn't look much like a very believable sky here, but I'll fix that. The lighting I've used here is much simpler than in the final image and it shows. If you look carefully at Steps to Infinity, you will notice (part of) a Mandelbrot set in the sky, amongst the clouds. I began with a portion of the Mandelbrot set, shown below. It may be familiar to you from Ken Musgrave's image on the cover of the 1994 Fractals Calendar. In this case, I've changed to colours more appropriate for a blue sky. For the next step, I've mapped the square image onto the inside of a white sphere, which will represent the dome of the sky in the model of my scene. Notice that this image is considerably lighter than the first, and this is due only to the white colour of the original sphere. I create some clouds for the sky by using a fractal texture function which selects blues and whites for each pixel based on something called fractional Brownian motion. When the clouds are combined with the Mandelbrot set image, the final Mandelbrot sky image comes to life. And the final image once again... Desktop Tetrahedron (1990) by Daryl H. Hepting and Allan Snider Carrot in Blue (1991) by Daryl H. Hepting and Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz Fractal Emblem (1992) by Daryl H. Hepting Splash (1993) by F. Kenton Musgrave The Great Fern Dune (1994) by Daryl H. Hepting Blessed State (1988) by F. Kenton Musgrave Captivating Rhythm (1995) by Daryl H. Hepting This image is based on a fractal which is similar to the one used to create Fiery Dragon and Steps to Infinity. This curve is also defined by two transformations, but with slightly different parameters: xform scale 0.618 /* Dragon scales by approximately .7071 */ rotate -137.5 xform scale -0.618 rotate 137.5 translate 1.0 0.0 This image is an interpretation of the process by which the points of the plane are captured by the transformations in the description of the curve to form the actual curve. I've assigned an initial point to each of the two transformations and I apply the transformations to their respective points and then to the results, over and over again. As I compose the transformations into longer and longer strings, the contractivity of each composite transformation increases. These \"stronger\" transformations capture more and more of the plane. As the strength of a transformation increases, a cone under that transformation gets wider and shorter. The upper black and white image above shows one possible colouring for the image used to construct Captivating Rhythm. Each band corresponds to a different level of \"capture\", increasing away from the curve. The reverse of \"capture\" (lower left above) is \"escape\" (lower right above). Notice how the arrangement of disks differs between them. The image below shows another way to view the same data, ultimately selected for the final image. Here, I have broken up what were solid bands in the earlier image by using information about which transformation was applied at a particular time. In creating the final image, I applied a fractional Brownian motion texture and added an outline of the fractal. Untitled by Stan Ostoja-KotkowskI Fractal World (1994) by L.

    "text": "1995 About the cover: Floating in space, this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity. At once, it appears natural and yet somehow unnatural, perhaps a testament to the familiarity of fractals. Amidst the fractal clouds, the sky reveals part of the omnipresent Mandelbrot set. I edited the 1995 Fractals / 1996 The Art of Fractals calendar as a Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University. The calendar featured contributed images from Danielle Bercel, Michael Field, Martin Golubitsky, John C. Hart, F. Kenton Musgrave, and Lewis N. Siegel. This calendar was completed with the assistance of the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics and the Graphics and Multimedia Research Laboratory at Simon Fraser University. Earlier work was done at the University of Regina and at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center. There are many to whom I continue to be grateful, but especially B. Mandelbrot, K. Musgrave, P. Prusinkiewicz, D. Saupe, and R. Voss. January: Snowflake in Winter by Daryl H. Hepting von Koch's snowflake curve, an early mathematical monster, is depicted here in friendlier surroundings. The blue visible amidst the spheres is what remains after an algorithm to cover the complement of the fractal is applied. It works by finding the minimum distance of d of a point x from the fractal then drawing a disk of radius (maybe less than) d centered at x. Since any point already inside a disk cannot be part of the fractal, the algorithm progresses quickly as the complement is covered by disks. The spheres are the three-dimensional extensions of those disks. A fractal texture is applied to the spheres to create snowballs &mdash; the making of which is a common pastime during long Canadian winters. The snowflake curve is based on an equilateral triangle, of which each side is divided into three parts then replaced by four parts of the same length, and so on. February: Chaotic Quilt by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky Although chaos would seem to be the antithesis of symmetry, it is possible to find elaborate symmetric patterns in chaotic processes. Shown here is a hexagonal pattern similar to those that sometimes appear on quilts. This image is produced by iterating a map with hexagonal symmetry. Although the iteration possesses all the features of chaos, a surprisingly detailed and intricate symmetric pattern appears when we take a very large number of iterations &mdash; in this case about six billion &mdash; and color each pixel according to the number of times it is visited during iteration. In this sense we are computing an averaged picture. The colors themselves were chosen for their artistic effect. Note that the detail inside each of the hexagons happens to resemble a flower. The fractal quality of the picture is to some extent represented by the reappearance of the hexagonal symmetry on ever-decreasing scales. March: The Great Fern Dune by Daryl H. Hepting This fern dune is one of the natural wonders on this distant world. The fern leaf is defined by a set of linear transformations, sometimes called an iterated function system. The sand dune which surrounds the leaf was created by evaluating a so-called escape-time function for the fern and subsequently interpreting the values as heights. The escape-time function works by determining whether a point escapes membership in the fern, and if so then how quickly. The fern shape at the top of the dune reveals the accuracy with which that question was answered here. More points are included than might otherwise be expected since it is easier to exclude points than verify their membership. The scene is made more believable by the use of fractal textures for the clouds, moon and sand. The technique for interpreting function values as heights is effective for adding a third dimension to two-dimensional data, and has been employed to great advantage in many earlier fractal images. April: Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing, Variation #1 by Danielle Bercel This image is the result of a two-year metamorphosis from the image shown below [not shown], entitled Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing. The title of these images is a partial quote from Karen Blixen's novel Out of Africa. From inspection, one may see that both pictures depict the same fractal and that they share virtually all the same coordinates and parameters. The roles of color and black (or monotones) between the two images are reversed. Areas black in Variation #1 were colored according to logarithmic function in the original and monotone areas in the original received an algorithmic coloring. The form of the original is still visible in Variation #1, but it has been de-emphasized. The images are based on a variation of the usual formula describing Julia sets: zn+1 = zn2 + c, where one may adjust the value of c (a complex number) as a parameter to obtain different images. In the variation, a function is added to the mix and becomes another parameter for manipulation: zn+1 = f(zn) + zn2 + c. For these images, the conjugate of a cosine function was used. While I still prefer the original picture, as a parent might feel for a child, it appears that almost everyone who has seen both of these pictures prefers Variation #1. May: Mandelbloom by Lewis N. Siegel (with thanks to Randy Hudson and Daryl H. Hepting) It has been observed, by Mandelbrot and others,that fractal forms are found abundantly in nature. In this spirit, Mandelbloom shows natural forms occurring in a fractal. The image was created with a method used to show how the Mandelbrot set evolves over time. To create an image of the Mandelbrot set, points in the complex plane are iterated according to the well known function Zn+1 = Zn2 + C. The structure in Mandelbloom comes from an attempt to capture the movement of these points at a particular moment in time. In traditional renderings of the Mandelbrot set, each point in the plane is iterated until it escapes from the neighborhood of the origin, or reaches an upper limit. The number of iterations is then utilized to generate a color for the pixel which represents that point. In Mandelbloom, each point is instead iterated exactly the same number of times, and each point's location in the plane is used to color the pixel. With this method, a procedural texture is used to associate a color with every point in the complex plane. Rather than calculating colors for the pattern, color values are read from bitmaps of either the stem or the rose. June: Humble Aspirations by Daryl H. Hepting (with thanks to F. David Fracchia) In the midst of the harsh surroundings, a lone tree struggles for life. Each element of the scene modeled here employs fractals to shift attention from the mathematical details of the model to the illusion which it creates. The terrain is created from instances of a height field derived from a planar linear fractal, [not] shown below. The density of the fog which covers this desolate land is modulated by a fractal function. The tree, though idealized, does incorporate some observations from nature which, along with a wood texture, add to its realism. Every branch in the tree is created by linearly transforming the trunk. Beginning with a very concise description, the model is expanded to include over 150,000 primitives for rendering. July: Untitled #7 by Danielle Bercel This image takes a portion of the standard Mandelbrot set as its starting point. The portion chosen, shown at a relatively low magnification factor of 414 in Untitled #7 n-2 (top image below [not shown]), seems rather boring with little to recommend it. However, at a magnification factor of about 40,000, as seen in Untitled #7 n-1 (bottom image below [not shown]), this same location reveals the familiar shape of the Mandelbrot set and its lake. Even at relatively low magnifications, images of fractals can be made more interesting by bringing out other details and the main image is the result applying one such technique. Points outside the Mandelbrot set will \"escape\" to infinity after some number of iterations, and this number is usually called the escape time (points which have not escaped after the maximum allowed number of iterations are considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set). Traditionally in images of the Mandelbrot set each point represented in the image is colored according to this value, but I have also experimented with several alternatives. One may determine the color by making use of the real component of the location at which the point was deemed to have escaped (the Mandelbrot set resides on the complex plane and so each point on the plane has both real and imaginary components). Another technique which can be used to determine color is based on the quadrant of the complex plane in which escaped points first land. The result is a sort of curved-space checkerboarding of color, as points belonging to a single contour may take on any one of four colors depending on the point of departure for the escaping point. To this, an additional logarithmic coloring algorithm is applied to produce smooth color transitions. August: Fractal Quilt by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky Fractals can be created to mimic the real world and they can also be used as a source of pattern generation. Combining fractal methods with symmetry leads to a method for creating many kinds of repeating patterns. The seventeen different symmetry types of planar repeating patterns were classified formally by Federov in 1891 &mdash; but their existence has been known for centuries. Indeed, each of these patterns appears in the Alhambra, a group of buildings overlooking the city of Granada that was constructed by the Moors in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Only more recently have mathematicians considered how many different ways there are to construct two-color planar repeating patterns &mdash; there are forty-six possibilities. A two-color repeating pattern is one in which half the symmetries of the figure preserve the colors while half the symmetries interchange colors. Fractal methods have been used to create this large two-color fractal quilt. It is amusing to check whether you can, in fact, identify all of the symmetries in this figure. (Besides the translations, there are eight symmetries &mdash; four preserve colors and four interchange them.) September: A Crop Circle on the Palouse by John C. Hart (with thanks to Gordon Farrell and Philip Peterson) This image demonstrates recent advances in computer graphics at modeling supernatural phenomena. This crop circle, that might have otherwise been the result of a UFO encounter, as actually created using a technique called procedural geometric instancing. It allows a new representation for procedural models, which are typically translated into simpler polygonal representations for rendering. The usual unorganized polygonal representations can be unmanageable due to size. Procedural geometric instancing encapsulates procedural components into the geometric representation, which are evaluated on demand during rendering. The crop circle, containing over 100 million primitives, was specified by a short description file which represents the field of wheat with a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) hierarchy of instances of a single wheat stalk which may or may not bend over, depending on the location into which it is instanced. Given this position, a simple lookup in a low-resolution \"crop map\" of the Mandelbrot set determines whether the UFO should bend the stalk or not. October: Dragon's Lair by Daryl H. Hepting A dragon curve is captured here in what may be its natural habitat. The brooding dragon curve remains after its complement has been covered by the blocks which form the walls which enclose it. The primitives are not spheres, as before, since the Manhattan distance function is used in place of the usual Euclidean. This means that distance is calculated x+y rather than x2 + y2 and so diamonds in the Manhattan metric fill the same role as circles in the Euclidean metric. To create the third dimension in this image, boxes with height proportional to the size of the original diamonds were used. The sharpness of these boxes and their shadows provide an interesting contrast to the apparent roughness of the dragon curve, created with a fractal texture. November: Barque by F. Kenton Musgrave A shortcoming of computer-generated images is often that they lack the level of visual complexity of a photograph or a painting. An impressionist painting, for instance, can have a rich variety of color in each brush stroke; furthermore, paintings always have a textured surface, and a painter is likely to modulate the color of an otherwise flat field of color, such as a blue sky. In Barque a variety of fractal methods are used to obtain similar visual complexity. First, we start with a fractal mountain and fractal water, as seen in the image [not shown] below. Then a fractal color perturbation, as seen in the second image below, is applied to the mountain and to the sky. Finally, a fractal post-processing filter is applied to the image to create a pointillist effect. This filter samples the color of the image at a particular location, perturbs that color with a fractal distribution, then replaces a small area with a spot of the perturbed color. December: Snowflake in Winter by Daryl H. Hepting and F. Kenton Musgrave Floating in space, this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity. Each step in the staircase is both a small copy of the whole shape and a collection of many smaller copies of itself, which illustrates the key concept of self-similarity. The fractal, called a dragon curve, is formed by iteration of just two linear transformations. Each step in the staircase can be identified by a common sequence of transformation applications. By labeling the transformations with 0 and 1 and recording how they are applied, one can associate a binary number with each step &mdash; used here to assign heights. The staircase looks somehow natural but the shape is more regular than would be found in nature. Like many fractal objects, it possesses a sense of familiarity. The clouds in the sky are also fractal, but they represent an example of stochastic fractals &mdash; in contrast to deterministic fractals like the staircase or the omnipresent Mandelbrot set.",

    "text": "A Path to Fractals Nature is filled with a beauty easily perceived at many levels. Trees and forests, rocks and mountains, streams and mighty rivers, wisps of fog and great billowing clouds all contribute to an immediate, undeniable impression upon our visual sense. Although the impression may be hard to quantify, it is no less real. Artists often use poetry, paintings, or photographs in an attempt to communicate this impression of beauty. All these forms share in that they are patterns — of words, pigment or light — which gain permanence as they are connected with ideas. In this way, mathematicians also make patterns with permanence. To understand nature, we must also understand the language with which it speaks to us. Galileo said that this language is mathematics “its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.” The attempt to understand nature on the basis of mathematical patterns has a long tradition, which includes Pythagoras and Kepler. Though scientists since may have generally agreed with Galieo’s statement, they found the triangles and circles of Euclid’s geometry to be limiting. Mandelbrot acknowledged that: clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line … and he provided an alternative with fractal geometry. Mandelbrot coined the word fractal from the Latin root fractus to capture the rough, broken and irregular characteristics of the objects he intended to describe. In fact, this roughness can be present at all scales, which distinguishes fractals from Euclidean shapes. In the twenty-odd years since its introduction, fractal geometry has found a wide purview. Fractals seem to be everywhere, as the word fractal is now used to describe the universe and some of the very smallest things in it. Fractals, which belong to Galileo’s realm of “other geometrical figures,” add a very rich vocabulary for describing nature concisely. Now, the ruggedness of a coastline and the roughness of a rock can be quantified. ——— This calendar celebrates the deep symbiotic relationship between fractal geometry and computer graphics, which has grown as each nascent field has developed. The use of computer graphics for the study of fractals represents one of the first applications in the now popular realm of scientific visualization. As mathematical objects of infinite complexity, the detail of fractals can only be appreciated with the help of computers and this dependence represents the epitomy of scientific visualization’s goal to see the unseen. Apart from fractals with geometric constructions, the computer is also essential in the study of systems which exhibit fractal behavior over time. Here, computer-generated fractal images provide a glimpse of nature not so easily seen, one filled with deterministic chaos. Many physical systems are governed by deterministic laws, yet behave unpredictably. The unpredictability comes from sensitive dependence on initial conditions — two states which begin arbitrarily close together may become arbitrarily far apart after a finite period of time. Though the rules which define them are exceedingly simple, the complexity of shape is derived from repetition of those rules at a level that only the computer can manage. Computer graphics allows the communication of this complexity, with an eloquence not possible through words alone. Surprisingly, even these abstract images can appear organic and natural. Many of those who know of fractals were introduced to them through this application of computer graphics. With the increase of available computing power, the rewards and dangers of exploring the Mandelbrot set have become more evident. Arthur C. Clarke, in Ghost of the Grand Banks, speculates that in the future, Mandelmania will become a serious affliction for many. A sense of fractals can be gained without the computer, as nature abounds with forms possessing fractal characteristics. Although the largest and smallest examples of these cannot be seen by the naked eye, many remain easily accessible. More formally, fractals can be seen as abstractions of the natural qualities found in mountains, trees, and clouds. This process of abstraction leads to algorithms which allow computer graphics to produce astounding forgeries of nature that capture our impressions. One hopes that the result of the computer graphics process, approached from either of the above perspectives, is a pleasing picture. Each image may be created with a different purpose in mind, but ultimately the pictures are a means for effective communication of the material. And if the picture is pretty enough, it may even help to convince some of the beauty in mathematics. After seeing computer-generated pictures of fractals, some people will ask if there are any real uses of fractal geometry. In this case, it is important to emphasize the connection of the images to the reality just beyond the computer screen. There are many examples of the struggle to evaluate and apply the new idea of fractals and acceptance has not been unanimous. Mandelbrot gave a tentative mathematical definition for his discovery, but many have been concerned by its lack of precision. Then again, who could argue with the beautiful images, produced from simple equations, like the famous: Zn+1 = Zn2 + C which defines the Mandelbrot set. Natural objects possess detail at several levels but manufactured objects generally do not. In becoming focused on or bound to a particular scale, an important connection with nature is lost. Self-similarity is the key to much of the detail in natural forms. Similarity, in a mathematical sense, means that objects may differ only in size or position but not shape. Self-similarity means then that parts have the same shape as the whole. Fractals may also possess the self-similarity in a statistical or approximate sense, as many natural objects do. In its simplest form, fractal dimension can be said to measure the degree of this similarity. Experience has shown that it is difficult to be precise when defining fractals. Mandelbrot’s original definition based solely on dimension was considered too narrow, but Falconer has tried to capture the essence of what it is to be fractal. He has done this by adopting the approach of the biologist who would define life — most living things possess certain properties, most of the time. In the case of fractals, these properties are: a fine structure, too much irregularity to be described in traditional geometric language, both locally and globally, some form of self-similarity, perhaps approximate or statistical, a “fractal dimension”(somehow defined) which is greater than its topological dimension, and a simple definition, perhaps recursive. The connection to the definition of life seems appropriate, since fractals have been linked at many levels with nature and life. Even the human body exhibits fractals in its most basic functions, both spatially and temporally: in the circulatory system, the respiratory system, and at the cellular level across nerve membranes. It is remarkable that fractal geometry, born in an abstract mathematical universe, has come to have such an impact in our own physical one. Although one may appreciate equally the beauty of the Mandelbrot set and a mountainous landscape, it is not always easy to see a unifying theme if it even exists. One may understand the recipes for generating images of the Mandelbrot set, but it is quite another matter to see fractals when looking away from the computer screen. It is revolutionary to think that fractals really are much more than the pictures which represent them and it may be more reasonable to view fractals only as isolated curiosities. Is fractal geometry a set of techniques for computer graphics or a new way to look at the world? Many of those involved with fractal geometry advocate the latter, but in order to arrive there from the former position, a significant transition must take place. Several paths may be followed, for example: abandon the need for a precise definition of fractal. Considering Falconer’s list of properties, fractals elude any narrow characterization which may be applied. view an image of the Mandelbrot set as a symbol for the processes which created it. Simple rules, applied recursively, yield complex results. examine Mandelbrot’s early work (soon to be available in his Selecta) which did not have the benefit of elaborate graphics to show its beauty. From the diversity of his early studies, one can grasp the connections that Mandelbrot made which prompted him to define the new geometry. begin to see the self-similarity in nature which plants, trees, mountains and clouds exhibit, and find fractals represented therein. Once the process has begun, it becomes possible to develop an eye for fractals. Although fractals are used mainly in physics, they have appeared of late in such diverse areas as aesthetics and psychology, indicating again that fractals are a very powerful idea. As researchers have struggled with the implications of fractals and chaos, so too have philosophers and artists. Just as the flapping of a single butterfly’s wings may affect global weather patterns, the actions of any individual may have far-reaching implications. These changes in world view are already being echoed in the arts. Historically, the introduction of a new geometry has been inspirational for artists. Although fractal geometry is significantly different from Euclid’s, the challenge may be to understand how these different puzzle pieces fit together. Fractal art is in a unique position since computers wait to become a widely accepted artistic medium. The procedural, or algorithmic nature of fractal art places it at a crossroads between mathematics and art — a fertile ground waiting to be fully explored. But more than just in visual arts, fractals are being actively explored in books, television, motion pictures, dance, theatre and music. In fact, a great deal of music exhibits the fractal distribution of 1/f noise over time, a sort of middle ground between unstructured white noise and highly structured brown noise. It contains enough structure to be regular, and enough variation to be surprising. An early example of fractally-informed music with computer-generated fractal imagery was Mandelbrot and Wuorinen’s experimental performance entitled New York Notes. Fractals, as a language of nature, give a new understanding of the finite world around us and provide a glimpse of infinity. Represented in this calendar is a collection of exciting and diverse fractal images. The Mandelbrot set is depicted in some interesting new ways. Both deterministic and random fractals are represented — some closely related to their mathematical roots. I hope you will be encouraged to explore fractals in new ways.",

    "text": "Evaluation I take my teaching seriously and I am always willing to hear from students about ways that I can improve. As a sign of this commitment, I provide a link to my reviews on ratemyprofessors.com. If you are interested in my teaching, please also look at the other sources described here. I give my students the opportunity to provide their written feedback to me at exam times (midterm and final). Midterm feedback is formative (I will look at these results immediately and discuss them with my students) and final feedback is summative (I will not look at these until my grades have been submitted). Feedback Instrument The Faculty of Science also collects summative feedback about my teaching. Whereas this was once done on paper during class time, it is now done online during the students’ own time. I am undertaking the posting to the web of the feedback that I receive. I provide a numerical summary of each data set and word cloud summaries of the responses to each of the open-ended questions on my feedback instrument. I understand why “word clouds considered harmful” by some, in some cases. I think that they are appropriate here because they are engaging and allow a different way to look at the text. I use https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/ to generate the word clouds and save them in SVG for the web. I don’t do any processing on the text that I create while transcribing the responses. My instrument and the one from the Faculty of Science have mostly different questions and different scales. My scale has 5 points (Always — Never) and the Faculty of Science scale has 4 points (Strongly Agree — Strongly Disagree). For both, higher scores are better. I compute the Weighted Rating for a course offering by multiplying each of the two summative scores by the number of respondents who determined that score, summing the results and dividing by the total number of respondents. The result is expressed as a percentage.",

This is a super weak course, there is little to no content. We mostly watching ted talks and videos from the 90's. Discussion is frequent but instructor is not good at dealing with off-topic or derailing conversation. Several class members do not understand social cues or appropriate ways to discuss things and frequently interjected and derailed things or dominated the class with what should have been 1-on-1 conversation. The course usually deals with the interface between users and computers, As well as it mainly focuses on behavioral science, computer science and other fields of study in sciences. The course’s group project assignments are a great opportunity to apply class material and get to know other students. This course is fine as it is. There are insignificant drawbacks, but they mainly come from Dr. Hepting's nature, so I find criticising the course pointless. It is appreciated by the absolute majority of students, I hereby guarantee that. Identify what you perceive to be the main strengths and weaknesses of the instructor. Instructor explains every chapter with real-time examples where it would be easy for every student to understand and gives more space to work as a group. None. Putting on ted-talks and talking about elevators or your trip to IKEA for several classes is not very stimulating or informative. He also has allowed the marker to completely stop marking things. We have only gotten 1 assignment marked and it is the end of the semester tomorrow! We haven't even gotten the midterm back. PRO: Dr. Hepting has significantly improved his communication with students in past years. Removal of Piazza as useless and janky interaction platform and shift to URCourses as the unified course action platform is a remarkable improvement. I appreciate the &hellip; CON: Lack of clarity, his undecisiveness and huge pauses between phrases in lecture performance are still an issue. Please work on decision-making and presentation performance. I am strongly convinced that Dr. Hepting possesses a lot of useful knowledge, it is just his communication bottleneck that scares people off at times. The instructor has creative assignment ideas and is always willing to help students in need. Comment on the value of the textbooks and the assignments in the course. If there was a textbook for this class I didn't buy it. It would have been useless. The assignments are filler junk that do not reaffirm learning nor teach anything new. Individual/group Assignments given by instructor are very useful for every student to work as a team and information given in textbooks are very keen to understand. Meh, whatever. Not really much to say here. Students were encouraged to resort to external sources that they find useful. And I think that is correct. Please keep it that way, it works for everyone. That is fine. The length of time it takes to have an assignment marked and returned to us was unacceptable. Here we are in the last week and the midterm has not been marked. Most of the assignments have also not been marked. This is unacceptable. The textbook and assignments help apply class concepts and the instructor’s lecture material. Any other relevant suggestions? No Teach this class in a room without a projector and let someone else make the instructor's syllabus",

CLICK HERE to toggle details he is kind and willing to help the students organization he was really friendly, a very organized person communication and encoruaging students to participate instructors greatest strengths are he understand students properly respectful; knowledgeable; listens to student input; able to make changes in himself/course if needed; cool and good! he's very respectful of students stimulating discussion and encouraging participation his teaching skills relevant knowledge about the course the instructor is always open to discussion and has a great sense of humour! he encourages student participation instructor's greatest strength is the feedback from us; he has provided discussion forum for all the meeting in order to solve the problems which we are facing; he helped us in all best possible ways calm, easy, good instructor, enjoyed this class he is a cool guy ability to engage students by giving out maps to redesign and show videos of design implementations his teaching philosophy NA good at starting conversation about topics; good at thinking outside of the box his rapport with students and the respect that he gives them; makes class discussion actually feel like a discussion and not an interrogation stays up-to-date, provides real-world examples engaging the class in discussion strong vocabulary that can remove confusion (sometimes make it though) NA encouraging students to think outside the box NA ??? and always try to understand the students and help; great knowledge NA engaging but not intimidating the instructor has more knowledge about the subject one of the best instructors, he is very polite and calm and understand students situation and very co-ooperative with his students NA the friendly and joyful nature and clarity of thoughts clear expectations relating real life design problem with what is taught in course and discussions in class ease to present and make course easy to learn and score his patience while explaining every silly question and tough question asked by students simplicity and clarity NA experience, way of teaching, and encouraging nature the way he presents his thoughts through videos, etc.; treat students kindly and encourages discussions informative, knowledgeable, and helpful the instructor allows the students to express their view and ideas about a topic and does not try to force his view on students his knowledge of design methodology and ability to critique interfaces of all kinds giving respect to student opinions about everything listening to and respecting students NA smart; available outside of class; kind he broadens our perception without making us realize that we are broadening it and being creative. I never knew when I step out of my comfort zone until very end. It was like a Christopher Nolan movie where you make all the sense in the end; ability to reach, encourage students; empathy he encourages students to implement their own ideas. He supports student ideas communicate with students carry students along and make students to think deeply thought process and conveying ideas subtly; the ability to engage students in discovering their own creativity and potential",

    "text": "Funding NSERC Discovery Grants Personalization of interaction based on discovered constructs (2012-2016) Summary Eyewitness identification is often highly regarded by the legal system, yet it is not always accurate. An identification may be compromised if the words used to describe the target face impair the witness' memory of that face (verbal overshadowing) or if the witness sees so many photos that he or she may identify a photo as the target face when it is actually similar to one of the early photos viewed (inaccurate source attribution). Faces of a race different than the witness may cause additional difficulties (cross-race effect). In order to improve the accuracy of eyewitness identification, these sources of inaccuracies must be mitigated. Verbal overshadowing may be addressed by using only non-verbal means to ask for recognition, rather than recall, of the target face. Inaccurate source attribution may be ameliorated by reducing the number of candidate photos presented to a witness. In order to meaningfully achieve this reduction, it is necessary to understand how a particular witness judges similarity between photos so that a computer-based presentation can be personalized accordingly. My research to date indicates that people employ one of at least two different strategies when judging facial similarities. I seek to democratize accurate identification of faces by: understanding the different strategies that people may use to judge facial similarity; developing a concise means of testing which strategy a witness is likely to apply; developing a computer interface that makes use of a witness' identified strategy to allow accurate identification of the target face, while viewing as few candidate photos as possible; and developing an extensible system to manage and store candidate photos for use with the interface. My research to date has used a set of 356 photos (178 Caucasian and 178 First Nations to allow for examination of cross-race effect), which participants have sorted based on how they each judge similarity. This work will contribute to eyewitness identification by providing better tools for witnesses and by providing a basis for understanding which faces may be more or less easy to identify. The same techniques can be used to study interaction with fractal images, which has applications for democratization of multimedia composition. &nbsp; Democratization and personalization for information access (2006-2010) Summary Computer software should conform to its users and not the other way around. Although this phrase is often repeated, it seems to carry little weight today: users are regularly told of the need to use standard processes and software. My research explores an alternative view: let software deal with each user on their own terms and then let it manage the translation of each user's work into the terms of the others with whom he or she needs to collaborate. Democratization means that any user will be able to have satisfying and meaningful interactions and explorations of their chosen problem domains. Personalization means that each user is able to interact with the tool in a way that mirrors his or her own concept of the problem. Knowledge acquisition techniques will be used to discover each user's concept of a problem without requiring its explicit naming with a possibly unfamiliar vocabulary. User experiences will be more satisfying, hence more helpful to democratization, if the personalization phase can be as short as possible. I have developed applications in the areas of information visualization, recipe browsing, environmental decision support systems, eyewitness identification, and multimedia composition. I am seeking techniques to understand, as directly and as efficiently as possible, how any given individual conceives of a problem. I plan to take this understanding or knowledge and make it available for manipulation by that individual through my software, called cogito. This interface is intended to allow and support a user's exploration of that information, enabling him or her to manage and even transform the space (by changing the order in which decisions are made, for example) until the desired results are obtained. People will bring their diverse applications or problems to the cogito system and they will have satisfying experiences exploring them. Technology can, I believe, be more powerfully used when it augments individuals seeking personally-creative solutions and helps those individuals to communicate those ideas to others. &nbsp; Conceptual spaces: theory and tools (2002-2005) Summary In 1960, J. C. R. Licklider looked to a time when humans and computers would work in intimate association and saw it as being \"intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind.\" Back then, Licklider found that up to 85% of his \"’thinking’ time was devoted mainly to activities that were essentially clerical or mechanical ... operations that can be performed more effectively by machines than by men.\" Although many of these tasks are now done by computers, many software programs still keep their users from their work by requiring them to be tooinvolved in clerical or mechanical details. In an era when so much is done by computers, humans are still needed to deal with the problems that require their personal creative input. These problems are harder to deal with, and as such only experts are likely to tackle them. My research focuses on developing appropriate computer-based tools to support the experts in working on these problems, and to encourage more participation from more people in exploring and evaluating alternative solutions to these hard problems. The tools in which I am particularly interested use visual interfaces to remove the requirement of computer expertise from their users and to explore and evaluate all the available solutions. Such interfaces address the problem when a user, searching for a solution, says \"I’ll know it when I see it\" but has no other way to specify it. The notion of a conceptual space, defined with the help of a programmer, is a way for the user to build a vocabulary to talk about his or her problem. In this way, my work seeks to change the relationship between users and programmers rather than put programmers out of work. To develop these tools, I will rely on the study of software users to refine my own software and ideas. Widespread acceptance and use of this type of tool will go a long way to realizing Licklider’s vision, meaning that computer use will become more productive and more rewarding.",

    "title": "A Picture’s Worth",
    "text": "A Picture’s Worth What does the phrase “A picture is worth ten thousand words” mean to you? Does it become more or less meaningful if it was written by an advertising executive or an ancient sage? I embarked on an exploration into the origins of this phrase in 1999 as part of my doctoral work (A New Paradigm for Exploration in Computer-Aided Visualization). It was important to use the phrase correctly and so I wanted to know whether a picture was worth 1,000 or 10,000 words. Various versions of the phrase, and stories about its origin, are in circulation. This page seeks to trace its history. For their help with the original version of the page, I thank Dona Bubelis of the Seattle Public Library, Ellen Chamberlain of the University of South Carolina, and Dr. Paul Lester of California State University Fullerton ( A Picture’s Worth a Thousand Words?). In 1999, credit for the phrase seemed to belong to Frederick R. Barnard, National Advertising Manager for the Street Railways Advertising Company (offices then in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco). The maxim which is popular today seemed to originate as “One look is worth a thousand words”, and appeared in a 1921 advertisement by Barnard. He chose to modify the saying for a 1927 advertisement, where it took on its more famous form. The two advertisements appeared in the advertising trade journal called Printers’ Ink (now known as Marketing/Communications). March 10, 1927 (pp. 114-115) &ldquo;One Picture is Worth Ten Thousand Words&rdquo;. This advertisement uses the specific example of a baking soda ad campaign seemingly done by Barnard's firm. The basic message is the same as the earlier ad, though perhaps Barnard hoped it would be more compelling as a Chinese proverb. December 8, 1921 (pp. 96-97) &ldquo;One Look is Worth A Thousand Words&rdquo;. This advertisement talks generally about the benefits about advertising with pictures on street cars. Confusion between whether a picture is worth 1,000 or 10,000 words may stem from a 1948 entry in The MacMillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims and Famous Phrases ( formerly known as the The Home Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Familiar Phrases ) is an early and very informative source about the phrase. Editor Burton Egbert Stevenson made the following entry on page 2611 of that volume: One look is worth a thousand words. Fred R. Barnard, in Printers' Ink, 8 Dec., 1921, p. 96. He changed it to &ldquo;One picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; in Printers' Ink, 10 March 1927, p. 114, and called it &ldquo;a Chinese proverb&rdquo;, so that people would take it seriously. It was immediately credited to Confucious. This entry establishes the link between the two advertisements, but this source misquotes the 1927 advertisement and thereby creates “One picture is worth a thousand words”. Familiar Quotations: a collection of passages, phrases, and proverbs traced to their sources in ancient and modern literature by John Bartlett also provides information. Stevenson’s error is repeated on page 782 of the 16th edition (edited by Justin Kaplan and published by Little, Brown in 1992) where it credits “One picture is worth a thousand words” as a misattributed “Chinese proverb” and references part of the entry from the 1948 edition edited by Stevenson. “Nice guys finish seventh”: false phrases, spurious sayings, and familiar misquotations by Ralph Keyes and published in 1992 by HarperCollins has a similar account to that of Stephenson. Keyes, however, adds his own twists to the story because the phrase “One picture is worth a thousand words” does not appear anywhere in the 1921 ad: Calling an orphan saying a Chinese proverb gives it a cachet with very little risk that its actual source will be discovered. A deliberate exploitation of this syndrome involved the proverb `One picture is worth a thousand words.' This saying first appeared in a 1921 ad in Printer's Ink [sic] which was written by publicist Frederick Barnard. Barnard headlined his ad `One look is worth a thousand words.' He attributed this maxim to `a famous Japanese philosopher.' Six years later, Barnard revised the saying to read `One picture is worth ten thousand words,' and then republished it in the same magazine as a `Chinese proverb.' Barnard thought his ploy would give his words added weight. He was right. For a time, Bartlett's identified Barnard's line as `a Chinese proverb.' Other sources attributed his proverb to Confucius. The Macmillan Dictionary of Quotations had it both ways. They cited Barnard as the maxim's author, adding `Ascribed to Chinese origin.' Keyes’ book identified several rules of misquotation and the one of which he and several others have been guilty he calls numbernesia: getting the words right but the numbers wrong. The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase, Saying, and Quotation is one reference which has the correct attribution (but without any of the story). The phrase has endured to become an American proverb, appearing on page 465 of A Dictionary of American Proverbs, edited by Mieder, Kingsbury, and Harder and published by the Oxford University Press in 1992. Current opinion would remove Mr. Barnard from the picture (pun intended). There is now a wikipedia article entitled “A picture is worth a thousand words” that is focused much more broadly than this page. In updating this page, I came across a wonderful account of the history of this expression written by William Safire for his column On Language for the New York Times Magazine. Worth a Thousand Words was published on 7 April 1996. If you have more information about the origins of this quotation (or the stories that surround it), please send me e-mail and I will update this page accordingly.",

    "text": "Inspirations In short, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with (other) enthusiasts for artificial intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant future of cerebration to machines alone. There will nevertheless be a fairly long interim during which the main intellectual advances will be made by men and computers working together in intimate association. A multidisciplinary study group, examining future research and development problems of the [United States] Air Force, estimated that it would be 1980 before developments in artificial intelligence make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving of military significance. That would leave, say, five years to develop man-computer symbiosis and fifteen years to use it. The fifteen may be ten or five hundred, but those years should be intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind. &nbsp; J. C. R. Licklider in Man-Computer Symbiosis, 1960 &nbsp; When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe. &nbsp; John Muir in My First Summer in the Sierra, 1911 &nbsp; There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, &lsquo;Morning, boys, how's the water?&rsquo; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, &lsquo;What the hell is water?&rsquo; &nbsp; David Foster Wallace in This is Water, 2005 &nbsp; When you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again. &nbsp; Steve Jobs in Video interview from Santa Clara Valley Historical Association, 1995 &nbsp; In our culture we spend a lot of time with the how. We've become a culture of technocrats and all we do is become technicians asking &lsquo;how do we do this?&rsquo;. Nobody stands back and asks &lsquo;why?&rsquo;. &nbsp; Joel Salatin in How to Eat Well AND Save Our Planet, 2008 &nbsp; There are no passengers on Spaceship Earth. We are all crew. &nbsp; Marshall McLuhan, 1911-1980",

CLICK HERE to toggle details finding flaws in terrible designs professor's way about explaining topics with fun and informative examples the student involvement level and the nature of the course the class is more interactive and we can gain more knowledge about the course interactivity this course is more interactive. So it leads to involvement of many people and which in turn makes other students to open up the class is interesting best is the way instructor make it interesting for the student by providing some activities. Instructor doesn't make the course boring the instructor give practical example of design and videos I like to this course because professor show us some related video to help to understand topic NA the TED talks and other videos it is interactive this course lets me breathe. It is a highly relevant and important topic and still is presented in a simple and pleasing manner. Does not put limits and restrictions on thoughts and allows the students to interact with each other and the professor helping everyone to learn and understand everything required, together interactive classes, discussions, opinions are asked the interactive nature of the course. There are always topics and scenarios to discuss in class everything providing the practical example interaction on different topics during class the discussions and participation this course not focuses only on software or computer and also focus on other devices and machine or can be applied to practical things except technology the ability to think outside the box, creatively evaluate different situations and think up scenarios NA is practical more than theory-oriented videos, discussions, and professor's way of teaching understanding the different approaches of design; how to be more creative and why it is interesting and practical it is not theory-oriented but it is practical the materials and instructor guidance discussions NA learning about design is fun the hands on experience on real services it is very free form. I like the discussion and the use of different teaching aids good discussions happen; interesting content it really gives perspective on what good design is and how to create it the class discussion NA the occasional video demonstration. Impossible to comprehend interaction design ideas without watching a video of the ideas the class discussion and the online forum no piazza. That is amazing. No, really! That is hilarious. We use URcourses and your site. That's it! I like it! the subject matter is interesting and relevant content it enhances our creative thinking and makes us aware of the bad designs and ways to improve them NA incorporates real-world examples of design some aspects can be fun / interesting it correlates to the real time technology which makes interesting and easy to understand this course gives an insight into interface design the class is interactive, real world examples help understand problem better. Asks for our opinion is good. What would you like to change about this course? CLICK HERE to toggle details no group work; clearer instructions and requirements for assignments NA NA NA NA nothing none I found nothing to be changed till now topic should be given a day before lecture so student can prepare I need to change when we are writing in the exam paper, please remove this box format NA more notes on the board please more scenarios the instructor could ask the students to read about something relevant to topic that is to be discussed in class, before coming to the class so that everyone will be able to relate to the discussions happening in class and contribute more chapter-oriented lecture is needed NA NA nothing nothing, it's perfect (just kidding). I think the course lacks a proper format on what is to be taught in every lecture rather than just discussing different topics (that doesn't mean that I don't like discussions) more info about the group project (e.g. past projects) nothing nothing for now NA don't feel any necessity of modification to class nothing more discussion for cognitive pyschology; more recent example and studies rather than old nothing don't feel any changes for this course nothing be more clear and concise on materials the online is full of outdated things such as dates NA nothing pertinent allowing less off-topic discussion. Allowing comedians to have the floor instead of trying to keep everyone on track more clear assignments with more explanation, especially with marking schemes more modern examples nothing have class end on time more often nothing nothing it is just as good as it is. Just don't break it, okay?? more time on subject matter, less time going over assignments and evaluation; going through more design from 'scratch' rather than always critiquing assignments it could have been more practical based NA NA more involved activities / smaller classes there would be no changes that can be done for the course presentation or slide show could be included weight of midterm should be more than 10% What do think are the instructor's greatest strengths? CLICK HERE to toggle details asking thought provoking questions ability to communicate with his students well prepared and high teaching skills and abilities; respects students the instructor is more knowledgeable and taught the course in a way the students can understand this course NA the smile and interactive nature treats students with respect. The instructor clearly communicates his expectations for student preparation instuctor's greatest strength is the students' feedback and how we interact in the class experience of his life instructor's greatest strength is he always teach us well and also helping to the student and find out our comments NA his energy, his calm demeanor, and his preparedness listening and encourage students to participate the instructor encourages students to actively participate in class and discuss on topics. The instructor listens to the views of all students and does not undermine their ideas but provides a better way of thinking that the students might not have thought about he is cool drives participation of students in class as well as online his capability to connect people communicating with students to force students to think rather than just learning course material humour; thought-provoking; aware of the `dank memes' best utilization of URcourses by providing forums for student. Also keeping all lectures recorded with images on URcourses knowledge about several fields NA his teaching philosophy of challenging students to think out-of-the-box and develop his perspective encourages for a good discussion/brainstorm; calmly listen to the student question and help him to deeply assess it he is awesome he explains the topic clearly and have discussions at the end he explains thoroughly each point fostering discussion NA respectful, relays the material well, generous. He tries to stimulate discussion but loses the room easily interaction with students dedication to the topic and respect for the students. Never unwilling to have a discussion starting discussions; thinking differently to give different perspectives provides interesting thoughts and topics stimulating class discussion and involving students in class good vocabulary the ability to maintain the grasp on students' attention starting a good discussion; caring for the students passion in HCI; critique of interfaces good at finding flaws in designs and encouraging critique. Knowledgeable on the subject clear understanding of the course content he encourages participation not only in class but also on UR Self Serve / URcourses NA fun environment for discussion of the material NA the level of patience in elaborating the every single question asked by student and has a great knowledge about updating technology the instructor is clear in his way of teaching and he backs it up with real life examples makes the class participate in lecture and examination questions",

    "text": "Three public events take place on December 9 at Simon Fraser University at Harbour Centre, 515 West Hastings Street. For more information or to reserve seats at the lecture, call 291-5100. An exhibition of art based on mathematical principles and ideas. Fractals, more so than other areas of mathematics, are visually exciting in a very real way. Fractals are a language with which to describe the geometry of nature. Images of fractals can be an important access to mathematics and surrounding philosophical questions. Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Teck Gallery (Room 1305). Interactive computer displays for visitors to experiment with making their own fractal designs; investigate E-Gems, a project to design math and science electronic games (Counting on Frank, one of their products, was chosen by PC Magazine as one of the top 100 CD-ROMs for 1995); and check out the math education and art resources available on the Internet. Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Segal Centre (Room 1430). Ingenious mathematical amateurs. It is possible for someone without formal credentials to make contributions to mathematics. Well-known artist M.C. Escher and unknown homemaker Marjorie Rice both tackled mathematical problems, developing unorthodox notation that was essential to their methodical investigations. Each worked alone, essentially in secret, rewarded by the exhilaration of finding answers to a large puzzle. Lecture by Dr. Doris Schattschneider, Professor (Emerita) of Mathematics, Moravian College. 5 &dash; 6 pm in the Fletcher Challenge Canada Theatre (Room 1900). We'd like to thank our sponsors, Simon Fraser University, the Canadian Mathematical Society, and the British Columbia Ministry of Employment and Investment. The fractal on this postcard is Fiery Dragon (1990), by Daryl H. Hepting.",
