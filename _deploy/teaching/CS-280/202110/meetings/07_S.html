<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. Because I think okay I just got started and then, for I know it's 1131 or 32. So my apologies for that. February every second today. feeling different. Okay, so speaking of assignments. tried to clarify a few things. Let me go to the website and. Let me share that with you and then we'll close your a few things i've done. But some people saw over 1918 or 19 responders to the feedback. So you can still make sense, you can still contribute to the feedback. about the filter goals. Nobody answers. So this is what it is so far. Yes or no questions but there's also a question written. Let me see if I can. Something here because I had just to make sure that I could. see whether there was an answer being written by anybody. Anyway, so i'm using feedback in your courses as a alternative to polls and zoom because. feedback and persist beyond the zoom session. that's my idea that. We can benefit from having these discussions. If I can't see. again see the answers to questions i'm not sure about and then.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;A Professor.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Please just take this as my opinion, and you know take it fairly waited, but I would much prefer doing polls in the zoom lectures as i've been i've been here every day, but I have a lot of trouble engaging with these lectures. And I would much rather be discussing things on here than trying to find my way through a website on the side to do something, after the fact. But that that that that's just my something that i'm feel that I would like to share with you.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So here's a way that i'm going to. Oh. i'm going to edit a poll. Another option. as well. Okay. i'm going to launch a poll right now. So it's about 7030. So this is for. Feedback right understood. 6535 so still really strong preference for zoom calls. Okay, oh. i'll keep that in mind.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Professor. yeah more on that note, I guess, if the class might agree with with that I find I would rather be really engaged during the lectures, but then have a lot less time trying to navigate the system outside of lectures. I think that that would be very beneficial to to the purposes of this class.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So, in particular, if you'd rather not have breakout room discussions on your course.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;No, no, I like I like the breakout rooms on here.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;But no, no, but. not making making notes about them.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I find that the number of your courses submissions is overwhelming and I can't figure it out and so that causes me to shut down when it comes to your courses.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Alright, so 93% vote, and it was 63 to 34 oh wait, I can share this total view. So I ended the poll and. Now I don't know the skill, let me. make a new poll on still sharing that other one with you. Okay, so I don't think I can do that same thing same time, so let me quickly do another poll here. Can you see any of this stuff i'm not sure what. zoom is showing to you, I think I select the chosen windows. In my screen share but i'm not sure.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Our desktop.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;it's showing my entire desktop.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Your courses Pole and like your chrome tabs and that kind of stuff.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. that's good to know that you can see. i'm trying to type anyway. So the SAVE button. is blocked by the control panel for zoom so gotta just make it appear at the very bottom there. And if you caught that excitement and in the screen share. Okay, so i'm going to launch this poll for you our courses, so you can select more than one. So what are we that I somehow indicate optional. Like I didn't mean to indicate that there are. These are assignments to do is. Like adding to the discussions are doing the feedback. Feedback in class. Because it's for. me immediate that way. So figure out a way to. The poll results for. Okay, so 19 responses pick other I didn't specify either so, can you can we have a discussion about what's the other.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I think the thing that i'm seeing very commonly in the comments, is that. A large majority of the students wish that everything was accessible from your courses. I think the fact that people have to go to the website is very confusing for some and they don't know when to check it or what to use, whereas if it's all on your courses, then it keeps it in a centralized location, rather than checking multiple. that's what i'm seeing a lot of in the comments.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Which comments in the chat.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;yeah yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. So. Let me. get back to you. To give back to see Let me end the poll here. Okay, so. I need to share the poll first. Okay, so people like. The discussion outside of class being option on your question. Is. About 30% of the people like that. That 65% like is for the engagement responses. And can you see that I wrote that they're graded. Each of them is graded for Point two 5%.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yet, we can see that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, just cut off on. display here. I hope you like that i'm sending in new them trying based on feedback and got last semester. And it's. there's a lot of work setup so I mean not that i'm attached to it, because it was a lot of work. And I think it might be valuable. So I appreciate the comments. So the other thing is then to deal with making sure that the other content is visible. Okay, so now let's go back to the website.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Take fine versus other online.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;My two cents in here, I think the real issue that's going on is people are much more comfortable with using you our courses then another websites just because they're so used to it so maybe just an ideas we could try doing everything off of your courses if that makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, this is the best actually.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, seeing your courses for everything.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I like your courses i've been using your courses for years. Is second okay. So let me just handle attendance here first. I thought I hit return on this, a long time ago, anyway. There is a student password for attendance in the chat. Do it seems to be hidden by another zoom window. So this is a student view of what i've done so i've turned on the recent activity. So this will be the recent activity. Since you last logged in. So you can see, this forum posts. that some of you may have if you're looking at this now, you might have seen that there are some changes of the URLs for the. assignments. still see a changes in the course. Okay. So I hope that's going to be helpful. When I notice i'm trying to find a link I can give you like the. The calendar on the meetings. So you can just look at upcoming events.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I believe you can export the you are courses calendar into like your personal calendar and see that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;You can subscribe. You can subscribe to it. In the meetings I have these upcoming events and linked to the calendar, so this is not to me this recent activity stuff is not helpful because it just. It goes too much. It has had incredible things everything it doesn't just show what's been updated. So I would I would advise you to look at the block on the top rate. For recent activity. Instead of clicking for full activity report. So now what i've done with meetings. So the upcoming events is the one that i'm thinking of here because I can make the link click to go back to your courses for that, and then you can see. The upcoming events for the course. Sorry i'm going to take these zoom office hours out of the calendar and in our class because there's no way for me to add them to all the classes. So i'll show you what I did for that. In a second here. To achieve your objective right.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I think the problem is that people don't like having to click through to another website, they just wish all of the information was accessible right on your courses.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. But I don't know how I could do this on your courses. Because I have these templates and add a process that. generates them and then. they're not it's it's still a work in progress. But I just. I don't see how to. put this directly into your courses. If I had a link to your courses that. Instead, instead of having. Sorry go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I know that for like my. That we took over the summer, he had like each individual like lecture broken up into like a module and your courses read click the module you'd have your. What are like learning objectives for today and then like have the links for the videos were supposed to watch. And then you can link from there into like your discussion forum and that kind of stuff I know that's how he broke it down so it's not like 17,000 links on your courses it's. module one through 20 or however many was how they end up doing it in the class seem to like that a lot and I believe that's just a template that's just built into your courses itself doesn't require anything funky to get it working.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah well, I guess, maybe because i've been using your course for a long time and have had problems with putting content into your courses. Maybe this is a solution, because over time and if there's better. started with. Let me label. People reading your. moodle pardon me is. They don't talk to each other very much because it seems like this would be a great place to practice and to make an edit. The meeting. right there and then. Anyone like this. So pick one it's a better like that, yes or no, or it's just as good or it's just as bad. Okay, so what 80% think that's a better approach with the direct links. What I can do to improve it for next time. let's continue this discussion. And I appreciate your feedback and we'll we'll take it. will keep it in mind i'm so. I have my own reasons for doing. preferring things on my own website. From my years of experience, using you are courses. That, I want to. See, I feel like this is a feature more than a bug. Okay, so I got a direct message which. I asked you remember to please not send me direct messages. Because, not everybody else can see them then. And then I have to go and. Choose everyone again on my chat if I want to get to the whole class. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I think, so thank you for problem solving Darrell.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I got kicked out my own meeting. In case you're wondering what happened there for a second. So thank you zoom. Okay. Anyway, I was trying to say is that i'm happy to. Work with anyone, and I appreciate the. honesty and the feedback and i'll do my best to address it. So we can all have a very positive experience. Okay, so let me go back to you. So the individual assignments due dates aren't here. explicitly but they're in the calendar, so this one is. Let me click on this description link. So the first one is trough marks and it's due on. February 22nd, which is the Monday after the break. This gives you. contained, here are some guidelines for writing for the web. So take those into account. And then here's a calculator was a rubric. So the second blog entry will be due march 11. And then, an empathy map which we'll talk about soon. We do march 25 So those are the individual assignments. And then there's also a project which you can do, individually or as a small group. and say up to five people. So proposals do march 4. And then the final deliverable is due on the 20th. Pardon me not the 20th it's worth 20 marks and still on April eight. So, as we discussed there's no midterm exam. I hope you're not too sad about that. So in place to the mid term. So i've done the engagement with meetings for 10 marks. Here, let me go back here and. So this is intended to you, I am trying to keep it according to the syllabus. well. So these. So you can see that so here's certain meetings this is sort of the general stuff. And then, where the engagements meetings and there's a number behind that. contributes to the final grade so 1010 works for the engagement meetings and total. And then individual assignments. And then the project. So I have a forum for project for projects discussions and also for individual assignment discussions. So their own forums, so you can decide if you want to. subscribe to them or not, but those were that's where those discussions will take place. And then there's a 25 mark final exam. which may be a take home. which may be something else which will be determined. And then five mark server dissipation so. For the participation is the attendance at meetings and then so there's participation discussion so you can, if you want to report a blog online and the your courses website. or on my website. or suggest resources contribute to class, these are all things and I also suggested. In the blog entry assignment, for the first. One you submit it. And you are courses, but if you wanted to make it to the public, you could post it to the class blog. and doing that would. be evidence of participation so. i've tried to collect. Participation related things here. And then research credit if there's an opportunity, it would be listed here. Okay, so does that. seem all right. thanks for the thumbs up. will appear in the calendar. Right top right here. The Office hours. See you don't need to go. into. My office. My office hours. on Mondays and Wednesdays, and one hour on Tuesdays and Thursdays. And here's the link. take it to the office my office my zoom office for the Semester. This will send your send me an email, if you want to get a hold of me outside. Of those times. And I can probably make us a better color. You should put make it the same kind of button and other ones. But if you click on the office link it'll go to zoom. So you can go there, right from here. We should do a breakout room in the last few minutes here. by accident. we've all heard stories about. Things like that.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so I have a question that. About that if you can explain about the blog that what we should write and what does this format that we need to follow to write the blog and, as things if you can explain thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;me ask one more question here, Nepal, before I go to. Okay, so about the. question of. format. And topics so. I invite you to read through this first of all, and there's a sample that I provided. A blog that I wrote a few years ago. Can you see that, on the screen.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;And then I mean. Read read through the. The rest of the assignment and. And the topics and so on. Thanks the links all work if it is a problem with the link, let me know. And then we can have a discussion in the individual assignments discussion okay. All right. Okay, so. 84% yes, compared to. 16% saying no this, there is one Absolutely not. So I won't push them on to. dropbox i'll put them inside your courses. And i'll figure out how to do that figure out the best way to do that. Okay, so we're out of time for today. So we can think about. Your courses and zoom and context of. How you're helping advance the greater good. This is our discussion today. So thanks, very much for today and we'll see you on Thursday. Okay. Any last urgent thing. Okay. Have a great Tuesday Thursday. Take care everyone.

<ul><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;good morning
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Good moring
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;busssyyyyyy
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Crazy busy
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I studied, lol
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;assignments and midterms are here already
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yes, if you can explain more about blog. thanks
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;what is the password
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;for attendance
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;he hasn't given it yet.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;ok
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;There does seem to be a lot of information overload, core course content seems to be posted in a lot of different places
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;^ well said, Michael
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;true ^^
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;It'd be nice to have all the course content on URCourses itself so it's easier for us to navigate and easier for professor to manage
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think its a UR courses problem I think its the cs 280 website
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yes, there is a local host site as well as the urcourses contents which makes things more complicated.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Like I have broken links to videos we were supposed to watch under the feb 2nd review of last day
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah I think the links being centralized would be easier for completion. I know I always I have to check both sites to ensure I got everything down.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I think that there should only be content on UR Courses (the videos to watch, with modules named BY DATE and not by meeting #). Everything else seems to be extra and more confusing than it is worth.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;^
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;yeahh
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for listening to our feedback and taking it under consideration.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;^ Yeah! Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah attendance is cool
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;The attendance procedure works well for me
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Im with david
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;yess
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;yeah
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;yeh UR course
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I agree
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I agree too
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;I like David's idea
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;agreed
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;agree
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, me too.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;How was your weekend?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;it was good thank you
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;zoom is the worst I s2g
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I can see the course updates on URCourses
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I can see updates
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I can see it
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;are we able see the class recordings after lecture engagements?
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I believe the lectures are recorded for transcribing
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;even i don't see them anywhere. I was wondering where they could have been posted
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;oh
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes: some of us would prefer this to eb in UR Courses. Maybe in modules
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Collapsible modules?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Having each day reference previous days and future events is confusing. I would much rather look at each day as itself and look ahead or back myself if I need to do that
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I think you need to go from scratch so it's fine.  thanks.
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Or even if there was direct, detailed links on UR Courses to relevant CS280 website modules, like one for 'preparation for next class' that goes directly where we need to go for next class
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;that is a lot of hypertext linking but it should be worth it
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;That seems to be a reasonable workaround, if that works well for you.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;This is good, however it shouldn't end up being another ton of links on UR Courses for every meeting
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;What else do you propose without making him fully start from scratch? It seems he's doing his best to accommodate everyone the best he can with systems he's already put a lot of effort into. To ask him to fully rework seems unreasonable.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;^ Dayne thank you for pointing this out
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;we are just wasting time like this. we have 150 students we can make all of them happy. it is what it is.
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;^^ Agree with Dayne!!
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Is he frozen
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;The joys of zoom
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;xD
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;✌🏻
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;I use this other service called ClassIn and it has way more functionality and stability than Zoom
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;its paid for sadly
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;With a free software, you get what you can
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you professor for accommodating everybody. I feel that the students also have a responsibility to accommodate to different styles of different teachers. Not everyone works the same way as one would hope.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Dr.Hepting
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;password for attendance please
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;g0j101
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;lol why did you share the password? he/she is supposed to attend the class to know the password
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;oh I thought it was someone who was here, my bad lol
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Wait.. I don’t see Nitin in participants. Did they just dip in to get a password and then split?
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;yes i think so
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. That's pretty much everyone who comes in and just spams whats the password
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Clearly attendance is active until the end of the class.. there is no way for any of to know when Nitin arrived or went or how long he was here for. Attendance should be restricted to 5  minutes or so if professor wants a hard limit on who can receive the attendance mark
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly ^^
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;I heard from someone that they had a professor who had two attendance links
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;one in the beginning and in the end
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;My 210 prof had that for exams
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;can someone please tell me what we have to post in today's engagement with meeting
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;what did we learn about today
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I know for 215 it was just a "heres the attendance code" randomly during the class, and it was up for ~2 minutes before being closed
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks! n__n
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks so much for your hard work, Daryl! :)
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Appreciate the effort
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for being so accommodating!
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you, have a great day
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;thanks
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;Thank You
