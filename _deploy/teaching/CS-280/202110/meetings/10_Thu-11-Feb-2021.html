      My favourite discussion that we had in today's class was, with the rapid advancements of technology the world has been facing in recent years, are the problems the world is currently facing new, or the same? This is what I want to write about in today's discussion.My opinion is that the issues we are facing are the same, as they all stem from the same, underlying issues. For example, we considered in class whether the issue of 'Surveillance Capitalism' could possibly be a new issue. I'd say that issues like surveillance capitalism are just symptoms of the underlying problem of...
    </li><li>
      The meting began with the discussion about the response to the previous meeting. From this class I clearly got an idea about the topic of vlog. After having dissucsion in the class about the twitter account I got encouragement to make a twitter account because, from a long time I was thinking about being on a social site. The chief thing which was very attention seeking for me was the point made by the Joel in the How to eat well and save our plane , 2008 In our culture we spend a lot of time with the word how...
    </li><li>
      Using Twitter is like using a public restroom stall and read all the writing on the wall. This is coming from somebody who never uses Twitter. For me, I would have to weigh between the person's benefit and the personal cost of using something before doing it.I do agree with Dr. Hepting that some people depend too much on Technology. I wasn’t able to watch the Flight 401 video. But as soon as I heard the mentioned autopilot mode being shut off, I knew the was something off. Overreliance on autopilot mode is something that should be looked down upon,...
    </li><li>
      I think the most important thing you taught us in the meeting today was how essential it is to really make sure that we are keeping up with even the most circumstantial of maintenance. What I gathered from the video/ incident we spoke about was very similar to our last meeting when we spoke of the ease of use (for discord). I think today's meeting really put into perspective that that same principle applies to more than just social media and can really drastically impact the world.
    </li><li>
      For this meeting we had to watch a video regarding the crash of Eastern Airlines Flight 401. The flight crash was caused by the negligence of the crew, however later inspections found out that it was due to a faulty design which diverted the attention of the crew and also due to the complexity of the buttons which control the autopilot function of the flight. These were some of the issues I found which, if designed properly would have prevented this mishap. This makes us think about how important the User Interface design is in such modes of transport. Now...
    </li><li>
      Flight 401The video is subtitled the ghosts of flight 401. I think that's a fitting name even the vast majority of the video is focused on what happened on flight 401 and not on the alleged ghost sightings after the fact, because what happened on the flight is far more haunting than seeing a ghost. Going through the events from the crews perspective it's hard to blame them for how they handled the situation. They were being cautious and trying to double check the landing gear on the slim chance that there was a double failure. The mistakes they made...
    </li><li>
      In our 9th meeting, we discussed the failure the pilots, the control tower, the maintenance crew and everyone else that was involved lead to an airplane crash. At some point we discussed humanities over reliance on technology like auto pilot.
    </li><li>
      The video/discussion we had related to the aircraft and the ethics of the computing reminded me of something similar going on today with self-driving cars (say a fully automated car without need of human input). A simple google search in the likes of "self-driving car choosing who to kill" will being up pages upon pages of the morality of the self-driving car. There are different variants of moral dilemma that self-driving cars provide (pedestrian vs driver safety, choosing between two pedestrians, etc.) but the main thing I find interesting is the ethics of the decision making itself. Who ever gave...
    </li><li>
      having watched the video for todays meeting they are defiantly places for the cockpit interface to be improved. on the other hand a good interface only can go so far in regards to poor execution. when designing an interface it is important to think of the who the interface is for and design it with them in mind.
    </li><li>
      Response
    </li><li>
      I really liked the video about the airplane lights. could you recommend more videos like that and thanks for going over our previously asked questions.?
    </li><li>
      I wanted to add that cybercrimes like identity theft and fraud are more prevalent in the modern era of computing than it used to be. There is plenty of scams out there that can trick the unsuspecting general public. The ability to shop online brings additional risks in that important financial information can easily be exchanged with the wrong people. While the scams aren't necessarily new, this is a problem that we didn't see nearly as much years ago.
    </li><li>
      The meeting involved discussions about the blog and crash of eastern's L-1011(flight 401).the things that I learned from the incident:-first thing, before building and adding my ideas to the interface I would like to consult the client's field professional and work as per his/her requirements and comforts he/she needs in their workspace.-bringing automation in life/death fields can be very dangerous; I would like to add manual alternatives for important functions.-as we saw the system responded with an alert signal but it wasn't good enough to determine, these days useless ads flashy on our screen, why can't it be the signals...
    </li><li>
      One of the reason that caused the Eastern Air Lines Flight 401's accident is system. After the crash, people found that the joystick on this plane is very sensitive that once someone moved it a little bit, it will close the autopilot. It is a bad example of interface. It isn't help people to use it but cause a serious problem. I think to design a good product, especially related to personal security, it should be more strict and make sure everything is good. I think the accident of this air crash really reminds us that the product should based...
    </li><li>
      I think Jef Raskin's quotes about what properties computers and interfaces should have is spot on. I agree that an interface should be “responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties”, which of course puts responsibility on the designer or programmer. And although a system or interface can only lead people in the right direction so far, I think all designers should do their due diligence to make it as usable and accessible as possible. If not, unexpected and unwanted things can happen. Some example could include missing an important email because of an unnoticeable connection error, not knowing...
    </li><li>
      In the previous lecture we discussed some inspirational quotes and watched a video on a plane with 176 passengers which gets crashed because of a bulb. That was so unpleasant to see that many people and crew members lost their lives because of a 5 dollar bulb.
    </li><li>
      Utilitarian approach seems to move towards the favor of most user so i think it could be the better approach
    </li><li>
      Hello,Thank you very much for providing the links for blog 1 it is very helpful to browse accordingly. Also just wanted to say that after watching and discussing in class about the crash in Miami video got lot of additional information that was helpful in understanding.
    </li><li>
      I'm learning that interface design is not only much more complex than first blush, but it that it is also everywhere!I find it difficult to see interfaces with fresh eyes, especially ones that I am very familiar with. It is challenging to assess how intuitive things that I have been using my whole life actually are - especially when most "new" interfaces are derivative of something I'm already familiar with.I am interested in learning more about everyday, "invisible" interfaces like the Norman doors that were covered earlier. It is fascinating to me applying critical thought to a problem that is...
    </li><li>
      On Intuitive DesignMedium.com is a really unique blogging website and popular among all sorts of folks in the industry. From Tech to consumer, from the software engineering team to management, it's extremely welcoming to anyone wishing to express thoughtful discussion about niche topics to the world. One of the best parts are the various organizational spaces, curated by employees currently working at firms, and discuss the various challenges they encounter. More specifically, there exists a vast amount of informational wealth from software engineering teams at Airbnb, Uber, Stripe, Pinterest and more! Recently while browsing through I found an article on...
    </li><li>
      I found it interesting to see how the interface design of technology, such as an airplane, could have deadly consequences if not designed well. I would like to know more about the details of that even that was discussed in class, surrounding the plane disaster.
    </li><li>
      In the flight 401 the crew were busy with the landing-gear indicator and didn’t notice that the flights autopilot was disconnected. The flight lost altitude and evidently crashed. It didn’t occurred due to any ghost but , caused because of the crews lack of attention. The video shows that computer technology may cause harm by humans moral weaknesses. Proper ethics are also important in information technology.
    </li><li>
      From what I see, technology has brought back many old issues in new forms. Security/privacy is the primary issue. The average person uploads so much information about themself to the internet without much thought. Previously, you could secure yourself from people looking into your house by closing the blinds. Now, you have to worry about people gaining access to any webcams, security cameras, or baby monitors you have. There is a public depository of unsecured wifi cameras that you can access with nothing but a URL.Previously, you would worry about losing your debit or credit card or having the physical...
    </li><li>
      we discussed about the blog entry 1 topic in the last meeting and also the metaphors using different technical platforms ;like twitter. i have make a note from this discussion that if some technology is intuitive after some time of use ,than it is considered as well designed because with getting familiar of its use, we can figure out the exact metaphor for using it.
    </li><li>
      After seeing the video about the plane crash, I think that we should not blame the auto pilot mode and not depend on that. It was the mistake of the crew that they we were not more alert and did not see that the modes have been changed, and ignored the alarm that beeped when the flight descended 250 fts.
    </li><li>
      During the last meeting, when discussing the video concerning Flight 401, another student mentioned something about there being many parties that were responsible for the crash and how the airplane malfunction itself wasn't the sole cause. I think that's a fair observation, however there was something I noticed while watching the video that continually bothered me.At the beginning of the video, the exposition claimed that many of the flight crew, especially the pilot and co-pilot, were very experienced at their jobs and held these positions for quite some time. They were not newbies. Although what occurred on the plane appeared...
    </li><li>
      The principles of user interface design are intended to improve the quality of user interface design. I agree that computers shall improve the quality of the work and increase efficiency, not harm human or their work in any way. Technology should be used as an incentive to make our life easier.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we saw the topics for first blog and the criteria. Then metaphor for using twitter was also discussed. I saw the video of that failed jet and what i concluded by seeing the video is that may be the flight team lacks the exact method for handling and using that new model
    </li><li>
      In this last meeting we discussed about the blog entry1 and how metapjors use many diff tech platforms. Aslo after use of a tech for a short period of time, it becomes understandable to people and is seen as an elegantly built and when its use is understood, the metaphor using the tech can be found out
    </li><li>
      In the previous meeting, we discussed our next task, Blog 1. It's wonderful that much of the topics were explored in the classroom. Topics may also be of our choosing, which is awesome. Apart from that, we have addressed the use of twitter. I don't personally find it really interesting, so I've never created an account. But indeed, I like reading blogs which are written by famous bloggers but haven’t attempted to write one. So, it will be my first time writing a blog, so I'm pretty excited about writing one.
    </li><li>
                                                                                                                                                                                      In today’s lecture, I learned about some misconception and technical difficulty of not lighting the switch that cause a human error which leads to clash flight 401. There was only one issue of not lighting the switch, but the functionalities were working. So, the pilots ended up by making wrong decision. The same way people use to end up the things by making wrong decision even if they were on right path. So, being a computer specialist one need to formulate more logical operations if some system may mislead but there should be some backup plans,...
    </li><li>
      From the last meeting we had a great discussion about the blog entry 1 topic and also about the different metaphor by using the different technical platforms like twitter that about the twitter's working and how many we have on twitter and i noticed the one thing is here that if there is some technology is a new one then it will considered as the well performed designed because i think if we get familiar of this use then it gonna better for us that we can observed the exact changes for using it.
    </li><li>
      How important is it for programmers to implement ease of use and intuition in their products? Who does the responsibility lie on when it comes to working around the needs of the other? Should the programmers sacrifice the function of the program for the ease of use for the client/ a pleasant design? Or should the client be responsible for learning how to navigate the interface in order to use it? At what point does ease of use outweigh utility of a program, and vice versa?
    </li><li>
      The flight-401 in which we can see how devastating accident happened for such a small issue, the light bulb caused numerous deaths, i think the interface was failed to design the needs of humans and that resulted in such a tragedy.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that i learned from the videos was confidence and self-efficacy. The term self-efficacy plays a vital role in everyone's life. From the video, the result was that confidence leads to good and better results, in contrast, lack of confidence and fear messes up everything and in some cases can bring bad or negative results.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed ethics and interface, and I watched the referred video about the ghost of flight 401. A little issue of a bulb causes a big accident of flight falling. According to Jef Raskin,An interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties.A computer shall not harm your work or, through inaction, allow your work to come to harm. A computer shall not waste your time or require you to do more work than is strictly necessary. When we consider our design of computer and user interface, we should avoid...
    </li><li>
      After watching the video Flight 401, I think it wasn't just a fault of the pilot. It was also a fault of the control tower because when a pilot disengage the autopilot mistakenly and the flight dropped the altitude from 2000 feet to 900 feet. They should have inform the pilot saying that your altitude is way lower then it suppose to be.I also found the a youtube video similar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4JXmtEtBFc&amp;ab_channel=TheFlightChannel
    </li><li>
      The broken light in the plane should not be blamed for the crash, sure the light being burnt out started the string of issues that led to the crash but the events cannot be simply blamed on the light. The interface of the plane controls should be functioning before take off to make sure things like this crash don't happen. The pilots and crew should have kept an eye on their altitude and where the plane was going, it's like driving a car but letting go of the steering wheel to use your phone and not pay attention to the...
    </li><li>
      After watching the tragic flight 401 video, I think the main idea was very clear, as was the most important take-away from the video. As with something of that nature, many things went wrong but what was apparent to me was that the interface/design could have been developed better. It said in the video that the autopilot mode switch was "inadvertent/accidental" and that there was even a chime/ringing (notification) that the plane had dropped altitude, and with all of the commotion over the lightbulb that in the end was simply burnt out, the notification had gone unnoticed. I really don't...
    </li><li>
      The most important we have learnt today was how essential it is to really make sure that we are keeping up the even with most circumstantial maintenance.The video has some similar to our last lecture in which we discussed about interface ease of use.In today discussion we just put into perspective that the same principle applies to more than just social media and can really drastically impact the world
    </li><li>
      From the last class and after watching the video "flight 401", I think that it wasn't just the fault of pilot and not also the autopilot mode. I can say that if the first pilot mistakenly turned off the autopilot mode. The second pilot should have noticed the alert that was going on. Also, when control tower made a call to flight and asked for if things are okay. They should have also inform the pilot that the flight is on very low altitude.
    </li><li>
      Keeping with the topic of user interface, and noting the video on flight 401, we have to make some assumptions about our end user. On one hand we want to ensure that our user interface is accessible and intuitive. But chances are we also do not want to assume that our end user if stupid -- or needs to be coddled and have their hand held through their experience with our website, program, etc. We have to make some assumptions that what we have done is sufficient to ensure a good outcome when people use our product, whatever it happens...
    </li><li>
      The story of "How A Broken $5 Light Bulb Caused this Massive Jet to Crash in Miami" reveals a lot about interface design and the importance of user interaction with the interface. I gathered a few main points through watching this video and engaging with the lecture.Firstly, it is essential for the interface to be clear so that it can easily be understood by the person using it. This involves prioritizing certain messages over others. For example, in the above-mentioned video, the sound alert designed to warn the pilots of any unintentional deviance from their selected altitude went unnoticed. This...
    </li><li>
      I agree that it was totally the crew's fault in the crash of Eastern airline L011. From the maintenance crew to the pilots, everyone was responsible. Computers on the other hand were functioning adequately. Although I do not agree with Jef Raskin's statements that computers won't require more work to be done than necessary. Bugs are exactly that.
    </li><li>
      it was really helpful
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we discussed about the first blog of this course and  Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of using twitter
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed the task of Blog 1. Several of the topics for Blog 1 were discussed. And the best thing is that the topics of our choice are allowed to be taken up. We also spoke about Twitter, but it's interesting that I still don't have a Twitter account. The best thing is that writing this Blog 1 would be my first life blog, and I hope it goes well.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 9, we discussed about the inspirational quotes on professor's website which were very informative. In addition to that we also watched a video on a plane crash and discussed how a bulb led to the crash of an airplane.
    </li><li>
      After watching the video "Flight 401" about how the flight crashed because of a burnt-out light, the crew members not understanding proper risk management and how computer interfaces need human interaction. The video helps understand why proper risk management is needed to handle difficult situations and make the best decisions during such situations. Also, the video helps understand that a computer interface won't do anything without human interaction.
    </li><li>
      I found the debate between deontology and utilitarianism interesting and would have enjoyed to hear more of where everyone stands. As someone who is ruled by emotions, I find the “fine line” complex, greyer rather than black and white, but I admire the idea of utilitarianism. It would be much simpler to break things down into two categories such as pleasure or pain.
    </li><li>
      In the previous lecture we had discuss about the video of Flight 401, we discussed that how interface design is used everywhere and its not much complicated
    </li><li>
      In the previous class, we had talked about the Flight 401, and its interfaces were that good enough then can warn the flight crew. As per my thinking as the computer gets updated the human also have to learn with them as we can see that only warning is not enough to warn the people as in the stressful condition. they have to put some more warning to get the crew know about the danger. These was the biggest interface of all that big flight accident.
    </li><li>
      A computer is a device you use to finish something; simply using a piece of software is rarely, to end the goal.
    </li><li>
      Am still very much interested in the concept of accessibility and usabilityMy question is that to what extent can one be granted accessibility ?Secondly, can programmers make it more easier to user to have easy way for using a software?
    </li><li>
      Qualified computer software or system must be based on human well-being and must meet three elements. Convenient, safe and fast, without increasing the original workload. This is the purpose for which the computer was designed. In future courses, I want to know more examples of how computers can benefit mankind.
    </li><li>
      The events of flight 401 bring up some interesting points. The idea of fail safes to stop these events from occurring. In the video the way the events were described made it sound like every single fail safe they had in place didn't work (flipping the lights to see if it was just a dead bulb, checking the window to see if the gear was actually down) and on top of that the slight nudge that caused the auto pilot to slowly descend into the grasslands. It sounds like things were in place to stop this even from occurring but...
    </li><li>
      Regarding twitter and the role it provides, it is interesting to consider how powerful of a platform it is. We can use it as a method to vent about whatever we are feeling at the time, to no one specifically but just putting it out there. Or, as mentioned in class, it can be used as a way to help organize events and inform the general public/whoever happens to be following you "live" on whatever is being scheduled. However, at its core, twitter is still a social media website, and can be used for less than ideal things, such as...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we discused about the plane crash of 1972, it was due to a faulty bulb, but i think it was because of pilots which were not attentive seeing the overall picture rather than focusing on bulb. hence we mush design and develop the tecnology that is fully controled by computers and donot need human response at any level.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we saw a video clip on How a broken $5 light bulb caused a massive Jet to crash in Miami, Florida which took place on 29th of december, 1972. The flight 401 was flying between new york and miami . The video basically depicts the relationship of Ethics and Interface. An interface is a junction at which two things or systems assemble together and interact. Here, the malfunction of the bulb is showed which leads to whole crew getting distracted and ruin their landing. The given scenario is a computer failure. This proves how the design...
    </li><li>
      When I saw this video, I felt that human life was fragile because the crew was so busy checking whether the wheel had been put down and ignored the altitude that the plane crashed into the ground in full operation, so 101 people died. If the aircraft's operation interface is more safe and convenient, the crew will not make this kind of mistake. Machines generally do not make mistakes, but people always make mistakes. Hence, a good interactive system is necessary because It can well meet human beings' needs, and a good interactive system will reduce the chances of people...
    </li><li>
      For this meeting, the point I really liked was the discussion about knowing your audience. As a designer, one should exactly be very aware of their target audience and should design it in a way that's suitable to that audience and not everyone in general. When an attempt is made to generalize a service/product, it usually loses touch of it's main purpose and hence is not the best thing for the targeted audience.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about the blog entry1.
    </li><li>
      I learned from watching the video that concentrating on one single mistake which was of the light not turning on. Whole of crew was busy to solve that problem and did not follow the basic rules and procedure of landing which cause the flight to crash. So I learned that even if there is some problem , you should remain calm and while solving that problem do not forget other basic thing which we have to follow which if not been look after can cause other problems.
    </li><li>
      Well, I found the video about how the light bulb caused the airplane to crash interesting because it was very informative and it made me want to learn a lot more about planes. I find the training to be a really good exercise for problem solving in the airlines because it can help prevent more accidents.
    </li><li>
      The airplane video shown, gave us a great context to human errors in computer designs.Humans are not machinery optimised for precision. Actually, we humans are a totally different type of unit. Our strengths are ingenuity, adaptability, and versatility. Our weaknesses are continual alertness and accuracy in action or memory. Even when physically impaired, we are remarkably error-tolerant. We are highly versatile, resilient and imaginative, great at seeking reasons.Quite a lot is known about human performance and the way it applies to system interaction . Several classes of human error have been defined and studied and conditions can be stated in...
    </li><li>
      In the video about how a $5 light build caused a plane to crash it shows just how important the user interface of programs are as we could see that although the flight crew had serval hours of flight experience with so many other planes because that particular L-1011S had an interface not so similar to the others they had not realized when something wrong had been done causing the plane to gradually descend and crash.
    </li><li>
      The fact that such a small thing like broken bulb could take the whole crews attention which inturn causes a huge crash is just insane. As the reports suggested, the crew was in fault, they didn't noticed the alert as flight engineer was looking down for broken parts. The other thing to notice was none of the crew members had done even 500 flight hours in this plane which ofcourse meant they weren't familiar with the system. Also the reports of crew members able to see captain and Co pilot after the crash and haunting in the planes made by...
    </li><li>
      From the video, I can suggest that it was not just human error but there was a fault in both system and human. The green light from the landing gear did not work due to that computer error and due to this all the crew staff were focusing on that and did not see other big problems of altitude decreasing. I am trying to say that due to just one computer error all humans who were working on that machine got distracted and did not saw the other big error.

      Ghost stories and media fussOver the following months and years, Eastern Airlines employees began reporting their sightings to dead flight crew members on board another plane, the L-1011. The story and what is in it is that some parts of the ill-fated plane N310EA (Flight 401) were recovered and installed in another plane, the L-1011, and although some parts were recovered from the crashed plane and re-used in other aircraft of the company's fleet, what resulted from the accident is the complete loss For N310EA airframe. The news of those views (totalling 27 views), which included seeing the spirits of (Don...
    </li><li>
      The video on plane crashing really shows us the importance of each and every minor aspect and the loops of neglecting those minors in advancement of technology as well. It would be the important thing that is discussed in class. The discussion about the usage of Twitter was also quite interesting with too many comments on that. The interface design is also a major discussion in the class.
    </li><li>
      I learnt that in every design every little detail matters, like the video provided for us to watch, enough attention was to provided to the light bulb therefore the plane crashed
    </li><li>
      The video of Eastern Airline tell us a lot. Autopilot mode has been turned on automatically and crew members were not aware about that also Engineer tried a lot to find an issue with it. At last, it's crashed.. Just 75 people survived after this accident among the 176 passengers and crew members.
    </li><li>
      In the class firstly, we discussed about the blog what to write and then after everyone discusse about the website and some application like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and all where we can communicate with each other and post something and also write our thoughts in it and people will reply their thoughts and opinion on it and also discuss about some problems and changes that happened.
    </li><li>
      According to me, last class lecture was important for understanding the purpose of technology in daily life. The way it governs the system around us has a huge impact on everything related to us. The case of airplane crash near Miami international airports teaches us to deal with software glitch and errors. It could have been avoided if the crew knew about the operations and must not have distracted from them. At present, we have latest software which can even land the airplane on its own, but the success rate is not 100 % at each time. Working with technologies...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, there was a video about the ghost flight it was shown in the video that how an aeroplane was destroyed due to unawareness of the new technology. This incident happened on December 29, 1972, and EASTERN AIRLINES Flight was approaching to Miami, Florida where there was darkness due to no moon and as the flight approached to the international airport the flight Crew discovered that something was wrong with the Nose Gear as it was not lighting up so they went up bach to the decided altitude and tried again but as the technology was new they...
    </li><li>
      In class someone brought up the idea that the interface of your program or whatever you designed greatly affects how people will use it. The question I have related to this is that would a program with a nicer interface do better than a better program with a worse interface just because it is easier to navigate?
    </li><li>
      In the video, it is about how flight 401, an Eastern Airlines flight crashed because of a burnt-out bulb.Actually, there were some flaws in that jet. A bad interface of the cockpit leads to the second approach of landing by the pilots because the bulb for nose landing gear was burnt out but actually there was no fault in the landing gear. During the reproach pilot in a rush unintentionally hit a button which in turn activated a mode that constantly dropped the altitude of the plane which led to its crash.If the bulb would not have burnt-out, the plane...
    </li><li>
      We discussed about the pros and cons of twitter and how the users are facing problem using twitter. Then we discussed about the blog post 1 topics and how to attempt it elaborately. I would like to know more about the algorithm/protocols that twitter uses to restrict users.
    </li><li>
      Its true sometimes that twitter blocks someones account or post just like youtube and the reason i searched is that due to its bots there are bots sets and sometimes they fail to understand the actual meaning of the tweet or post but just go on to delete it due to its algorithm as bots can not identify the difference between them.I want to know how actually bots are designed and work and what conditions are set before designing bots or anyother thing.Like sometimes its due to error or if some group reports a tweet for any reasons then without...
    </li><li>
      From the video i learned that if we have some problem, we need to solve that problem but while solving . The airplane 401 video gave us a great reference to scrutinize the human error and computer system.One should not complicate a particular scenario, with different context. Therefore, the mind diversion from the situation can cause a great damage to a process and may hinder it despite the design being error-free.
    </li><li>
      I think that when developers create an app for a certain group of people, but then people outside of that intended group start using the app, it can come off as unintuitive for the new users. This is the case with Discord where it was originally intended for gamers as an alternative to older VoiP/IRC clients like TeamSpeak and Curse Voice. For people who used those older programs, Discord seems very intuitive to use, but with the influx of new users during COVID, it can seem difficult to them.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that we learned in this meeting was when we designing a new product safety and ease of use for the client or the costumer should be our top priorities. We should keep in mind that the product should make things easier for the users and not harm them or allow their work to come to harm. This meeting was a continuous of las meeting where we talked about how Flight 401 had a tragic accident just because of a small bauble light and unlike Flight 401 our program should help us to do things fast and...
    </li><li>
      I think its hard to blame the airline for the light bulb breaking in the plane. They made it seem like the $5 light bulb caused the plane to crash. The plane and airline had many redundancy's to fix things like that. The plane beeped at the crew, who missed it, and the control tower did not tell the plane they were losing altitude. The title seems to be click bait which is usually not good for the greater good as too many people read titles and assume the rest of the article.
    </li><li>
      i believe that awareness can make computation towards the goal of CI or AI more efficient by shedding of irrelevant possibilities
    </li><li>
      For “Flight 401”, there are three levels of a good design: visceral, behavioral, and reflective. Visceral design concerns itself with appearances. Behavioral design has to do with the pleasure and effectiveness of use. And reflective design considers the rationalization and intellectualization of a product. Through the three design levels, users can have a deep understanding and familiarity with the product.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. Apparently it's minus 50 with wind chill today. I remember. When I was. Maybe it as an undergraduate or before going to. High School or public school. hearing on the radio in the morning, that exposed flesh would freeze and less than 30 seconds. I don't hear those kinds of warnings of anymore, although it certainly fit for a day like today. We also used to hear that. there's wind chill. To be minus 100. So now I realized that they changed the wind chill scale, so that they don't get. minus 100 values. And I would tell people that voted at minus 100 which when children that. They just wouldn't accept that minus 50 I guess that's more reasonable I. Sure, maybe first me get attendance kind of the way. My car wouldn't start this morning I started last night. should be good, at least until the morning. And then I had to spend. I spent a few minutes outside trying to get what I thought was the cover of the block heater receptacle. Because I didn't have to plug it in as a fairly new car. And plug it in before. So trying to figure out how to get the car plugged in. And then. Going back to the manual. So I was hoping to find. And an illustration of. How to operate cover or what I think is cover. And it's just some text about plugging it in and. More indication of whether you're skeptical is so. This is maybe like a Microsoft manual as well. So it's good to say that maybe. Maybe it's the Microsoft people who are writing the. The Ford manuals. Owners manuals. It just seems like. When I go to look for things in that book. it's not designed for me to find an answer it's. yeah. yeah the card on a blue screen of death, maybe in the future of the group, but dashboard of death. Considering that. Mercedes one to be to be talked about having me. screen. anyway. Think everything's. frozen here going slower in my computer's too close to the outside wall here. Somebody sent me a direct message you can. Go and select everyone again. there's the password in the chat. Simon ready for the break. I couldn't agree with you. A little bit. share my screen, I guess, I didn't. sorry about that. meeting today so 10 before the break. And then we'll be 16 afterwards so we're not. we're about 40% the way through. To 50. Almost. I didn't publish this. Time. I realized it. didn't get published. in a timely fashion so. I apologize for that. Anyone here, but so a few things I want to go through, and then. We can, some of you have referenced Kristen Harris videos. Has anyone seen him in a social dilemma. Okay. yeah. or. doing a reaction on your window would be fine too. Anyone. How many people have heard about. i'm not a cat. said enough to give you the.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;story.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Apparently, is taken over the Internet, over the past. Two days ago, I think.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Love about that video to is in the top left corner, is the warning saying it's illegal to record it but somebody couldn't miss the opportunity to record.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah risking six months jail time.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;contents like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Anyway, it's a short video so i'm gonna. i'm gonna play it, so this is the link to CBC kids news I thought that was interesting. Some some news is there's a fit for kids to watch.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I just saw this.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Apparently us using the system's 10 year old. laptop. Now it seems to be zoom. i'm not aware of any zoom clients have kitty filters available. Have any have you gotten. A CAP filter. For zoom. Anyway, here is the video. had indicated, maybe the theme, the theme for today could be brand new problems question mark. server and was very happy, this is a light moment to share. Their wisdom Nice that it could be shared so quickly. And there's nothing. it's not anyone's expense. That we get from this. fact that we can. We can share things so quickly. In the modern days. Is that a brand new problem or. well. it's not. A brand new problem in. maliciously but it's a brand new opportunity as well, I guess. that's. that's part of the. CT use the catchphrase for the course that's part of the risk and reward of living in the information society, these days. rewards. To carry it on that theme is that we can. The tool, the tools that we use are very flexible. in the sense that we can decide what what to do and. We can take an active role in designing things. meet our needs and our situations you don't have to. Look, for off the shelf systems. We don't have to do things the way that. The software. The software indicates, it should be done so. So, first of all responses to meetings. engagement with meetings. what's on the screen now is. Is a summary. Of the comments or the. Responses I received from from you in. The engagement of meeting forum for meeting. eight. But there's a great variability in their responses and getting. In terms of length and contents of some. You know i've talked about, not so much a summary as. A key key points. This is what i've written here. that's what I reference for in the last question so response to the most recent meeting that can include one or more, the following. The most important thing you learned from the meeting the concept from the past meeting that was most difficult for you understand what you would like to know more about. something you encountered that is related to the past meeting. Is that. Could this description being more clear. Would it be better to say. pick one of these. because some of the. Lessons responses for the meeting eight went up to about five or 600 words. So I haven't when I included the responses to pass meetings in. The page here. or here I didn't do everything exactly. I didn't quote everything. But with 100 and some people in the class is this list. This helpful, or should it be. summarize further. Having. 100 words for the response. That helps to clarify things.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yeah i'd be fine with that I think the only issue i'm having is there any way, we could get some sort of a feedback for the responses, because i'm not really sure if it's exactly what you want, or not, if that makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so. When i'm grading them. I can only great with a mark I can't leave a comment with him. So I would say what I would like is one of these things.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Well it's most important, like most of the chat agrees with 140 character word count or something like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah okay 140 characters. And it's more more substantially reduced than I would like so it's like reading a tweet about the meeting. 140 words is maybe a bit longer. So here's a bit of trivia do you know how. The link I think tech an. SMS message length is 160 characters. Anyone know how that link was determined. Is that they're.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;paying for the towers, or something like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Was the story, I heard was that the fellow who designed, it was he looked at a collection of postcards and he kind of the letters were in the postcard messages. And he decided that hundred and 60 was. He founded 160 years ago about the average. So I looked at the length of the. Responses to meeting eight and I noticed that they were. The median was about 100. So I thought that might be. A good length.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I feel it was inspired by the. SMS thing the more than 140 characters would split into two different SMS is so they just kept kept it so that it wouldn't split them into two.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I think the SMS is 160 isn't it twitter's 140 or was 140. To begin with. So they can't 20 characters for their own. own housekeeping so on so forth. yeah you can have more than one message put together, but I guess it's the question of. what's a reasonable amount what's the reasonable size for a unit, so that you don't have to. break them into more than one. here. Waiting for me. Okay. To look at the history of. These different standards and just to understand. relates to that quote we looked at from Steve Jobs, you know when you realize that. Everything that around around us was designed by people who were no smarter than us. You know, then we can change things so. pattern 60 characters was. nobody's walking around with their phone. They might be talking to my son and video chat. I get motion sickness to talk to him because he's always moving around. anyway. i'll put a word count limit on the. Okay, so we're counted as one thing we can do. And what about the instructions here. So that's one thing to consider, then we show you what i've. done here with. The transcript that I posted in on to your courses in the vtt file. So here, I have. So what I did was I consolidated I took out the timestamps. And I changed people's. Names I gave them identifiers. So when a student one. Until those names are this is to replace the names to protect the innocent. And, here is my identifier D H h. And what I did was I. took all the messages and into the block. I can can say that all messages from the same speaker. In a row so. So there's a different speaker here. stops and then I start again, this is actually me, but it was identified as me. Better. So when I was thinking of. summarizing the transcript. just going through the vtt file. Was was. very tedious so this way. It makes a little more. reasonable to read. So. Unless the audio I didn't do the the chat transcript, but I could do the chat transcript in the same way. Just provided as a standalone not trying to synchronize it with. The timestamps. So maybe maybe the audio and the chat transcripts are. interesting and useful to have. on their own, and then I can. Take this and make the summary out of it. So what i'm going to suggest is that we have. breakout rooms. To discuss. pretend minutes and then we'll come back together and talk about things. That seem all right is that. Clear. Well we're supposed to discuss. The way things are set up. So we have not, this is from the chat so we haven't. talked about a minimum well minimum would be zero I guess. Your words you wouldn't have to do them. Over time, but having a maximum of 100 words. And we can so. Okay, so TIM. I don't know i'm not sure.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Then.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Because there were have the ability to be flexible in the class in the design of the class. And we have these different things available to us. and want to make sure I want to do my best to make sure that we're. valuing your feedback about. The way things are going the way things are being. Here we're using this technology. And the information that we have and the opportunities. With the web and so forth, and audio transcripts and. so on and so forth, to. make this the best. make the best use them to support our. Efforts to think critically about computing. So that's the reason why taking 10 Minutes it. Has a 40% mark. Of the class meetings. anyway. So i'd like you. In your groups to think about. What could be improved or clarified about what i'm asking you to do for engagement. To reading your responses to the meetings. And then. All the records are all the things are laid out on the meetings page. This is a summary of responses, a good. thing to do, I kind of have an. meeting a. summary of responses. And the summary of what was discussed in the outline. and so on and so forth, I guess. what's there that's not. working for you and what's not there, that would be nice to have. Okay, anyway. Here we go. 10 minutes turn now we'll get the act together.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;hi Professor. I was in breakout room 11 but I had to change my privacy settings to use my microphone so you can can you throw me back in that room.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;sure.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Jennifer Jennifer. Jennifer okay. Coming back. Any. New thoughts to share, about. About. Engagement the responses to the engagement for meetings. engagement with meetings.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So i'm happy with them that seems clear to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I think our group is pretty unanimous and the fact that you've gone above and beyond honestly in making this class accessible, I feel like you've done so much work and. It doesn't you know, like I think it's it's all great.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;One thing make it easier for you um and it might also be more helpful for us is, if you just for instead of summarizing all the different responses. That seems like a lot of effort for you, I think what might be a better idea is just choose a favorites response that you wanted to highlight and us to think about and just posted anonymously and choose that one we can read, one for each class sort of thing.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe I can it's fairly straightforward to do the. Do the list of them. So I can I can do, the list of them. And then just we'll just talk about one of them. So okay. In the chat there's a comment about having more about hdi design concepts. This isn't really the hdi class where we talk more about that, which is 428. But the same time we're going to talk a bit more about. hdi stuff. In terms of empathy and. So on so we'll do a bit more. But if you're interested in hdi then i'd encourage you to look at 428 so well. Okay. Anything else.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Could you maybe just expand on like where we're at in the Semester like where we're how far into the textbook we should be and. Like 40% so is that, like. chapters like 124 chapters 123.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we're not falling. Reference book so closely. From 2008. feels like a long time ago now. I wouldn't want to do that. Say we're looking at the social context. And some hdi concepts. yeah so it's not required for the textbook but I gave you a link to the blown to bits book. A reference. So I understood the question anyway. The topics in this in the calendar description. we're going to be guided by current events as well. and see where our discussion takes us. But the idea is to touch on these different things. Captain crunch. So. We can talk about what the exam is going to look like. Okay. Just reading the comment about. That Captain crunch. A few. A few meetings ago I had a link from. CBC ideas about. The philosophy of science, Professor who is talking about. trust. You know, so it says it's not even. That we debate things. In society with debating. strenuously and passionately. That, at some point in time. When people are at the point of saying okay. Well, I don't accept your your your set of facts i'm going to leave my own set of facts. and continue on so at that point that's where were the real problems so i'm I want to be careful about. Saying everyone's personal opinions and so on. TV. there's a connection. So you can have personal opinion that supported by facts Mitch. agreed upon facts situation. You can have opinions, based on. fabrications which are. Not agreed upon his fact. So then it's about how do we make. How do we make arguments about that. and What are what are some pitfalls of logical arguments. That you might get into and then is it. Is it is our only job to analyze the information we have, or do we have to apply judgment as well. take on those things right after the break. So. was done last last offering is last winter. For the final exam was to. was to have a blog kind of post. kind of blog style at SA. an essay like the take home question like the blog entries. That was. So I had a few topics and people will get them around them, and they have a certain amount of time to write about them. So that that seemed to work. As. A file is an exam format. As a kind of an extended exam format. That would. strike a happy medium, I think, between scheduling a particular exam at a particular time. anyway. So we can continue to discuss that. Alright, thanks for your replies we're out of time today. right on the nose I guess. So I have an office hour today at 233 30. Right. now know from three surgeries. You know, when I have and it's on the website i'll be there. And if i'm not there it's rated to. Start i'll be there right away. Okay anything else so. And i'll. wish everyone a great break and. Stay warm and stay well and. we'll see you on the 23rd. Okay. bye everyone.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Well, thanks, very much have a good break.

    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;no you havnt
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;February break was one of the best decisions made by the UofR
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Cold days are good for side projects! Especially during a break
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I really need that time to catch up lol, agreed
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;what is the code?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;004fi5

    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Can you please explain about what exactly we have to write in blog 1
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Please, put another micron of plutonium in the fire...
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;yes sir
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;We've mostly separated church from state, now we need social media to do the same!
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;oh the lawyer!
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;lol heard that
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Interesting metaphor @Shareef
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;oh that was funny
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;thanks, hopefully we can work out the kinks
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;next time I'll choose a golden retriever as my lawyer
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;heard that they are good boys
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, lawyers
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;There was this deep fake rolling around last year where people used Elon Musk's face and I tried that with my meeting with university for coop term
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;"Stop hissing at my witness!"
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Fun times let me tell you
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;There was this one video going around where a person used pre-recorded video of himself on a zoom meeting and others didn't realize it was pre-recorded
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;the lawyer put his secretary under the bus however &gt;:(
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Just own up to it my guy
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Efy9iiQJM&amp;feature=emb_title
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Check this out
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;feels too fake tho
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;like wax figure is talking
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah it was not perfect but fun little thing
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;wait, that was you!
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;No lol
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Panth is next elon
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Hahahah I wish
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;The Canadian Hacksmith guy is the next elon for me
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I personally find it clear
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I do as well.
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I think it’s clear as well
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it is pretty clear
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes I find it difficult to think of something to write in the engagement
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe just added a recommended word count for those who dont attend the lecture
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I'm a philosophy minor so sorry if my musings are long, it's just who I am as a person.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;These all look like solid topics for the blog. Thanks for posting this.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;That's less than a tweet!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;jk
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;A clarified word count would be good
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I like that. Make it 140 characters, to force only the most important concepts. Just like a tweet
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;"Me, We" Mohammad Ali best philosopher fight me
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Id be good with keeping it short too
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I'm fine with short but that seems really short
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Given I've never bothered with twitter so I may just not be used to it
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;what should be the length of blog1?
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;900 words
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;likely has to do with bits
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Something like the size that gets piunged to the tower?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;omg lol wow
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Because it used to be 140, but when they switched to 7-bit encoding were able to squeeze in an extra 20 chars in the same 140 bytes
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I wrote 2 paragraphs lol, my bad
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;160 chars * 7 bits = 1120. 140*8 = 1120
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;so how much should we write for engagements
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;SMS is 160 chars, but uses 140 bytes
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;reddit is 40,000
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;reddit it is
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Twitter is now 280 chars
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;as of current*
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Im good with an 8 character response
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/02/twitter-creator.html
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;cat?
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;can we see the cat please
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I see your cat decides class time is the time to sing the song of its people as well
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;hahaha has someone got a cat audio filter on or is that a legit cat
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Cat requires snack
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;hahaha
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;hahahha
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;we are about to get lawyered by the cat
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;that sounds like a cat-astrophy
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;does he have a cat as well?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;min or max limit?
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;max
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Seems like a good way to do it while keeping privacy standards :)
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Very awesome! :)
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, what are we discussing?
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Can someone please tell me what is min and max limit for engagements?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;ok
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;at least a twitter post
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;For 10 minutes? we are a month and a half into this class!
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Prepare to adapt!
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Can someone tell me the  code of attendance ？
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;...
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Student password 004fi5
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;ty
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good prof, works for me
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;attendance password?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Its been said multiple times
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;scroll up a bit
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Shoot.
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;rip
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;hahah
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;.
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;004fi5
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Good job Preet, you just enabled late behaviour
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;is our blog entry suppose to be in html? like is it suppose to be put on a site?
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;Blog requirements are all on his webiste
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;Rubric, word count, everything
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;yea I noticed that
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I’m not sure why students are being the gatekeepers for other students being early or late
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;it is annoying in the chat
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Agreed
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds like a you problem Shareef
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;but it just seems strange because cs215 isn't a requirement
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;nvm ill figure it out
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;My group had some responses towards increasing the emphasis on HCI/ Design concepts if possible. I think ethics on technology is really cool and the way we conduct class is great, but I'd also like to explore design or UI/UX.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;It says no textbook required for this course
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;The course descriptions also mentions cybercrime and intellectual property theft etc. Is this gonna be upcoming topics
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;the captain crunch whistle hack was so cool IMO
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;From the point of view of the exams, I feel like what we've been doing so far is just debating different points of view about a topic and how we all feel about it personally and not following a specific objective direction. So I am wondering if the exams are gonna be the same or something different?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;early internet days people could hack into the phone line with a certain frecuncy
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;the whistle came from a cereal box and the guy had free phone calling
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/02/phone-phreaks-the-toy-whistles-early-hackers-used-to-break-into-the-phone-network.html
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;did i cover the exam question?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yes! Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I thought you answered it well.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I understand. It fits the class too, thanks
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for taking our input!
