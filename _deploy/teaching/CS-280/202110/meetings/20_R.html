      What is professional certification? It is usually used to certify a person's professional quality in a certain field, and to obtain a certificate or license by passing an exam. In fact, many people immigrate to Canada every year. If they choose skilled immigrants, they often need a professional certification in this field to prove that they have professional standards. Professional certification is a very effective means to guarantee the professionalism of employees in all walks of life.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned in this class was that a degree has more to it than just a degree. Before this class, I didn't even know what CIPS was, let alone accreditation/certification/membership. Who knew that a UofR CS degree could provide us more qualifications automatically and help improve our credentials. I wonder if there is any other thing like CIPS we should be aware of. It would be helpful to have these titles when trying to enter the workforce and when writing an updated resume.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we talk to Thomas richard who came to explain us and give some information about CIPS accredited programs it is an educational program for universities and colleges so he explains us about it and give all answer about the questions we have so it was nice session and we get chance to learn about some new programs as well.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we had a presentation by CIPS Saskatchewan Vice President, Thomas Boxall. He introduced us to the certifications that CIPS offers and how it can be a good add on on our resume and CV. The AITP is a first-level certificate which will help students who want to continue their studies in the IT industry. It was a good, insightful presentation and helped me figure out the steps needed to put a foot in the IT industry.
    </li><li>
      I thought this presentation was interesting, as while many of us may know about different certifications you can get to add onto your resume, it was good to see what they can actually mean. It adds meaning to the string of letters you can see after names on job titles, as well as shows the benefits to being a part of these organizations or getting certifications, both connection wise and pay wise. It was also good to see that we can qualify for some of these with minimal extra effort on our end, just by having our program through the...
    </li><li>
      in this meeting, we had a guest from CIPS. CIPs is Canada's association of IT Professionals. the guest was Mr Thomas Boxall. he explained to us the meaning of this organization, one of the interesting things I have learned that this association provides licencing/certification from CIPS (Canada's association of IT Professionals) for certain IT NOC for SINP (Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program). It is amazing to have this certificate in future and it only takes 2 years of experiences to get it plus it is recognized all over the world
    </li><li>
      During the presentation last class from the CIPS Vice-President, the main takeaway was that it is important to get a leg up on other competitors and applicants when applying for a job. With the additional accreditation that CIPS offers for our program, we're able to have access to a title that looks good on our resume and is appealing to future employers.
    </li><li>
      Great to know about CIPS as I am about to graduate next year. Right now, I am struggling with my job search. As long as there is something that can help me to the next step, I am forever grateful.Very nice of Thomas for going through the application process and answering all the questions. Free membership for students is great. Lots of good questions that I didn’t even think about.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we had a presentation on CIPS.
    </li><li>
      On last meeting, There is a speech by the CIPS manager, he introduce the CIPS program to us, The speech is talking about mainly the three program designations. CIPS stands for Canadian Information Processing Society, which is a national IT association of 10 Provincial regulators that license IT professionals in Canada and abroad. For AITP which is Associate Information Technology Professional (AITP) can be easily get by apply for it through the CIPS official website, another two required knowledge test. The benefits of getting the designation is: when apply for a job, the employer will see the title beside your...
    </li><li>
      Well there was no lecture that day so nothing so discuss but it was a great presentation and was knowledgeable!Thank you very much for organising!
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was about the value of the CIPS certification. It was helpful to learn about the better job prospects and better pay that comes with the CIPS certification. I will definitely apply in my third year of studies. I would like to learn more about other certifications that could help my career.
    </li><li>
      We had a very interesting discussion at the last meeting. I liked to hear Richard. In all honesty, I was totally unaware of this professional designation before the previous lecture. However, I am now interested in it, and so I have surfed some websites to learn more. I believe this is a very positive step in making students knowledgeable of the opportunities. If you know that you want to be and how you achieve your destination, you will work accordingly and will succeed in accomplishing your dreams.
    </li><li>
      I learned quite a bit from the presentation and do plan on becoming a CIPS member and getting that designation. I wonder if all CS students get this presentation, because I had never before heard that the U of R's CS program was accredited. It is certainly a nice bonus to hear of.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed many things and learned many of them with vice president of CIPS organization about the professional conduct and procedure for becoming a member. He discussed many things about how CIPS helps for getting good job and maintain you to be an important part of organization. We also learnt how CIPS suspends the members if they commit any internal or external IT crime.
    </li><li>
      I would be interested in hearing more about cips from the employer side. The people with cips would obviously like to brag about how good it is. How do people employing across boards and within boards find cips on a resume if it makes a big difference or not.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we had a presentation explaining CIPS and its AITP designation. Something I worry about is not having the prerequisite experience to get hired after graduating. That's why I think it's nice that this class offers this information to get a potential leg-up on other applicants. Another example of the University doing this is changing the Comp-sci bachelors program to have two mandatory classes dedicated to software engineering (now that 476 is mandatory). So I'll give this AITP certificate a serious consideration if it will actually help me in the future.
    </li><li>
      We got to know about AITP. designation and how we become a member of CIPS.
    </li><li>
      I wasn't really interested in the job opportunity that was presented last class, especially since I'm only in my second year and it applies to after graduation
    </li><li>
      meeting responsein the last meeting, the professor introduce CIPS. So what is CIPS? CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society) is the professional association of IT professionals in Canada. Since 1958 CIPS has helped strengthen the Canadian IT industry by establishing standards and sharing best practices for the benefit of individual IT professionals and the sector as a whole. CIPS represents thousands of members across the country as Canada’s Association of Information Technology Professionals. CIPS offers Networking opportunities, Certification of IT professionals (I.S.P. and ITCP certifications), Accreditation of IT Post-Secondary programs, a niche IT Job Board, a voice to government, and represents...
    </li><li>
      In this lecture, Thomas Box, vice president of the CIPS Saskatchewan had a presentation about CIPS and the different designations offered by CIPS. He really had a good presentation and we got to know a lot about CIPS, designations offered (AIT, ISP, ICP), and what is the eligibility and how to apply for these designations. It was a great session and hope that professor arranges more sessions like this.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture, we talked about a couple of things out of which our major focus was on "Professional Designations". The term "Professional Designation" basically stands for "a stamp of approval". It means that you're professionally skilled for working in corporate world or your particular field of work.
    </li><li>
      The CIPS presentation by Thomas RM Boxall was very education. I learned about the three different designations AITP , I.S.P. and ITCP. I will definitely be applying for AITP before my graduation. I strongly believe having a designation such as AITP will help me land a job quicker.
    </li><li>
      Today was my first introduction to CIPS. Although I am not interested in IT, I find CIPS provision of job postings, mentoring programs, and networking opportunities to be very valuable as a student that will be entering the tech industry in a few years time; these resources are beneficial for helping students like myself develop the necessary skills to navigate the industry. Moreover, I find hope in computer professionals working towards CIPS membership and designation, which requires years of experience in the field and to uphold the CIPS Code of Ethics and Standards. It is important for us to honour...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing was to know how each device is connected to each other thru internet, although we have setup security for each links but there are still loop holes that needs to be resolved not only on devices but in networking as well
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned from the last meeting was the benefits of professional designations and the designations I can apply for. Although it wasn't too difficulty to understand, I am still unclear of the differences between the ISP, ATP, ISP, and ITCP regulations. I would enjoy learning more about the professional benefits that these designations provide. It seems a very simple task to apply and receive these designations, so I would love to learn more about what these designations signify. I have seen presentations or representatives of KIPS at job fairs and heard mention of mention them in...
    </li><li>
      In our 20th meeting we discussed an optional computer science opportunity that will help us with finding jobs in our Computer science careers.
    </li><li>
      We discovered the 3 different classifications in CIPS presentation: AITP, I.S.P. and also ITCP. I am going to undoubtedly be making an application for AITP just before my graduation. I firmly feel having a classification like AITP will certainly assist me land a project quicker.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we discussed Cips (Canadian Information Processing Society). The definition of Cips is also explained and described in detail. The goals and significance set by Cips are very significant. We also focused on how to apply for Cips qualification and what is needed. Many questions have been answered
    </li><li>
      Having a professional designation for computing professionals would be a great idea! By using this designation you could control what a computing professional is capable. You can limit what is allowed by only letting people with the designation to be able to do things. This could forward ethical programming. This like a computing governing body that looks into the ethics of progamming and audits companies for their ethics would be a very good idea.
    </li><li>
      In previous meeting we had presentation about CIPS. The vice present from CIPS Saskatchewan explained how this CIPS course can be a good addition for student who want to build a career in IT profession. I never heard of this course before but now after the presentation I would really love to research more and have this addition to my resume for future benefit.
    </li><li>
      On professional designationsWe had the chance to learn about CIPS, that provided a professional designation of information technology to students and recent grades from the computer science background. Much like an engineering degree carries the professional designation as a professional engineer, this provides a similar mark of recognition for IT professionals. It’s also important in addition to taking this designation to know the in’s and out’s of various information technology related procedures. Managing databases, planning for network architecture, supplying key organizational documents from the ground up all are valid requirements within the field of IT. It’s also interesting to note...
    </li><li>
      Our guest speaker was highly interesting and provided a great connection between the classroom and our future work. In the days since I've been doing some reading on CIPS, and was struck by the difference in the organization's status from one province to the next. While CIPS is legally recognized here in Saskatchewan as a self-regulating body, there are other provinces where this isn't the case. This had me wondering: with remote work becoming increasingly popular with tech workers and companies, are there jurisdictional issues surrounding ethics enforcement where a member's work crosses provincial boundaries? If a CIPS member does...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we just listened the lecture delivered by the guest and asked him questions. It was interesting
    </li><li>
      The last lecture about AITP is really helpful for me, thank you for holding the lecture.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we had a Guest lecturer, who is currently Vice president of CIPS Saskatchewan. He told us about the certificates CIPS provides and the opportunity we will get by getting to enroll in this program. He also told us about the CIPS membership, which has jobs exclusively available to CIPS members. Overall, it was a great experience, and I came to know about lots of new things.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 20, we have a presentatiion about CIPS, which proviides us an oppotunitity to have a job after we graguate from universiity.
    </li><li>
      Meeting 20 was very informative about professional designations. I want to thank Dr. Daryl Hepting for giving us the early opportunity to learn about CIPS. I hope to get my certification soon.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we had a presentation from guest "Thomas Box" VP of CIPs (Canadian Information Processing Society). Before this class I didn't had any idea about CIPs certification as I am almost about to graduate this certificate will help to get a job in IT profession.
    </li><li>
      I appreciate that Thomas took the time to outline the AITP designation, but the IT world is the last thing that I am concerned about or even remotely interested in. I fail to see how maintaining a designation is worth the commitment of renewals every 3 years, and the potential of a marginal pay raise after investing so much in a Computer Science Degree. I can’t help but think about the ethics of obtaining and maintaining certifications. I was reminded of the conversions in earlier lectures pertaining to Blog Entry 2, of how some companies may claim to serve the...

      In this meeting. We listened to a guest lecturer and asked him some question. It was good. However, i got lost in middle of a the lecture. I guess i get the most of it. Overall it was good for a change.
    </li><li>
      about the cips, I want to join it. But I concern about am I able to pass the program. Because my grade is not high at all, and the talker said it can use in any country. It like an international pass, I'm afraid the program is hard. So I decide to not join the program
    </li><li>
      In today's meeting the lacturer thomas was a good impression and I acknowledge the tcp connection, it was nice to know about the membership of kips and how it can help in the near future for the opportunities
    </li><li>
      I think CIPS certification has certain benefits for computer science majors. After the CIPS certification, This certification will be of great help in our future work and more in-depth study of computers. Second, CIPS certification helps show students CIPS members' views on IT industry opportunities and the importance of professionalism, ethics, and continuous career development. Although I want to apply for this certification, I may not be able to participate for some personal reasons.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned was that Kips is not equivalent to a degree, it is a designation. What a designation tells employers is that you are on the path to becoming an IT professional. Meaning that one has gone through the training of an accredited program and you have gained the knowledge necessary to to be considered an IT professional within their eyes.
    </li><li>
      I think the guest speaker was grate and I have already registered to become a member of the organization. it would be nice if we could have another guess speaker before the end of the semester.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we a had Thomas Boxall from Sask CIPS as our guest who give us useful information about AITP, ISP and ITCP. I think it was very helpful to have him because he give us useful information such as that we have to personally apply for AITP designation before graduation as it's not done automatically. I think we shouldn't have to apply for AITP designation ourselves and it should be done automatically by the institution that we graduate from as these will help us find jobs easier in the future.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a great discussion with gentlemen from CIPS. That session was having lots of information regarding student's career and Their future planning. Will excited to attend some session like this.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned in the class was about CIPS organization.
    </li><li>
      Really informative about job searching and certification and i really liked it but it was just for bachelor student so would be more nice if something was for diploma students as well.But really nice session
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, there was a guy named Thomas who was there in the class meeting discussed all about the CIPS he also taught that how to receive the CIPS certificate and what important role does it plays.It was a very informative secession and if possible it would be great if there are secessions like this.
    </li><li>
      The class was about CIPS seminar and it was an informative session. I learnt about how to get an extra credential as a computer science graduate.
    </li><li>
      the last class I learnt about cips, I also learnt about different types of certifications available
    </li><li>
      The CIPS representative enhanced the information about the designation of DIPS and how important is it to enroll in CIPS as a member and accomplish the certificates that he mentioned. He also inclined more how it would help you to be one step closer to get a job.
    </li><li>
      The last meeting was pretty simple. We discussed and learned about ISP, CIPS and their application process long with other stuff that will be helpful for us to get professional standards.
    </li><li>
      In the last discussion , we attended a virtual presentation by mips sask. I gotta know about the eligibility of their certification to diploma and degree students.
    </li><li>
      Last meeting we talked about AITP designation. I learned that this is important and advantageous when applying to jobs. Certification is based on the completion of a cs degree. With this the holder is able to have access to CIPS. I also the process of acquiring the free certification.
    </li><li>
      In the last class meeting, we had a meeting with Thomas Richard (co-host) he gave us information about the computer-related fields about the CIPS as the description of the courses like the accredited programs and membership registration, and personal certifications for work like how to apply for that and more information about these all in detail. as it is the kind of virtual presentation by MIPS sask. it was nice meeting with him. we got a lot of knowledge.
    </li><li>
      I was unable to attend thursday, i sent you an email telling you why. I do have some questions though, did anyone hear anything amazing during Thursday, or was it informational? i hope i can check out the log file when i get time, it was defiantly something amazing to look forward to.
    </li><li>
      In class we were visited by a guest speaker who brought up a company in which students like us could seek employment for once we are out of the computer science field. I don't have much to say on this topic as if you attended the lecture it was pretty self explanatory but one question i do have is how hard it is to get into this company. What is the percentage of people who get accepted?
    </li><li>
      Cips is a good introduction to the computer professional society... it helps build good professional relation of a computer graduate and improve the job society at large
    </li><li>
      In this class, we mainly completed the introduction of CIPS and the explanation of how to apply for the membership. We listened to whether the membership of CIPS would provide extra points for students majoring in CS in their future resumes.This is a constraint on the ethics of the computer industry.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we had a guest speaker talking about cips explaining what its all about as well as how the certification program takes only 2 years and is very recognized worldwide 
    </li><li>
      CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society) is a federation which provides many services to IT professionals in Canada. They provide certifications to IT professionals: the AITP, ISP, and ITCP designations. These certifications tell employers that the certified member follows a code of ethics and has a high level of knowledge and ability. They also provide accreditation of university programs which allows students from accredited universities to have a fast track to ISP and ITCP designations. Lastly, they provide a job board for IT professionals to find work.
    </li><li>
      In today’s meeting we got to know more about CIPS an national IT association. Other professor talk about it in details and guided us through how can we apply and what all are the requirements and qualifications you need to apply. It was a knowledgeable meeting.
    </li><li>
      In the past lecture, we had a guest in our class. He made us introduce to different topics such as professional designations and CIPS and I learned a good number of things related to computing. Hope to know about more new things in next lectures.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we had a guest speaker discussing about AITP designation. The pre-professional Associate Information Technology Professional designation and Candidate Membership is the first step to obtaining Professional I.S.P. status. AITP holders have recently completed a relevant IT University or College education program, but do not yet have the required experience for the Professional I.S.P. designation. It is the primary qualification for the I.S.P. and ITCP Designations, which gets you access to CIPS and their resources.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we had the professor introduce us to CIPS the Canadian Information Processing Society. It acts as a society of people who establish a standard for best practice for IT professionals.It can be a great skill to acquire and to add it to our skill set.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the idea of professional designations was introduced in the class by the guest. It was a good experience as I got to learn different things from him. The idea of CIPS was also a good thing to know about. Overall, it was a great experience.
    </li><li>
      I thought it was really valuable to learn about the CIPS membership and the benefits involved. I'm curious to do a bit more research to see what the value is for members and whether or not it's worth the yearly membership but I appreciate that my schooling is enough for the certification process and I very much appreciate an accountability process for members. I'd love to know more about the many types of certifications available out there to expand my options as a future computer professional and how CIPS stands up compared to those other certifications.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discussed about CIPS organization, we had an interesting session with Richard
    </li><li>
      Richard was the host of the previous meeting. CIPS was something different and fascinating that I heard about.
    </li><li>
      the last zoom meeting was delivered by the guest named Thomas Richard i really found it interesting for myself. As he taught us the information about the computer related fields especially about the CIPS as the description of course like accredited programs.
