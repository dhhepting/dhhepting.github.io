      My response on your ques about videos is that the programming is a fun and we have to take inspiration from little coding that we can learn it and make it more interesting and from other video also is that we have to influence from it
    </li><li>
      I am sorry i post the wrong discussion actually it was about the meeting 2 i post later for meeting 3
    </li><li>
      It was nice discussing in depth about each video in points. A suggestion from next class if you can use any text editor instead of writing with a pen in notes it's just easier to read and understand. Overall everything was good and also Dr. Hepting if you can upload course material so we can understand the course in a depth and know what we are going to do in the overall semester.
    </li><li>
      Today we discussed about the conclusions we had about last meeting's two videos. We discussed how everyone should start learning to code and once we do we must find a proper moral framework on using personal user data.
    </li><li>
      Our discussion about choices to permit or deny the collection of user data from a computer system made me think about how these choices are influenced by the nature of the entities that provide the software/hardware/services in question. It seems to be widely understood in the tech sector that data is now a valuable commodity. Since publicly traded, for-profit companies are accountable to shareholders who expect to see the value of the company (and therefore their shares) increase over time, there is a powerful incentive for such companies to collect and monetize data. Open-source software projects supported and managed by...
    </li><li>
      From this meeting I clearly know the syllabus of this course.
    </li><li>
      Hey everyone, here is my response to today’s discussion:Change in viewBefore today's class I thought the two videos 'Code Stars' and 'Moral Operating System' were relatively unrelated. After today's class however, I find the contrast between them really interesting. Code stars can almost be seen as a recruitment drive to try and motivate people to go into development. It highlights many of the more positive aspects of coding, but ignores ethical issues surrounding technology and development - there is 'no moral imperative'. On the other hand, 'moral operating system' brings to light some of the issues with technology, and how...
    </li><li>
      My understanding of computing is that it is the process of using computers to perform unique functions for us because our time is too valuable and computers are much more efficient (when they work). We use them to assist us with achieving more than we could on our own.There are also some creative merits to computing, too, as you could get a computer to create any application that you want.
    </li><li>
      Today was my first class in this course and simply by it alone I can already tell that it is going to be one I find very interesting. From this class I had one topic that stuck with me and that is what are the limits of computing? I know this wasn't discussed directly within the class but when we talked about the programming of the mouse and the creation of things such as Microsoft and twitter, I thought of how far programming could go and what innovations will be the next step for our current generation of programming. Another...
    </li><li>
      Q: WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PURPOSE OF COMPUTING?For me, the purpose of computing is to create tools, software, applications, etc. that will help people (either professional or public) - whether that's to automate a task, offer support or accessibility, meet some kind of need or solve some kind of problem.Q: Talk about something related to today's discussion.I was grateful to the student (sorry, I can't remember who) for mentioning that "Code Stars" felt like a recruitment short. There was some sort of uncomfortable undercurrent that I felt when watching it and I couldn't put my finger on it...
    </li><li>
      While our discussion had a lot of different topics I think I would like to learn more about digital data collection. I, like many people (I would like to think), don't really read the user agreement/private policy/etc. of goods and services I use. In fact, I don't really understanding them, even if I read them. This is potentially very dangerous, as if don't really understand how a particular good and service has used/collected my data (and invaded my privacy), I have not prepared myself on the potential repercussions of my personal data collected (say if that data was hacked). Thus,...
    </li><li>
      When we are talking about a moral operating system, I do not think this is necessary. A moral person will do moral things and someone who is just after money will ignore morals for money. As we see with twitter bans, twitter knows what is wrong however they chose not to ban everyone. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/trump-twitter-account-copy-tweets-glorifying-violence-suspended-a9545831.html The article shows that twitter knew a long time ago that most of what trump was tweeting however did not ban him. So the question then being do we really need a moral operating system? Twitter banned an account that did everything Trump did so therefore...
    </li><li>
      In todays class we talked about the 2 videos that we have watched in last meeting. Professor was asking about our opinion and observation based on the “Code stars” and “Moral operating system” that, what computing is useful for. Many people had many opinions about it. Many of us discussed about their thought on this questions. Some people said: its an expanding industry that’s cross multiple fields, recurring drive, way of creating job opportunities etc. In my opinion computing is a way to express our technological thoughts. There are no limits into it, you can build anything you want by...
    </li><li>
      My opinion of the purpose of computing is a skill. It is a skill that you learned and acquired knowledge over time. Just like in any other field of science or any other profession. It can be used with good intentions such as the first video of the past lecture “Code Stars”, where they overly make it look like coding is just for good purpose only, which is not realistic. It can be used with bad intentions as well, such as hackers. For example, last year, Sask eHealth was under a ransomware attack, and a lot of data about the...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this past meeting is the purpose of computing and software. The purpose of computing and software is to increase productivity and to make our society more efficient. Compared to the past, we can finish many tasks more easily and quickly. With the advancement in computing and technology, there is more opportunity to create innovations and to improve the quality of life. We are able to find and access information instantly and becoming more productive everyday. One interesting question that arose from the meeting was whether a software is about helping people or...
    </li><li>
      Hii everyone the response about the last discussion topics is here,firstly in the last class we were discuss about the last 2 videos that we supposed to watched and doing the discussion about the that topics such as the code stars and the moral operating system. Then after that we get the description about that two topics that are really interesting and have a contrast with each other as that the Code stars can almost be seen as a recruitment to try and it motivate people to go into the development. and as well it highlights many of the more...
    </li><li>
      I found that we didn't cover much in Monday's class beyond what was included in last week's video, but I found the instructor view of UR Courses to be very interesting! :)
    </li><li>
      The purpose of computing is essentially to make our lives easier. Computing has made a lot of aspects of our lives easier such as communicating with people who are far away, and completing complex math problems that take humans quite a while to figure out in a matter of seconds. It has also made storing and retrieving data a lot easier with the sorting and search algorithms. Industries like manufacturing have become almost fully automated due to computing requiring for humans to work less on strenuous tasks. 
    </li><li>
      From my point of view,Computer is a big need of present era. We can't imagine our life without computer. Everything around us is working by computer. Computers are general-purpose information machines that can perform a variety of tasks on data.
    </li><li>
      During the session itself, I found it very interesting seeing the different things that people got from the videos, and was refreshing to see a semi-wide variety of conclusions drawn from it instead of all sharing the exact same thoughts.In terms of what the "Purpose of Coding" is, I think it is a way to solve problems. Whether those be creative or logical problems, it is an outlet for us to find solutions to problems. Whether we are designing compression algorithms to make accessing content online easier to those with poor or limited internet access, utilizing as a creative outlet...
    </li><li>
      From last meeting, we've gone through some brilliant ideas of the video “code stars”. Here’s my thoughts from the last meeting about what is the purpose of computing?From “code stars”:The reasons are the development of industry and the job needed from society. We can see many traditional jobs have been taken by programs, which do more efficiently than human work. It's a trend, there will be more needed jobs requiring computing skills. And not all about jobs, learning computing is not hard as calculus, it’s fun, and easy to get resources online. Software can help people in different ways, to...
    </li><li>
      Watching the two videos posted has put things in a different perspective for me. I never thought of online spaces being compared to real life spaces. The speaker makes some excellent points, these platforms are very lax on structure and don't offer the necessary structure for long term survival. Different applications are different spaces and therefore constitute a different response from users. We need online spaces that reflect real world spaces.The filter bubble video was also very informative. It's true you can't see the big picture if there are gatekeeping algorithms hiding information from you because they don't think it...
    </li><li>
      for me the overall purpose of programing is to make some contribution to another field. a good use of computing is to make something that would otherwise be impossible or too dangerous and make it possible. For example the use of computers to render a visual image of a black hole based solely on the math. the reason that I got into computer science was in partly due to my curiosity of how this device that we spend most of our time interacting with works. but the major reason was to create the program that I perceived to be missing...
    </li><li>
      The lecture started with a discussion about the two videos that we had to watch and a lot of points were put forth by the students about what the main theme of the video was. There was a consensus between majority of the students, that the 1st video was a recruitment drive, inviting people to learn to code and highlighting how it is as simple as picking up a brush and starting to paint. It showed a picture of how there will be shortage of computer science graduates in the upcoming years compared to the number of jobs that will...
    </li><li>
      We discussed the purpose of computing. I believe multiple reasons affect me in why I want to do computing. First, it is a growing industry, it can be applied in nearly every field, and can find a job with well paid. Secondly, it offers a lot of things that what we can be computing on. It also has the power to change the world such as AI. Computing has the power to create things from our imagination.For the moral operating system, I believe it is a really hard thing to do. Because people's perception of what is moral and what...
    </li><li>
      Well from what I learn from the lecture on is on how there are so many different responsibility and on how theres so much going on.
    </li><li>
      In my opinion the purpose of computing as I understand and see it — is ultimately to solve problems. When we code and make programs and the like, we typically have an end goal in mind. Be it mathematical, scientific, or something creative. Computers can do what we as humans would rather not do, which is repetitive tasks, be it dozens, hundreds, thousands or even millions of times. To use a topical example, suppose you wanted to model COVID-19 and its spread - sure you could sit down, crunch some numbers, and plot a little graph yourself - but why...

      When first deciding which field of study to pursue in university, I was unsure about Computer Science. I was under the assumption that the evolution of computers would dominate the future and was weary about what this would look like. However, upon taking a web-design course in high school and thinking critically about my goals, I realized that, if computers are to shape the future, why not be part of creating the future that I wish to see? I decided to take what seemed like an unknown path at the time, and I see the immense benefit in that decision...

      As for "beware online filter bubbles", Web companies will adjust services according to people’s personal preferences, like different people search same item at website, the output of results are total different. We hope that the web company can let everyone set their own personal preferences.And for "what obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good", social media is already indispensable for everyone. We can learn about the latest news or news happening around us from the Internet. Anyone can post a message on social media to let others know you more fully.

      Computing is any objective-arranged action requiring computers to manage, and process communication/information handled by a person. Computing creates an environment to design and build software and application programs for a wide range of its own purposes which could be processing, and also managing various types of information. Moreover, there are different contexts in which the term “Computing” have been used based on specifics. Computing itself deals with mathematical concepts, it follows an endless systematic algorithm concept. In reference to the Babylonians in 2400BC, the earliest tool used for computation was known as the abacus. The main purpose of “Computing” is...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 3 , we talked about the two videos(code star), as what is computer programming and its answered as that programming is something like instructing the computer, what to do and the morals of computing like maintaining privacy. The discussion was about the purpose of computing. My understanding of the purpose of computing is basically, performing all the logical calculations in seconds, storing large amounts of data and developing new software to help out the whole world . And the main purpose for studying computing is to being updated with the new technical techniques as nowadays its all about...
    </li><li>
      From the last lecture I got to know about the course outline. I got to understand the purpose of computing also about the moral adapting system.

      From the last discussion I found coding to be a very powerful tool. You can be from any profession but still you can become a programmer. Computer technology is growing to a vast extent. I learnt about the growing opportunities in the field of computers. Computer technology deals with benefits and risks both.

      Thoughts on Filter Bubbles and ObligationsThe first video is a snippet of a TED Talk presented by Eli Pariser, and the inventor of the term “filter bubble”. Eli is a political activist presenting interesting thought points on the internet and its role in our society today. His points go further and reach out to how certain companies have changed the internet by monetization or recording data from its users to feed into internal machine learning models, and how that affects the end user’s mental, and political state of thought. Parsier easily communicates the concept of how these online companies have...

      My understanding of the purpose of computing would be that of the development of either hardware or software that helps in making certain tasks easier for us. In all our daily lives we all have things we really don't feel like doing or wish someone else could do for us and this is where I believe computing comes in. The development of things like washing machines, dryers, cars etc. all came as a result of this so as to make things like washing clothes and travelling easier.

      In our meeting 3, We discussed about the 2 videos that we watched in meeting 2. We went through the videos in details and professor took the opinions from all the students. After that, we briefly went through the syllabus. Professor also asked us to answer this question “What is your understanding of the purpose of computing”. My understanding of computing is that computing is an necessary to our day to day life. Now a days computers are everywhere such as; school, collages, hospitals, work places, supermarkets and more. Computer made our life easier. We can’t imagine having our life...

      Previous videosAs per video code star:we can say that there are huge opportunities for those are in the field of computer as there are multiple uses. The developer should make the application or program with the consideration of users. Concept of helping people creates the feeling of humanity.I learned about the opportunities and concept of humanity in development of software. As per video Moral operating system:we can say that it is hard to make decision to break the rule of personal privacy to protect humanity as it involves the ethics and etiquettes. So, it is hard to get to decision as...

      I think one major importance of computers and the internet is that they allow people from all over the world to communicate with each other. This provides many benefits to most people but it also has some downsides. Criminals can communicate with each other and conduct illegal activities over the internet. Finding out about and stopping these activities can involve invading the privacy of innocent people which is a huge ethical dilemma. I believe privacy is very important and I am interested to know some of the leading opinions on dealing with this issue.

      The most important thing you learned from this past meetingComputing is the essential part of the last meeting. I learned that every sector globally is growing and handling the complex systems we need to make things more effortless and secure. Learners can also benefit from it like mastery, and it has no limit anytime and anywhere. According to Pastori, "Do what makes a lot of money, do what a lot of people use" means a person should play over the public's interest. Softwares in the market -Softwares are about happening people and solving real-life puzzles.The concept from this past meeting...

      My take on purpose of computing is basically to solve issues. There are lots of places where we can apply computing, from industry to day to day lives. In each situation new set of problems appear and by computing we can fix those issues. Now, in general sense, computing is basically working and playing with information, to calculate, to understand and apply data. But these information is not something completely isolated. Each of these data, calculation and understanding helps us to solve a problem, create something new or improve existing technology. So I think in the end of the day,...

      According to my understanding, the purpose of computing is to make human life easier and better. It also includes various kinds of purpose regarding information processing, structuring and managing. We can gather the information on anything of our need, and this can be possible through programmed data. In the field of technology, computer science is the department which helps us to know the way in which technology works and the way in which software engineering is changing the world for everyone.
    </li><li>
      Computing is a tool of creativity. The purpose of computing is to expand the variety of things can be done in the industry. It is really helpful to people and everyone can use it too. Computing is limitless, you can create whatever you want to create with it. The interesting thing is that its not that difficult if you really understand the basics like as said in lecture not all math, you can simply use logic in it too. The softwares are really about making things easy to people. Computing is designing and building hardwares, softwares for various purpose. It's...
    </li><li>
      One of the question raised in the class was: What is your understanding of the purpose of computing? I think the purpose of computing is to make our life as simple/smarter as possible which includes helping people in the process.
    </li><li>
      We learned and had a good conversation about the two videos which was helpful and motivational. That is we can use computer in many every field and is very helpful. But we also have to take in note that we don’t breach the privacy of any person by using technology we have. Indeed computer programming is the best field for me and this video helps us feel motivated.

      The purpose of computing is to have solution of every problem.In this world of technology, the advanced computing system has gives us many opportunities to fulfill our dreams.Human can make mistake, but computer don't. The algorithm helps us to know how machine works and solve problems.The computer science is not longer just a vocational for getting job instead it is completely foundational for getting any job. The tech industry is fast growing and there is no greater opportunity to change the world through technology as it is effecting every field. It's not only about computing device but also medicine, space...

      starting with the ted talk on beware of bubble filters, this is something that is well known to a lot of individuals in recent time. Most social Media pages are tailor made to suite what an individual would is most likely to want to see on his timeline and they avoid things we don't want to see. Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are all the top media app that use the bubble filter. Honestly, I don't mind the bubble filter cause it narrows it down to what I want to see and the one major trouble individuals have with the...

      The purpose of computing is to evolve world. Computing gives opportunity to humans what they can’t do just by man labour. Computing makes innovation limitless. Though its our responsibility to decide what we do with this opportunity. Its very similar to a man possessing a rifle, he can either use that to save people or he can do evil by killing innocents. For me, I’ve been into gaming from my childhood and it just fascinates me to see how computers can make those virtual worlds. Learning computing will help me answer those questions and open new doors for me.

      Question from meeting 3: "What is your understanding on the purpose of computing?"The purpose of computing is to perform calculations, process various information, and store/retrieve data on a scalable level. The ability to compute created businesses, some of which are now the most profitible and powerful in the world (google, for example), as well as brough forth an unprecedented level of scientific research and discovery. For instance, we never would have seen the first image of a black hole without immense computing power. We would have not seen many amazing discoveries without the power of modern computing. Lastly and perhaps...

      Hello"Beware online filter bubbles" by Eli Pariser talks about this online filters that are created by complex algorithms to create a tailored experience for user. He explains it as a filter bubble and tells everyone to beware of it because it is filtering the content based upon what algorithm thinks we like rather that what we really like, in fact controlling the internet for us. Many companies like Facebook and google are doing it without even user knowing about it. To explain this he took the example of his Facebook account which shows him filtered content. In addition to that...

      I think the biggest thing I took from the discussion was the contrast between the two videos. Computer science is often portrayed as a very innovative and even sort of hip thing, with all these cool offices and startups and such. The problems of privacy are another very big thing and are talked about frequently as they're a huge concern, but I've never really seen them put together and the topic of privacy really isn't brought up much when learning about computer sciences and such which I had really never noticed. These issues have everything to do with computer programming...
    </li><li>
      I think that computing is very important in the present time and that each one of us should learn about computing because our day starts with it and also ends with it. It helps us to better connect with people, help them by making software beneficial for them and create a benchmark in the technological world.I want to learn more about computing because computing is an endless world. Every day we can learn more about it, discover more about it but still, there would be a huge portion left to know about. 
    </li><li>
      In meeting 3 we discussed as a group the videos we watched in meeting 2, like how in video one it talks about how great a job in computer science can be with its good pay work environment and how there is a lot of opportunity. One person noted that it leaves out the bad of computer science.then in video 2 they discuss data collection and how far we should go in collecting that data is it morally right to do so.
    </li><li>
      The third meeting is all related to our real life activities. The first video, beware online filter bubbles is very much true and the same things happen with me all the time not only on google but also on other social platforms like Instagram. it is true that internet shows us the things that it thinks that want to see not the things that we should see or know. the thing i learnt from this video is that web is not standard anymore. it will show us the results basis on our previous searches.the second video is quiet similar it...

      For me, computing has many purposes. Some of these are listed below:1. To drastically reduce the time it takes to do complex calculations2. To reduce or eliminate the repetitive tasks that humans have to do so they can focus on things that cannot be accomplished by machines3. To empower people to create4. To help solve real problems faced by the modern civilizationMy purpose of studying computing is to learn about all the super cool things that go with it, be it AI, machine learning, IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, etc. And learn how different computing technologies can be applied to solve various...

      My understanding of the purpose of computing is process, store and data. Process and store are common "couple" in most people's understanding that are never accept formal CS introduction. And I like to visualize things when I first time meet them, In all of my CS class, I can say none of them are not trying to describe computer/ computing is base on a human brain to me. Same as I, when we thinking-is same as process, when we memorize things is consider as store, and the event or knowledge that we memorize are data. But human brain is limited,...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting I get to know more about what Computing is and why is it necessary and all. But the new and most important thing that I learned was about filter bubble. Before watching that video I had no idea about anything going like this in my surroundings. And now I also think this is a problem which is also somewhat related to ethics and this needs to be resolved. We think that we can get complete information about something we search for from google but in the reality we are not getting any information in a proper...

      In my opinion, the purpose of computing, is like collecting data, storing the data, doing the calculations and so on. For the word of computing, it is already existing in world for thousands of years. Computing benefits people in many things whether count how many money earned today or population census. In the world right now, since we can easily find a calculator or computer, computing is more like a computer things. It can be used on analysis data or even predicted data. With the help of machines, computing is becoming more complex. So there are different computing right now...

      The purpose of computing is to make life easier. Computers can make our life's easier by doing many things such as completing repetitive tasks, dangerous tasks, calculating long complex calculations, storing data, sorting data, forecasting etc. I find that even though computers have made our lives easier, the use of this technology by greedy corporations has also made us mental slaves. For Example: Many people are addicted to the use of social media platforms. These platforms have a huge impact on our lives, they can influence people into doing crazy things.I am studying computing because computers are used in every...

      It is really crucial of one to know how to code in this era, the technology is evolving. The only way we stay with pace of the world is by coping with it. Coding is one of the most important way to cope up. It helps to increase the productivity, helps to connect to the internet and also help to make a program which might represent your surroundings. Therefore, it is easy to learn.The aim of the exercise was to show that while most people can embrace their favorite smartphone instantly, far less can understand the moral values that underlie...

      The most interesting aspects of last meeting were the fact that coding is a tool for many different ways to impact the lives of others. Not only that, but the first video could be seen as hyper-positive. The up-side to coding, and jobs in coding, was the only side brought up. What's more is they used the trendiness of the workspace to try and encourage people to become coders as well. Again, like the first meeting, the ethics of data collection was talked about, and is something I would like to learn more about.
    </li><li>
      My understanding of the purpose of computing is that it is instrumental. Like a music instrument, computing takes time to learn and requires lots of practice. However, with comuputing you can get creative in terms of design and purpose similar to how with an instrument can be used to make different music and portray different purposes.
    </li><li>
      For this lesson, we have discussed What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?What is your purpose in studying computing? In my understanding, the essence of Computing is to help human to better complete data analysis and processing, which can make our study and work further improve efficiency.I learned Computing because I was interested in logic and processing. The program is just like mathematical formula, which can clearly deal with different types of computing problems.Then we think of privacy issues, according to the articles and video data, more and more people are concerned about the privacy of the Internet,...

      After looking at the first video, I encounter the term filter bubble. This is a state of intellectual isolation created by popular social media and personalized search sites. As a consequence, consumers become separated from knowledge that conflicts with their perspectives. The database algorithm maintains a record of information, such as past click actions, search history, etc., and then, according to the primary priority of the user, it selectively determines which content will be presented to the user. In this way, people are being effectively isolated in their own cultural or ideological bubbles according to what they would like to...

      The purpose of computing according to my opinion is for the advancement of humankind. It is to make humankind independent and self-reliable. Computing is now eases our day-to-day life routines and makes space travel possible. Artificial intelligence progressed due to high-end technology and computing. Thus the purpose of computing is for the betterment of the society.
    </li><li>
      Computing to me is to program or code various machines and software to invent new things and refine existing ones to make the earth a better place. it is a superpower available to everyone with which we can make lives better and sustainable. One thing that could be improved in future meetings is if only our professor could type his notes instead of writing because I am not able to understand any written notes.
    </li><li>
      What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?To solve problems or create convenience through information searching and retrieval, entertain or distract with games or social networking, and above all make money.What is your purpose in studying computing?I have a need to create and a desire to solve problems. With an ever-growing interest in the world of tech, I feel compelled to learn how to code and be my own boss. Our world continues to be shaped by technology and I no longer want to be just another user.

      The purpose of computing goes way back to the time of World War 2. Alan turning created the turning machine in order to encrypt the enigma code. He is said to be the father of computer science for creating algorithms to solve complicated problems. We are programmers who use coding as a tool to solve real-world problems and to make life easier. We as a computer scientist create machines which help us do a lot of repetitive work as well as high-level thinking as supercomputers. Supercomputers can calculate billions of arithmetic in a matter of seconds. Computing helps to achieve...

      Q: What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?A: To me the purpose of computing is like the purpose of being a Doctor or a Lawyer or really any sort of profession. Some people might be in it for the money or the social esteem but at the same time there is a great opportunity to help people. At the end of the day Computer Scientists are really creating tools for people to use, but that doesn't mean that those tools are always going to be helpful or cause more good than harm. Computing is just like anything in...

      Meeting 3 we discussed the two videos from meeting 2 and we learned that based on a teacher's claim his students improved by 30% after they used code. The first video was mostly about bringing famous and successful people from Facebook, Twitter and other platforms to talk about coding. WE learned that people who know how to code are more creative and successful and there is a lot of jobs will be available but less people are interested in the field. Second video talked about ethics and how we should make decision as a developer on things such as handling...

      The class was highly emphasized on the purpose of computing such as to build software. The initial discussion was on the code stars and moral operating system. This semester I am also taking CS 330 which is introduction to operating system and I so that the reason why the dissucsion about operating system was more realistic for me. The professor had given us important knowledge about the moral operating system and the thing which I liked most was that he was so excited and interested in knowing the views about the code stars from the stand which was a motivation...

      Computing is an action that requires, takes benefit of, or creates computing machines. It contains studying and testing mathematical operations and developing both hardware and software. It has scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological and social aspects. Major computing majors include computer engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, data science, information systems, information technology, and software engineering. The drive of the Computing is executing calculations, store information, retrieve data and process information. A computer has programmed data or computer language that tells the computer how to fulfil its purpose. The computer will only do what it is programmed to do.

      Social media is/has become such a massive impact on our lives and each year it gets stronger. To developed such a world changing platform is amazing, at the same time scary. These people who can do things as amazing have the most powerful deck of cards. Each day we grow and grow. I hope to making something world changing myself but hopefully not the path of a social media since it brings harm to some and censorship is a problem that a code cant pick up on/ my understanding of the purpose of computing is to make my life, and...

      The first video shows how we are being controlled by internet and how the personalized life which is provided to us by default is dangerous for us. Our future is at a risk of not being more explored and internet ends up controlling our future personality instead of letting us to evolve, shrinking our brain evolution to zero.The second video shows the behavioural differences in human beings and how social media research results shows us the content that they want us to see following the social norm and classes. They follow according to the classifications and shows us the contents....

      From the last meeting, we discussed the purpose of computing. We were asked about what that means to us and from my perspective, the purpose of computing is to share information with others. A network of networks to distribute and gain access to information all around the world. The idea was to further mankind in ways we never could before because before we had the internet, people had to use phones or books which caused a lengthy amount of time to further their knowledge to tackle new issues. Today everyone has access to the internet and the moment we need...

      I found the ted talk about social media platforms especially interesting. I know that social media is a very central part of many people's lives, especially with limited physical interaction during a pandemic. It is important to realize the power that the corporations behind these social media platforms have over their users, so that we can use them better. I especially liked the idea of thinking of a social media platform as a "space" for sharing, like a city of people working together to build their community in the way they want it. I do not use social media very...

      In our class discussion, the concept of "what programming means to you" was brought up and over the last few days. I have really been thinking about what it means to be a programmer and why I decided to pursue programming as a career. For me it is really about how open the computer science field is. As technology continues to advance, the need for programmers and those who understand the various subjects of development is continuing to grow. The options are unlimited for programmers and that versatility is something I have always desired. Not only that, but the ability...

      In my opinion, computing has various of purposes in the modern world nowadays. It could connect people around the world together. It could be a useful tool for many fields in the world today. For instance, it could help people calculate many things. It could be a software that people can utilize it, for example in the factory, in hospital, in restaurant, in studio and so on. Currently, computing is essential for everyone. It creates more works for many people. It also a source of entertainment for people to relax after working.For me, my purpose of studying computing, firstly, is...

      In meeting three, we discussed the videos about the code stars and moral operating system. Also, we talked about the purpose of computing and how everything worked. Professor also discussed the morals of computing and privacy. My take on the purpose of computing that it is an essential skill to learn in this modern world of technology. It gives us access to the worldwide net, where we can connect with people and learn about their ideas and experiences throughout the world. The purpose of learning to compute is to developed new software and hardware which can further help in solving...

      In meeting 3 we basically discussed about cyber crime, we learn that the fight against cyber crime has always been important as it assures the integrity and credibility of the systems. We also discussed about the purpose of computing system. I mean its basically creating something that is user friendly and serves the purpose of making things easier for the intended person. Interesting point where you question yourself as to not only how but why? Why are we doing what we are doing, everything serves a purpose and so does computing. Coming back to cyber crime, privacy and security are...

      My view on the purpose of studying computing:I believe people study computing for various reasons, most especially to be able to solve challenging and complex problems. There are also people who study computing because they would like to make a positive difference in the world by being creative.I decided to study computing because I would love to learn new skills. I believe the use of technology is part of our future and by studying a course like computer science it can help me make a great impact in the world.

      Computing for me is a system built to make our everyday tasks a little bit easier. Every day, we find ways to make our daily tasks easier and more comfortable to do; computing is just one of the most efficient methods we have created. From our workplaces to our transportation and back at our different homes, there are computers there making things easier for us and it keeps getting better as time goes on.My primary purpose in studying computer science is to solve problems. There are always problems around, in scientific, business, and social contexts. it is our responsibility as...

      For me, coding is a tool used for creating art. Much like an artist using paint and brushes on a canvas. At this point in my experience with computer science and coding, I wouldn't say that I've encountered a situation where I found myself creating something that would require a moral framework. Of course I will encounter this in the future when my work is able to reach and affect more people. I'm looking forward to learning more about what I can do as a programmer to think about the influence my creation has on other people. While thinking about...

      I liked the "Code Stars" video a lot. I think it delivered an important message and I agree with the idea that coding should be a basic skill for people &amp; not something restricted for people in that particular field. As technology advances everything is being automated through the use of computers &amp; obviously when there is a piece of hardware there has to be a software which is operating on that hardware - coding becomes more and more important as we advance IMO. Ergo, knowing how to code would prove to be useful for everyone this way or that.As...

      Nowadays, people cannot live without computers in every aspect of their lives, so computers' future is auspicious. There are five Purposes of computing.(1) people need computing for recreational activities, such as watching movies, listening to music, playing various games, communicating and making friends, etc. And, There is no doubt that computing brings people a high experience in entertainment. For example, more and more realistic games bring real experience to people.(2) People often use computing for numerical calculation, so computers are widely used in scientific research, engineering technology, and other aspects. In general, most people have used computers to do accounts.(3)...

      My understanding of the purpose of computing is slim when overlooking the vast utilization of modern technology. Generally speaking, my understanding is that the purpose of computing is either to simplify manual processes or to create something new. For example, it simplifies things such as building and maintaining a database, communicating with others locally and globally, and running through a great number of processes in a short amount of time.I'd say that if I needed to solve one hundred math equations, it would be easier for me to build a program to solve them for me. I believe that concept...

      In my opinion computing, it is a goal-oriented activity which helps us to think in a different way, it led to the advancement of humanity.Computing is used in each and every fields nowadays.In the class, we discussed the two videos which were 'Code Star' and 'A Model Operating System'.The first videos motivated about learning the code and the second suggests that we need a model operating system which knows the difference between right and wrong.

      Meeting 3 was all about filter bubbles and their affect on common people. The internet is providing us the information that it thinks we want to see. It has started working same as Facebook or other social sites like when we search for any thing it keeps us showing the same kind of results for the next time. it has created a sense of isolation for the searchers or internet surfers. the difficult thing for me to understand was the reason behind the concept of filter bubbles.
    </li><li>
      The video 1 gives you an idea about programming. Its basically you teaching the computer to do things for you. Its a process of breaking down the problems. Its a way to express your creativity. One thing specifically draw my attention was "You don't have to be genius to learn how to code, you just have to be determined." Whereas video 2 highlights how to utilize this power ethically once we have it. How to use the data we collect constructively and by maintaining the privacy.
    </li><li>
      Computing for me can be said to be an introduction to a brand new dimension. We have been using the latest technology for years now without even knowing what reasons are they created for and how are they created. Keeping the learning portion on the side, the engagement to the computing lets us deal with the creator side of the tech we have been using. Of course the factor of security, privacy, improved experience, money, and many other things matter. But the greatest factor for today's generation is socializing.

      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting-&gt; Purpose of Computing and Moral ethics to followthe concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand-&gt; What should be the ethics of code in Computing Businesswhat you would like to know more about-&gt; Security against the purpose of computingsomething you encountered that is related to the past meeting-&gt; What Purpose of Computing really stands for
    </li><li>
      We discussed the purpose of computing and discussed how computing can be used almost everywhere and it has endless possibilities. Also, we discussed how we should use computing for good causes and to benefit people in the society. Then we lead to talk about a moral operating system which will not be selfish like some of the applications and operating systems which collect way more than the data that is needed without the user being fully aware of it.

      In this lecture we just discussed about the two videos from prior meeting. In the first video 'Code stars' , we get to know that coding is not all difficult, its a fun and we can make a lot of money in this field. From the second video we learned privacy is important although with this superpower of computing we can get access to everything but there should be limit. And my answer for the understanding of computing is that computing can make our work more easy and we can introduce many new technologies with its help.
