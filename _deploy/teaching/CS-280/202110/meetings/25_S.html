    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Sure okay thanks thanks Darrell and you know we're glad to be here and have the opportunity to. come and talk to the students, a little bit about you know what sounds sounds tells up to you, and you know share some some of what we believe is some really relevant content. Within the IP space, right now, so we're hoping the class gets some some positive takeaways from from today's discussion, so my job here is more to kick things off. For and introduce our presenter rick but my name is Trevor McDonald I just for a bit of background here, I began my career in in about the MID 90s. After graduating from the course you're all taking today graduate from the you have our with a computer science degree i've been in it for about 27 years working in you know progressively senior it positions. You know, currently on soft skills director of it operations, so what my job is today is, I have a team of about 100 980. It professionals everything from service desk to architecture to infrastructure and cloud services. And my team is really SAS tools external customer facing it department, where we're kind of an antenna it group that focuses on. On our external customers and when we provide services like data Center services or or Colocation manage it and cloud services and as well, my team supports. All SAS tools business customers from a tier one perspective i'll put a plug in that you know if ever, the classes interested in touring a a. Best best of class data Center we have a few data Center facilities within Regina than happy to you know take take the class through if if that's something that you'd like to take me up on down the road i'll just throw that out. I joined the eclipses catchment order director so here's here's the kind of the kips ty. I joined the board in 2015 and since i've been a fairly active members activists work allows me to be anywhere anyway and. i've held positions, such as treasurer Vice President, President and currently the past President, and then I also recently began volunteering at the kips national board level level a sit on the. The executive as a director of finance and i've probably held my ISP designation since. 2005 so i'll talk a little bit more about this, but I appreciate the opportunity to talk to the class today. Again i'm going to just talk for a minute and then passed off to rick and then we will cover as many questions as we have time for. At the end, and if we run out of time we'll we'll do what we can to give us your give you our contact information, so we can. We can follow up, but just you know, in general, i've i've been in it for a long time it's an exciting time to be in it, and I think they've said that every time i've talked to two groups and aspiring it professionals, because it always is it's just that kind of an industry that. always seems to be changing and evolving, you know any position i've had you know it's it's not long before. You know you've been there, done that, and you're off to the next, technology, the system changes. Or the processes and the business changes and it impacts you all the time, so one thing you're going to learn in your career is. You got to get used to to change right now you're investing the time to learn how to learn, and you know, once you hit the. The workforce you're gonna that's going to be probably one of the biggest skills that you'll take away from from university that's what I phone anyway because you're just. Learning ongoing in a go forward basis so lots going on within technology you don't see an emerging fields demands in cyber security artificial intelligence information of. Things is. all over the place iot we're seeing these changes, you know not not only the way that we live, but you know, the way that we work and to interact with with businesses so before I introduce our. speaker here, I just want to share just a few points on. What I think i've been in it for quite a while and i've been recruiting for for quite a while, so the top three things that I think. You know, you need to be mindful of when you're looking for that first job is. The first thing is the quality quality your resume so a recruiter or a manager, you know, probably spends I don't know. 10 seconds 20 seconds scanning through resumes so make sure that your resume is is customized you know specific to the job you're applying for I reviewed, on the other day that it was for. And it architecture position and it talked about marketing, you know someone was applying for marketing and also right away that one goes in the garbage may make sure you spend some time. Make it specific you know call out, although you know the applicable skills and education that you know, make sure that it's easy to see and make sure it's clean Document No typos. That kind of a thing, because that that's deliverable that resume is the first piece of work that your future employer gets to see so it's it's a big judge of quality of work that you do and it's going to mean a lot The second thing is, you want to stand out. So you're already doing that because you're part of a kips accredited program and i'll talk about that a little bit more. other ways to send stand out or you know Microsoft certifications like I talked about the demands and cyber security Ai Internet of Things it's. microsoft's in your ability to learn in an ongoing way, and you know it shows engagement and then it shows the you've got a good work ethic that kind of thing so search don't hurt and then of course experience is very important. And I know it's a chicken and egg thing, because how can you get a job without experience but look for opportunities to volunteer there's lots of lots of opportunities out there, even if not for profits like. kips organization, for example, and then number three is don't be too picky with without first job and and The reason I say, that is, you know i've talked to students even recently where you know this, the student wants to be a db or they want to be a whatever Linux. admin or specific jobs, like that, and what i've told them is. Okay that's great but here's what's going to happen you're going to you're going to make your way through. college and university and you're probably going to take the first job that you get and. If you might end up where you think you're going to be and coding in the language you you think you're going to doing the job you think you're going to do, but chances are you won't be. And you know every business is different every it deployment is is different and again, you need to just take that. knowledge of how to learn and apply it to an IT position and linear careers just going to go in numerous different ways, possibly based on. You know the the business you're working with once you find you're interested in, you know you can end up being what multiple things from recorder to. configuring software as a service to the cloud service provider, you can be you know anything from from that to an IT project manager that sits. Really, one of the most exciting things about it is there are just so many different opportunities and i'll tell you the other thing is today. The job you're going to be doing in 510 years probably doesn't even exist that's just the way that. Things things are moving today in the way that Business and Technology is is driving our field so. i'll talk about the kids accreditation and so with with SAS Tom alrighty job descriptions we actually prefer graduates from accredited programs. And the main reason is that kips members have an obligation to follow the kids code of ethics or we like Colin at. The kids level we're talking to starting to talk about it for good and there's four imperatives within the code of ethics, the first is as a. kips Member we protect the public interest and privacy of information, so any work that we carry out or study, with the primary regard to public interest. We make sure, in accordance with regulatory requirements and legislation so that's the number one thing number two is we avoid conflicts of interest, so we. Act in the welfare of others and not you know for our own game, the third imperative is that we take professional responsibility. So we serve our employers or clients competently material with their work with diligence, we maintain in advance their knowledge and exercise uncompromised professional judgment so we're always acting as the professionals. And the fourth thing is, we contribute to the it profession, so we were respect to rates and the aspirations of the profession and our colleagues. And it's our job to uphold the integrity, dignity in the image of the profession and i'm actually reading this this part right now, because this great offer kips website, but. That is, you know the big thing being a a kips member is you work towards your ISP or your professional designation and it means that you are. A practicing professional that adheres to our code of conduct and and the ethics and that's something that an employer can trust in and it makes you stand out. As an it as as a future employer so i'll start leading into rick's presentations here so he's going to share a recent example of the shifting cyber security landscape and I think the impact it's going to have on all of us as we go through the presentation we're gonna. you're going to be thinking, this is a you know it's another hack and there's all kinds of things going on in the world did this is some serious serious stuff and. we're going to talk about a hack that. And maybe these are my words, but that is believed to be an act of cyber warfare, so you know, the definition of cyber warfare is. The use of computer technology to disrupt the activities of a State organization, especially the deliberate attacking of information systems for strategic or military purposes. This is an example as an example in the US is all over over this where call it cyber espionage or cyber warfare it's one government going after you know the assets of. of another, and this situation is going to have huge impacts that ripple all the way to cloud providers, like myself, because it's going to impact, you know it, that the whole it. All call it supply chain, and if you want to play in the IT game there there's going to be requirements well beyond what are in place today to be an active member at a. At a global level, so rick is going to talk to us about the details of the. incident and I want to point out that the perpetrators here clearly did not follow anything close to the kips code of conduct or you know practice it forget Donald come clear to here. So i'll introduce rick and again we'll hopefully have some time for questions at the end so rick Lee is a digital forensics consulting manager with SAS tell. ripley as a forensics technology investigator who started his digital forensics training 25 years ago at the katie Police College. While a member of the Royal Canadian mounted police rick's career with the rcmp spent 25 years, including six years in commercial crime. And two years starting up the vagina integrated technology crime unit. rick as well recognized within the digital forensics community that has been recognized as an expert witness and provincial court. Court a queen's bench and an arbitration hearings in saskatchewan rick continued his career in digital forensics after retiring from the rcmp for 14 years as a security manager at SAS tell. And then in 2015 brick started up the SAS trial digital forensics group which he leads up at this time, recalled several coveted industry certifications such as nc which he was the first in Canada to achieve. g CSF CFA and CSP rick is a sought after speaker, who has presented at conferences in North America, Europe and China, and so without further delay i'd like to turn it over to rick just shed some light on a very. Recent cyber security incident that has very serious short and long term impacts on it in North America and around the globe so over you rick.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, can you see my screen. Sure perfect and obviously you didn't hear me so that's good. Thanks everyone good morning we're gonna be talking about the solar winds or Ryan breach which was. A supply chain attack. As opposed to someone trying to break into your network through other means.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;question is.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Here we go so today we're going to talk about who are the suspects we'll talk about the actual malware that was put onto the systems, why they pick solar winds. we're gonna talk quickly about the attack lifecycle and how it relates to this particular attack and the sophistication of the attack. This was a very well planned thought out attack and we'll get into more details on that with the victims, our reaction to the attack the consequences and some things you can do to remediate the attack, should you be a victim of it. And there's memes about everything, but basically this created all kinds of fires that had to be put out all over the world. So the suspects, the. US federal government and many of the cybersecurity experts out there, believe that this was associated to Russia, and in particular the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service they go by many names depending on which. Businesses looking at it anywhere from a PT 29 which stands for advanced persistent threat and this case after 29 they're, also known as cozy bear dukes unc. dark HALO and the most current one is no Belgium. And this was actually so far has been referred to as an espionage versus a cyber attack. And there is a significance there because of its espionage that's considered to be normal practice around the world, between governments. The US does it all the time, Canada does it every nation that has any cyber capabilities, is doing this type of activity, a cyber attack is where somebody actually tries to, for example in the Ukraine and number of years ago they took down the power grid. So that would be a cyber attack where they're actually using cyber to attack the infrastructure of a country, its destructive disruptive and that type of thing. So in this particular case, it was considered espionage, because no stolen data had little monetary value, but it was significant value to governments. Know observe targeting a financial data customer data or personally identifiable information and know uncover disruptive or destructive activity. And with all advanced persistent threat type activity, the goals included stealth and persistence, they want to get into your network and they want to stay in there for a long time and they don't want you to know about them. It was well resourced, it was a long running campaign as we'll get into constantly dedicated infrastructure to run this campaign. and large number of personnel possibly spread over multiple teams, some of the experts out there figure there could have been 1000 people working on this particular attack. So why solar winds well one it contains all of your it's a network monitoring tool and it contains all of your admin passwords. If they get into if they get control of the Ryan system they have control over everything that you that your systems touch. Put simply, the you have a serious control over pretty much everything you own they can log in take data manipulate data and in the most extreme burn your network down using other malware like a wiper ransomware to do it so there's a. This was a severe attack. comments this came out on December 12 is when it was actually advertised by fire I that this attack was happening. and on December 17 these are comments from the Wall Street Journal. The attack Linda extraordinarily stealthy Tradecraft using cyber tools, never before seen in a previous attack. The strategy that zeroed in on a weak link in the software supply chain that all US businesses and government institutions rely on. And approach security experts have long fear, but one that has never been used on us targets in such a conservative way. The hackers use the digital equivalent of a spice this is to blend in with the flood of data flowing through government and corporate networks and remain undetected. They snatched up years old, but abandoned Internet domains and repurpose them for hacking, and they named their software to mimic legitimate corporate tools. Most devastatingly a sneaker malicious code into the legitimate software of a trusted software maker an Austin Texas based company called solar winds and a software called a Ryan. Leaders some comments made about the attack Kevin man via, who is the CEO of fire I he initially started up mandy and i've known Kevin since 2000. And mandy got bought out by fire I and he subsequently has become the CEO of IRI we are witnessing an attack by nation with top tier offensive capabilities. Fred Smith who's the President of Microsoft so as our teams act as first responders to these attacks these ongoing investigations revealing attack that is remarkable for its scope sophistication and impact. Thomas posture from the US Homeland Security, the magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate the Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months. And Bruce schneier who is well known, computer security consultant, we have a serious problem we don't know what networks, they are in how deep they are what access, they have what tools they left so. This is. Quite the breach that we're looking at here. So it was first discovered by fire I the way it was discovered is the ritual discovered after the hackers enrolled into the face into fire is multi factor authentication system. Which fire I employees used remotely sign into the company's vpn. generates a unique code on the user's phone that they enter, along with their username and password each time they access their account so that even if someone has your username and password they can't get in without the mobile phone. And the code. After the hackers registered their device with the fire network to obtain the end codes that would normally go only to that employees device. Fire a security system it shouldn't an alert to the employee into the company security team saying that an unknown device head registered with the company's multi factor authentication. They had to provide credentials to authenticate. In order to authenticate to the fire vpn it was the process, the attacker followed to enroll in the MFA solution, which is what generated the alert for this point the attacker already had the employees username and password. The employee his credentials are compromised old fire I security teams device didn't belong to him and in the course of investigating they discovered the solar winds malicious software. So some of the actual malware that were that was on the different systems. stellar particle is a nice crowd strike gave to the developers of sunspot instance, but is now we're used to insert the sun first backdoor into software builds of the solar winds or Ryan it management product. It monitors running processes for those involved in compilation of the Ryan product and replaces one of the source files to include the sunburst backdoor code. Several safeguards were added to sense but to avoid the Ryan builds from failing potentially alerting developers to the adversaries presence. sunburst is the file name is the solar winds are Ryan core business layer dot dll. it's a digitally signed component of the Ryan software framework that contains a backdoor that communicates via http to third party servers. Were the reasons they use http P E s and later there's one that uses DNS is because those are protocols that you have to allow run on in your environment if you want to access the Internet. And fact that was digitally sign means it's going to be less likely to be discovered as being malware. So after initial Dermot period about the two weeks that retrieved and execute commands called jobs that include the ability to transfer files execute files profile a system. reboot the machine and disable system services, so it sits dormant for two weeks, again, so that people can don't realize that it's actually in the environment, yet so they're not as aware of it. sends a beacon to a server controlled by the hackers including information about the effect of network. To signal infected system is open for them to surreptitiously enter hackers would then use that information to run with it, which targets they wanted to burrow into further and again the dll was actually signed by legitimate solar winds certificate. teardrop is the second stage malware selectively deployed against targets based on until mastering initial reconnaissance, so if it was a. If it was the US Government Department of Justice that's something they want to break into they're going to drop teardrop if it was a mom and pop store that happened to have a Ryan on it. there's no interest to them so they wouldn't be dropping the teardrops software in their. teardrop is a memory only dropper that runs as a service spawns a thread and reads from the file gracious underscore truth dot jpg which likely has a fake jpg header so that it wouldn't be determined, if it was. Had a document header with the jpeg extension, there are programs out there, that would find that and say there's something wrong with this particular program, especially our forensic software. teardrop does not have code overlap with any previously seen malware and lead us was used to execute a customized cobalt strike beacon. cobalt strike is a commercial full feature penetration testing tool which builds sofas adversaries simulation software. But it is also being used now by a lot of attackers We recently had a ransomware attack where they got into the network initially through a phishing attack crop the cobalt strike and their wandered around the network for a couple of weeks before the drop them ransomware down. The beacon that it creates is cobalt payload the model advance attackers the uses the beacon to regress and network over http http s or DNS. And we also limit which hosts ingress network by controlling peer to peer beacons over windows name pipes so that's something it will see you dropped here in a bit. raindrop semantic the antivirus software, so the malware was used only during the very last stages of an intrusion deployed only on the networks and very few selected targets. You say that in some cases, the hackers chose to deploy the raindrop malware strain instead of the more widely used teardrop. raindrop mysteriously appeared on systems where sunburst was also found with no direct evidence that sunburst that triggered it's installations. And despite being different strains semantics of the two vectors had similar functionality, which accompanied described as being a loader for the cobalt strike beacon wish you'd critters later used to escalate and broaden their access inside a hack it network. Then we have supernova supernovas actually believed to be a second threat actor. And the authentication bypass vulnerability and solar winds are writing software may have been leveraged by adversaries as a zero day to deploy the supernova malware. The solar winds or Ryan API that's used to interface with others Ryan system, monitoring and management products suffers from a security flaw that could allow remote attacker to execute an authenticated API commands, resulting in a compromise of the solar winds instance. It was described by Microsoft and Palo Alto networks as a.net web shell. it's novel and potent due to its in memory execution sophistication and its parameters and execution of flexibility by implementing a full programmatic API to the.net runtime. But, unlike the sunburst dll it was not signed by legitimate solar, wind certificate which makes us believe that it was actually a second threat actor, as everything else that the apta 29 used was actually signed by the solar, wind certificate. son shuttle. So remember this happened, they discovered it actually on December 8 march 4 management found son shuttle, which was the second stage backdoor. Use the file name lexicon etc, and it communicates with a hard coded commanding control server or https and the Web server was re web COM it uses cookie headers to pass the values of the command and control Center manager control, sir. Central would function as a second stage backdoor for conducting network harrison's along others send verse related tools. Microsoft phone more software which they reported on march forth as well, gold Max the command and control backdoor for hiding malicious activity and evading detection. It also has a decoding network traffic generator for concealing malicious network traffic with seemingly benign traffic again just so that it. fits in and isn't easily observable so I bought used for maintaining persistence and downloading additional malware payloads. and gold Finder believed to be used as a custom http tracer tool for detecting servers and redirect is like network security devices between the infected devices and the command and control server. So they dropped multiple pieces of malware which up until this time i'd never been seen before. So the attack lifecycle when we're talking and advanced attack starts off reconnaissance, then we have the initial intrusions and network often phishing email or something like that or in this particular case, it was a backdoor and a supply chain attack. establish a backdoor into the network to obtain user credentials and the don't want to be a regular user they want to escalate up to admin or route install various utilities. Again, they do their privilege escalation lateral movement around the network, they take the data out and they maintain persistence, so in relation to this particular attack. On the reconnaissance sighs side and the process recognizance hackers tend to be like detectives the gathering information about an organization. Hope usually they're using open source intelligence, they might go to the company's website download information on. Who the C suite is the CEO CFO that type of thing who their admin assistants are because let's face it, the admin assistant does most of the work. Certainly, the communication part of it so they're looking for that type of information if they're doing a phishing attack they know who to go after. Solar winds customers are located on the solar winds webpage so you go to their website you'll see all the different people that are customers of solar winds. And that would be a good a good target to go after the solar winds updates or password was solar winds 123 not a particularly good password. and installation of sunspot malware to infect solar winds Ryan updates so that's the reconnaissance part for the companies that later got attacked they came in through solar winds and then they have their access to the new network. Initial compromised the attacker she is compromised office 365 credentials to access solar winds network once inside the planet malicious code into an upcoming patch what's Ryan software which was downloaded 18,000 times triggering a secondary payload. sunspot is stellar particles malware used to insert the sun burst backdoor into software builds of the solar winds around it management product. And Cecil, which is the cyber security and infrastructure Security Agency in the United States, their incident response investigations. have identified that initial access in some cases was obtained by password guessing passwords praying and inappropriately secured administrative credentials accessible by external remote access services. passwords as password spray attack. The militia sector attempts, a single commonly use password such as password one or summer 2017 or Whatever the case may be, against many accounts before moving on to attempt to second passwords so they have. A list of all the accounts and they run one password against all of them, then they run another common password against all of them using a dictionary type attack. Next we establish a little. Trojan it solar winds Ryan update downloaded and installed and the sunburst backdoor execute 1214 days after the Ryan update installed it checks. don't work domain, it is in it disables any security software collects system information determines if it's a network of interest. context the command and control server opens a back door, and if they decide to proceed with further going in deeper into that particular network it downloads the cheer drop back door and extracts and installs cobalt strike. escalating privileges teardrop backdoor launches who am I to load malicious do malicious dll attempts to steal credentials queries active directory and attempts to escalate privileges it uses many cats to obtain the credentials, maybe cats is a memory resident. program that will capture passwords as their typed in. After spend only limited time on the initial endpoint so they get on and get off and they use the golden sal attack which allows the user to forge SMS tokens and bypasses the Multi factor authentication and password requirements. So just one more information on the snl attack. The attacker can gain access to any application that supports xml. which includes things like as your. aws V sphere, etc, so a lot of cloud.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;capabilities.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;With any privileges they desire and be any user on the targeted application. The golden sal name is similar to the golden ticket, which was an old attack. And this is attacking attacking pro every aspect of the sound sal response object in addition golden SMS have the following advantages they can be generated from practically anywhere. You don't need to be part of a domain federation of any other environment you're dealing with they are effective, even with two factor authentication is enabled. Talking signing private key is not renewed automatically and changing a user's password won't affect the generated sal so the interesting thing is, in this particular case, this was the first time we've actually seen one used in the wild. and move laterally in this case the actor spent only limited time on the initial endpoint then they want to move to other systems in the environment. They use the duo secret key which for electricity, who is another. incident Response Group and their investigation Dermot the attacker access to do integration secret key for the outlook web access server. This key then allow the attacker to derive a pre computed value to be said in the dual said cookie. After successful password authentication the server evaluated the dual said cookie and determined it to be valid this the allow this then allow the attacker with knowledge of a user account password to then completely bypass the Multi factor authentication. And this case, the goal was to actually get to the cloud based resources was one of the goals of this particular attack. maintain presence, they used multiple they created multiple points of access to the network service accounts application accounts. And one of the reasons they use service accounts is because, as a digital forensic investigator, when we look at a system one of things we're looking at is the users so we'll take a look at the users will take a look inside there. Their profile will be able to see what programs they run all kinds of things like that. There is no profile for the service accounts or. Or the application accounts, so we lose that capability of getting that information. You did extensive work defeating the Multi factor authentication. The store stole the dual secret key and the edit actor controlled phones to multi multi factor authentication. Unfortunately. They got caught that way. Then you're going to complete the mission preached email Council trust the usda Federal Government they had access to over 3000 US Department of Justice email accounts. It access to victims cloud assets. from fire it they actually stole the red team tools that they use for doing penetration testing on their on their customers. And the full intention of the hackers this time are still not known but they could include things like attacks on hard targets, like the CIA and NSA using blackmail to recruit spies. Former Homeland Security Advisor Thomas boss, or one that it could take years to think the attackers from the US networks living in able to continue to monitor destroy tamper with data in the meantime can take a long time to get the people out of these environments. So on the left side the some of the post breach activities we see the solar winds installation attempts to remote the up tends to remote update you didn't get the malicious patch going down it begins execution it then use the domain generation algorithm and contacts, the DNS servers. It goes to a malicious DNS server which then decode the embedded machine domain name and it says to itself okay Is this something we want to go deeper into. If it doesn't decide to just keep that running and has the ability to go back to it later if it is it the plugin starts a malicious command and control and execute commands. The attacker drops, the second stage malware and then lateral movement and further exploitation occurs, but if it wasn't something that they wanted to go after it actually. was a plugin kill switch which was an activated and got rid of all the evidence on the compromise system. The next one on the right is unc. Which is what fire I named the group because they weren't prepared to say at this particular time that it was. attributable to Russia solely gave it the unclassified number and started off with the teardrop and beacon malware being used the attacker host names match the victim environment. The IP addresses were located in the victims country which again makes it less likely to be discovered, you might have firewall rules, for example, that would not allow a company to go to China or Russia, Iran, North Korea, which are the high. volume threat actors, these days, but if it's in your own country it's not as likely to get blocked. Temporary file replacement and temporary task modification would they would actually do is if there'd be a file say services, etc. They would delete that put in their file, which they wanted to run which had the same name after it had run and done what it needed to do they would delete that one and replace it with the original file. And they did the same thing with tasks. Then lateral movement using different credentials so whatever credentials, they used to get into the environment they use different credentials, while moving around environment again just making it that much more difficult. For investigators to find. The end goal was getting into the cloud, so you had to supply chain compromise than the initial access command and control was your first command and control server. Then they had hands on keyboard attack on the premises from your second command and control server and then there's actually even a third cobalt strike command and control and we have the hands on keyboard attacking the cloud itself. This is a timeline of the events so September 4 of 2020 we have the initial. 2019 we had the initial attack vector going into solar winds. They started injecting test code they tested what their code was do whether or not it was going to get discovered before they actually put in the actual code, they were going to use November 4 they stopped us in injecting the test code February 20 the solar gate is compiled and deployed. and enlarge it starts getting X or. downloaded and updating. The solar winds product on on premises. So, in May, we had the actual start of the hands on keyboard attacks. In June, they actually removed the malware from the solar winds build environment. and on December 12 the supply chain attack was actually disclosed to the public. And again, the bottom one is just what we saw earlier, the backdoor connects to initials demanded controls, since gather info. cobalt strike is downloaded from a second command and control and then the remote control via cobalts Greg beacon, and then we have the attack and keyboard hands on keyboard attack on the premises so unlike some malware there's actually somebody at a keyboard that's. doing their activities. So from the attack sophistication like it was mentioned many times so from the development team perspective. The deployed anti analysis measures, so it didn't execute for 12 to 14 days it defies forensic an antivirus tools that might threaten it and disable them, it says the host names on their command and control infrastructure to match a legitimate hostname found within the victims environment. Use specific infrastructure for each victim, reducing the usefulness of network based ios ios ios ease are indicators of compromise. Which are things as a incident response team you're looking for the things that will help you identify other systems in your environment that that have been compromised and these things get shared so. If you were to share it with another company they wouldn't be able to they wouldn't stand out like they would in the First Company. primarily used only IP addresses originating from the same country as a victim leveraging virtual private servers. And the attackers hosted their command and control servers on commercial cloud services such as Amazon Microsoft godaddy and others again keeping it within the country that is being attacked. From the operational side they had different credentials are used for remote access and lateral movement. replaced the legitimate utility with there's executed their payload than restored the legitimate original file and did the same thing was scheduled tasks. living off the land is where you're using tools that are already on the system, so a lot of SIS admins, for example, will have the PSA tool suite as part of. Their computer built and in there is a program called PS exec and if they can get access to that they can use that to run commands and others are on other systems so they're looking for tools that they can use as opposed to downloading their own which might get discovered. They were totally routinely removed their tools, including back doors once legitimate road remote access was achieved. This a disabled event login using audible before hands on keyboard activity and then enabled it back again once it was completed so while they were actually on the system doing activity, they would. disable the logging event login and then, when they were finished, they would re enable it. Creating special firewall rules to minimize outgoing packets for certain protocols before running noisy network enumeration activities that were later removed after the network survey. executing lateral movement activities only after disabling security services on targeted hosts and allegedly using time stopping to change artifacts timestamps and leveraging wiping procedures and to prevent discovery malicious dll implants so time stopping is where. Where are the things as a forensics investigator doing incident response is, if you find a piece of malware you want to see everything that happened around that time. Or, if you have a you know when the breach happened you look for all the activity that happened the hours or days before that, and then what happened after that. Time stopping takes the MAC time, which are the modified access and created times and they'll change the time from what they actually are and they'll usually backdated to when the system was built originally so that it looks like it's just one of the original builds from Microsoft. And again just makes it more difficult to determine what happened in when it happened. So some of the solar winds customers include all branches of the US military pentagon's State Department NSA Department of Justice Homeland Security. office of the President of the United States 425 of the US fortune 500 top 10 us telecom companies top five accounting firms and fire I Microsoft Intel and video vmware and belk belkin so they're going after computer companies as well. 300,000 customers use. Solar winds products 33,000 of them user Ryan. 18,000 potential victims downloaded the compromised update of the victims 80% are located in the US well the others are in seven other countries, Canada, Mexico United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain Israel in the United Arab Emirates. ones that are known to have been compromised and gone to the second stage, including the Department of Homeland Security Department of State Treasury commerce. federal regulatory Commission Kent State University California Department of State hospitals Pentagon us postal service. State and local governments NATO fire I Microsoft Cisco Intel nvidia delight vmware belt and international Inc equifax Cox communications, so they had access to a lot of data, a lot of really valuable data to another country. This is just microsoft's look at it, information technology 44% government 18% think tank NGOs 18% government contractors, which were primarily supporting Defense and national security or nine and then other 11%. potential victims, in addition to the critical infrastructure companies is also infected three firms or provide services for such companies. The service companies are known as original equipment manufacturers are oem compromising one oem depending on where you compromise them could lead to access to thousands of organizations. To have the oem compromised have access to hundreds of industrial control systems networks around the world, so all the infrastructure power oil, gas, water, all things like that. The political response trump downplayed the hack and with no evidence to support it just that maybe China rather than Russia might be responsible. At the time, he was President elect Joe Biden said that a good Defense isn't enough, we need to disrupt into our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber attacks in the first place. I will not stand idly by in the face of cyber assaults on our nation, he said he has instructed as a transition team to study the breach and will make cybersecurity a priority at every level of government and will identify and penalize the attackers. This is when he was looking at it as a cyber attack, as opposed to espionage, so there are fewer things that you can do. When it's an espionage. instance, as opposed to an actual attack on infrastructure. On February 23 of this year, the Senate intelligence committee her testimony from Kevin man dia the CEO of fire I sued a car Rama Krishna CEO of solar winds he actually became the CEO after the breach brad Smith President Microsoft and George Chris President CEO of crowd strike. One of the things that supposedly coming hasn't been enacted yet is an executive order requiring notification of breaches within 72 hours of discovery. To a government entity which hasn't been decided yet, as well as other security requirements, this would override any non disclosure agreements, one of the things that often comes up when it comes to advising or doing notification of a breach is that. there's a nondisclosure agreement in place and I can't tell you about it, and the reason I wanted to get past, that is, you can't fix what you don't know about. So some of the reported data leak from solar winds the solar leaks website offer source code allegedly obtained from Microsoft Cisco solar winds and fire. The information, taken from Microsoft is offered for $600,000 and contains a 2.6 gigabyte file and third claims includes personal source code for windows and various Microsoft repositories. Cisco. they're looking for a half million dollars includes 1.7 gigabytes worth of product source code and the dump of the networking giants internal bug tracker the seller claims. For $250,000 seller claims to offer 612 megabytes worth of source code for solar winds products and for fire I you can get their. tool red team tools for 50,000 and, if you want it all apparently it's a million dollars. and They claim to sell have access to the systems of targeted companies, and this is only the first batch of data that's going to be released, they also claim they can provide proof that their offer is legitimate. So, from a timeline perspective. September 4 we've got them getting into the into solar winds. February 20 place when a. Customer starts or customer service seeing the compromise software. It starts contacting the command and control servers in April June, they removed the malware from the solar winds or Ryan update. On December 7 remember December 8 is when that was first discovered by fire I the CEO Kevin Thompson retires. Also in that date to private equity firms with ties to solar winds board sold 280 million dollars of stock and solar winds and the price fill 22% after the breach was revealed on the Eighth, we have the breach being revealed by fire I on the 13th solar winds acknowledges it's breach. On the 14th the FBI season, the office of the director of national intelligence intelligence from the cyber united coordination group to coordinate their efforts. December 17 we see that additional piece of supernova which we believe is a second threat actor and on the fifth the FBI CIA. NSA officially blamed Russia for the silver solar, wind cyber attack, and this is the investigation continues they'll be looking into this for the next year, trying to figure out everything that's happened. But there are tools and activity that are being used to mediate the threat solar flare Open Source tool to generate a full list of the credentials in an orion database. kill switch fire I Microsoft and go Daddy created a kill switch for the sunburst backdoor when deployed uncompromised networks causes the malware to terminate itself. Fire I released a tool called a zero ad investigator, which looks for techniques used by the attacker inside their networks. And Microsoft has taken control of the domain name that hackers used to communicate with a compromise systems. This technique noticing calling as long Microsoft and its partners to build a list of all infected infected victims, which your organization is planning to use to notify all the fact that companies and government agencies, so they do know because they have to report in. To this domain, they know all the people that have been affected by this, and they haven't going out and notifying people. they've notified, for example, the CSC and Canada, which is like the NSA in the States and they have gone out and contact companies in Canada that were affected by this. recommended actions isolated affected solar, wind service from the network at a minimum consider changing the passwords for accounts that have access to solar, wind servers infrastructure lot the egress traffic or the traffic, leaving the solar, wind servers. If it's used a manager networking infrastructure consider conducting review of the network device configurations for unexpected on authorized modifications rebuild all impacted solar, wind servers and install solar winds or Ryan version 2020 dot to dot one hf to. And CSS data treat all who's smarter by solar winds or Ryan monitoring software as compromised by threat actors and as soon for the persistent mechanisms have been deployed. So there's gonna be a lot of people are gonna be rebuilding their entire environments. One of the things even as a digital forensic investigator and we'll find soft we find a lot of malware that the end of virus products aren't going to find but there's no way you can guarantee you found everything, so our advice is always to wipe rebuild and start over. microsoft's recommended actions if preached. it's aqua simulating simultaneously sophisticated ordinary Microsoft said the actor demonstrated sophistication and the breadth of tactics used to penetrate expand across and persist in effect that. Infrastructure, but many of the tactics techniques and procedures were individually ordinary ttp tactics techniques and procedures are what the different companies as a response companies security companies use to identify. Who an attacker is because they will typically always follow the same techniques tactics techniques and procedures to protect against such attacks in the future, the company recommends that organizations, adopt a zero trust mentality. and using the enable multi factor authentication with solar solar against the attackers took advantage of fraud role assignments permissions have exceeded rule of requirements and, in some cases, abandoned accounts and applications which should have had no permissions at all. In summary. cyber attack and data breach reported to be among the worst cyber espionage instance ever suffered by the US due to the sensitivity and high profile of the targets in the long duration eight to nine months. in which the hackers had access within days of his discovery at least 200 organizations around the world have been reported to be affected by the attack and some of these may have also suffered data breaches. Solar winds is also facing a class action lawsuit and one of the interesting things I said that they sold $280 million worth of stock the Canada pension plan also bought about that much at that time. So that stock went down by 22% sure if it's come back up yet or not, and this was followed shortly thereafter by the Microsoft exchange server breaches which is. People have on premise Microsoft exchange servers were looking after their email were there was for vulnerabilities zero Dave all but vulnerabilities that were put out in the wild. And there were numerous groups that were going after them and typically would leave a web Shell on the server after compromising it giving them full access to everything in the environment, so the fun just continues to happen. Just like any questions I think we've got about 10 minutes before the class.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;i'm just wondering how they didn't. see any of these suspicious act.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;How they didn't see it. They were doing they're doing numerous things their. Their organizational skill when it comes to attacking very good they signed the software there. They use different accounts for doing different things they put the infrastructure inside the country that was. The victim was. Most of the things that you're going to be looking for, if your. Operation Center.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;You got muted.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So rick I didn't think that was gonna affect you as a co host. Can you.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;hear me now. yeah hear me now. yeah so again they were using. Strategically they were doing all the things they needed to do they use different accounts for different things. They were using malware that had never been seen before, so you're not gonna get any anti virus hits they were using infrastructure within the country of the person that was being attacked so that your firewall rules aren't going to kick in. Things that would normally alert to your sock aren't going to kick in. They were just very stealthy and very good at what they were doing.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I was just gonna say in the chat rick, the question is. what's the percentage what percentage would you say is human error and ignorance to software movement.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So in this case, it was a supply chain attack and you're going to find now where people weren't putting as much effort into looking at the software updates you're going to find more controls being put in place, I think. The. tools themselves again they were zero day vulnerability or zero day tools and that they'd never been seen before, so there was nothing that was going to kick off your antivirus or anything like that. So. human error in this case there probably wasn't a lot of human error in there, it was just good crane craft by the people that were doing the attacking yeah but you'll find more things happening in the future, just because of this it's going to up up grade the security. companies that are out there.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;it's a really good question and rick What would you say just in general, when when you see. hacks What would the percentage be you know more related to fishing or for human error versus this kind of attack.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;The majority of the incidents that we go to or typically fishing type of tax and so probably 80 85% of the attacks out there, right now, are phishing attacks. According to the latest statistics that i've seen and just because it only takes one person to click on that link. So and they're very good at using open source intelligence and to go out and really target the individual it used to be, when you got a phishing email, the English was bad just didn't look right. Now they're becoming very sophisticated and very difficult to determine that something bad's happening, are going to happen.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Darrell do I have time to read a couple more questions.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah absolutely.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, the next one here is, you mentioned that there is less than a government can do from an espionage versus cyber attack point of view, but if espionage leaves you at high risk for a cyber attack does this change.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;that's something that the government has to determine but. Typically it's been if no damage has been done, I mean the big thing right now is trying to determine how badly they've been compromised so it's probably going to take them a year to figure out all the different systems that have been compromised find any now where that's out there. They see anything malicious happening, then they're going to up. Their sanctions or whatever it is they decided they want to do.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Okay cool and then the lead on to that is somebody wants to work for you. So is trusted in information security what's a good trajectory to get into the field.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;To get in the field there's lots of. Free training that's available for example sands.org which is probably the biggest online trainer security, training group out there. All their Summit this year have been free so you can. Go to www dot sands si n s.org and you'll find a list of all the free training that's available there and just. Go out there do your research. there's lots of free tools that are available, that you can practice with. there's free digital forensics tools monitoring tools wire shark is a great one for looking at traffic Internet or network traffic learning how that works learning the protocols. work towards some certifications there's the CSM the CIS SP certifications. That i'll get those are considered an expert certifications in the security field, but you can think things like security plus from COMP tia is a good one for getting into for basic getting into it and understanding what's going on.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;perfect and there's a comment here or a question does this mean the firm's would be more inclined to move towards cloud, and you know we've talked about this and I know the answers absolutely um do you want to talk about that.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah more people are going to cloud environments, just because their monitor their looked after by an organization that supposedly. supposed to have good security controls in place, but when you look at this one, for example, the the goal was actually the cloud activity to getting into the cloud accounts and they use that. called saml attack as an as a way to do it so there's no guarantee, just because you're in the cloud you're secure. And a lot of people when they create their cloud accounts they don't look at all the security aspects of it either so again, you have to be trained and knowledgeable on what you're doing.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;yeah and you know from my perspective, it is a like rick is saying we're going to see a drive towards the cloud and then what that means to me as a SAS Jose cloud provider is we are going to have to have all kinds of. certifications and procedures in place that don't even exist today so to be a cloud provider is going to be, you know much, much more difficult in to two more really quick ones here rick How are they able to steal tokens to bypass Emma fees.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;i'm. Just by getting into the network and. running the tools in the environment, they were able to create the saml tickets and get the dual key. Key so once they have those, then the within the environment, they can create the tickets and then they go to town.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So in last one is. What encoded have to do with this, where people board with the you know, the whole world around them, and there was extra time or was there a vulnerability out there, what it was, was it a coincidence.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;colada be a coincidence, because this actually started in September of 2019 and we didn't get covert here till 2020 and China, I believe was around December of 2019 that it became well known, but ya know that would just be a coincidence perfect.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Perfect case thanks everyone for the questions they're all back back to you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So can I ask one. john.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;He said.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;It wasn't human error so much in terms of the attack, but looking back now is that Are there things that we could ask a solar winds. In there there they're cool they provide. features that we're not there to but should have been in hindsight.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Solar winds has gone to a lot of work recently to upgrade their. way they do their work and create their software. They hired a couple of people, Chris Krebs who used to be the head of seesaw until trump fire them and another fellow who used to be at stake, which was the old cult of the dead cows. hacking group and sort of their own security group as a lot of them do so they've hired them to help them with looking at those very questions and they've also got I think three different. Security companies that they brought into system as well, so they are certainly looking at that and don't want to ever have that happen again, because they probably won't be in business again if it was to repeat yourself.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;mm hmm. Okay, any other questions last question. Well let's. Give a warm warm virtual round of thanks. To our speakers. directly and. Terry mcdonald's. and We will see you on Thursday students. For our last meeting of the Semester. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;And rick and Trevor is it Okay, if I post the recording of the. Meeting to the to my you are courses my class website.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah absolutely.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Great thanks again take care and stay well.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.

    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl!
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;thank youu
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;How long do you think a resume should be? Ive heard people usually only like 1 page but then also people like a few pages
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;3 pages max
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;That was fascinating!
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;How much percentange would you say is human error and ignorance to software movement?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I agree
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;You mentioned that there is less that a government can do from an espionage vs cyberattack point of view - but if espionage leaves you at high risk for a cyberattack does this change?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Also as a student who is interested in InfoSec, what is a good trajectory to get into it and/or digital forensics?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;thank you, jeez, that is scary if I can't trust even software update...
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;does that mean that firms would incline more towards cloud?
