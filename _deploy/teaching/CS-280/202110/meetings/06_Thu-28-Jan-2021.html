      I thought it was interesting how how limited the google algorithm really is, I would’ve thought the results would be more tailored to each person based off of their history. I would be more interested in understanding how search results are actually chosen and if they have anything to do with the history of the device that is being used to search.

      It appears that google search results are generated based on certain metrics such as: your location &amp; ranking. A webpage's ranking is probably determined by the amount of traffic on it as well as other unknown factors that are used by google's algorithm.
    </li><li>
      In our fifth meeting we discussed an article about trusting algorithms too much like only using the first result on the search engine Google. Google which is part of the Alphabet corporation has been known to sell user data and give internet residence to anti science, racisism and other dangerous ideologies and websites.Another dangerous endeavor that search engines and websites like Google and Facebook does is control what search results show for different people. Unless it is undeniably proven facts and science, falsehoods and controversal opinions can cause dangerous actions like denying Covid 19 exists, anti-vaccinations and violently trying to...
    </li><li>
      Today we mainly discussed filter bubbles and how they affect search engine results. The most interesting fact from today’s discussion, in my opinion, is the fact that different search algorithms generate different results. This makes search engines, in and of themselves, their own little 'filter bubbles'. People who search on Duck-Duck-Go, for example, will have a ‘search engine filter bubble’ that is different than those who search for things on Google. This can create differences in the information that people are exposed to while searching the web. Used over a long period of time, this difference could create entirely different...
    </li><li>
      I don't know if I necessarily learned that services such as Alexa use algorithms to determine what information to give you, but the lecture made me think about it more. Personally, my house utilizes Google Home and I find that there are many benefits to having it. I've always considered the security and privacy concerns – which is what I think most people worry about with “listening” devices – but I've hardly considered the biases of what information is given. I think for innocuous things, such as a cookie recipe, it's not that big of a deal, but services like...

      Alexa summarize this article for me”Amazon’s Alexa is now answering to about 70% of the total smart speaker market share within the United States. Amazon reporting in 2019, that over 100 million devices of the AI assistant platform have already been sold. It presents a unique opportunity to provide this sort of niche aid to it’s customer base. However, not all the reviews about Alexa are turning out to be in favour. CBC’s recent interview with Frédéric Bouchard reveals some of the woes of working with Alexa.Bouchard states on how he believes these devices eventually lead to the users finding...
    </li><li>
      I believe that this distrust of scientific expertise can be a good thing, if people in turn try to learn more information in the a proper way regarding subjects they do not quite understand. Especially since it seems like nowadays a lot of people just take anything they read or hear as facts immediately.
    </li><li>
      From the meeting5, I really like the idea of in-meeting activity. My opinion after reading the article discussed in the class is yes for sure asking anything to Siri or Alexa gives us answer but not with the all the information we used to get before. There are lots of reasons behind that it could be our location, past search history or anything. By getting the information what they wanted to give it to us that's completely wrong but on the other side if we see it's kind of advantage that we are not wasting the time and we are...
    </li><li>
      The past meeting was very interesting specially for me. As, when I study something, I want to implement it in real life and that’s what we exactly did in the last meeting. We proved the existence of filter bubble by searching same words and surprisingly majority got different top non-advertised results. At first, I wasn’t that interested in this topic, but after I practically saw this, I want to know more about what criteria do this social-networking platforms take into consideration, how they keep trace of specifics of participants, and much more. Therefore, I surfed numerous websites in my spare...
    </li><li>
      From the news article, I realized how some scientific products (voice assistants) facilitates distrust among people and restrains / hinders social interactions. I had never thought in any way that asking voice assistants for answers to some question can cause reduced interactions with people. I think the concerns raised in this article are valid and a really important topic that needs to be discussed to bring awareness to people that rely on voice assistants for answers.
    </li><li>
      I think the most interesting part of todays class was how similar the search results were between all the different users and browsers. I suspect that that either due to some websites being vastly more popular or that (especially with the political searches) there is some governing body enforcing a consistent result. eg) the ggc site being the first result for everyone on a Canadian network.I find it hard to believe that anyone would place very much trust in devices like alexa, as someone who has an alexa I can confirm that she either mishears, replies an answer to a...
    </li><li>
      I like the involvement of everybody in this meeting about the filter search bubble. However, doing this in class is quite a time-wasting, that could have been a participation response where students go out and search for those keywords and show their result.I would like a more in-depth explanation of the blog post assignment as it's worth way more than the participation. Also, a breakout room is good. Rather than having people just throwing out ideas left and right is just too much to take in from over 100 people.The Alexa’s news.Considering that once people let devices like Alexa, Google,...
    </li><li>
      What I learned from our meeting today is that the electronic search algorithms in search engines do not give us neutral search results because they may be affected by different factors from one person to another or by the search settings from one user to another. In this pattern, I noticed that the differences in the search are sometimes a picture that is not pure or directed to the user, and this is something that is considered a subject to reconsider it because of its dimensions and effects on the neutrality of the search results.
    </li><li>
      Today in class we discussed how we implicitly trust the first result that the algorithm gives us when searching things on the internet. It was pretty fun to compare everyone's search results and see what the commonalities were and also what the outliers were. It definitely has me reconsidering my choice to use Google, especially since my searches are usually mundane, and so there's not really a need for Google to "curate" those results for me. Holla at me with your suggestions, haha. ;)Now that I think about it, I'm not even sure that Google is doing a good job...
    </li><li>
      When looking at "How 'Alexa' is threatening society's trust in scientific expertise" people do have a right to be skeptical of technology algorithms, as it is impossible to know what is going on in them for the average person. A study done in "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mortgage-discrimination-black-and-latino-paying-millions-more-in-interest-study-shows/" showed that black and Latino applicants paid 0.08% more than white people. These biases from computers come from the data that they are learning from. Since people have biases the computer learning from them will also have a bias.Politicians saying they are on the side of science has been a political issue for longer than Alexia....

      I learned a bit concept about google algorithm. I would love to learn or study on google algorithm how it works and how it ranks the result.I researched a bit and found out that google works on ranking algorithm. The results which are shown are due to the following factors :-the key words you typed,the location where you are in,you past history to get you to more fimilar topic like if someone searches gate then for normal person it would be image of a gate nd meaning nd definition for it but if some person which is more related to...

      When we did the in-class filter bubble google search activity I thought it would be interesting to do a small test among myself and my family by checking 2 additional sources (an iPad that I use for schoolwork and an old iPhone) as well as the original source of my PC. The result was kind of uninteresting as there was only one difference among the 3 sources, which was the "chocolate cookie recipe" search, which had a new top search on the old iPhone being: https://www.bettycrocker.com/recipes/ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookies/77c14e03-d8b0-4844-846d-f19304f61c57 (the third top search on the PC and iPad). My additional results gives my...
    </li><li>
      It is because AI doesn't discriminate that's why we don't get much different results but it may vary from locations to locations basically it uses the data gathered from users pattern which site was more clicked after searching particular word or even the interest of the user can be noticed by the search engines.
    </li><li>
      From past meeting 5, I learned how the search engine shows different results base on your location, domain, IP and type of search engine. If you search for "some recipe" in google.ca the result will be different with https://www.bing.com/ and different in https://ca.search.yahoo.com/. Also if you have your location service OFF then it will show you what comes first in the search then if you have it ON. It will show something close to your area/region.We did this filter bubble experiment most of the class to see how it works.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting Dr. Hepting talked a bit about the blog in the class and the submission details. Also talked about the meeting details and the expectations. In the meeting We also read an CBC article about “How 'Alexa' is threatening society's trust in scientific expertise”. Which was about how human are so biased and their trust toward the machine over a human. When we are searching for a recipe by using voice assistance, the siri or alexa providing us a random recipe. But without knowing if the recipe is accurate or watching the video or article we are...
    </li><li>
      In class yesterday we discussed VPN's and how based on where you are will affect your search results. One thing that I struggled to understand is just how big of a difference there is on what our search results end up being based on where we are. I know that different places revolve around different cultures but things as simple as a cookie recipe can greatly be changed simply by being in different spots and having different advertising history.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 5, we are doing in class activity to search some topics by using google. It lets us understand when we search same topic at the same time, we will get almost similar website from google.For "beware online filter bubbles":Web companies will adjust services according to people’s personal preferences, like different people search same item at website, the output of results are total different. We hope that the web company can let everyone set their own personal preferences.For "what obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good":Social media is already indispensable for everyone. We can learn about...
    </li><li>
      I thought it was interesting that we had a wide range of search results for different topics. My theory is that it was based on the search engine used (google vs bing vs duckduckgo), and also maybe location services. The covid vaccine result that was the most popular was really strange to see because I assumed it would all be official government pages or perhaps even news articles.
    </li><li>
      I learnt from the video that from social psychology, spaces shapes behaviour and that spaces have political consequences. When people are in a big room, they tend to behave differently than when they are in a small room.Spaces change behaviour partly because of how they are designed or by how they are encoded or norms on how to behave.Good physical spaces are structured.The behaviour of LinkedIn tells that it is a work platform
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we learned how we get different search results depending on our internet footprints. The concept from the last meeting that was difficult was understand was the fact that to what ratio does the SEO and to what ratio google's algorithm contributes to the search result for an individual. I would definitely want to learn more about that. The fact that some search results were not even relevant to the search was disturbing ( for example COVID-19 Vaccines). I had an experience with this myself. If searched Ice skates they would show me male ice-skates ( I'm...
    </li><li>
      I didn't really understand the purpose of the in-class exercise of posting the links we got from various searches to see how they differed from other people's. Most people seemed to get the same two or three links at the top of their results. The CBC Ideas piece about chocolate chip cookie recipes isn't really about why certain users will see one link and other users will see another link. It is more about what is the process for determining which recipe is chosen by the algorithm and who or what is responsible for this determination. Dr Bouchard argues that...
    </li><li>
      During this meeting, a majority of our class was spent in doing a search experiment. The topic of the videos we had to watch was about Filter Bubbles and how they are leaving out objective important information in favor of subjective important information. This was evident from the results of the experiment. For example, we were asked to search about the Governor General of Canada. The top search results didn't show any recent news about the resignation of the General, however it led us to the website giving us information about what the General does. It isn't only about this...
    </li><li>
      what i am most interested in learning more about is what the possible alternatives to algorithmic filtering would be. sure filter bubbles are not ideal but neither is having our search results curated by a corporation. To me this problem might be on the consumer not the program and an greater emphasis needs to be put on become active consumers of internet not just allowing the algorithm decide for us.
    </li><li>
      Vyomesh How ‘Alexa’ is threatening the society’s trust in scientific expertise.              Here we learn about the reason about the working of the Alexa is quite interesting but somehow it is good for the someone as per their ideology or for someone it is not. The Alexa or any other devices that runs with the new technology known as Artificial intelligence. It records the voice, tracks our location, and customize things according to ourselves. It captures all the moments of ours so it could be dangerous.Hypothetically speaking there could be a breach that can carve out the important details of ones and can...
    </li><li>
      The search engine activity we did in class was an interesting example of how we may be limited in our scope of what we can easily learn about, and it also showed how search terms can drastically effect what actual web searches come up, vs News Articles. It showed that we can, providing we are in a similar geographical location, get similar, repeatable results. However, this limits the ease of access to a variety of sources of information or views, and also creates a feedback loop depending on how the algorithm works, where the popular result gets picked more because...
    </li><li>
      I found the results of our class experiments on search results interesting, and was honestly surprised to see that for most searches, one or two URLs seemed to account for the vast majority of results. I wondered to what extent the top search result for each user was influenced by their location and browsing data, and how much of it was influenced mainly by the search engine used. A couple of years back, privacy concerns led me to switch search engines, as I was becoming unsettled by how relevant my search results were to my interests. It seems strange to...
    </li><li>
      Meeting 5 was interesting, i was little bit surprised to see different results upon searching same thing, even after being in the same area. the last meeting proved that there is really such thing like filter bubble.but the concept of alexa being a threat to society is little bit difficult for me to understand. but yes, it is true that filter bubbles are the threat. the internet should be the platform providing immense and same crucial knowledge to everyone. it should not be on the basis of recent search or what internet thinks that we want to see.
    </li><li>
      The filter bubbles are threat as same as alexa to society. the internet is showing us the results that it thinks we should see. Upon searching same topic people are getting different results, which is the result of filer bubbles. This meeting was all about getting different results upon searching same thing.
    </li><li>
      This meeting was sort of interesting, using different web browsers to search various information, the 'Chocolate cookie recipe' and also various political affairs, We all wondered what the basic criteria would be for the web browser to provide us with the results that are mainly similar but also differentiate as we surf on contrasting web engines.
    </li><li>
      the internet that we are using has clearly lots of pros ad cons and the list can keep going forever the first video the very important point i learned and its not debatle was the personalization filter, which is just a tiny part of the bubble filter and i think this is more dangereous because the knowledge regarding the web, internet, inforation is very less and itcreate chaos everytime something surafces.the second video of ted talk had some very good points and also which make sense about the structurely everything was build the more restrictions the more people tends to...
    </li><li>
      For the last meeting, we reviewed the content of the student blog, and analyzed how the google search website gave us the feedback of the content that we want. As can be seen, some students give very different links for the topic, and other students give the exact same link of the topic. So, we can say, there do have a filter bubble on google search. In addition, we read an article on the CBC site, about ‘’How 'Alexa' is threatening society's trust in scientific expertise”. Here are some of my point of views.the most important thing you learned from...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from past meetings is that how we humans trust more on artificial intelligence rather then on our own fellow persons. The concept from the past meeting that was the most difficult to understand was when we all experimented to searched chocolate chip cookie recipe and we all got different recipe results. We all clicked on the first recipe without even thinking that how this recipe came up on our web. A philosopher Bouchard is searching on this concept and he is worried about the increased reliance we humans show on artificial intelligence. After...
    </li><li>
      Learning about filter bubbles and how they work was sort of interesting. We really do need to have a common search platform where everyone gets the same news and the same result.Getting to know the search results of everyone and how they differed from one another even though everyone searched for the same thing at the same time was amusing. Looking forward to having more activities of this kind.
    </li><li>
      It is horrible that technology is taking over our privacy and even though software or a website says it protects our privacy, in some ways, it is being leaked or stored somewhere in the information bubble. It hit me when Eli Pariser said that the internet is showing us what we want to see, however, it is not necessarily what we need to see. The algorithm all the search engine use includes our personal information. So it feels like the human gatekeeper has been replaced by with the algorithm ones.
    </li><li>
      • the most important thing you learned from this past meetinghow big tech giants use your search result, location to filter what do you see on the web.what you would like to know more aboutI want to learn more about how this companies uses our data and our preferences to filter our search result and how can we escape it.• something you encountered that is related to the past meetingI read this great articleLink: https://www.nbcnews.com/better/lifestyle/problem-social-media-reinforcement-bubbles-what-you-can-do-about-ncna1063896
    </li><li>
      In our last meeting we discussed and saw the bubble effect firsthand from different perspective, or ip address to be more precise. How our location and other stuff impacts on what news or search preferences we get. As we saw 2 videos prom Eli Pariser from the ted talk of previous class, we discussed the topic of those videos in class and its impact on society
    </li><li>
      I was expecting the links that showed up on google to vary quite a bit. However, it was interesting to see that the links were largely consistent for all the searches that were performed during class, with 2 to 3 main first links showing up for most users. I assume SEO might be at play here on boosting those links to the top. Additionally, I believe that if more controversial topics were chosen, there might be a larger variety in the search results.
    </li><li>
      In the class meeting, I learned about Forticlient and algorithms. Forticlient is a VPN, and it is a secure and reliable to access networks and applications of networking gadgets. Then, Artificial Intelligence algorithms like Siri, Alexa, Google, etc., society relies on them and losing trust over the organization and human expertise. Bouchard said, "we can't see what we want, "which means if we search over the internet, it shows we have the content over the platform which the algorithms want to offer, and we studied on it to know that what will happen. Our first attempt on Chocolate Chip Cookie...
    </li><li>
      I see how the technology behind Siri and Alexa can be difficult to trust, when they deliver information without any source along with it. When using google on a computer, it is much easier to check the website or author of a source to test its credibility. I think it is just important for users to understand this difference. I can understand how this could create a lack of trust in technology and algorithms, but I think its unnecessary. The technology like Siri and Alexa that we have is very useful in everyday life, and should not cause any problems...
    </li><li>
      The most interesting part I found during this meeting is when I using Microsoft Bing to search the "Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe", the top 5 result is different with google, and I use google more often. I think the different between the two search result is because the data that google collected from my search history is more than Microsoft.

      After watching the Don Norman talk , I found the most imporant topic to be the Norman's point on happiness and stress. When people are happy they are often relaxed, and when people are stressed they are often anxious, among other things of course. Although anecdotal, personally I always found myself doing significantly worse on exams that I was overly stressed about. More so in my first year of University as that is when my "exam anxiety" was at its highest. The past two years however, I have been taking a more relaxed, laid back approach; because eventually I did...

      The point that I find interesting in this lecture was that I never thought about how virtual assistantsare getting their results and how they might be delegating our judgment.
    </li><li>
      1.As discussed in class, filter bubble can be a problem because it shows the information that people already belief in (bias ideals) instead of different ideals, by reading the news, technology such as Alexa or google may cause problem because of humans way of thinking. moreover i believe google, alexa or others record our history, location etc and remembers them, Shows us what information according to them not what people wants to see.2. can your go over the topics of assignment 1 one more time??
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture we had learned about how alexa and other algorithms like this are threatening the trust among the people. Without seeing the source from which we are getting our answers, weather it is correct or not. We trust the first answer that pop up.We also learned about filter bubble in class today with few examples and we got to know that we get different results when we are in different part of the world but when we are in a same area or city the result seems to match mostly.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned about last meeting, was filter bubbles. The speaker explained it at one point during his talk that it was invisible editing of the web. This obviously brings up questions as the intent to these edits, the affects they have, and the possible abuse of this editing that can affect all those visiting certain parts of the web. There is also a discussion to be had about personalization vs. manipulation. There are obvious benefits to personalization of search results or Facebook wall results. However, there are issues involving what can be shown and should...
    </li><li>
      This class was rather interesting as it was an experiment of sorts. The main takeaway is that there appears to be certain sites that bump themselves up as the number one result, regardless of who searches for it. I have an interest in cooking, and in spite of that I still got one of the same two results (all recipes and Sally's baking addiction), my past history and websites that I visit was nowhere to be found, making it quite curious. Looking more at it, they are both highly rated recipes, with all recipes having a 5 star rating based...

      The video shows how our environment effect our behaviour and thought process. How the online platform that we are son much involved with and depended on can be beneficial to us beside being destructive. The video further goes on to describe how the civilization of past ideas were for our betterment and how we are moving towards a generation confined in man-made online space leaving behind the best behavioural and personalities that we could have gained instead.The article about alexa shows how our daily security is threatened with the rising blind dependence and trust on technology. Technology is day by...

      I think its important to note from this past meeting is that it is up to the user to judge whether the source they searched is a reliable source.the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult to understand and would like to know more about is how some sources acheived to rank 1st; Also, why Google showed the same result for the chocolate chip cookie recipe for some people but not for others? why for some people it's the same 1st ranked site but not for others?something you encountered that is related to the past meeting I...
    </li><li>
      In last lecture, we had a discussion and lot of experiment that how google gives different results to individual for the exact same question. It means these kind of search engines are personalizing data for individual and providing results according to that. We can get example that I tried to search about Samsung S21 from my device so it was showing me first link from official Samsung while I tried it from my friends device so first link from bell network with S21 instead of Samsung. Hence we are unaware that whether it is the SEO of the website or...
    </li><li>
      in the lecture we all searched about different things( ex- chocolate chip cookie recipe, covid 19 vaccine and more). The search results was different for everyone. This is because of internet is using invisible algorithm to personalize the data. It depends upon the searched history, what kind of browser user is using and the location of user. Internet does not give the results that what we want to see ,but it gives the information that internet wants that we should know; means it is putting filter bubbles. Eli Pariser makes the argument that this might yield results to be terrible...

      In the last lesson, I learned how easy it is to get information in the era of big data. No matter what it is, just enter it on the Google interface, and the content you want to find appears. However, the difficulty of filtering out useful information from the massive amount of information has also greatly increased. Especially the increase of useless information caused by current consumerism, such as various advertisements. I think the most difficult point in this era is how to obtain effective information and distinguish the true and false information. In some cases, the information found after...

      I read the article about Alexa again and found it interesting how some people can draw a line with gadgets like these, after all, we all carry a smartphone in our pockets. It was also a little entertaining how the headline targets Alexa, maybe the author of the article was really upset with his last Amazon purchase. Anyways, the “Hope for the future” section made me think.From the article:"There'll be an energy in trusting in each other and building things together," he said.

      In todays meeting we talked about many thing related to Filter bubble the video is linked to the in-class activity which is due to the filter bubble is a algorithm whose outline includes ones personal information online and the bubble inside contains ones human behavior individually which is totally different from others. The last part is to request some controls for the user to have some authority through filters and which is some risk.The risk in platform of social media is getting more riskier daily. The bullying and digital harm through social media has increased. So, the obligation that social...

      In this lecture, we learned how we get a different search result in spite of searching the same thing but over the different devices as it uses the past search history to make the experience better. In the lecture, we all in the lecture searched on the different topics such as the Chocolate chip cookie, Covid 19 Vaccine, Governor-General of Canada. We all searched for the same topic but we found that the advertisement which was shown to us were different due to the same reason.I also had an experience like this I and my roommate searched for the term...
    </li><li>
      After watching the most recent videos posted, it made me think about the power of design and it's affect on us consciously and subconsciously. The power of our minds to affect our actions based the environmental stimulation around us. When we are happier we perform better, but at the same time we need structure and order to get things done. In the first video it is very apparent that the way things are designed affects our emotions. This definitely plays into programming a website or space, we can see the effects different designs have on peoples emotions. The second video...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting I found the filter bubble experiment very interesting but I also want to know that why we did not get the same result as shown in the video. Most of the people got similar search results then where is that filter bubble thing?
    </li><li>
      The point 'Alexa' is threatening society's trust in logical ability is interesting. these days individuals are occupied with their devices like smartphones, PC, and so forth talk remains with individuals. in this subject, we can see that Bouchard is stressed over people. since individuals trust the web more than people. The web runs on calculations and all web-based looking is refined through them. Indeed, all that individuals see and do on the web is a result of calculations. individuals can look and get the data about the thing they are searching for and see better while taking any choices. be...
    </li><li>
      Similar to videos I watched in the previous meeting(meeting 4), I learned from this meeting that not everyone asking the same question/query to google gets the same answer.I would like to know more about how the ranking of the results that google provides effects/affects a person's decision making process or understanding of a subject.
    </li><li>
      well, from the last class topic and by watching the videos related to that class we get the information about the filter bubbles that how filter bubbles working as in last class we doing some search on google and that means that by doing this we get the information about the filters as we all were doing a research and that research shows that everyone get different different top results as the reason behind that is the filters the software they run for the searching of us then the location is the thing that matters so we can say that...
    </li><li>
      In our last meeting, i got to know and learn about the way we will end up getting distinct search results which actually is based on put internet tracking. The previous meeting's theory was tough to understand about the ratio thing between algorithm of google and SEO. Google's Algorithm imparts the search results differntly for each and every person. So everyone might have their unique search result. Also, some people may experience irrelevant search results. At times pops up the same advertisement all the time. Hence, the search results are individualized by them. Therefore, we cannot say any specific thing...
    </li><li>
      During last class, we got to know more about filter bubble. We searched about Chocolate chip cookie recipe, Governor of Canada and COVID-19 vaccine. Few people from our class got different results. We tried figuring out the reason behind getting different link. This was based on the algorithm used by search engines. And we don’t know what algorithms are used by these search engines?The lesson I have learnt from “How 'Alexa' is threatening society's trust in scientific expertise” is that we don’t have trust among each other. Usually, whenever we face some problem in our real life, we take help...
    </li><li>
      The social media isn't providing a variety of communication ways, which cause some problems. Nowadays many people's social content are through the internet so that according to the idea of city that used to be, there is a lack of the ways of communicating in social media. In my opinion, the big company should do more like create an environment for more people, different people, and be focus, checking those garbage informations, so it can create a better place for every people.
    </li><li>
      As a future programmer I learned that the content/product/service which I'm going to showcase to my audience should cover the following points:-should be relevant/what they are actually hoping of-should be important-proper check of their feeling ,will they be comfortable enough in exploring more into it-making it less challenging and more user friendly in terms of technology and public friendly in terms of emotions-rather than creating a rigid design of one owner and owner's rules, making it a bit liberal giving people appropriate power over it, so they feel the ownership and the warmth.
    </li><li>
      In the meeting we did some activities like you asked us to post the first link of the website about the recipe of chocolate chip cookie. And then we decided which is the most recommended one. We did the same with Covid-19 vaccines. I think people got almost same websites because of the highest recommended one by the google. It also sometimes depends on the history of our searches.I think that's what we discussed in meeting-5.See you in the next meeting.
    </li><li>
      this was a very interesting meeting. As I got flabbergasted by the fact that a thing like a filter bubble really exist as we searched about covid 19 and choco-chip cookie etc. Now, I find as a threat because it can really affect a person's thinking and really can be used to promote some type of propaganda. We are relying too much on the internet and usually, people can be misled by the internet pretty easily. Alexa as a threat to society seems pretty real to me. However, as long it maintains a balance between the data shared and comfort,...
    </li><li>
      In the last class I enjoyed the exercise when we all searched up the same things on google and we could all see first hand how we all get different results from the searches we make on google depending on the individual.
    </li><li>
      you can say that google search is totally depend on the certain matrics you can say depend upon location, area. And the link which is showed on the top of the search is depend upon the how amount of trafficing which are used by users as well as google algorithm.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the concept of filter bubbles had been highlighted very well. I like the practical thing, we all did in the last meeting. And Due to some algorithm, every device gets different result.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we did some searches to verify about filter bubbles theory . And that was true in most of cases. So its real thing that these algorithms edit our web result accordingly, without even letting us know.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting the search result was really different as i saw and that was one of the same thhing that was discussed in the video as well that it depends on the personalization filter depending on you what you saw and where, so it was a bit of a shock that it so precisely monitor your search or activity or in this case the clicks which is already to exposed and i think which makes it more dangereous is the eco system that we are in and also the knowledge is really less, one of the reason i thought...
    </li><li>
      Alexa' is threatening society's. the word threatening is a bit ambiguous because as the years go by and technology advances we as humans become too careless and less about how things operate . So when you ask your Alexa for the recipe for a meal, you are stranded so you only want the recipe fast and only the best recipe. Hence the individual doesn't care why it came up but that it came up.
    </li><li>
      As we discussed in last class, different people gets different search result as per their previous search. For example, if I search particular school here in Regina, I will get the first few links of that school information page afterword their will be a different school, however, this school will be here in Regina only. Now, if my friend who is in Calgary searching a school here in Regina, he will get the first couple of link related to that school afterword he will get the links of school located in Calgary itself. So, here we saw how the search...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we further discussed and experimented on the filter bubble concept. We all were asked to search on the same top with the same name for instance "Covid-19". The results were similar to the ones we saw on the videos posted from meeting 5. Everyone got different search results due to their filter bubbles. Different results were shown to everyone which were personally tailored to their queries and search results. Some of the students were missing the important piece of information on the first page of their results. An experiment was conducted by Frédéric Bouchard where he...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 5. I watched the report "How 'Alexa' is threatening society's trust in scientific expertise". It was talk about in most of people's mind the position of AI is beyond the scientist that invent them. people are over depending on internet, Fake news and real news are mixing together. If the percentage of trust tend to fake news, then the Fake news will become the true. This is how internet violence come from, some small case will become a huge problem such as roll a snowball through thousand to ten thousand netizen. And the worst result is the person...
    </li><li>
      We need to the be more careful about how we approach artificial intelligence in future as I said in meeting 4 and the article about 'Alexa' says that we know very little about these AI's, we don't question anything as we just assume they are correct we don't check the credibility of the source at all.The political part of the article was the thing I did not understand.I would like to know how are they improving these AI assistant.if you ask google assistant something she just shows the first web search she can find.
    </li><li>
      Hearing what others say about how just the moral and obligation systems behind a company really opens up more conversations and how big the system really is. To think all these things are done by a code, a code that decides what we see and what we don't see is beyond amazing ability wise but scary to think about looking at it. We may continue to be forced into our own bubble but if you can keep your eyes open all these developments will be spectacular to see just don't let it consume you. I would like to learn the...
    </li><li>
      Based on the in-class activities, it proves that online filter bubbles abound on the Internet. However, depend on what information we are searching for, some results from search engine can be roughly divided into several categories instead of everyone getting a completely different result. For the special keywords, the results were nearly the same for different users. The conclusion of in-class activities is quite different from my understanding of online filter bubbles. But, there is no denying that online filter bubbles do have impact on the information retrieved by users.After reading "How 'Alexa' is threatening society's trust in scientific expertise",...
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about how 'Alexa' is threatening society's trust in scientific expertise
    </li><li>
      The working of filter bubble and the outcome of it in our results platform can be understood by the experiment conducted by the professor of university of montreal. It is surprising as to how individuals get different results for the same search done on different devices. It shows the way algorithms works in governing the results shown to us. Due to this filters, some of the important results are missed by the user which they must know and its all because of the algorithms.
    </li><li>
      The idea of the filter bubbles does not work very well when we searched for different topics since most people get the same response from google search. However, when we googled the covid vaccine it did not give the government site or WHO site. It raises the concern of the possibility of putting inaccurate information on the top page. A few years ago someone in China searched his illness issues on the internet using Baidu(Chinese search engine) she got traped to believe a hospital to be as good as some major hospitals. Which gives them false information. So I think...
    </li><li>
      In this lesson we discuss and practice the results of a computer search.Obviously, most people are able to find the corresponding URL very quickly.One of the important points of the article in this class is that computers do not eliminate trust between people, or between people and scientists.The paper argues that the original traditional trust relationship is broken because of the shortcomings of human nature and the differences between human and machine in search.It is not difficult to understand, after all, the existing computer network is based on big data and engine work, this model is naturally faster than the...
    </li><li>
      In this I learned that how Alexa or Siri threatened the society trust about scientific expertise. Most of the people nowadays using Alexa or Siri for search on web rather than searching Manually. the searches made by Alexa are depends upon where you are sitting and what type of mobile or pc you are using. And it feeding the distrust in humans as if we searching about something it show the different sites as we have taken example of covid19 in our class and it was different results to everyone. They shows the result but we cant say its right...
    </li><li>
      It was really surprising how everyone's search result was different than others and I as a CS student I just figure that out. But in the same time it's kind of alarming because it shows how everyone is being isolated and these computer algorithms are making another small world for everyone where they only see what these algorithms think are good for them not something that is important to the world. This censorship is the same as the last meeting like how we talked about companies censor things based on things that we might be more interested in, rather than...
    </li><li>
      In the last class we came to learn about the algorithms of the search engines and how every time we get different search results. In an experiment we tried searching different topics which are Governor of Canada, the recipe of the Chocolate chip cookies and COVID-19 vaccine. And we do not know how this system even works.Watching the video of “How ‘Alexa’ is threatening society’s trust in scientific expertise ” I’ve came to learn that we guys need to trust the manpower over the internet and the search engines. Which is that we if we need the recipe of the...
    </li><li>
      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting-&gt; How filter bubble works and how can we make online platforms more public friendly than user friendlythe concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand-&gt; It was very interesting lecture and nothing felt difficult to me in this lecture.what you would like to know more about-&gt; How the filter algorithm works and how can we overcome this bubblesomething you encountered that is related to the past meeting-&gt; It is when Dr. Hepting gave us activity and how different the result were for the same...
    </li><li>
      I found the topic of meeting very interesting “filter bubble” and the experiment we did was exciting. I really want to get more information related to this topic.
    </li><li>
      From Eli Pariser's TED talk I learned about how social media and search engine algorithms cause users to only get information that the algorithm thinks they want to see. This leads to echo chambers where people only receive the same information and perspectives over and over again, which can lead to very closed-minded thinking. I have noticed this personally on apps like twitter where I only really see tweets from people with similar viewpoints to me over and over again.
    </li><li>
      “How ‘Alexa’ is threatening society’s trust in scientific expertise”: Since the technology is developing day by day, there are many explosive inventions related to computer and digital system such as AI (Artificial Intelligence). In my opinion, the most prominent in those inventions is the virtual assistant which is developed by many companies such as Apple (Siri) and Amazon (Alexa). Siri or Alexa could help people a lot whenever they need them. Users could active them by using their voice. For that reason, Siri and Alexa are also known as “voice assistance”. From my perspective, voice assistance helps people a lot...
    </li><li>
      As we searched about the covid 19 vaccine, and put the link in the class activity. As I observed that every link was different because of their interests or we can say filter bubbles.Also we searched for the recipe to make cookies, and in the experiment, when it was asked from AI devices such as alexa, I also tried it on my alexa, the same way Bouchard did. Even though i was able to find many other recipes over the internet. As filter bubbles, shows us those links which people has searched more for.It filters the links according to the...
    </li><li>
      The question, Eli says, is that while the Internet reveals what we want to see, we don't really need to see what we need to see. The filter bubble is what he calls it. It's a bubble of exclusive knowledge of your own, so you can't see what isn't going into it. It was seen as a liberation from the power of people who owned and edited the content you saw when the Internet was created. As an example, as discussed on your website, talking about Alexa or Siri or any other responsive AI, they listen to us all the...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting I learned about filter bubble that how it filters your search results according to individuals search. I learnt that how different people get different search results on the basis of location and according to the popularity of the URL.
    </li><li>
      People trust computers more than human scientists because they think computers are more reliable, and there is still a gap between people. If people want to deal with this problem, the certification of scientists online is essential. Only the authority of scientists has been certified, and I believe the public will believe in such scientists. For individuals, because human beings are social creatures, it is necessary to communicate with others. But only online social networking is not enough; we should communicate more with friends face to face.
    </li><li>
      In this class, we learned about how social media publishes false news. In my opinion, the companies have tried to fix this by adding the fact check feature which is very interesting and can help limit the expansion of fake news.
    </li><li>
      Hi all,The biggest and most interesting takeaway for me from the meeting was the importance of SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for any website, public or private. I was surprised to see raps.org come up as first when searched for "COVID 19 Vaccine". My point being, government data could've been optimized more so that data comes up first when searched for.
    </li><li>
      Well what i learn from this is on how the aligithem can change what we view or what we think we want so we can get filter results that we might not want to have
    </li><li>
      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting-it is that there are different search results for different persons though we search for the same thing at same time. This is the bubble filter that shows us different results.the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understandbubble sortwhat you would like to know more abouti would like to know more about the how social media is interlinked with the bubble sort and how is it a greater platformsomething you encountered that is related to the past meetingfilter bubble

Okay here's a question about response. responses and I was going to talk about that as well, so let me. share my screen right away, but. Let me look into that first to answer that question about. necklace I don't see your engagement for meeting five. Can you say. So. The email that didn't get centered and form messages didn't get posted if you still have a text, maybe just included with your response today. would be my suggestion I wouldn't worry about. Having the. Sound so much the idea of having the response for last meeting but. i'm more interested in the ideas. me share my screen with you, first of all. You can see. What i'm doing here. today. So if you find that i'm. At the end of meeting. or whatever the meeting number is and there's no question. posted here. Let me know. Okay, so now let me switch to in case people haven't. I knew, to the idea of doing these responses. And I had a student I was communicating lesson. You seven problems, adding to the response, so let me just go switch to a student here. These are a question and answer. means you have to post something before you see something. For you see anything else, what other people. So the idea is to go click on a response. The discussion here. When you get to this. group reply to this. Once you reply, once you add your own message here. Then you can see other people's responses. For those of you have done this before if I missed anything. clear to everyone. If you miss the password for attendance. I had some problems. I know, last day was a bit of a hack problem because of. snow day can go by without any problems, right. Having said that, here. i'm going to do the password now. she's given me. Permission error, when I try and do something like that, instead of a blank page. Okay. OK.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;OK.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;today's stuff. I wanted to. seem that we're getting. giving me Google responses, so I thought I haven't tried duck duck go. and Now here let's do that, so this is the Google or sponsor. For me. seems like these are the top three sally's baking addiction our recipes and Betty crocker. So here's duck duck go. To PS and teen dot dot dot. Five boys Baker. maybe.com. And chocolate chip cookie. Center cut. co.dot.so those are completely different. And then, following those first three results we get an ad. And then we get another all recipes. very best faking. At cracker. Oh wow chocolate chip cookies are in the news. i'm. kendra cookie pie that's got to be on par with eating it drove me to tell, I think. The tie sounds better. Anyway, so the top results to be different for duck duck go. and check out being. US being.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;accidentally sometimes yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Anyway, okay So here we have the being results. So reading from. This kind of looks like a pinterest thing. Now I don't know whether you should read down the columns or across. The chatelaine has the. best. rated recipe, I think. In terms of positioning and search results. i'm not sure if these are the same. kind of cut offs here. same. or not. So, for that reason i'm going to say that the next one, is this entry COM. stars and 1000 reviews wow that's pretty good. And chocolate chip cookies dinner then dessert. And in 22 reviews five stars. Chocolate chip cookies emails. la times. Chocolate chip cookies for stars 1900 views. So I think we're not talking about chocolate cookies anymore in the chat. yeah the link to the story about Robin Hood. We can talk about shortly. Chocolate chip cookie. chatting. anyway. Okay, so there's that now that me. My page some things I haven't updated on. gave you a couple videos related to design. Any thoughts about. Everyone. For find find the links okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. The previous day. Is cargo shifting to design. In sort of a human computer interaction perspective. This point was because of the. filter bubbles one, but the. Second, one of what what allegation to social media platforms have to the greater good. And how do we think about designing spaces and. As we are. Present and future computer professionals. What what obligation, do we have to think about design. As a public good. yeah so this. is a nice little video of. Norman doors limited to their calls Norman doors after don Norman. You talked about them and so those are the. doors that have. ambiguous controls so. If it's a flat panel, you know what's your I need to push the door open. But official handle that looks like it should be pulled but really need to push. that's that's confusing and that's. that's a problem and that's where the term Norman doors comes from. I remember a cartoon from the far side. really has imagery of school for the gifted and the kid is pushing on the door. Where it seems to be, I think it seems like a. season, a flat powder push, no, no, it is. Anyway, so. he's pushing on the door and this mark Paul. This is one example. That i'll put this video up here. Oh yeah okay so that's a good comment about securities feature. Because in this video as other video but Norman doors there's a scene from a movie about. US being stuck in that room because of the. feature. window.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah good good.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;audio.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;caption. yeah crystal yeah anyway, let me see again, if I can.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Make.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Let me see if that's going to help with the audio.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Professor just a quick question. yeah. So, last week the videos we talked about they were all about social bubbles stuff like that, for example. And this week we're talking about design i'm just wondering, do you think a good tie in, for that would be the power of influence, for example, you're more likely to use something if it's easy to use or a nice to look at.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I was thinking about it from the perspective of happiness.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, fair enough.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. So I think you know, the idea of having influencers and so on. I mean we'd like to follow recommendations. without necessarily going and trying things ourselves. You know if you see somebody else doing it then we'll just do that instead. But, so the first video from last week for the filter roles one was the idea. And we didn't well. Because of the discussion there is about the algorithms that are being used and. To provide us what we wanted, so the question is maybe not just. How do we do this, provide tailored information to people but. Should we be doing this, and why should we do it. And then that goes back. To the. To the moral operating system.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;You know.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;simple questions like. iPhone or android. And then. Should we take this guy's data and then what's the moral framework we should use when deciding to take this guy's data. So those are questions that got fewer and fewer responses. So I don't necessarily think there's all. there's enough. Enough why questions asked. Compared to, I think. Mostly in technology they're talking about. As asking and answering how questions. So then. The second video from last day about social. What kind of. connection with. Which What should the platforms, but to the platforms or us in terms of their contributions to the greater good. And I pride in the design. To me, and so that's why I went. shifted the. pride in the aspect of design so it's not just a matter of. To. me it's not just a matter of. Meeting the specifications but. meeting people in a train it to the public good.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;that's okay so basically. What you're getting at is that with our design with the design of these different platforms and technology, this could be a way to contribute to the greater good.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, I understand, thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So just following up on the chat discussions here a little bit. about the cars with their touch screens. I agree that. they're a little bit distracting maybe a lot distracting. And the fact that well. Sometimes I have a cook I hook up my iPhone and. It sometimes says to me that the keyboard is unavailable, which is good when i'm driving. But still I can touch. do a lot of touching and. That sounds funny anyway, I can still i'm still free to touch the screen for other functions like navigation and and music. and I think that people that companies think Oh, I have this ability to touch screen, and so we can create this one piece of for the. Center of the dash that's. That can take on all these functions. and We can just replace it all as one unit if it fails, and so on and so forth. But I mean the question isn't. What kind of design. it's the technology in search of a problem. You know, we don't want to create other ones. So we do. It is to not. it's not just think technology. Is a solution now that's the problem. But rather. To me it's computing as about. How do we augment. people's ability to perform the tasks they want to perform without fundamentally altering the tasks. And I saw the Mercedes. I don't know what car, it was but they're planning a moto with it with a whole dashboard is. The touch this I don't know if it's all touch capable or part of it is just display. That seems. It seems nice if you didn't have to drive as well. stirring the cauldron I talked to like Sam Jackson. expletive deleted expletive deleted. anyway. today. So i'm gonna try a breakout room. And the question around would like you to discuss this. What is their responsibility to design in designing technology for the greater good. That makes sense is that. Open ended enough but specific enough to. Have you go.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;make sense to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. anyone else, like to. So your responsibility as. Computer professionals. As future computer professionals. And we'll discuss the idea of what makes it professional. At other points during this. This semester okay. Okay, so having said that, let me make 2020 groups and we'll take it from there. Okay, so video for about. 10 minutes. Now checking on you and then we'll. Come back to discuss. So there's a. You can continue this discussion on. asynchronously with the our courses forum for breakout discussions. as well. Very good. Okay, here we go opening rooms. And a good discussion.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Have you heard about the Microsoft for some companies are pattern that is some sort of software that will that can use deceased person as a chatbot have you heard about it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you mean to observe provide. Provide companionship from the deceased person.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I don't know the full detail, but the topic is that they'll turn a deceased person has a chat Bot i'm not sure how they're gonna do it, but they'll be patented. And that's.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;patented it yeah. No, I haven't heard some of those details about the patent and so forth. If you have a link please you can. invite you to share that. So did you get put into a room. And, and you left the room.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;room want to be silent, we talked for a while and we run out of ideas, basically.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;um.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, well then, I better.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yep link to the channels.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Other stats something recently played a video game seven bronco December seven I hope people heard about it, so in that game, there was almost the same idea like one of the main characters friend died, and one of the company recreated almost recreated that deceased person. He talks, like the real one, but doesn't have all the functionality like lines are limited, what he can talk about isn't limited but the basic idea is saying and the game is set on a dystopian future.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Okay, so how is that going to go room.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;It was.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;It was good wow okay. So two owners about.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;rate.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;or no time.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I would say a little too long.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;We actually got cut off so.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yeah we kind of ran out of stuff to talk about so yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;OK so i'll make them. i'll be more. Strict with the time then. Okay, so. Anything you want to share with the whole class. In the vein of. responsibilities as professionals to the world to the greater good.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I think we all had the same thinking that filter bubbles should not be there. This was the common point between all of us.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so. So, on what basis do decide to to not provide filter bubbles. Is that.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;The rationale.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;i'm. On the basis of searches.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, no, I don't mean. Technically, how to do it or to not do it, but. But why would you not do it. what's the basis for decision to not do it. Is it a. Is it a practical issue is it a moral issue.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I think it's a model, as well as practical it just limits us.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay anyone else, want to.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;um i'd have to do with. Getting rid of filter bubbles I think it's more of if the consumer doesn't want filter bubbles then you'd have to move over to a platform that doesn't have them rather than limiting them it's not on the choice of. The company i'd say it's more on the choice of the consumer, like if you're against filter bubbles, and you only ever use Facebook, well, I think that's. More or less your point and, if you think you can make something better will amaze will why don't you make a better platform and not include these things.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;What about the like apple and, like the APP stores limiting them, so you can't even buy or can't even use software's without filter bubbles. Because like that's what they did with. parlor.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;don't buy an apple them.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Well, just.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yeah that's fair, that is a fair point but like.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Even know that those things exist.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I think if you take an ECON class it's it's on the onus of the consumer right like.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;A consumer you haven't deployed.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. We kind of discussed that be more optional rather than like whether you wanted or not, which.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like. I feel like i'm platforms should make it's an option issue once it's not I mean.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Have you guys. used to trust or other sites that mostly shows pictures so when you have an account they give you an option, what kind of pictures do like is. zadroga watercolor stuff you if you want, you can create your own filter bubble, if you don't want that you can skip it out.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;When you pick what you are interested in yes.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I don't hold as long to talk about Hollywood and stuff sometimes I want to say about other stuff now if I don't have any food travels i'll get news from around the world, probably not the one i'm currently looking for I need to have that option, at the same time.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so that's what we discussed that to make an option. And also like keeping in like all the. security concerns and everything in my.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;With the filter bubble we're not choosing what. What are the gaps, but if we don't have any filter bubbles it'll be a whole math. i'm complete math there is no order at all.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so filter bubbles I don't care about sports. These are a lot of sites that like basically scan me or something like that they'll never give me sports because they never click on anything about sports they only give me everything instead of what I do enjoy, but I can always look up sports if I truly wanted.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;No.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so let me just make a comment here. So I appreciate the. The discussion. That in terms in terms of. So about the discussion. it's not clear it so if we want to say. pick a platform that has filter bubbles are not filter bubbles are these different things. Then we need to. there's an expectation there's some transparency, but what features exist on the platform. which I don't think we didn't you don't think is. required or. discussed very much at this point. And secondly about our going to run discussions. I think. Since I enjoyed all the conversation, but I think we need to use our. raised their hands from the participants window. or not sure whether it's a blue hand or an emoji for you on your list. Okay, so it looks like it's an emoji for me on this list. So if you'd like to speak, please let me see your hands up and. yeah sure.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so previously, I was thinking that there are mixed opinions about filter bubble so just you know, to get everyone's you should we have all or something like that about whether our platform should have filter bubbles or no. That you can start a poll right now.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I could do a poll I don't like those polls, but. i'll do something in your courses. Okay, so i'll put up a your courses. instrument this afternoon. Okay. So that'd be something to. Attendance was right at the beginning. let's see. So it's after call 45 now. Okay, so I don't want to make a big deal about attendance. alright. So, only one way to indicate participation. And maybe it's. Not a great way. But I will keep an open mind about that. Go ahead yeah sure.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Oh sorry it was from before I didn't do it again.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Okay, so. So the engagement with meetings is just a general asking you to write a response to today's meeting. And the breakout room, you can talk, you can enter something about the discussion from the breakout rooms, if you like. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;i'm sorry, are you referring to the engagement section.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So i'm just looking at the comments here in the chat. The prompt for the discussion is the same every day yeah so that's the engagement with meetings, if you want to talk continue discussion about the breakout room. And there's a forum for that.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Thanks for thanks for clarifying oh you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Have a good weekend and we'll. See you. On Tuesday. Take care everyone.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you bye.
    </li></ul>

    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;haha, nutcracker goes brrt
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;no sound?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;So basically he's talking about intuitive design
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;is it only me tha cant hear?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;no one can hear it
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;its fine
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;read
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think zoom shares audio when you share screen
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;nah but that's ok, I can read :)
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;i think a dangerous design car companies are doing right now is replacing all car dash buttons with a touchscreen
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;it def won't work here in frozen Regina...
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;you can share audio there is an option
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Zoom does share audio, my CS 205 lab instructor shared a video this week and we could hear the Audio as well
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Mercedes just released a model of a 60inch touchscreen as your dashboard...
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Not everybody buy mercedes
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;Zoom doesn’t share computer audio directly. It might be able to be configured for that, but the simple solution is to feedback the audio from the speakers to the microphone. Since Dr. Hepting is using a headset, the speakers can’t pick it up.
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Tesla's always used Digital Dashboards
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;Mercedes 3&gt; lol
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;i know but I don't think I wont want to distract my driving butler...
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;or like any major EV company
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;most of the car companies are going for aesthetics over user-friendly flexibility
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;honestly other than my gf who is saving for a BMW, i don't mind getting second hand cars till the day I die
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;My Mercedes from SGI salvage works just fine
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good, just don't get too distracted by touch screens
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;My McLaren in Forza is also really nice xD
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;lol I used to buy total loss and fixed by myself then you pay a bit for inspection lol
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;can't wait for my Bluetooth seatbelt, however
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;the only time I use Ok google to do stuff for me
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I talk to it like Samuel Jackson
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Say "i'm sorry, I couldn't get that"! Say "i'm sorry, I didn't catch that"! I dare you I double dare you!
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;Our responsibility as programmers or just
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;individuals?
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;Ok thanks
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/microsoft-chatbot-patent-dead-b1789979.html
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I think it went well
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I guess good
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;great isn't alex?
    </li><li><strong>S45:</strong>&nbsp;too long
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;we just got started on AI
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;and how to program them correctly
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;The market will decide, just like Robocop?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;the police ended up privatised?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Don't vote conservative then
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I dont
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;sure but regardless of political stance, im sure no one wants to be too exposed
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;we need some control mekasures
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;*measures
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;For sure and get people in office that would make changes
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;Somebody had mentioned Parler getting taken down, wasn't that because they were literally conspiring murder and domestic terrorism on there?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;If Everclear must exist then let EVERYONE be able to see what is it currently observing
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah because its a right wing terrorist group
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;yup! now they are scrambling to find a website that will support them
    </li><li><strong>S47:</strong>&nbsp;They all went to telegram
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;What about attendance?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;it is done
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;he did it already
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;We did that at the beginning of class
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;Is the prompt for the discussion forum what we discussed in the breakout rooms?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;The prompt for discussion is the same every day, and it's posted underneath the "engagement with meetings" section on URCourses.
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;XD sry not Everclear, Clearview AI
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Everclear is alcohol...
    </li><li><strong>S49:</strong>&nbsp;Is breakout room is optional?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;thank you sir
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you very much!
    </li><li><strong>S49:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;thanks
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
