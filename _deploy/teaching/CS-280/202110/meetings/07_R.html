      Filter bubbles: Positive or Negative?I think filter bubbles have their uses, but they also have some glaring issues. Filter bubbles can offer improved user experience, as information is ‘filtered’ so that users get to see only the content on a website that they enjoy. At the same time, however, filter bubbles cause censorship via omission, where people are not exposed to views alternative to their own. In my opinion, there should be a balance: Users can enable filter bubbles if they like, or disable them if they want a more well-rounded view.URCourses and Zoom and How They Benefit Society During...

      The most reliable way to decide public interest is through the market. I think if we decide public interest before releasing a software or other products to the market, we will hinder innovation and diversity. It is better to release an innovation to the market and let it decide if it is a good product or not unless the product is obviously detrimental to the public. If we allow the entrepreneurs and researchers to decide what is good or not, the public is losing the 3 steps towards empowerment as discussed in the article.I believe computer technologists are no longer...

      I would say Moodle is not the best to work with. URCourses is just a skin on top of Moodle. And Moodle is not pretty beginner user friendly to set up. Especially for a content-rich course like CS280. Organizing this class is tough. Most people are too lazy to check for a different website they would rather have one website to look at the course content instead of two. It’s kind of like a modern website design interface, they don’t want to get overwhelmed by too many things at once.While I do appreciate the effort of making accommodations for the...
    </li><li>
      For this class we did not get into any of the content but more so voted on how the class course could be structured better. this got me thinking that when creating a program for it to be user friendly you can only go so far, there are to many people that could use a system that think differently to please everyone. eventually it gets to a point where it is up to the user to learn and adjust.

      It is important to build self-confidence in life. People are often afraid to do certain things, and we need to overcome that. As a computer student, I think many of us will be a programmer in the future. We may be afraid of our future life now, but we also need to overcome this idea. Confidence is important, and we should also try to help others and build up our confidence. Creativity is very important, but more important than this is our confidence to overcome difficulties

      Zoom and its responsibilities for the "greater good"With the ongoing pandemic the need for virtual communication has become a necessity for the vast majority of us. This is probably the main reason why Zoom has become to ubiquitous and as wide spread as of today. However, while Zoom is a very useful tool for hosting and attending virtual interactionsof any sort, it is also not without its controversy. A quick browse of Zoom's Wikipedia page (while not a perfect source, Wikipedia can provide us a quick outline of the issues) you will find a myriad of issues mostly related to...

      In meeting 7, we are discussing about URcourse and zoom, and we voted for the material and other meeting activities should be posted into URcourse or show us at zoom or both.
    </li><li>
      During the last meeting we discussed about the issues faced by students while accessing UR course.
    </li><li>
      vyomeshI learned many things from the meeting, one of them is people should see the beauty of the objects, the neat and clean design that makes the things more precious which makes you to enjoy. The chapter of fun with little emotion that makes the things much simpler and subtle even if it does not make any sense but still it will make us happy. Happiness makes one to do breadth for search which then helps to do out the box search. I learned that the lack of confidence has done many negative impacts to the people.  People can be...
    </li><li>
      In the class we discuss about how students want to learn and understand the Subject and which way is better, through UR course or zoom platform because students find some difficulties to understand the things what to do or not to so by giving answers of such questions asked by professor and by majority of students opinion some changes are done by professor to help students to understand and learn the subject properly without any difficulty. Our professor understand our problem and help us in every way he can.
    </li><li>
      We all acknowledge that the management of teaching and grading methods plays a vital role in online education, which has been rearranged in today's class, taking into account student views. From it, I noticed that how considering everyone's perspectives leads to the strongest alternative. Discussing those topics in class gives me a deeper idea of the direction that this course is heading in. However, I am quite uncertain about the outline of our course with respect to the specifics of our assignments and projects. But finally, I find this subject very fascinating, so I'm looking forward to learning new stuff...
    </li><li>
      There is some productive discussion regarding the organization of the course content, and I appreciate that Dr. Hepting is willing to listen to our feedback.
    </li><li>
      well in the last meeting we didn't read any topic that is related to our syllabus because the professor gave us some questions in the zoom poll that is related to our course outline means to say he did some updates in the course according to our choices that we given in the form of answers to his questions regarding to course changes as which thing is better for us so that we will not get confused and get the all things done in a right and good way.This is one of the good thing for all of us now...
    </li><li>
      From the last meeting, we have discussed how to improve students' experience of study Asynchronously. And we vote for many ways of scheduling our course, from using urcourse to zoom by using explicit links, how we are going to use the urcourse, and the form of our response for the meeting. It’s really grateful for Dr.Hepting helping put lots of effort on matching students needs with teaching style.From the meeting before the last meeting, we’ve also discussed the sociology term ‘Anomie’. It describes an uprooting or breakdown of any moral values, standards or guidance for individuals to follow. To be...
    </li><li>
      In last class, we didn't had a discussion on some specific topic but students got a clear view of the operation of the class. Doubts were cleared and I think every student apprecitated the hardwork done by professor to make things clear to the students.
    </li><li>
      First of all, thank you very much for putting the links of each meeting on UR courses it helps us to find everything quickly.Talking about the content of meeting 7, I really like the video about bad doors got some more idea about the design in the everyday life.But if I talk about veil of ignorance after watching and looking the video I am still struggling what exactly it means if you can discuss on that in next class that would be great!Thank you
    </li><li>
      Well unless i am not confused did not learn a lot but it was mostly a trobleshooting class trying to figure things out
    </li><li>
      Much of the discussion in the last class revolved around our feelings about how information is presented in this course, and what interfaces should be used to share that information. While our current condition of attending school remotely is a unique and unusual set of circumstances, the challenges of managing information flow seem to me to have grown in general in the last 15 years. At one of my previous jobs we grappled with issues of how to best communicate by e-mail - management wanted employees to have access to as much information as possible, which was an admirable goal,...
    </li><li>
      The Veil of Ignorance presented by Rawls is a very unique concept in that it exposes the true plight of the bias of social construct. That is, how can multiple different individuals coming from almost cosmically different backgrounds propose and unify under a social order or construct to govern how everything from trade to transparency should occur. Therefore, Rawls presents us with the idea that the social construct can be defined under two main principals, equal opportunity and maximizing the liberty enjoyed by the people. I believe that is level of fairness is well at play in today’s world, however...
    </li><li>
      "Norman Doors"I found the idea behind so called "norman doors" interesting enough, but like with most things I think there are two sides to this concept. From what I gathered in the clip (may or may not be the full story) Norman seems to emphasize simplicity as the key to great design. He claims one should not need a sign, directions or instructions to operate whatever it is you could operate, be it techology or something as simple as doors. The opposite of simplicity of course is complexity, but with complexity also comes options and flexibility. Mac vs. Linux is...
    </li><li>
      We discussed what improvements could be made to our course description during the last lecture. Therefore, during class time, several polls were generated so that everyone can give their personal opinion according to our choice. In consideration of these points of view, the professor has updated our homepage of CS 280 urcourses, which was intended to benefit students.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed about the way of using and accessing ur corses links and all material. The class discussion and polls were really helpful in solving the inconvenience that almost everyone faced while using cs 280 material and videos’ links. I found the new setting quit easy than the last one. That is really appreciated , thanks to professor.
    </li><li>
      Last meeting discussions and votes really solved the issue of accessing the cs 280 course material. Firstly, it was confusing to find one specific material link or video on the website. A big thanks to professor, for helping all students by discussing with them and changing the access pattern. It is far better and easy to use cs 280 course platform, now.
    </li><li>
      After watching the video “It's not you. Bad doors are everywhere” I learned how good designs are important. I also learned about Norman door. A Norman door is a design where it tells you to the opposite of what you actually supposed to do, or it gives wrong options and needs a sign to correct it. There is also basic principle of good design such as discoverability and feedback. For making a good design we need to go through some steps such as observations, idea, prototype, and testing.
    </li><li>
      For the last meeting I learned about design, what makes a good design, and what might make bad design. For example, discoverability is important in design. It should be clear the operations one can do by looking at the object in question. Discoverability is interesting to think about and is one of the main reasons, I believe younger generations are often times better with new technology. I feel as though many of the older generations do not want to try and discover what they can do on technology in fear of "messing something up". Meanwhile, it feels like newer generations...
    </li><li>
      This meeting was a kind of problem solving session of sorts for the UR courses website and the course content. The students had issues with the accessibility of the content on the professors website. The professor heard all the issues patiently and tried his best to accommodate all the requests. There wasn't much discussion about anything related to the course, however retrospectively, this was a good example for the role that designing of a product plays into its use and eventual acceptance by the consumer.
    </li><li>
      What you would like to know more about?I guess with the popular social medias these day, how we can apply what we've learned regarding filter bubbles in these platforms?what you would like to know more aboutHow to better apply discoverability &amp; feedback -&gt; human centered design on softwares.
    </li><li>
      The things I learned from the video ‘It's not you. Bad doors are everywhere’ by Joe Posner and Roman Mars is about designs, how one can make good design and how important it is. Bad and good designs are everywhere but by following the simple process such as observations, idea, prototype, testing and going over them again and again can make the design better. I also learned about Norman door; A Norman door is a design where it shows you the opposite of what you suppose to do. It was a good video.
    </li><li>
      I really liked the veil of ignorance video, especially in light of the ongoing farmer's protest in India.I found these statements from the video extremely insightful:"According to the liberty principle, the social contract should try to ensure that everyone enjoys the maximum liberty possible without intruding upon the freedom of others.According to the difference principle, the social contract should guarantee that everyone has an equal opportunity to prosper. In other words, if there are any social or economic differences in the social contract, they should help those who are the worst off. And, any advantages in the contract should be...
    </li><li>
      in the lactures we did few polls regarding the meeting responses, and the content on your personal website rather than on ur courses, in this case i personally wanted to say that it is not that hard to navigate and it is just more work to post the same thing on the urcourses, then we discuss about the group prject upto 5 people and the deadline, and a good news for me that there will be no midterm.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we mostly discussed about the look of the UR courses. I think the professor has done really well changing what he can. so, I think we should focus more on the content of this course rather than telling him what to change.I had missed writing about meeting 6 so I will write about that in this one - I agree with the video that bad doors exist everywhere and so we should come up with a general idea of designing basic things. A bit confused about how the concepts that we go through in every class are...
    </li><li>
      In this past class we we mostly just discussed the format of the class. So instead I am just going to pontificate about the accessibility and usability of everyday things. In the video about bad design there are many things that I had not really considered, although have surely been tripped up by at some point. Besides the obvious like what the video talked about with the doors one of my favorite things that is very commonplace is automatic doors, which have that little sticker warning that it is an automatic door, and to be cautious, however if you read...
    </li><li>
      In last lecture, Dr. Hepting created lots of polls on Zoom. The whole lecture was discussion about Engagement forums, Study material and so on. Like what material should be needed to post on Urcourses!! Let's see what we study in next lecture.
    </li><li>
      the last meeting was all about modifications to be done in ur courses in order to make it more beneficial and resourceful for students. In the last, we discussed the details regarding the assignments.
    </li><li>
      We Discussed about how we should going futher in the course use UR courses for studing material related to the subject and we also discussed about the assignment 1 about the marking scheme and how to present the assignment.

      In the video, It's not you, bad doors are everywhere discusses that Don Norman actually complained about door more than 25 years ago. Gates shouldn't even need instructions – the structure of a door can direct users through it just great. Then why do so many doors require instruction manuals on the side of them? When most people were complaining about something, none of it is going to occur. Don Norman is not the majority of people, he's a psychologist and cognitive scientist. Don Norman realized about it, and published so extraordinarily thoroughly regarding his concerns that he transformed the...

      In the last meeting we just discussed about where to post the content of the lecture. By answering the polls we find the ur courses more useful to share the lecture material.
    </li><li>
      I think the confusion when the UR course is related to the topic of design. We are used to the design of the normal class which hold in-person meetings. We are used to getting most of the information in person, and the structure of put everything in UR crouse can be hard to track. The hundreds of emails that we get after someone make a post is also a sign of bad design.
    </li><li>
      Veil of ignorance is important because no one knows who they are because of their hidden characters and it’s important for impartial ideals. Moreover, helps are survey more ideal like equality , justice etc in a better form
    </li><li>
      In the 7th meeting we discussed about posting the material on UR Courses or on your website. The polling done by people showed that they are facing so many issues while accessing the material and posting their responses to something like "filter bubble feedback".
    </li><li>
      The last meeting discussed about the modifications or changes to be made on UR courses to make it more user friendly. For that reason we did quit some polls on zoom. The discussion was about the changes to be made on the website regarding the forums and study material.I missed meeting 6 so here goes.The video, Its not you, Bad doors are everywhere discusses about the weird and not at all talked about experiences we have in our day to day life with some doors. The video says its not your fault but the design isn't right. The design should...

      In the video, accessibility is called discoverability. When people see the product, they should find out what they can do. Usability refers to whether the product is easy to use, whether the user can complete the task, how efficient it is, and the user's subjective feeling during the process, which is the product's quality from the user's point of view. In the video, Usability is called feedback. These two elements constitute the principle of human-centered design. Moreover, we look at the world, and we come up with ideas. Then, people are thinking of solutions and testing them. This process has...

      Just glad that professor is putting so many efforts so that we could find things easily. Watched videos of bad door and veil of ignorance. I really liked the concept that if it do a particular thing without realizing that you did it than that is what called a perfect or convenient design. So would like to see these concepts through more practical examples. And the second video is the reality or the balanced rules how to improve without harming or degrading others. I would love to explore or relate this concept in terms of computer field
    </li><li>
      accessibility and usability-&gt; Accessibility is making a design that is convenient to all the audience and usability is how one feels about the task after it is done.when is a "why" sufficient to implement the "how"?From the TED video by Dr. Norman, one can learn that making a design such a way that user feels obvious of the instinct it has on the mind, will resolve the problem of "why" and "how". In the TED video it is well explained by the reference of badly designed door.

      The responsibility of me as a computer programmer for greater good is to keep a person's privacy in consideration at all means and provide the user an option or right to choose between what they want and what not. The data used or method used to provide service to the user should be partially shown to them. This will make the Internet a little bit more ethical.
    </li><li>
      Accessibility means that information should be allowed to each platform, and it should not be limited to anyone because, with it, the world can solve complex problems. Usability means that if people have any information, then how to use it. The communication should not be limited to one platform because things get easy when someone properly put them for many people , and you put it in a way so that who needs it can use it.
    </li><li>
      Meeting 7 summary helps to understand how a good design promotes accessibility and usability. A good design would be usable by as many users as possible, it would not be too complex to understand . Good design also helps to provide equal access to people with disabiliities. Also, a good design would help its users to complete their tasks efficiently and efficiently.

      A portion of this class was focused on making the course content easier to navigate. I appreciate the effort that has gone into the website and understand that it was due to issues with an older version of the site.I wanted to voice some thoughts about what could potentially make navigation of the course easier. From personal experience, the most organized and navigatable system is to divide URCourses into a header for each week. The header for each week would include required and additional readings, assignment submission portals with due-dates, and forum boards. These listings would be sorted in chronological...

      I already knew about Rawl's Veil of Ignorance and felt that it was already a good philosophical rule to live by when thinking about how to treat others. I also think it's a good general rule for creating a better world and even helps with creating government policy. I haven't really connected it to designing and innovation though until now.In the video, the man describes how when travelling to the UK, he struggled to use their basic appliances. This is connected to Rawl, as when we design things, it's important not just to solve whatever task that thing accomplishes, but...

      From the previous class, I still wish to know more about filter bubblesAt a point I became confused on if filter bubbles is idea or notPlease I seek for more information
    </li><li>
      What I learned from this meeting are the differences in terms of education and delivery of lectures, and I, on my personal side, believe that the method of delivering the lecture must be as it was in the way the professor was planning for it by the professor. I understand the differences between the delivery of information through the personal website and the urcourses, and I do not see any many differences in this way.
    </li><li>
      At the last meeting, we discussed the application of URcourse. For the application of URcourse, I don't have much opinion on it. The video for this lesson is about the Norman Gate. The video explains how to use computer science to solve detailed problems in life. Sliding doors are a good example. Computer science can better improve the details of society.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we came to know about the features of UR courses and also about accessing the course material of this subject which is CS 280. We also did attempted some polls and that polls help our professor to improve the homepage for CS 280
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the professor had tried his best to make us understand about how to use website.
    </li><li>
      This week, I was most intrigued by David Kelley's talk titled "How to Build Your Creative Confidence." Kelley explains how we can use a step-by-step approach to ease people into activities or learning skills that they are unfamiliar with. By slowly exposing people to new experiences, thus building up their comfort level, people can develop confidence in overcoming former anxiety-inducing tasks. This process is important, because it reveals that people are not born creative or not creative, skilled or unskilled. Rather, mastery of a skill is the direct outcome of practice and perseverance.I can relate this to my own experience...

      Id like to say just how irritating it is when the instruction aren't clear, the world should be simple or made simple and yet there are always things like the doors. My goal is too keep things simple, easy, and make peoples life easier, but looking at some things i just question why is it like that and why cant they just make it simple. I hope to learn the best and simplest as well as the cleanest way to write my code in CS and being able to pass that code on is a life long goal that i...

      Zoom and UR courses are two programs that assist in advancing the greater good by enabling students to have easy access to educational material, and with zoom in particular, helping to enable a large portion of the workforce to stay at home during a global pandemic, helping to delay the spread of this virus. While Zoom's privacy policies can be dubious at best, and with the data breach that occurred back in 2020, the software does still provide the greater good.Regarding UR courses specifically, online resources for learning is great in lowering the barrier to entry for higher education, enabling...

      The video "bad doors are everywhere" metaphorize closely with the computer world. It gives an important context about how designs are important for a particular platform.For example: I assume, in last lecture, we were insisting the professor to redesign the UR course tab to see a particular feed easily. This might make our complications a bit easier.
    </li><li>
      well in the last zoom meeting, it is mostly about the ur courses and it was the discussion about some problems faced by the students to access it. I really appreciating the hard work and time given by the professor to those things. Also, we voted for some things. Basically, it was not related to our syllabus but its helpful.
    </li><li>
      It is very interesting to know that there is a terminology called Norman door which indicates the door design such that it goes against the norm. For example, A door with a vertical handle that needs to be pushed open is defined as a Norman door. In my opinion, this concept can be widely applied to computer science and engineering to describe unusual designs. However, a common known principle human-center design that consists of observation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing is used to improve bad designs and solve more difficult problems. From my experience in programming, the Norman door is...
    </li><li>
      I learned about how bad doors can affect you. The norman door where the design tells us you to do opposite of what you are actually supposed to do. I think the doors should be simple and easy to use instead of seeing the signs or thinking about which side should i open the door. If we have a handel we should pull the door and if not we have to push it. It should be this simple rather then being complex. We should not make it complex because doors should not be in our problem list at all.
    </li><li>
      In the last class I enjoyed that you took time to listen to our different suggestions concerning aspects of the class and allowed us to decide a way forward through the poll results
    </li><li>
      In the last I enjoyed how we were able to come to certain conclusions from the suggestions and through the results from the results. Hopefully this will better the learning experience for some students as well.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we all discussed about the platform which is best for the reply than i would like to stick with the ur course because it helps student in improving engagement with the professor and the stuff. One more important point was made in yesterday class which was that student left meeting after attendance or they only come in meeting for attendance than you can also make it mandatory for the student to turn on the camera and it will also be nice in the virtual room to give it the vibe of real classroom. From the lecture...

      From Don Norman I learned about concepts of human-centered design such as discoverability and feedback. These concepts are very important for designing things in computer science so that software and hardware is intuitive to use for most users without needing tons of documentation, and so that users get direct feedback for their actions showing them what has happened. Utilizing these concepts can help make using computers much easier and less frustrating, especially for less technologically-knowledgeable people.

      Each time we click, watch, offer, or remark, web crawlers and social stages reap data. Specifically, this data serves to produce focused on notices. The vast majority of us have encountered the odd impression of history repeating itself as an item we investigated online out of nowhere shows up wherever we go on the web, just as in our email inboxes. Frequently this publicizing proceeds until we capitulate and buy the item.Directed commercials can assist us with finding what we need easily, however costs exist.The web has changed an extraordinary arrangement from the good 'ol days, when individuals stressed over...

      I think we the most important thing we learned in this meeting was that how to design/implement something.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 7, I have learned about "improve". Human is inventing and improving since the earth have human culture. From stone Axe to mental Axe, from copper sword to alloy sword. Things are changing their material to upgrade their power with keeping their original design. And everything are being human center; Hilt for protect users hand.
    </li><li>
      First of all I really appreciate Dr. Hepting accommodating all the problems brought forth to him for this course. I think UR courses is a great learning environment for students. Although, it can be a bit confusing to navigate within folders and following links in it. As a computer professional I think the simplicity of the UI is critical - the iOS is a great example of an incredible OS with a minimalistic/simple feel and solid functionality. Sometimes it can be cumbersome to navigate through several links to get to the area desired.
    </li><li>
      For the past meeting, you have talked all about URCourse and the CS280's website. Some students found that they were in trouble when finding stuffs for engaging meetings on your website and they asked you to redesign whole things. I was very appreciated how you were trying to how to meet their demands. However, in my opinion, I am fine with all of this. I just need to spend little time to figure out all things, and all things are understandable. Moreover, students need to change their style of study in order to match their professor. Basically, most of professors...

      I find it hard to believe that people poorly design things on purpose. Even encountering these things semi daily basis. Something so simple as a door with the wrong sign or wrong handle. If my office building had anything like that I would want it changed so that it makes sense. Are people just complacent and allow them to stay? Which would beg the question why aren't these obvious flaws being changed and fixed.
    </li><li>
      Thanks for all the changes you made to better the changes you made for the class. Can you explain the assignment further?
    </li><li>
      Even networks plays and important role in security Network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources, but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats
    </li><li>
      during the breakout section, we discussed about the core responsibilities of the future generation programmers. The main topic of discussion was the privacy concerns and the creation of websites as per the needs of elderly people, who have no or minor knowledge about technology.
    </li><li>
      The class was about improving the ways to interact in class and betterment of using UR courses and website. The usage of polls and zoom sessions
