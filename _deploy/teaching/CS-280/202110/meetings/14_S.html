<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Hello. Well, just as as. I was late because my cat ran to the room here and. I was not trustworthy of his motives, so it has a good amount of the room lock them out. And then. it's a connecting connecting connecting connecting and I knew it wasn't going to connect. And then I had some problems rebooting. So it's been quite a good morning already. Thanks for sticking around. So did anyone see my post to the forum about technical difficulties.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I had some technical difficulties, putting that out as well, anyway. Never a dull moment. So how is everyone today.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Good good.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;cannot complain at all.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Not at all wow i'm really happy to hear that. do some more coffee, yes, I agree with that. Coffee is never a bad idea, I think. So let me. Do our attendance here well. So a connection. To login again. Or do I. One place told me I had an invalid session key. And then I went to a different screen or I want us. to access the attendance that's letting me work so. not sure about that. i'm happy I didn't have to login again but i'm not happy that I didn't have to log in again because i'm likely. On borrowed credentials here. Let me share the screen, so you can. see if you can beat me and copying it. From here to the chat. so slow there by having to select. A direct message and send it back to everyone. That was slow because and i'm 55 couldn't be 56 so. knock on wood. All goes to plan i'll be 56 by the end of the Semester. So my birthday is on April 17 so that's. that's a Saturday. This year. yeah like being married my wife and I are both areas and sometimes that's. that's not a good combination, but. again. anyway. I was born in Chinese calendar, I did at one point.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;I have to look into it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Anyway, okay glad we could have some quality time there. Alright, so attendances handled. Okay, so let me show you the changes I made to the project proposal see if they meet your. approval. Okay, so can be done, individually or in a small group of up to five. If you choose to work in a group list all the. So if you choose to work in a group list all the members of the group, on the proposal so that. Project group can be created for you. well. As I discuss late, the other day it's see i'll be put into the same project group, because at this moment you're all in your own project groups. anyway. So there's five of you only one copy needs to be submitted. trust that the system will work. So, if your project changes after proposal submitted, please keep me informed. and keep in mind that the goal that proposes for you to do some planning, so the changes will be necessary. me choose what you will do with for the project, it almost feels class themes in some way, and I am open to your ideas about how to how you will do it your options include but are not limited to. So I moved the list so I should have made that line as well. Let me fix that right away. So, on the first first page. You say project proposal. group or if it's an individual put your name and if it's more than one person in your group. and put all the names of the people in your group. Okay, so just so it's clearly identified at the top. So. i'm editing the website with Adam. And when I release when I reboot my computer which i've had to do a few times lately. Adam doesn't start properly. I wonder why that is. Anyway, so i'm just starting it again now. So i've heard people say nice things about vs code. Well, that i've looked at a little bit, and I was having problems. Getting some things set up but we're gonna take another look at it. Now I like Adam. As much as I use it. But like I said i'm open to new things. We still not still capable of learning new tricks. me see if that's. checking to see whether. jacqueline's running in the background. Okay, so here i've changed at the same so you can put into the project together, only one cognitive repurposing needs to be submitted. me choose what you will do for the project, unless you have class things in some way and i'm open charities or how to do it. contents and foreign either proposal to match the River colonias appalling headings topic describe your topic and how it relates to class, so I have a link to the list of topics and learning outcomes. For the Semester, which may be of help to choose a topic that's new to you, but you haven't done your blog entry. The general topic is similar please indicate how you're treated differently, such as from a different perspective. So you might. tackle the same general heading general topic knowledge unit sort of speak sorry. we're going to try to talk to you quickly now to make up for time. Anyway, it's interesting to see what comes out in the transcript on him. I have to look at some of these words and think what was I trying to say and some of them are. Are guessable but others are. rude require trip back to the audio recording to see it listen to it again, I think. Anyway, so the general topic is similar please indicate how you'll treat it differently, such as it from a different perspective or. I hope that's clear enough. So, then, the deliverable and the rationale choose the form in which you deliver your project your options include but are not limited to. So you can do a research paper a book review Wikipedia article committed create and promote some online content. Video. and video doesn't have to be a live action shot, it could be a recording or presentation with narration can be a podcast or blog. picture yourself as a computing professional identify and discuss role models for your life as a competing professional. discuss contributions you've made to an open source project such as on github, for example. write some code to test, an idea. And also explain why you are choosing it. I can probably make that a little more clear, let me try that quickly. lost focus on my text editor. Okay, so I said also explain why you're choosing that particular deliverable. it's not a big improvement but small and perhaps. And then tentative plan provide a clan of some milestones realizing your chosen deliverable. This plan may look like an outline of what you plan to. include you're doing this with a group make clear how each Member will participate in the final deliverable. So it doesn't have to be two pages long. I didn't give a word count. So if you have a group, then you might use extra space to. you're doing it individually, you might be able to fit onto one page and if you're doing a group, you might need two pages to describe how you envision everyone working together. To complete the deliverable. So that makes sense. Okay. right then. So I wanted to touch on embassy today. And I wanted to also show you the empathy map assignment. So you can let me know what you think what needs to be clarified, and so on. So I suppose the describe the steps. should be under the list of what you're asked to do. So let me change that quickly. let's see if we can do it quickly. So in hindsight, I realized. That my zoom was having problems yesterday, or it may have been my zoom and problems yesterday, if someone tried to connect to me during my office hour, and it would just it just tongue there connecting to audio for several minutes and I tried. I tried to. connect communicate with the students in other ways, but I didn't. Use I had not sufficient. So, if it was you. say it was Jason. Here and trying to get Ahold of me in office hours yesterday. And I apologize, it was my assume that was acting up, I can think.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;and
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I hope I can. answer your question. Perhaps today at 330 is another office hour. And if not by email or. message for. discussions. Okay, so it seems like forever ago but the beginning of the semester we talked about proctor track. And lots of. unkind things are said about proctor track. So we're not going to this is not indication that we're going to use proctor track. For the final exam. Because we're not. However. i'd like you to. go through the process of onboarding. And then. Think about the activity. So describe the steps you take to underperform the proctor track onboarding examine onboarding and practice rock onboarding and practice exam. Well, I don't know what i'm going to ask for the final exam. So, still a bit early. I have to. I have to. go over some good topics. yeah Okay, so we could have some fun with talking about. What could be on the final does anyone know what could be on the final well I probably have a better idea than most people. So the i'll say that it won't be something that it's that's. outside the context of our discussions. In the topics we've considered in class in our meetings. It looks like too many zeros on that se. So it'd be something. i'm leaning towards a take home exam kind of structure. Where there'll be a choice of. you'll you'll be given a choice have. You heard me you won't be given a choice you'll be given. A topic from a set of topics, so not everybody will see the same topic or topics. And then you'll be given some time to write. An article or an NSA about that topic. Okay, so I didn't see what Dane said, to begin with. yeah so the exam is. 20th 20. Thinking it's a 20th I could be wrong. Anyway, yes that's off topic. So what I. What I want. This idea to this assignment to focus on is. Looking at. developing our skill for empathy. Which is a coin to that Roundtable I can't quite a lot is in terms of a soft skill that's important for computer professionals to have. So an empathy map looks like this, I think this is the right link to it. Okay. Just an article called empathy mapping, but it has a. there's an illustration here, so an empathy map, according to this. Article, that is the definition it's a collaborative visualization us to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. It externalize is knowledge about users in order to create a shared understanding of user needs and to aid and decision making. Okay, so you're going to be doing an empathy map for yourself. So here's what an empathy map looks like. So it doesn't have to be a square with four squares. can be rectangle there's four quadrants and we think about what the user. says thanks does and feels. Well, completing the task. Or the activity. So. We can, maybe say think about these these four categories Category four types of or the four quadrants in terms of. do the same and different. So if we ask the person. To speak to talk about their experience as you're doing it. So we can we can get. Information, we can quote the user. By asking them questions and ask them to think aloud when they're working through the activity. So they might say this is. This is clear, this is not very clear. This is. frustrating, what do I do now. Those kinds of things might be said. By the user. And then, what the user does, we can observe what the user does. So that's somewhat straightforward. move that's the most straightforward. However. Well, so if we're talking about a user other than ourselves. asking them to speak aloud during an activity. or ask them questions is maybe not very natural for them so they will. They might say some things that are different. Then what they would. Be might come up with. A different explanation. And the does because they're under observation. They may be. Somewhat self conscious about. performing an activity with someone else there. or. Whether they're being recorded well performing the activity. But it's still. These are still some. This is still reasonably better sources of information than for us to guess what the user wants. or think about the poor user has to do these things. If we can get some things that are. or. Even coming directly from the user, however filtered they might be it's a benefit. And then thanks and feels. Those are a little bit more. difficult to find it. So the fields. it's more about user. Experience or the emotional. So here i'm going to switch to the text. So the thinks quadrant captures of what the users thinking through the experience ask yourself from the qualitative research gathered what occupies users thoughts. What matters to the users, a possible to have so it's possible how the same content and says, and thanks, however. A special attention to what the users think that may not be willing to vocalize try to understand why they're reluctant to share they unsure self conscious polite or afraid to tell others something. The fields quadrant is the emotional state often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself what where is the user, what does the user get excited about how does user feel about the experience. impatient pages low to slowly confused too many contradictory prices worried, they are doing something wrong. So here's a sample empathy map. If we're going through the activity of buying a TV. The the person may say where should I start. What size best I want sending reliable. I was expecting something different. Thanks and we're wasting too much time what else, am I missing. I want something awesome too many acronyms. Why is this so hard. And under what they do check the web, a web site. make small decisions postpone big decisions observes and store asks friends. Listen list pros and cons compares products. and feel overwhelmed excited unsure who to trust anxious inadequate fear. Okay, does that make sense. I would say we don't need to include the goals at the bottom. Is in this example.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;So is this assignment like imagine if you were in their shoes sort of anger.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;well. I want you to do it for yourself, but this is just i'm just sort of outlining the process.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;gotcha you can. If you, you can construct empathy maps for other people doing an activity. In that case, you would. You would have to rely on other data that you've collected. You wouldn't be able to. get exactly what they feel or think. I mean you can observe it, you can record what they say and what they do. But you'd have to. do some work to in empathizing with them. You know, putting walking a mile in their shoes, so to speak. From all the other information you've collected to you, you would. Get you make. guesses about informed guesses about what they think and feel while completing an activity. make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;And then the third part of. This is when you've. gone through the process. Some of you may have already gone through the process of onboarding and doing the practice exam. When you've gone through the process, you can look at what you've observed about yourself. And then think about. areas or opportunities to redesign our improvement of the process. In the interface and. You know, to say. If there's a particular thing that made you nervous about. If the concern is about privacy is there a particular thing that makes you nervous. And could that be improved, for example, could that be restated. can be made more clear that the data is not store is stored in Canada. And that nothing is. nothing, nothing is capped. for purposes other than verifying your exam participation. And so on right So how could we. How could we improve the onboarding process. that's the last part about the opportunity to redesign. seem okay. And as far as i'm concerned that you know if we can. If there are questions or concerns about this. Over the next while we can. We can clarify things. as well. not opposed to doing that either. So there's a related article sympathy versus empathy and user experience. So rather than. know I feel like we've talked about this a little bit. That we have sympathy for the poor user. And we're going to do the user favor because they're so hard done by. So that's using simple that's using having sympathy for the user versus empathy is. Understanding their position and what. And how they perceive. Things so it's not looking trying to look at the problem from the perspective of the user and not just. look at it from the outside. So I invite you to look at that article as well. For today. I apologize for my. system problems. Then again, if you try to get me with an office hours. Let me know i'm trying to keep keep track of all the different. ways to keep in touch. But my my intention is to is to be available for questions and so on, so i'm not trying to hide out. Okay, so have a great weekend. and enjoy the sun. Take care and stay well. And i'll see you on Tuesday okay.
