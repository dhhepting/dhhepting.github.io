<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning, everyone. doing today. See. This nicely being an old older person. I was able to go get my. astro Seneca shot yesterday at the drive through. very smoothly. And not too much worse for the worse for wear after getting the. Progress is being made. talking with. The keeps people. to having a. An employer perspective on professionalism. And so we're still i'm still working on that and know where three meetings left after today. But we'll. See you later. Let me. share my screen here. And then we can go from there. Students getting having problems logging into your courses is this just today. Or is it, then a persistent problem. Okay well. Today, only for. Doing attendance and. I mean. I know everyone's keen to get. Every opportunity to. get a fraction even a fraction of a mark so. Cry again during later on during the session. i'm still logged in I don't think that I get any privileges. Let me put. The chat. Sure i'll try and sign out and sign back in again. Consistent so. and hopefully that's. helpful to somebody. for fun let's try this more about this error message. That article usually they're. Clear. Article. Because it's got some. details. Because my miss configuration of server. server name or bind the end. The session can be a tricky one if you held up for your all your authentication once. This error, as you may not be able to log into moodle or fix it fix. The entries. and need to be checked change in cases where can we find a database table. We will configure plugins for the. plugin. So i'm quite impressed by this article. i'm not sure why it's still called a Stub. Okay, so, judging from comments last day. The idea of. Having a code, the code of ethics. cover. And then the mainstream was. was a positive thing in terms of defining. behavioral norms for competing professionals. So let's have a discussion about the final exam. This is a popular topic in the chat. My feeling is. exam. and plug style writing of. An issue. discussed in class. And people would get different issues, different questions. have to check on. requirements and regulations, but. i've heard people talk about 24 hours. Maybe we can do that longer. Of. The time that the question for be receiving a question. or to the time of submission. So the final exam is scheduled for.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;it's scheduled for the 20th of April at 2pm.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So that would be the. submission time would be. On the 20th exam question prevailed on the 19th. You have 24 hours submitted. Oh i'll check on that and I can report. definitively on Thursday.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Would I be okay to assume that you know we're allowed to type your answers as well, like like we've been doing them for all the blogs, and the assignments.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. help with legibility certainly. and don't go. turn it in. OK so. The details on Thursday how's that.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;For the final i'm happy to receive them. So, the reason I. Have a code of ethics here is. we're going to talk with electro property or intellectual works. A little bit, but I also thought about the. usability. That was. looking for. usability usability so design and implement systems that are busty and usability secure. listed under professional responsibilities. 2.2 point nine. understand. So, based on the understanding that the public good, is always the primary consideration. Even though the public good, is not easily defined sometimes. Each principle, supplemented by guidelines which provide explanations to assist to being professionals and understanding and applying the principle. So that would be a good. guideline for air understandable error messages and documentation. So that would help and understanding and. So, not so much jargon, but. But some explanation of the jargon better yet if there's no jargon at all and just plain explanations. So here's understanding that the public good to see paramount consideration. again. So is related to privacy they're competing professional should become conversant in the various definitions of forms of privacy to understand the rights and responsibilities associated with a collection use of personal information. not sure what's going on clicking not moving in the text. awareness and understanding of computing related to technologies. And the consequences. that's a good principle. We should. Be ambassadors for computing. And I guess thats related to see. Something in the chat here. that's stories from yesterday let's take a peek. So that's an interesting. question. here's an interesting piece an oral arguments October Oracle said that google's conduct left unchecked would ruin the software industry by making it so developers could not be rewarded for their work when others use their code. Google, are you vaccinate. Australia soccer industry by erecting enormous copyright hurdles for developers and forcing them either to reinvent the wheel. After they wanted to instruct the Community something okay licensing fees to the most dominant software companies for the right to carry out simple mundane tasks. I know there's something related to that in the code of ethics. finished going. Through understand. Understanding. The context. modifying are retiring systems. might be some features and they all systems that are important and rely upon. So here's The thing that.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Is.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;relevant to the supreme court case in the States. respect the work required to produce new ideas inventions creative works and competing artifacts. developing new ideas inventions creative works and computing artifacts creates value for society and those expend a separate should expect to gain value from their work. confessional should therefore credit, the creators of ideas inventions works and artifacts and restrict copyrights. and trade secrets license agreements and other methods of protecting authors works. of customer unlock recognize some exceptions to creators control of work are necessary for the public good. computing professional should not unduly opposed reasonable uses of their intellectual works efforts to help others by contributing time and energy to projects that help society such. Pardon me illustrate a positive aspect of this principle such efforts include free and open source software. and work put into the public domain computing professionals should not claim private ownership of ship of work, they are others have shared is it up. and share its public resources. And I cook reading of the. decision. It seems like. Respect for trade secrets and enter to actual property. intellectual work. Well, the question is. So. If we should respect copyrights pens trade secrets license agreements not protecting office works. So. What. mechanisms are appropriate for acknowledging the work of others. This is enough to be cited as Yasser. So copyrights. discussed in this case, what about patents. So why don't we take 10 minutes to do a breakout room discussion about. This one point, this principle 1.5. as it relates to the Supreme Court case ruling that we just examined. Any ideas. That you'd like to share.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay yeah well, I think, for, like us, we really discussed like like. To like make a more informed decision, we would like to like know what code they kind of use like like from what i've read and understood was. Oracle sued Google over code that was under free years which. it's free years. Which is really silly to me that they bother like like it seems more like nowadays people don't understand what free uses and stuff like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Now. be widely used the same time. shouldn't be acknowledged. And Oracle being credited with. With the code.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Oh.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;And there was just a couple things I want my group discussed. first thing is part of the issue regarding court cases like this is that, in order to know where the line for copyrights and the legality is drawn you need to have a decent level of knowledge regarding the subject. and also the other thing is isn't android the operating system that's google's being sued over isn't that based on Linux, which is already open source software.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;well. Today, for Java Java language application interface that goes directly to my son. And it was later acquired by Oracle so Google actually paid turn around 30 to $50 billion for the rights to. use that Java application interface to develop android much later on Oracle acquired son. So, then, the conflict, our eyes. like Google continue their us. without paying over a cold and Google flame that they already paid son door it not narrow purse of ciao.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. This is a big was a big company until it stopped being. Until it's bought out by Oracle and. disappeared. How many people remember sun Microsystems.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;All I know is that they developed the challenge and great your end.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. yeah their computers as well. what's the connection between minecraft sun Microsystems.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;minecraft is written in Java and so you have to install the Java runtime environment to use minecraft.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Okay, so copyright. yeah. There are some details about.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;It.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;mechanisms to. To honor intellectual work. That are complicated but. Should we have. The idea of protections for different. works. So i'm not sure that she is as a whole, operates in an open source concept, because. Software patents are. are an important. piece, for some people. In terms of. opens so programming languages. being open source, so they. Have uniformity, but then we also have to make sure that there's. consistency and transparency. standards. c++. is maybe. seen as a language that. Growing to be off, not all things necessarily many things to many people. At a time here any final thoughts. We can we'll continue this. next day. Okay, so everyone have a good day take care stay well and we'll see you on Thursday.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Professor.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;What time are your office hours. Sorry at 233 3330 Okay, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;And then 1230 to 230 tomorrow.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thank you very much.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;bye.

    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;So we will have 3hours?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;So the exam will start on april 19 at 5pm?

    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Yes Thank you
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;So we will have to just write one blog like the class assignments?
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;I like this idea for the final
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;yes Brandon, that is what we were doing all semester as well.
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah, I'm just saying that it is a really good alternative.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;awesome
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/05/tech/google-oracle-supreme-court-ruling/index.html
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Kind of related in the aspect of reusing code for something it was intended for.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;why was it 6-2?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;There are 9 justices
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;8 maids a milking...
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;7 swans a swimming...
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I would assume one didn't vote
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Honestly not even sure, cnn is probably not the best reference article, just thought it was interesting and somewhat related to the course.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Oh it is but why didn't Amy Coney Barrett participate
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Here is a worse scandal
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/matt-gaetz-defends-lone-no-vote-on-anti-human-trafficking-bill/ar-BB1f8CTW
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;In my opinion that would depend on economic profit
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;If they use your work and make money you should be paid
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;It would also greatly reduce reusability to counter ^
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;or at the very least credited
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;mayhaps have some royalty program give a cent for each use of a program...
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout rooms: ACM code of ethics 1.5 and google v. oracle
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;it was pretty straight forward, ask, credit and pay other people's material
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;used*
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Another case of sue for da monies
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;I don’t think it can be so simple considering this started in 2010 (I think it was anyways)
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Oracle is a big company, they can keep the fight longer than others
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Well is the problem that being credit, or is it the use of it since i could not understand which one is being used
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;It was uniquely written java code right?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Ohh okay I understand
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Ohhhh, that's interesting Yashvir
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;me
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Ive seen a couple of their servers
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;can someone send me the attendance code please
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Because of Minecraft I do haha
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Also I swore java was open source lol, guess I learned something today
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Microsoft bought out Mojang who makes Minecraft hhaha
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;"Corporate Engines" The book, the movie
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;eh128p
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;JAVA language and its APIs are two different thing. the case is over APIs not java
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;As I mentioned in the breakout rooms overall I have challenges with this concept, as I think copyrighting and intellectual property really puts a chokehold on creativity and disallows smaller companies to innovate.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Gotcha. I know very little about java, thanks for the clarification
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Also CS as a whole generally operates on an open-source concept, where people share ideas and knowledge.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;We shouldn't have to resort to rampant copyrighting if people are willing to credit and share with each other their code to an extent
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;@dayne the problem with not protecting peoples intellectual property is that if theres no protections there no reason to innovate because then you just waste time and money with no potential reward
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I couldn't imagine a world where you had to pay for every snippet of code you need.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Oh I fully agree that people need credit and to be paid.
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Same basic blocks of code are open, yes. But not entire algorithms
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;It can be very limiting when used improperly
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I also am aware that I don't fully understand the context here. To me this seems like a petty argument between two giant corps. I would be more interested to see how this conversation would go down among smaller devs.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah agreed
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Coding languages should be open source in order to have uniformity
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;the battle between Apple and Epic helped smaller app developers not needing to pay 30% in profits which is nice
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Again, want to point out here how much you need to know about programming in order to even understand the case
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Also some developers come up with new ideas on how to implement old algorithms.. creating new marketplaces and what not.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yes awesome point Dr. Hapting about transparency. Totally agreed
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you Professor, see you all on thursday
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you, have a nice day!
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, have a nice day
    </li></ul>
