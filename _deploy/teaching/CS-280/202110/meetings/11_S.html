<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Hello. how's everyone doing today. Little rushed around i'm trying to organize. An event and. I want to get your input on that. Never a dull moment around here, it seems. So we have an alumnus from the University of Regina. did his bachelor series grow. warning me raised in China. He said NASA and he's in charge of. robotics division Program. So there's a. wired article from July when perseverance was launched. To talk about building a self driving car from Mars. His name is Larry massey's and. So he's like he's agreed to do a zoom seminar for us. So he was he was here in 2004. So you don't remind remember 2004. Like I do but anyway, he was here giving a battlefield lecture. Which is. Now we have the science public lecture. anyway. started the science public lecture. To replace it. So he came to talk about in the earlier. Mars Rover mission. Anyway, so it's time to have him back. semester. Ninth and after April 9. i'll try to make it a weekday evening. Okay, so i'd like your input on that. Okay, so still waiting for about. 15 people to reply to the pole so goodness 30 seconds. Okay. 30 seconds we're still waiting for a few people but. i'm going to end the poll now. Okay, so. Have a slight preference for before March 29. So, looking at the calendar. i'd say about. That last full week of full week of March. So we need to pick a date between the 22nd in the 25th of March that's a Monday to Friday Monday to Thursday sorry. And we'll try and have it at the same. 7pm. time slot in the evening. I can ask. One more question. Okay, so i'm making a multiple choice multiple. Answer vote for as many days as you like. But it's that week march 22 to the 25th. Now, where did it go. keen on Friday, because that's just. included. ready now. 30 seconds. Okay, so any 6% of you voted. i'm going to end the call. So Tuesday, is the least popular day and Wednesday is. This edging out Monday, as the most popular. So i'll just take this information and. Oh, see what his availability is like. So let's let's see evening, going to be like well introduce the speaker. and Then we'll talk for I don't know. 45 minutes or so 45 minutes to an hour and then they'll be some live question and answer. So he'll, be it won't be like Dave palmer's talk, because it will you won't have a pre recorded talk don't do that live. preference. Speaking of Dave Palmer Let me give you. A promise video. Okay, that should be the. link to the first seminar with Dave Palmer the guy who created windows task manager. So I edited that video on my MAC. Some of the bloopers from the live meeting. anyway. What the idea would be for. This talk by Larry massey. So thank you for your input about scheduling it. no guarantees that they would come up with all natural we've talked about here. Data point. I tried to keep up with email on the questions about the assignment but. seemed like most people got it in Okay, in the end. And the marker and I will be understanding, if there are some issues and. So it will be in touch with you about things that need to be clarified okay. So I put up the second blog. Entry description. And, as anyone had a chance to look at it yeah. Okay, so anyway i'm open to some clarification, yet about this so maybe we can just. Let me, let me share my screen and then we'll get to. OK so. The details are writing. well. This paragraph that. describes what i'd like you to discuss in your second blog post. So that deals with.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Upholding are defending the public interest to public good and examines how to define it in a practical way. sedation code of ethics says that the code. gurus principles formulated a statement of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good, is always the primary consideration. Now. I have a link there to Defense distributed anyone heard of Defense distributed before. Not so much in the news of present, I think. They created some 3D printer files for a gun. I can't remember a single shot. gun and. So that was their claim to fame. and interest in the Department of Justice in the States. I think that case is dropped. And now, they have some. they're involved with. cnc. devices to do some. parts. and so on. So I remember hearing. cody Wilson, who is the founder of that. Company, who is talking about. Their work being in the public interest. and It seems like there are lots of people who companies who would say that. Their work is in the public interest. But maybe. Maybe they benefit from the. idea of. or a lack of a clear definition of what the public interest or the public good, is. So i'm not saying you have to look at. That company. Or that history that particular story for your blog post that. Something where. claim or. The claim is being made. Public the public good, is being. placed with highest importance. And then, then to explore what what what is it what they meant what that. What definition of the public good, is implied there. isn't really in in the interest of the public good. So find an example of a claim that the public good, is is a primary is the primary consideration and critically examine that claim. Further than we can. discuss and clarify is required. There is a there is an ongoing discussion about Facebook in Australia. Seen seen in the news. So a version of this is. The Australian Government is trying to. pass legislation that would. not allow Facebook to scrape. Australia news sites. free of charge. And then have. Mark Zuckerberg make more money. To have them pay for that content. So that the local media ecosystem in Australia is supported. So in Canada there's similar. Like legislation being.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;contemplated.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So it seems like. they're talking about some people were. Saying. Rupert Murdoch is. Trying to keep us stake in the industry, and it was about. Protecting the little guy. So I thought we could do a little breakout session here for 10 minutes. To discuss. Ideas around Facebook. Is Facebook. The bad guy here are the. Okay yeah i'll do attendance in a second here. thanks for the reminder. Mention is that. Facebook removed Australian. News content from the site. So Facebook users couldn't. can share news stories, but then it wasn't always just about news, it was about. Public health information was also unavailable. So related so think about that is also related is the question of free. I think, because I listened to. ads on TV. comment about already proposed to replace them. Can. anyway. Everything is being proposed to be. free to the consumer, all these like. sell your home via home it's all free. Everything is free. Now is that the model. says, this is a sustainable model. When it comes to. news on the Internet. Talk about. Facebook and free. there's legislation being prepared in Canada. i'm not sure the details have been released, yet it's still being worked out. Okay, so is that seem clear enough. Okay i'm going to. Do breakout rooms now. Okay i'm opening the rooms now. For 10 minutes we'll get back. here. Okay, so do you want to share some of the interesting things that were going on. New breakout rooms, either in chat or. With the whole group with microphones. So what is the hardest subject. Okay, serving see the password for the. attendance. Any comments about Facebook discussion. centers encouraged.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;That um I think you read a little bit that there was a backlash and Facebook restored the. News articles or something like that, but it didn't day it's going to happen again like Facebook has not learned their lesson. Most of the time, all these backlashes are kind of pointless because we're just gonna keep doing it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;renews a proprietary platform to. enable our communication. it's not. We don't have the same relationship with telephone providers and. Maybe. The Facebook situations, a bit like the power outage in Texas. Is you don't have public accountability, we have private companies.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;But on the other hand, Facebook, is a private company, so in a way, they kind of are allowed to do what they want, with their system. Like. Like. Like the only thing that we can really do is basically go cool you're allowed to do that, but we just want us anymore and we'll make our own system so. yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I noticed, for example, the CBC or. Well, not, not a single to CBC but. They make use of Facebook. And, to me it seems like the public broadcaster should not be using private. platforms like that. Then we know some complicated issues, I guess, in terms of. Managing. Managing the accessibility and. Providing platforms that are always. And then, if we don't. We don't require them to be. used because they're all these different options, then. Will they be enough uptake to. Keep. Keep the public platforms. open and. Relevant. So it's not an easy issue. well. Bad. Anyway, thanks for your concern. didn't sleep last night. At the coffee's not strong enough today i'm not sure. My apologies. So let's talk about the project proposal on the project. project is. So originally in the class some years ago. 2010 or so and I started. There was an essay. group project. combination of them. So you can, if you're interested in doing a research paper. You can do that. But you can also do a book review. You can contribute something to Wikipedia. Creating promotes online content. Like a video blog or a podcast. You can picture yourself as a competing professional. and So I had something particular in mind there. In the sense of finding pictures of. People who would inspire you to as a competing professional. and talking about. The connection, you have with that person or persons. So you can also discuss your contributions to an open source project. Where you could write some code to test, an idea. So the question of small groups. So let's say. Since we have a large class. five people in the group. So you don't have to have five, but you can have up to five. So I can give you some examples. One from a couple years ago as weapons of mass destruction. And they don't have this math myth. So what would be the topic to discuss well the idea would be. to explore something that's of interest to you. relate to the class name so it's. Something that's connected. To the. Knowledge units were discussing. give you. Okay, so. Yes, you can be less than five in the group. Yes, I did say that I thought thanks. for that. Okay. The idea is. To give you a range of choices to. deeply consider some. Some topic related to class. and I didn't I don't want to close. The door and your creativity. So you're writing blog to blog posts so. I see I figure. That, if you and. you've got some writing in, and if you want to do more, reading, you can. In some different ways. In the proposal. You just outline what you're going to. Work on. You give a plan. Put in here. So one mark, so the topic. OK, so the way. Instead of. doing the group thing ahead of time. Well, you know the group. So stick with my first thing instead of doing the group's ahead of time. If you have. Your you make up a group for the project and you. clearly indicate the group members. On your submission, so you only need to submit one copy. Then we'll make up the groups based on. The submissions. That make sense. Okay, so. Take a look at that resource and all are given it. will make an addition to the. To the assignment description in terms of a sample. For your proposal okay. So I don't have one. And two the link to at the moment, but all create one. And we can talk about it. On Thursday, if needed. Okay. Okay anything else. That, I may have neglected or you have questions about. Today, so. 230 to 330. So. I investigated my issues with zoom and office. Do you know where to find the schedule. So let me. Go to. My office hours link. That can you see where i'm pointing at. i'm not there all the time, so here's my schedule. So today's Tuesday. And then I have an officer is gone hits the button. Yes, the proposal is one or two pages. Okay, and this should also link you to the meeting. I click on the link here. i'm not gonna leave the class. Back to. The knowledge units. yeah I thanks Nicholas that's what I was gonna say the knowledge units or the discussions. Why stop at font size 3070 or 100 and. Some. So that would not be the. spirit of one to two pages, so one to two pages and 12 point. Now, with. crazy timelines facing or. or very quiet and narrow margins and small tiny face but. You could do a. Little say single space. And default margins whatever editor using. say the word limit, so I don't know. yeah. I said pages so. You know when. So the reason i'm talking about the. size of the. Or the lines facing in the tightness of the margins and. So on is because when you give a. Page limit. And people want to write as much as they can they. Can they. can fill in the details as much as possible, so every nook and cranny. So i'm not. i'm not trying to. i'm not going to entertain this discussion anymore, since it's 1246 so i'm going to say goodbye for today. And we'll we'll talk about similar things. and we'll go through the. Is a video about self judgment. That I didn't get to publish before class today so i'll do that. afternoon and see you on Thursday. Take care everyone stay well.

    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;what about attendence
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;oh okay
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Facebook will always be the bad guy with how they always acted, good riddance
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yup, I heard, now Facebook just banned almost everything else including weather XD
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Microsoft already proposed to replace them
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I hope they do better, MSN is not very good
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Does anyone know how Canada is following up?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;on what?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;I heard they were looking at doing something along the lines of Australia
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Canada could be next to propose a bill just like Australia
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Has their been attendance please?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;There hasn’t been yet
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;just when thinks got Interesting 👌
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;things*
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;hehehe
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;we were discussing about what is the hardest CS subject...
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Good, pull news off Facebook. Unmoderated platforms like that are dicey to have unvetted news sources
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;And a little about WhatsApp new policies
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Lol^^
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;What were whatsapps new ones? I heard they made new one but didnt botherto look as I dont use it
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;We discussed whether money should be involved in news altogether basically
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;All users have to share date with facebook
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;data
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;HAHAHA
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;switch back to BBM
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Facebook took down the news regarding covid lockdowns and any related information as well, and I think that makes it in to be in the wrong in these times
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;I said learning and writing assembly language
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Oh man I loved assembly
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;CS 215: particularly the k maps
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;so tedious...
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Assembly just made sense to me? Am I okay?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;I liked assembly hehehe
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;cs 100
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;also tedious with all the registers...
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I loved assembly
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Wait K maps were CS 215? I thought it was 201...
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I liked assembly as well! I found CS 340 to be the toughest
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;cs340 I agree
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;I don't like assembly at all
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;what do you use kmaps for in 340?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Anything with logic diagrams is troubling
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;we can build robots with k maps so I hear
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I gotta agree CS 110 was the hardest, can't argue
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Wasn't the backlash to the government, and they agreed to amend the law?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;cs 310
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;No, we don’t use k-maps in 340 haah
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;kmaps were in 201
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;lol panth
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I was gonna take 340 next, but now I guess I need to rethink lol
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;wow I did not know their was so many assembly lovers. I truly envy you guys hahahah
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;cs 310. The old final were 70 percent worth of the final grade
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;301 has more about assembly
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Its like annoying but it was like basic coding with an etra step
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;CS is very easy
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;🙄
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;I always thought coding needed an extra step ahahahah
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;^^^nice
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;hahahaha
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;professor, you don't seem okay. is everything alright?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I just finished my all engl courses last sem and was so relived that I don't have to write any more essays and here I am writing blogs
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Dr. Hepting, if we have time towards the end class, would you be able to give us some direction on the Project Proposal?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;End of*

    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have any book recommendations?
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;what would be the topic to discuss?
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;it should be discussion from class
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;??
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Do we have to be 5 or could we be less than 5 in a group ?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;He said you can be less than five. Up to 5.
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Ohh ok
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;What do we include in the project proposal itself?
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;Is there any outline or sample how to write a proposal
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Should group members all submit the same proposal, or should each group member have a different proposal?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I am down with the filter bubble topic or the facebook vs Australia. Anyone else interested hit me up. Or maybe you guys have some other interesting topics
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, thanks
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;@Sanjida I find this resource helpful for formatting proposals. Of course, you don’t have to include every section. https://www.lakeheadu.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/56/GraduateMScResearchProposalTemplate.pdf
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks
