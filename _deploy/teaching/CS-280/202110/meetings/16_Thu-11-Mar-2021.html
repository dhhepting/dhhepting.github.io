      While not directly related to the main topic of today's lecture, I found the original discussion on where you should post the event invitation online fairly interesting. Despite being what is ideally an “open” environment, many of the different social media/community sites have vastly different use cases, despite falling under very similar classifications. What may be seen as appropriate to post onto Facebook, can be inappropriate or out of place to post in Instagram or Snapchat, despite the three of those platforms having a large overlap in user bases. To me at least, it seems like a form of segmentation,...
    </li><li>
      In today's meeting, I had a bit of trouble navigating claim rights and liberty rights and how they interact with regards to the internet."Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, that other person's liberty is thus limited."Looking at these, it seems like they defeat each other and you can end up with a cyclical sort of...
    </li><li>
      Something we discussed in class that I would like to know more about is the Aspen Institute. We discussed in class how the Aspen Institute is funded by Facebook and was made to help address social issues across the United States. As we have discussed in previous classes, Facebook and other social media platforms have exacerbated many social issues like polarization and social distrust. So is Facebook using the Aspen Institute as a ‘band-aid’ PR move to help with their current negative public image, or was it built with good intentions in mind? This sounds like an interesting discussion topic....
    </li><li>
      It was another interesting meeting in which we discussed about Claim rights and liberty rights.Claim rights are the rights that entitle the responsibilities, duties on other parties regarding the right holder.Liberty rights are the rights which does not entail obligations on other parties.These rights are applied on many different things such as essays, research papers, informative article, videos etc.We also did the breakout room to discuss the same things.
    </li><li>
      I would suggest doing a multiple-choice poll of what kind of social media platform do the students have. That would be a wiser choice for time than waiting for people to answer in the chat.There are laws that companies usually follow when operating online. While people can do whatever they want with some consequence. If they are an online troll, then they could get banned from one platform; then they can just create another account. There are instances of people losing their job because of the kinds of stuff they posted online, so they are held accountable for their actions....
    </li><li>
      After reading an article "Weave: The social fabric project I learned a new word called weaver. Weaver means the people who make efforts to build connections between people and make each person valued. They see the community as their home. In America their are crisis of connection between people they feel isolated and weavers is the community of people that are helping them to lead love in all people.
    </li><li>
      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting:The weave topic, claim rights and the liberty rights as discussed and the registration for them Robotic Mars Exploration.the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:The concept from past meeting is the democracy of the internet usagewhat you would like to know more about:I would like to know more about the liberty rights as a software developersomething you encountered that is related to the past meeting:the empathy discussion and democracy of internet
    </li><li>
      Our discussion during class about “What are your rights and responsibilities online and upon what do they depend?” was quite exciting. I also learned about the differences between claim rights and liberty rights and how they are inverse of each other. I would like to know more about how these rights play a role in advancement of technology and how they shape technology.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 15, There is a topic name "Weave The Social Fabric Project ", it about America need to build communication system for their citizen and arrange worker to spread this idea. Because America had many social problem came out since last year, Most of their citizen have their own survival system. If other want to break the balance of their system, it won't work. Liberty rights in America is unlimited, their citizen thinking of right is important to anything. So appropriate restrictions are necessary, even if it is unacceptable at beginning.
    </li><li>
      In our 15th meeting we discussed claim rights, liberty rights, online rights, online responsibilities and the rights to privacy. Claim rights are rights that other people or parties have responsibilities to do for the right holder. Liberty rights are liberties and freedoms a rights holder have. When it comes to online rights we discussed how much of claim rights to liberty rights should there be. Another discussion that came about with rights is what exactly were the kinds of online responsibilities should internet users have. Lastly we discussed about privacy and how much should people have or be willing to...
    </li><li>
      in meeting 15, I learned about the act of weaving. Weaving is a project that aims to build social trust to address the root cultural cause behind many social problems. I actually believe this would help solve the issues of isolation and help people connect more helping reduce the use of social space as a comfort means.
    </li><li>
      Today's society is different from before, computers play an important role in our life. I think its right to computer use also becomes very important. For example, freedom, people have the freedom to use computers. Since computers are our private property, we also have claims and rights to them.
    </li><li>
      we discussed about mars exploration, talked about rights on wikipedia.
    </li><li>
      We'll for this one, it was quite interesting talking about rights that these big companies will have since if we don't really have right for privercy and really currently we have no way to go and protect knowelged but at the same time if we do have rights will cause that we might lose people talking about things that they don't know about but they still have a useful perspective.
    </li><li>
      Topics discussed today were quite different but something new for me. I like the concept about the claim and liberal rights. As the claim right requires other persons' liabilities, duties, or commitments, it seems to me like the right of some managers or authorities who can control their employees’ work in a professional manner. A liberty right, on the other hand, is a right that confers no duties on third parties, which is like the employees who work under those managers.
    </li><li>
      The ethics of rights on the InternetLast class we had a brief discussion and breakout room on the subject of rights on the Internet. Or more specifically which rights should we have on the internet. One of ideas my group came up with alluded to information processing. The internet is an undisputedly a hub of shared information to be gained by anyone who is willing to spend the time to learn. Therefore, it should be us who are held accountable when presenting varying pieces of information on the web. Be it on social media, email or even over the phone,...
    </li><li>
      In our last lecture, we talked about claim and liberal rights. A claim right is a right that requires other parties' responsibilities, duties, or obligations in relation to the right-holder. The right to liberty, on the other hand, is everyone's right to personal liberty, including freedom of movement and freedom from arbitrary imprisonment by others.
    </li><li>
      I think we need to look over claim rights vs liberty rights online. My group discussion came mostly to you should have the same rights you have in person. However people tend to be more rude over the internet with that loss of human contact making it easier to be rude to people you cant see. So I would like to disscuss this further with what else people think would be the best way to solve it.
    </li><li>
      In, Weave, The Social Fabric Project from the Aspen Institute. In this nation, people get an interaction recession. Individuals feel alienated, invisible and in prison camps. Community resentment and separation underlies our most important matters, from ongoing economic and racial unfairness to political deadlock, a pandemic of hopelessness, and increasing suicide and overdose deaths. Resentment helps to keep us all from addressing problems such as poverty, unemployment, starvation and global warming. Weave encourages the several Americans in every society that perform to build social trust and weave neighbours together to enhance their societies.
    </li><li>
      Claim rights and liberty rightsIn the last meeting, the professor talked about claim rights and liberty rights. A claim right is a right to entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder. And liberty right is a right that does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder. So, claim rights and liberty rights are inversed.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed about the online event by Larry Matthies on Robotic Mars Exploration and how to register for the event. Later we discussed about Weave project and then about claim rights and liberty rights in society.
    </li><li>
      according to me the rights and responsibilities of a person online are in the hands of the developer. what he/she expects from one while using their interface, accordingly the preamble of rights and responsibility would be created for the users. To me as a future professional here learn to provide users a safe and objection-free digital environmnent.
    </li><li>
      It's interesting talking about liberty and claim rights. It makes me think of people being censored online for saying inappropriate and seemingly evil things. There is a lot of talk about the freedom of speech but there is also an obligation to censor awful hateful speech. I want to make it clear that I think people shouldn't be able to spread hatred. It's interesting because out in the real world you can be hateful with words and people won't react well to it but it's not necessarily illegal, but in online spaces it's a whole new world where censorship is...
    </li><li>
      In terms of the internet when it comes to rights and liberties it seems to mostly revolve around personal reasonability. The internet is to an extent the "wild west" (although this has been rapidly changing) there are not many limits on what can be accessed, posted, and viewed online. When it comes to rights the internet is a very difficult thing to legislate. One could say they have a right to the internet, but everything that follows gets muddied. Does one have the legal right on the internet to access say, pirated material, for example? Each country can set different...
    </li><li>
      I believe your rights online come from the rules (and what is socially acceptable) of the platform you're participating on. If you're a platform designer, then the rights you provide come from law. The more interesting part is responsibility, which some people would say you have none. Personally, I feel that everyone has a responsibility as a user or creator to at least try to not be a negative on society. However, I'm not sure that we can realistically expect anything of everyone, but I also don't like the idea of limiting rights. It's still unclear to me if limiting...
    </li><li>
      I found the claim rights vs. liberty rights a very interesting concept that goes well beyond simply the scope of this course and technology as a whole, and in that sense I would like to know more regarding this argument. Being a CS student who is very tired of math, I think its definitely a fresh change of pace to dive into a more philosophical type of question.
    </li><li>
      On meeting 15, we’ve discussed Rights and responsibilities, Especially, I would like to talk about the claim rights and liberty rights. The claim right is the right that takes the responsibility or obligation for a right-holder. However, the liberty right is the right that not taking the responsibility or obligation for a right-holder, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder. The claim rights more likely tells you what you can't do, the liberty right is what you can do.
    </li><li>
      The last meeting was quite interesting to participate as our last meeting’s discussion topic was about liberty and claim rights. What i got from the overall discussion is that liberty is synonymous of freedom, i.e. every person has the liberty to live according to themselves. It doen not
    </li><li>
      I Was wondering if you could talk about the final exam. A claim right is a right which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder while a liberty right is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder. could you talk more about the Robotic Mars Exploration too.
    </li><li>
      There is a relationship and precedence that links liberty rights and claim rights, especially online. While we, as users, have the liberty of expression, we also have to ensure that our online speech is not hateful, inappropriate, or harmful. Making this moral decision and enforcing it universally is difficult, if not impossible. Thus, regulation of online activity is required, but by whom? Should we rely on governments or online committees of people to regulate activities, or algorithms and bots? The former option is difficult due to the profound amount of online media that exists, while the latter lacks human context....
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we discuss the responsibilities and rights of online and what they depend on. Computerized rights, firmly connected to the opportunity of expression and privacy, are those that permit individuals to get to, use, make and distribute advanced media, just as access and use PCs, other electronic gadgets, and correspondence organizations. what's more, the duties are to Respect the feelings and thoughts of others. Submit to all licensed innovation laws. Try not to utilize or share others' work without authorization. Observe rules or potentially implicit rules for each Internet webpage.
    </li><li>
      The last meeting was quite interesting to participate as our last meeting’s discussion topic was about liberty and claim rights. What i got from the overall discussion is that liberty is synonymous of freedom, i.e. every person has the liberty to live according to themselves. It does not defines anyone’s obligations towards the right holder. On contrary, claim rights are just inverse of liberty as it does say that other party or we can say authorities have the responsibility regarding right holder, to make sure that their claim rights are not violated by anyone. Other than that in breakout rooms...
    </li><li>
      I really liked the discussion about the relationship and precedence between claim rights and liberty rights. Although we have liberty, there is a responsibility that supersedes this. So we have freedom of expression and speech online, but a limited free reign. We also need to have responsibility and regulation of hate speech, cyberbullying, false information and spamming which is annoying a lot and so on.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting professor showed us how to register for the webinar by Larry Matthies and in the later part we discussed about the liberty and civil rights for a developer.In the Breakup room we discussed that cannot do anything in terms of protecting our privacy once we post something on internet its out of our rich to protect it. we need an independent body which deals with our data privacy form this big tech companies link google and facebook.
    </li><li>
      I believe that a perfect a perfect balance of claim and liberty rights should be sought after especially in the tech industry. Sometimes people can feel entitled when they own products or pay for services, that they believe they can just do as they please without needing to think of how actions can affect others. If we also lean towards too much claim rights then things will be too restricted which can hinder progress or entice conflict within the community.
    </li><li>
      After reading about the Weave project I realized that they were right about how with all the technology we have today we can connect to anyone but we rarely connect as people and get to know each other. Which has created walls and barriers between us as a society.  
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I have learned from this meeting is about our rights and responsibilities online. I believe you have the freedom to do whatever you want online as long as it is not illegal. Online activities that promote hatred and lies should be discouraged as well similar to what Twitter decided to do recently. Several students mentioned privacy which is important as well. I believe the online community would be a better place if people behave similar to how they do in real life. We have a responsibility to create better online communities.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I took out from last class was the difference between claims rights and liberty rights. The concept that was most difficult for me to understand was second order liberties, such as powers and immunities. Although it was not discussed in depth during meeting 15, I am very excited, and would like to learn more about, robotic Mars exploration. I am eager to learn about this from the guests speaker via virtual webinar. Other than that, I would also like to learn more about Weave. I have encountered discussed about the topic of claim rights and liberty...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we get information about an interesting topic which is an article about the weave the social fabric project from here we get a new word that is weaver which means the people who makes the effort to build connections between the people and make each person valued and also learn about that the Aspen Institute is funded by the Facebook and also the other social media platforms have helped many social issues such as polarization. apart from that wed discussed in Brooms some privacy rights that are under liberty which is the synonyms for the freedom...
    </li><li>
      As the internet lets a user use the information collected from different sources it’s user’s right to make the decision .Privacy setting plays an important role as it lets a user protect the information but there should be a user guide for how to manage the privacy settings that makes it easier for a user to make changes because sometimes the media is set up with the full privacy.
    </li><li>
      Something I would like to learn more about is the responsibility differences between online and physical environments. Originally, I thought it was intuitive that we could find analogs between the physical and online environments, and thus relate the responsibility through these analogs. For example, we could find that Wikipedia (online) is analogous to a public library (physical) and thus we should share many of the same responsibilities (i.e. don't add books/text that spread misinformation for example). However, there are very distinct differences between the two (such as anonymity of Wikipedia), so is this analogous method appropriate to use?
    </li><li>
      In last meeting professor was asking everyone to join a facebook event call; Robotic Mars Exploration. It Seems very interesting. Beside that he again talked about the project topics. We also had a breakout season about online rights.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we discussed about the upcoming seminar by Larry Matthies about Robotic Mars Exploration. We were discussing about the correct platform to invite many people to join this seminar. After that, we had a bit discussion about project proposal. Then, we had a breakout room where we discussed about the online rights and responsibilities.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 15, we discuss about Robotic Mars Exploration, it about Dr. Larry Matthies uses his expertise and technology to autonomously navigate robotic ground and aerial vehicles on Earth and space.And talk about the Social Fabric Project, which solves the fundamental cultural roots behind many social problems in the United States.
    </li><li>
      Last Class, we discuss claim rights and liberty rights, which both are important rights in society. These two kinds of powers are inherent rights of people. A person has the right to claim his surplus-labour income freely. It is inviolable.
    </li><li>
      At the beginning of this meeting, we discussed how to register ourselves for the event which will be with NASA scientists. After that in the breakout room, we discussed how our privacy and security or our moment on the internet is tracked by some organization or is not safe. we concluded that it should not be easy for everyone to track the web activity of others, it should only be in the hands of the government.
    </li><li>
      The most interesting thing for me was how customers data is tracked in and linked, i already had the basic idea before but after attending the lecture i have now greater vision of how things work and how data is manipulated
    </li><li>
      In response to the question asked in class regarding what are my rights and responsibilities online and upon what do they depend, I think that my right and responsibilities online should be no different than the right I have online. However, I don't think that is the case. At this point, I do not have confidence to say that I do have rights online. Usually, the developers decide on the extent of a users rights and responsibility. There are applications that do let you know what will be done like for example some apps will ask for permission on whether...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, I learnt that the differences between claim right and liberty right.A Claim Right is a right which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder.In contrast, a liberty right is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder.Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person has...
    </li><li>
      As I investigate more into surveillance capitalism and how technology is weaving its way into every one of our moves, the more I wonder how many people actually know what is going on. I assume that the average person is not reading the fine print of the technologies they are using everyday and fail to understand how they work. Yet when made aware that their devices are "listening" to them and tracking their data, the general population is absolutely appalled and made incredibly uncomfortable.
    </li><li>
      I appreciate the concept of "weaving" from The Social Fabric Project. However, it is quite sad that the listed qualities of "weaving" need to be discussed and promoted, opposed to being natural to everybody. For example, it states "A weaver treats neighbors as family regardless of outward differences". I wish this was a universal trait that didn't need to be discussed. It really shouldn't be hard to treat others with proper respect and care or be an advocate for positivity. Hopefully one day we can get closer to the perfect world where people are inherently good.
    </li><li>
      Most people seem indifferent, but I have found the topic of rights and responsibilities online to sometimes escalate quickly. In the end, it is always the lack of transparency or education that causes confusion, and even anger. Times have changed dramatically but some mindsets have not. In this information age, it should be obvious by now that there has to be some level of responsibility online. If all we care about is streaming Netflix and shopping online, or worse, we believe in the “nothing to hide argument”, then perhaps our data collected is warranted.
    </li><li>
      In the previous meeting an interesting discussion was held on the topic "Claim rights and liberty rights". I would like to get more knowledge about it and we also discussed it in the breakout rooms.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 15 we discussed about the critical examination of computing. In the breakout room we discussed abut the challenges faced by computing. We also had a scope of the assumptions.
    </li><li>
      In todays class we discussed about liberty rights and claims rights . A claim right is a right that requires other parties' responsibilities, duties, or obligations in relation to the right-holder. A liberty right, on the other hand, is a right that confers no responsibilities on third parties but only rights or permission on the right-holder.A negative right is a right for me to be protected from harm if I try to get something for myself. A positive right would be my right to have something provided for me.
    </li><li>
      The class was about claim right and liberty right and discussed about peoples right on group discussion. Moreover, I learnt something new which is social weave, they are taking really good step to help people. I am excited to attend the seminar of the scientist from NASA.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about rights: Claim rights and Liberty rights. At the end of the meeting we also had some discussion on Weave project that I want to discuss more.
    </li><li>
      I am really very excited and eager for the meeting regarding the NASA mars rover. I learnt about the liberty right and claim rights and discussed in group discussion in what aspects they are different from one another and wanted to learn about liberty right especially.
    </li><li>
      The topic of last meeting was claim rights and liberty. From meeting i have learnt that liberty means freedom and everyone has freedom to do whatever they want . On the other hand claim rights say that other parties or authorities have the responsibility that claim rights of right holder should not be violated by anone.the breakout room topic dissolved was on some basic privacy rights
    </li><li>
      I got to learn about the Claim rights and Liberty rights which was interesting. It was also pretty exciting to know about public even happing on Robotics Mars Exploration.
    </li><li>
      Professor gave us insights about liberty rights and claim rights in the context of technological world. He also enlighten us with a term “weaver” which implies weavers make the effort to build those connections and make others feel valued. This term should really mark a great influence on ourselves and the programmers who develop a platform.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a discussion on Claim rights and Liberty rights. Moreover, at the end of class we had a breakout room to discuss some relevant points to that.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we talked about our rights and responsibilities as online users and its a topic I look forward to us discussing more. Also, the most interesting thing I learned was knowing about the social fabric project called Weave that aims to build social trust to address the root cultural cause behind many of America’s social problems.
    </li><li>
      In past meeting it was a great discussion on liberty rights and claim rights. also in breakout room we discussed some points of project with few classmates. I am very excited for meeting regarding NASA.
    </li><li>
      In the class, I learned that the mission of perseverance about life's possibilities on another planet and Dr. Larry Matthies was awarded for his work. Moreover, Weave is a project to build social trust in a society. In other words, Weave is a connection of happiness and be weaver is to care for others. Next, claim right is the right holder's duties on other parties, and liberty rights are the freedom for the holder.
    </li><li>
      I learnt that about the differences between liberty right and claim rightliberty right means people's right, freedom to do or have whatever, while claim right means obligation on people to allow or enable him to do or have whatever
    </li><li>
      I found it quite interesting how weaving can be something to be considered when creating social media platforms or what already created social platforms should plan to move towards as through this a safer community for everyone is created as everyone cares for one another
    </li><li>
      One thing I found interesting and amazing from this meeting was WEAVE. It's true that we have less trust on people around us and it will grow even bigger because of how our life changes from social gathering and interaction between people to social media where we communicate and show how we feel. No matter what social media and online interaction can never replace or give feeling that a physical interaction do and as result many people have started to feel lonely and less important to society. I think WEAVE is a nice way to bring people together although it...
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discussed about arguments and liberal rights.
    </li><li>
      Weave sounds like a cool project, a lot of people have social problems and being able to address that is very important. I wonder what else the future has in stock, I doubt we would've known about weave if we didn't have the technology but if people really do care i bet there would still be similar things without technology
    </li><li>
      Freedom is a social right—namely, the individual's right to choose the affairs involving himself. The choice right includes acceptance and rejection, or we can choose to be both "yes" and "no." For example, "belief" is a matter of personal freedom. The right of claim is the right to be realized by oneself, which requires the obligor to fulfill the obligation. That is to say, fighting for rights is the obligation of the obligee to himself.Therefore，Claim rights and liberty rights complement each other.
    </li><li>
      in the last meeting, we discussed about an interesting fact how internet data get tracked and how its insecure. Even though i am bit familiar about this thing before but we get in detail in the lecture and come to know how data is manipulated.
    </li><li>
      I learned about claim rights and liberty rights. A claim right involves other persons' responsibilities or obligations towards the right-holder, while a liberty right involves the right-holder's own freedoms or permissions. This means that a person can only have a liberty right as long as another person does not have a claim right which forbids them from exercising that right. In other words, a person has a right to do what they want so long as it does not infringe on the rights of another.
    </li><li>
      In my opinion, the so-called rights and obligations are difficult to be defined as a formula. So, in our life, how claim rights and liberty rights are realized and what are the constraints on these rights? At the same time, how do claim rights and liberty rights play their role in the cyber world? And will there be more limitations or overuse?
    </li><li>
      Everyone has a right to protect themselves while they are using the Internet. The difficulty with this is that claim rights and liberty rights interact with each other in really unclear ways and it is difficult to regulate them. Since the internet gives us an access to information it should be our right to make clear informed decisions based on information gathered. Moreover, rights and responsibilities of an individual online depends on how the developers implements the system. Rights and responsibilities online should depend and mirror the offline life. Overall, user's privacy on Internet is a right and it is...
    </li><li>
      Most of the current websites or network "facilities" are not disabled-friendly especially for people who can not see the screen. The current network is not barrier-free, for the disabled people, and I think that's what we still need working for.
    </li><li>
      In previous lecture the most important topic that I learnt about was of civil and liberty rights. I was also able to learn about social weave and moreover I am looking forward for NASA seminar.
    </li><li>
      Claim rights and liberty rights which we learn today is an instructing concept. We got to know about who this right is very important to make balance.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we saw a couple of things which included the Robotic Mars Exploration, aspen institute's weave which is the social fabric project and the wikipedia article on claim rights and liberty rights. Aspen's institute's weave project showed as the weaving theory which is basically method of lifestyle and emotional state and doesn't include a group of feelings or actions. also, it is nothing but basically regarding how you show your feelings or bring out emotions while interacting or communicating with the other person and not expecting any kind of thing in return. The main aim of this whole...
    </li><li>
      I learned about weaving in this meeting. I think we should all support weaving as it rebuilds and helps to strengthen the environment.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. how's everyone doing today. that's pretty good I think can be considering. You know, turn the stage.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;We cannot complain about the water.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. I was worried when I was raining on. Monday night and then snowed and I thought that might be a lot of slippery ice underneath but. Because I fall under those conditions before. But it was. It was nice to watch. Nice to walk pardon me. and actually sell it to my neighbors. And conversation with them. Socially distance of course because you're wearing masks especially. Anyway, you know it's a nice. Nice interlude I guess. let's go right to attendance. Let me share my screen. Here we go. This privacy. To work on the navigation. So these are actually a couple of videos. Anyone has had a chance to look at them. The first one is. steam is cathcart. he's in charge of whatsapp. And the second one is. Glenn greenwald who says the New York Times and worked with Edward snowden to. publish stories about surveillance programs in the state. A couple years old, but. Still. Okay, so. We come to yesterday with our discussion about. rights and responsibilities and privacy. Any thoughts about that, like to. comments or. Even questions. Start us off today. Okay well what's the point right if it's not respected. can't always be. In terms of kind of think of the things in terms of rights. and responsibilities as well. So there's interesting. The second part of the comment is. That privacy rights violated simply due to lack of knowledge. So. How many. How many people are. confident in their privacy settings a set up on different platforms. Read the terms of service and understand the law. and How many people are willing to not use a platform if the terms of service aren't. aren't supportive of you have your own privacy.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I do feel like there is something coercive about the way in terms of service or use just in the sense that I think most companies know that. No one or most people are not going to take the time to read every word of these documents, and so they can essentially put whatever demands on your privacy, they want. We use so many digital services now and we have to agree to so many terms of service that clicking yes, except just becomes second nature and we signed a lot of way in that process, but what choice, do we have we want to use these services now.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;mm hmm.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Exactly so between a rock and a hard place, so to speak. And you might think that. there's so many. People using these services like there's something like billions of messages sent per day on whatsapp. yeah so there's so much traffic going on who is going to be interested in me. So this is your losses taught chatting here both things, so why don't we start with a breakout room about. let's see. out and. have some agency or your privacy online. Is that a general enough topic yet specific enough. Right now. Okay, here we go now paste the question as a message to the groups as well to the bigger rooms. So See you in 10 minutes. From. The breakout rooms. We missed her last a few people, but that because that's. What happens raises operation and oh. Sorry, that was. A humor. anyway. Any ideas come up that you want to share. This is a good discussion.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I know my group there we were chatting a little bit and we got on to how hopeless it feels right because these companies are so massive and it's We just have to rely on the government to hopefully do something and that's it's it's hard to handle sometimes.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;In our group he thought that we don't really have a choice, right now, like you, can't really be private.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;We had kind of a quieter more sedate discussion in our group, but it came up a bit we talked about. The fact that there's applications out there that are explicitly designed to harvest our data and disregard our privacy and it's challenging to maintain privacy in the face of things like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. platforms to. To do things to protect our privacy, not in their self interest. So please don't do that, so that I can. Messages everybody. Okay. there's an interesting comment about what is somebody with agency look like on the Internet. The person could be using tools that are available Internet to create their own. profile online. So that is. reputable sources or authoritative source of information about the person. online. So that, of course, implies that people want to be online. You don't want to be online. And it's a bit more difficult, so in the year in the European Union, they have. The right to be forgotten as far as the gdpr. General data and privacy regulations that came into effect. Almost three years ago. To. give up some privacy is some control over your information. For convenience or. So there's a poem written after the Second World War. I believe, is a first, they came for the. Here, let me. Let me look it up. description. yeah. So I mean. We can say it depends. And we can say it a little bit more. easily when we're not directly affected, but if we. If we don't. Work to. send the importance of privacy. For others. Then, maybe. It will be so eroded by the time. We we hope to apply, then that. Our own privacy is threatened. Maybe. yeah okay so it's really a brilliant business model. it's a very. it's not it's not a very pleasant one. Because. Software is designed to prey on. Even weaknesses. and And, especially when it's not clear. So and. Anyone familiar with the terminator series of movies. yeah there's so many of them don't remember, which is which. So Facebook and these other platforms are. Are not marketed as having. A terminator, on the other side of the screen, are they. mean so we talked about metaphors. yeah. yeah. metaphors so if we think of. representation of what the processing power of. Facebook and other platforms have going. Have going for them. And it's not to support people. To get connected to family and friends or to learn about something. that's interesting to them. But it's. What we want, because they're trying to monetize every bit of interaction. So if we were. Take the. Mark Zuckerberg mark Zuckerberg face off the. business model and replace it with. something a little bit more scary. I would be improving the. Transparency around. Around the around the interface and. picture with mark Zuckerberg screen. mime attacking from the ocean, as some. references to it. privacy as relates to our use of technology in this class. Are some issues here. Get identified. In. The chat. And in the transcript. audio transcript. i'm. i'm trying to remove names from those places. urination those places. There are still more concerns what are other issues. Ownership of. This class. Sure, so I think. I think the idea. Is that it's your choice, so this is a bit of the agency issue. You can decide what we want to have. You on a claim that this was caught if you're a student s 13 and this discussion. there's a way to. for you to reclaim that identity for yourself. If you want to do that. If I can. give you that choice to. To make a claim. And having it. forced upon you that. You know the tennis student s 13 and today's. transcripts.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Where you. I kind of want to hear your thoughts on. Pro track since you're you're talking about the security and all this data stuff. What do you, what are your thoughts on that whole matter because it's kind of relates, I feel.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so I mean one one of the issues, is where the data is being stored. And so, for the pro track. The data is stored in Canada so it's not. it's not a cross border enterprise. So. Because this data is stored in the states, for example, then it's subject to other things like Patriot Act and. But in terms of. The features in pro track. track pardon me. there's some flexibility in terms of what kinds of things get logged and i've heard horror stories about. People failing exams or people who are coming so stressed out because. They are flagged as cheating when they needed to go. Have a bathroom break and. So on so. say the student is to. fill in the blank to. make any judgments about that, but making association between crying you're showing emotions. Maybe that's like. kind of a recapture. kind of test. So. I think the idea is with project track is to. Do do its best to ensure some conditions. A level playing field for the exams. So. I could see that. You may not want to have any other devices connected Internet browsing cable devices connected to the network. yeah you can go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Well, my thing with, that is if you're wanting no other devices in the room, you should you should need their full room scan not just this wasn't an exam that required a full room scan so. Since it wasn't required to full rooms, can you know, theoretically, I could have my laptop and I could have my other computer behind it, and I could be scroll on my computer behind it right. So I don't see why it needs to know what every single device is connected to my network when they're not necessarily in that same room so it's going into your network now where else is it going to check that you're not have other things on like. I think there's better ways, it could do it, that would be more privacy protected as all.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so maybe talk to your smart fridge and find out whether you have some performing enhancing smoothies in the fridge that are. Going on a limb here but. wired up the Internet connected fridges. Could report to your health insurance company or. You know whether you're. In following the doctor's advice and whether you deserve a good premium on your life insurance and so on. So I mean there's certainly. Lots of issues, the issues Ariel enough. and related one I don't want anyone sees these all state ads on. Anyone who watches TV, I still watch TV with ads. broadcast ads. And it says. Show she was a safe driving APP or something like that. And the APP is connected. runs on their phone and. They take a listen when they're driving. And I think it's not very far away, to say that they would monitor. It was connect with a car and. see that you're following the speed limit and so on. So. i'm. More concerned. scanning the network. It should be. transparent about life scanning the network. Anything that there'd be some kind of. permissions involved. So if I want to use. well. I guess is a nod to. My own agency, they absolutely COP and say such and such would like to use your camera or your microphone is that Okay, yes or no. He would like access to your contacts, yes or no, and so forth. So you think. Maybe your computer. would be on your side and say. This proctor track application wants to. scan your network. yeah go ahead Keegan.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I don't recall proctor track ever asked me if you wanted to scan my network it asked for hardware of your computer access to your camera and microphone but I don't remember it ever asking me if it could pro my network. Which is why it was concerning to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So, how did you find out about it.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;um well, I had a fire stick plugged in, and it was on on like a different level of like my house like somebody else was using it, and it was like Oh, you have to turn this device off to continue. A fire stick is just like a streaming things you like plug it into an hdmi port and you can stream like netflix and stuff so basically turn your TV like into a smart TV. And for anybody that doesn't know what it is. So, like.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so i'm i'm just wondering like why it doesn't why there's in the permission for that.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah That was my problem with it like I brought it up with my teacher time was actually David gearhart so like he investigated for me said it was Okay, but I don't know I still wasn't a fan of. The probing all your network when I don't think it's useful for what they're trying to do when they have other things that I think would be more effective.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. So anyway, it could be clear we're not going to use proctor track in this class. I just wanted you to. The empathy map assignment is about. going through the process and. Thinking about. pick up on how that's presented and. If there are opportunities for improving the presentation. Kagan.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I just didn't have any.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Other Keegan. zoom I see that the rectangle is shifted to the other Keegan. I wonder if you have that happened many, many classes. I remember one year in public school, there were five girls in my class, including me. names were installed, the same way, but. That was an interesting year I remember. Anyway, so you're welcome. I know not to rely on the rectangle but, if anyone wants to make a comment just put your. emoji hand up and. we'll go from there. So. yeah so there's a question about your courses and as a question about proctor track. And how to set a practice track so that appropriately. invasive. or records the things. that are necessary for. individualization. But not anything more than that. i'm trying to fall on in the chat here. So your courses is too difficult for people, then what. So how many people are. comfortable with your courses. who's not comfortable with your courses. So I think it's a discussion about. platform. And there are so many platforms out there, some of them are free, students, some are free to the university, some are. not free. I mean, some are proprietary or some are paid. To the university. involve some involvement big. purchase for the university some. involve purchases for students. And I think at some point there's. needs to be agreement on. The platform, and so I think you are courses as a version of moodle, which is an open source project. which has gone through a lot. And it gets a little better all the time. Too much clicking for me. set things up. So I think the issue is proctor track in the. data breach last year was. resolved. and I don't think that. invalidated selection. Anyway, so some some people some classes make. Use of different platforms i've heard people use school ology and. different things like that. Lots of issues. I see the scrolling by quite quickly now. But in terms of. Can we maybe need to have freedom from choice about the different platforms like somebody will say, well, we should use top ad. Creative so creative. or. or. School G or. etc, etc. So. can agree on your courses and agreed on. proctor track when required. So I think there's lots of interesting. ideas. To. Keep the exam. exams, like the final the take home exam that will have. In. In this class and have it. be challenging and stressful. and difficult to. phone in and as well not fun in. So I think there's ways to have it be fair valuation be fair. and reasonably cheap proof. and Now require individualization. Any questions. In terms of Canadian privacy law. grace from the University of Ottawa is. A restricted authority. and i'm just gonna. post. A blog post about. His. Analysis of. Canadian privacy law see 11 I think it is. And it's not it's not yet law. A bill. to revamp the privacy law. So there are other related posts and. here's a sample to get you started. The identification of data. So we may want the identify the data records, so that we could make some aggregate comparisons, without compromising the identity of individuals. The problem is it's difficult to de identified data that. Or the data looks de identified. At first glance, can be. We identified fairly easily. And one of the best ways to identify people is real estate. So how many people are, how many people protect their birth date. From. From widespread online access.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I used to protect my birth date but I no longer do that because I find with. recap password recovery if I forget my password I often need to know that, as part of the credentialing process, so now that we all need so many passwords and password managers to track all the dozens of accounts, we have in our lives, I feel like I don't have that freedom anymore.

    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I saw them this morning but too late as I have an earlier class
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Not yet.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;No, haven't seen them yet
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;What's the point of having a right if it's not respected? Online I feel like a lot of privacy rights get violated simply due to lack of knowledge
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;true
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;And it can be manipulated with design flaws or norman doors
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I do the best I can
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I do my nest
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Neutral
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;*my lol
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Same, do my best
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I do my best, which is generally just clicking "No" to everything
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;^same lol
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I would say so, between browser selection and limiting location services
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;"Agree or you can't use it" so it isn't really a choice with Terms of Service
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I skim....sometimes...
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Ok I don't read terms of service hahaha, it takes waay too long
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Depends what the platform is.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I will immediately use other platform without question
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I even ignore the sites that forces me to accept cookies
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;nowadays the media will do that for us
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;if the benefits outweigh the cons
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;But like at the end of the day, more end users need to take responsibility for the data that they upload...
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I usually skim over it just to have an idea how secure my data will be, but in the end it all comes down to how badly I need to use that app
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I agree privacy laws and all but like it was you who agreed and uploaded the data..
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;The terms of service that require "your immortal soul" always gets me
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;there's always an option for me so I am not really bothered by the compulsions to accept cookies or terms and conditions or show them my location
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;when you get a car you go through hours with an agent
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Works for me
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;How to have some agency about your privacy online
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room: how to exercise some agency about your online privacy?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;good discussion!
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;Yes!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah :)
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;my question beyond the breakout room: I wanted to know what people think a person with agency on the internet looks like
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;@Dayne My image, to keep it brief would be some very tech savvy person
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Well depends on what the definition of agency is
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly - everyone defines it differently haha
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;@Dayne someone who emulates their operating system on a vm and bounces their ip using a vpn
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;That's a tricky phrase
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;...god people, this is the nth time we direct messaged the prof...
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;So it might be good to clarify what agency means and what that SHOULD look like.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;The fact that your mobile devices are listening to you all the time, and if you speak something around it, you will get ads and recommendation based on that topic.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I f it is two parties being transparent with each other then they kinda have it they just can tell us all the bad things they are doing and all the good
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;we need an universal agency?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;time to put my phone in a faraday cage...
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;lmao
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;maybe it is because social sites are basically free so they ARE taking data to make money?
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;some of those things I don’t even think about anymore
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;But like us end users decide to use it so can we really put the entire blame on the companies?
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;sites that need payment upfront to use do not sell data or privacy
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Are these companies really doing anything wrong? Of course it's an invasion to our privacy, but we're all agreeing to it in the terms of service
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly, I 100% agree with @Reanne
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's ethical
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;time is money and they aren't leaving you enough time to read
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I also agree with that point
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I'd say yes it's wrong. Legality != morality
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Just my opinion though
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;agree David
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Everyone's in a business LOL. Everyone makes money by somehow doing something ethically wrong to other person
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I do blame the companies. If they provide a unique service - like Facebook, whose user base is part of the value of the service - the terms of service can be coercive. If the user doesn't accept them, they can't use the service - so they may agree to things they normally wouldn't.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;When everything we do is highly dependent on the use of internet services, they need to change the legality of it to protect our privacy
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;waste of time to try because I like my life easy so it’s just a little price I pay for it
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;It's definitely not ethically right but I think that's how they're avoiding conflict with the government
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Depends
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with you, Michael.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Unlike you Bilal, I won't give up
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Yes it's totally fair in my opinion
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I like to think so
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;its my privacy so I should decide what I want to do with it
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;It's a bizarre twist on 1984
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;It depends on what service I am giving up my privacy for
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I will bite my foot off of facebook's trap if I need to
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;aah watched that film
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;a good one
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I wonder how gives out our cell numbers to spammers
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;*who
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;job sites most likely
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;i am not any of them
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like what the data is being used for and who will get to view the data needs to be defined.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Like to the user
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;anywhere that you give your phone number and it’s public can also be used against you
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I think firm and fair regulation is the only way to ensure consumer privacy. Companies have incentives to seek data for profit, we can expect that they'll do so as long as it's legal, so the best way to address the issue is to draw clear and firm boundaries around how to respect privacy.
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;never read the poem, watched the movie on pol pot genocide in the same name tho
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Interesting poem, Prof
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Ok let's look at it this way. We all agree that "selling" data is ethically wrong, well then how is retail business ethical where they sell a $3 product for $100? We don't mind that LOL
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;That I agree with
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;because retail only harms our pockets
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;not our souls
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;data is worth more than just currency, true
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;@Panth If someone sells a $3 hammer for $100, that's different from if someone is selling my private information. I value my privacy more than some object, and someone selling it affects me in ways that someone profiting off selling an object doesn't.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I mean people did have a problem with massive mark ups when they bought out all the santitary wipe ans stuff when the pandemic started
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;yes!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Of course!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;true
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Yass
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;loved judgement day
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;agree
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I just lovethe Skynet memes
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;The first 2 are the best
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg is a terminator IMO...
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;yeah same clothes everyday, just need to peel that mask off
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;With Starlink coming up, what is to stop some rouge AI to just turn that into Skynet?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I must loosen the face skin with excess sunscreen lest people find out....
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;but I though zucc was a lizard
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;lizard-man from lizard planet
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;https://medium.datadriveninvestor.com/the-dataism-are-you-a-dataist-c102de049204
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;google "MArk Zuckerberg sunscreen"
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Hahahah that is a good image
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;ill admit, he does work out his glutus maximus...
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;When we get identified, we can be judged with a bias...
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Your efforts to anonymize the transcripts are much appreciated, thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Why? should I not have ownership of the ideas and thoughts that I share in this class?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I think you've put in a lot of effort into making this class an ethical course and I think you've done very well :)
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;no, give em to me!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I had a friend flagged for crying lol
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Ok ill stop
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I have a computer science professor who is very firm on using ProctorTrack in a 400 level class lol
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;that's interesting things to flag for
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Gotta hold those tear back next time ahaha
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Proctor track probes your entire network. It told me I had to shut off certain devices and I dont see why it needs to go that far through my privacy
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I have a question regarding privacy: What term/condition would completely turn you away from using an app?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;That is the one thing software don't have
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Panth, do everything you can to thwart the proctal exa...I mean proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;People will find a way
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;play games, and get played
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;It allows cross website tracking
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;hahahhaa
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;ahahah
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;fuggin, put a laptop right outside your window XD
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I had no clue it looked into your network too, that’s kinda crazy aha
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Prof, TV is still like $60
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Ya I didn’t know that either tbh
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;people are still cheating even in proctored exams idk what the point
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;its expensive, I like the free radio
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;true Raj, I would even say it people are more entitled to cheat
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;But with those things they are usually voluntary. If you want a better insurance rate because you follow the rules of the road go for it
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;cheating is best rebellion to prototrack
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;"If you are not hiding anything, you got nothing to worry about!"
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;already heard lots of student to say that they pre-recorded and uploaded that in proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;oh my my my lmao
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah it lost it at my Chromecast Audio too
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;i still haven't had any proctored exams till now so i dont know much about it
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Well the teacher allows that I have multiple devices hook up with the wifi and it did not do anything
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Lucky you, proctortrack really spikes the cortisol
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;thank you prof
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I've had 1 proctored exam and the prof kept it open book and allowed us anything to search up the answers, so I'm really not sure why he used the software in the first place
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I have proctored exam tomorrow aha fun midterm worth 30%
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;good luck buddy
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;what course bilal?
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Wait so in my room itself, there are 11 devices connected to the network, will that be a problem?
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;yea thx aha, cs 310
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Woops not used to haveing two keegans
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Many of the teachers outside of the filed of CS just really don’t know how it works I feel.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;field*
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;no offence nor judging but many are still not familiar with even ur courses
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;if UR courses is too difficult for people, what will they use then? homing pigeon?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;mail?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;The online transition for some profs would've been pretty large, I could see that. Especially if they aren't in a technical field
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;What are the topics for blog 2?
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;no i am talking about proffs
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;and not the whole ur courses but mainly the quizzes and exams that are given through UR courses
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Its fine
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;me
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;It works fine for me
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I am comfortable with URcourses
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I'm definitely comfortable with it
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I like UR courses makes handing in easy
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;all good
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I am totally down
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;UR courses is fine for me
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I like its dark mode so far
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;me too
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Dark mode is great til you have to use a comment field, and then its dark grey on darker grey
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Ur course's exams are better than TopHat ones
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;its got some issues but better than being flashbanged
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;This semester alone I have to use Wiley plus, vital source and urourses just to monitor what’s up in my courses
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I like UR Courses quite a bit, very easy to navigate, allows for easy communication with professors
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I mean you could also argue that the money spent on proctor track could have been put to better use
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;faster servers
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah! Or even more simple approach like having a pdf document to be downloaded, then scanning in your solutions as a different file.
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Proctortrack was hacked last year, makes no sense to use it
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;If people want to cheat they can still cheat.
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;if you are in a class with more than 100 students, UR courses is definitely going down during exams
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Money is not a problem, our tuition covers the cost no problem hahah
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;true, services like TurnItIn are reasonable!
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Money is always a problem haha
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Why there is Scarcity
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;wiley plus needs member ship as well as vital source needs subscription for the book.
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Instead professors should design exams that are harder to cheat on..
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;or assignments
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I mean a sticky note beats proctor track
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;hahahah thanks for the idea Keegan
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;time limits can be too unreasonable I would say
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Literally hear of people using a sticky note on the monitor yeah lmao
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;So was it a good use of resources ?
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;I had a professor for math class last year and it would be near impossible to cheat on that exam as students could barely finish in allotted time if they had done all the studying
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;ah yes
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;rushed math got us to the moon
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Mandeep was that for 221?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^^^^
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;my engl final was 6 hour long, imagine it being proctored , thankfully it was not
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like I had the same prof
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I hated 221
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Ya I was in that class to keegan
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;116, 221 was similar but I was talking about 116
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;but mine was in person
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah I thought you were in a couple of my classes
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;before covid
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;What prof was it for 221? I am currently taking it and now I'm worried lol
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;do not take Fernando for math 221
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;^
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;before covid, people had a chance to meet in person to study, there is more to learn than just colors on a screen
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I second that Rhythm
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Guys has anyone here taken CS 473 before?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;It was Fernando hahahah
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I'm retaking 221 with Remus and it's 10000% better
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;well I'm bad at math theories and he focuses on that heavily. if you have no issues with theory go for it
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;No, I really liked the conversation today though :)
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Remus is an angel
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Also yes Remus is an angel
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;221 by karen meagher, might be the one
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;REMUS RULES
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;yes I heard that haha
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/11/privacy-pressure-points-a-closer-look-at-ten-consumer-privacy-protection-act-concerns/
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;you guys can try Juliana if she is teaching, good prof
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;So not even necessarily encryption, but just removing the metadata that relates the data back to a person?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;the bare minimum, just the way the government makes em...
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Always born Jan 1, baby
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I do
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;I just give random birthday

    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah same, random day and year
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I do. Birthdates can be used for verification
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Feb 29 for the win
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Haha Panth
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Eg when I worked at SaskTel, birthdates were a verification option
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;sometimes it works being born just last year
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I tried but another organization has my birthday just posted online first page when you google my name
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I just always use jan1 1985
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;ah yes but now we know that, David..... *evil laugh*
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;:c
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Speedskater
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;short track

    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;when will we expect feedback on our bolg1
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Do you want it to be double spaced or just standard?
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;how many word we need for the Project Proposal？
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;1-2 page ^
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;so no specific style as long as it looks good?
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;For the research paper option, are you looking for the paper to be formatted in apa?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;perfect, quintupled spaced it is...
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl! Great class today, I had fun.
