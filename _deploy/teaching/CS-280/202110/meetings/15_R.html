      While not directly related to the main topic of today's lecture, I found the original discussion on where you should post the event invitation online fairly interesting. Despite being what is ideally an “open” environment, many of the different social media/community sites have vastly different use cases, despite falling under very similar classifications. What may be seen as appropriate to post onto Facebook, can be inappropriate or out of place to post in Instagram or Snapchat, despite the three of those platforms having a large overlap in user bases. To me at least, it seems like a form of segmentation,...
    </li><li>
      In today's meeting, I had a bit of trouble navigating claim rights and liberty rights and how they interact with regards to the internet."Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person has a claim right against someone else, that other person's liberty is thus limited."Looking at these, it seems like they defeat each other and you can end up with a cyclical sort of...
    </li><li>
      Something we discussed in class that I would like to know more about is the Aspen Institute. We discussed in class how the Aspen Institute is funded by Facebook and was made to help address social issues across the United States. As we have discussed in previous classes, Facebook and other social media platforms have exacerbated many social issues like polarization and social distrust. So is Facebook using the Aspen Institute as a ‘band-aid’ PR move to help with their current negative public image, or was it built with good intentions in mind? This sounds like an interesting discussion topic....
    </li><li>
      It was another interesting meeting in which we discussed about Claim rights and liberty rights.Claim rights are the rights that entitle the responsibilities, duties on other parties regarding the right holder.Liberty rights are the rights which does not entail obligations on other parties.These rights are applied on many different things such as essays, research papers, informative article, videos etc.We also did the breakout room to discuss the same things.
    </li><li>
      I would suggest doing a multiple-choice poll of what kind of social media platform do the students have. That would be a wiser choice for time than waiting for people to answer in the chat.There are laws that companies usually follow when operating online. While people can do whatever they want with some consequence. If they are an online troll, then they could get banned from one platform; then they can just create another account. There are instances of people losing their job because of the kinds of stuff they posted online, so they are held accountable for their actions....
    </li><li>
      After reading an article "Weave: The social fabric project I learned a new word called weaver. Weaver means the people who make efforts to build connections between people and make each person valued. They see the community as their home. In America their are crisis of connection between people they feel isolated and weavers is the community of people that are helping them to lead love in all people.
    </li><li>
      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting:The weave topic, claim rights and the liberty rights as discussed and the registration for them Robotic Mars Exploration.the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:The concept from past meeting is the democracy of the internet usagewhat you would like to know more about:I would like to know more about the liberty rights as a software developersomething you encountered that is related to the past meeting:the empathy discussion and democracy of internet
    </li><li>
      Our discussion during class about “What are your rights and responsibilities online and upon what do they depend?” was quite exciting. I also learned about the differences between claim rights and liberty rights and how they are inverse of each other. I would like to know more about how these rights play a role in advancement of technology and how they shape technology.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 15, There is a topic name "Weave The Social Fabric Project ", it about America need to build communication system for their citizen and arrange worker to spread this idea. Because America had many social problem came out since last year, Most of their citizen have their own survival system. If other want to break the balance of their system, it won't work. Liberty rights in America is unlimited, their citizen thinking of right is important to anything. So appropriate restrictions are necessary, even if it is unacceptable at beginning.
    </li><li>
      In our 15th meeting we discussed claim rights, liberty rights, online rights, online responsibilities and the rights to privacy. Claim rights are rights that other people or parties have responsibilities to do for the right holder. Liberty rights are liberties and freedoms a rights holder have. When it comes to online rights we discussed how much of claim rights to liberty rights should there be. Another discussion that came about with rights is what exactly were the kinds of online responsibilities should internet users have. Lastly we discussed about privacy and how much should people have or be willing to...
    </li><li>
      in meeting 15, I learned about the act of weaving. Weaving is a project that aims to build social trust to address the root cultural cause behind many social problems. I actually believe this would help solve the issues of isolation and help people connect more helping reduce the use of social space as a comfort means.
    </li><li>
      Today's society is different from before, computers play an important role in our life. I think its right to computer use also becomes very important. For example, freedom, people have the freedom to use computers. Since computers are our private property, we also have claims and rights to them.
    </li><li>
      we discussed about mars exploration, talked about rights on wikipedia.
    </li><li>
      We'll for this one, it was quite interesting talking about rights that these big companies will have since if we don't really have right for privercy and really currently we have no way to go and protect knowelged but at the same time if we do have rights will cause that we might lose people talking about things that they don't know about but they still have a useful perspective.
    </li><li>
      Topics discussed today were quite different but something new for me. I like the concept about the claim and liberal rights. As the claim right requires other persons' liabilities, duties, or commitments, it seems to me like the right of some managers or authorities who can control their employees’ work in a professional manner. A liberty right, on the other hand, is a right that confers no duties on third parties, which is like the employees who work under those managers.
    </li><li>
      The ethics of rights on the InternetLast class we had a brief discussion and breakout room on the subject of rights on the Internet. Or more specifically which rights should we have on the internet. One of ideas my group came up with alluded to information processing. The internet is an undisputedly a hub of shared information to be gained by anyone who is willing to spend the time to learn. Therefore, it should be us who are held accountable when presenting varying pieces of information on the web. Be it on social media, email or even over the phone,...
    </li><li>
      In our last lecture, we talked about claim and liberal rights. A claim right is a right that requires other parties' responsibilities, duties, or obligations in relation to the right-holder. The right to liberty, on the other hand, is everyone's right to personal liberty, including freedom of movement and freedom from arbitrary imprisonment by others.
    </li><li>
      I think we need to look over claim rights vs liberty rights online. My group discussion came mostly to you should have the same rights you have in person. However people tend to be more rude over the internet with that loss of human contact making it easier to be rude to people you cant see. So I would like to disscuss this further with what else people think would be the best way to solve it.
    </li><li>
      In, Weave, The Social Fabric Project from the Aspen Institute. In this nation, people get an interaction recession. Individuals feel alienated, invisible and in prison camps. Community resentment and separation underlies our most important matters, from ongoing economic and racial unfairness to political deadlock, a pandemic of hopelessness, and increasing suicide and overdose deaths. Resentment helps to keep us all from addressing problems such as poverty, unemployment, starvation and global warming. Weave encourages the several Americans in every society that perform to build social trust and weave neighbours together to enhance their societies.
    </li><li>
      Claim rights and liberty rightsIn the last meeting, the professor talked about claim rights and liberty rights. A claim right is a right to entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder. And liberty right is a right that does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder. So, claim rights and liberty rights are inversed.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed about the online event by Larry Matthies on Robotic Mars Exploration and how to register for the event. Later we discussed about Weave project and then about claim rights and liberty rights in society.
    </li><li>
      according to me the rights and responsibilities of a person online are in the hands of the developer. what he/she expects from one while using their interface, accordingly the preamble of rights and responsibility would be created for the users. To me as a future professional here learn to provide users a safe and objection-free digital environmnent.
    </li><li>
      It's interesting talking about liberty and claim rights. It makes me think of people being censored online for saying inappropriate and seemingly evil things. There is a lot of talk about the freedom of speech but there is also an obligation to censor awful hateful speech. I want to make it clear that I think people shouldn't be able to spread hatred. It's interesting because out in the real world you can be hateful with words and people won't react well to it but it's not necessarily illegal, but in online spaces it's a whole new world where censorship is...
    </li><li>
      In terms of the internet when it comes to rights and liberties it seems to mostly revolve around personal reasonability. The internet is to an extent the "wild west" (although this has been rapidly changing) there are not many limits on what can be accessed, posted, and viewed online. When it comes to rights the internet is a very difficult thing to legislate. One could say they have a right to the internet, but everything that follows gets muddied. Does one have the legal right on the internet to access say, pirated material, for example? Each country can set different...
    </li><li>
      I believe your rights online come from the rules (and what is socially acceptable) of the platform you're participating on. If you're a platform designer, then the rights you provide come from law. The more interesting part is responsibility, which some people would say you have none. Personally, I feel that everyone has a responsibility as a user or creator to at least try to not be a negative on society. However, I'm not sure that we can realistically expect anything of everyone, but I also don't like the idea of limiting rights. It's still unclear to me if limiting...
    </li><li>
      I found the claim rights vs. liberty rights a very interesting concept that goes well beyond simply the scope of this course and technology as a whole, and in that sense I would like to know more regarding this argument. Being a CS student who is very tired of math, I think its definitely a fresh change of pace to dive into a more philosophical type of question.
    </li><li>
      On meeting 15, we’ve discussed Rights and responsibilities, Especially, I would like to talk about the claim rights and liberty rights. The claim right is the right that takes the responsibility or obligation for a right-holder. However, the liberty right is the right that not taking the responsibility or obligation for a right-holder, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder. The claim rights more likely tells you what you can't do, the liberty right is what you can do.
    </li><li>
      The last meeting was quite interesting to participate as our last meeting’s discussion topic was about liberty and claim rights. What i got from the overall discussion is that liberty is synonymous of freedom, i.e. every person has the liberty to live according to themselves. It doen not
    </li><li>
      I Was wondering if you could talk about the final exam. A claim right is a right which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder while a liberty right is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder. could you talk more about the Robotic Mars Exploration too.
    </li><li>
      There is a relationship and precedence that links liberty rights and claim rights, especially online. While we, as users, have the liberty of expression, we also have to ensure that our online speech is not hateful, inappropriate, or harmful. Making this moral decision and enforcing it universally is difficult, if not impossible. Thus, regulation of online activity is required, but by whom? Should we rely on governments or online committees of people to regulate activities, or algorithms and bots? The former option is difficult due to the profound amount of online media that exists, while the latter lacks human context....
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we discuss the responsibilities and rights of online and what they depend on. Computerized rights, firmly connected to the opportunity of expression and privacy, are those that permit individuals to get to, use, make and distribute advanced media, just as access and use PCs, other electronic gadgets, and correspondence organizations. what's more, the duties are to Respect the feelings and thoughts of others. Submit to all licensed innovation laws. Try not to utilize or share others' work without authorization. Observe rules or potentially implicit rules for each Internet webpage.
    </li><li>
      The last meeting was quite interesting to participate as our last meeting’s discussion topic was about liberty and claim rights. What i got from the overall discussion is that liberty is synonymous of freedom, i.e. every person has the liberty to live according to themselves. It does not defines anyone’s obligations towards the right holder. On contrary, claim rights are just inverse of liberty as it does say that other party or we can say authorities have the responsibility regarding right holder, to make sure that their claim rights are not violated by anyone. Other than that in breakout rooms...
    </li><li>
      I really liked the discussion about the relationship and precedence between claim rights and liberty rights. Although we have liberty, there is a responsibility that supersedes this. So we have freedom of expression and speech online, but a limited free reign. We also need to have responsibility and regulation of hate speech, cyberbullying, false information and spamming which is annoying a lot and so on.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting professor showed us how to register for the webinar by Larry Matthies and in the later part we discussed about the liberty and civil rights for a developer.In the Breakup room we discussed that cannot do anything in terms of protecting our privacy once we post something on internet its out of our rich to protect it. we need an independent body which deals with our data privacy form this big tech companies link google and facebook.
    </li><li>
      I believe that a perfect a perfect balance of claim and liberty rights should be sought after especially in the tech industry. Sometimes people can feel entitled when they own products or pay for services, that they believe they can just do as they please without needing to think of how actions can affect others. If we also lean towards too much claim rights then things will be too restricted which can hinder progress or entice conflict within the community.
    </li><li>
      After reading about the Weave project I realized that they were right about how with all the technology we have today we can connect to anyone but we rarely connect as people and get to know each other. Which has created walls and barriers between us as a society.  
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I have learned from this meeting is about our rights and responsibilities online. I believe you have the freedom to do whatever you want online as long as it is not illegal. Online activities that promote hatred and lies should be discouraged as well similar to what Twitter decided to do recently. Several students mentioned privacy which is important as well. I believe the online community would be a better place if people behave similar to how they do in real life. We have a responsibility to create better online communities.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I took out from last class was the difference between claims rights and liberty rights. The concept that was most difficult for me to understand was second order liberties, such as powers and immunities. Although it was not discussed in depth during meeting 15, I am very excited, and would like to learn more about, robotic Mars exploration. I am eager to learn about this from the guests speaker via virtual webinar. Other than that, I would also like to learn more about Weave. I have encountered discussed about the topic of claim rights and liberty...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we get information about an interesting topic which is an article about the weave the social fabric project from here we get a new word that is weaver which means the people who makes the effort to build connections between the people and make each person valued and also learn about that the Aspen Institute is funded by the Facebook and also the other social media platforms have helped many social issues such as polarization. apart from that wed discussed in Brooms some privacy rights that are under liberty which is the synonyms for the freedom...
    </li><li>
      As the internet lets a user use the information collected from different sources it’s user’s right to make the decision .Privacy setting plays an important role as it lets a user protect the information but there should be a user guide for how to manage the privacy settings that makes it easier for a user to make changes because sometimes the media is set up with the full privacy.
    </li><li>
      Something I would like to learn more about is the responsibility differences between online and physical environments. Originally, I thought it was intuitive that we could find analogs between the physical and online environments, and thus relate the responsibility through these analogs. For example, we could find that Wikipedia (online) is analogous to a public library (physical) and thus we should share many of the same responsibilities (i.e. don't add books/text that spread misinformation for example). However, there are very distinct differences between the two (such as anonymity of Wikipedia), so is this analogous method appropriate to use?
    </li><li>
      In last meeting professor was asking everyone to join a facebook event call; Robotic Mars Exploration. It Seems very interesting. Beside that he again talked about the project topics. We also had a breakout season about online rights.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we discussed about the upcoming seminar by Larry Matthies about Robotic Mars Exploration. We were discussing about the correct platform to invite many people to join this seminar. After that, we had a bit discussion about project proposal. Then, we had a breakout room where we discussed about the online rights and responsibilities.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 15, we discuss about Robotic Mars Exploration, it about Dr. Larry Matthies uses his expertise and technology to autonomously navigate robotic ground and aerial vehicles on Earth and space.And talk about the Social Fabric Project, which solves the fundamental cultural roots behind many social problems in the United States.
    </li><li>
      Last Class, we discuss claim rights and liberty rights, which both are important rights in society. These two kinds of powers are inherent rights of people. A person has the right to claim his surplus-labour income freely. It is inviolable.
    </li><li>
      At the beginning of this meeting, we discussed how to register ourselves for the event which will be with NASA scientists. After that in the breakout room, we discussed how our privacy and security or our moment on the internet is tracked by some organization or is not safe. we concluded that it should not be easy for everyone to track the web activity of others, it should only be in the hands of the government.
    </li><li>
      The most interesting thing for me was how customers data is tracked in and linked, i already had the basic idea before but after attending the lecture i have now greater vision of how things work and how data is manipulated
    </li><li>
      In response to the question asked in class regarding what are my rights and responsibilities online and upon what do they depend, I think that my right and responsibilities online should be no different than the right I have online. However, I don't think that is the case. At this point, I do not have confidence to say that I do have rights online. Usually, the developers decide on the extent of a users rights and responsibility. There are applications that do let you know what will be done like for example some apps will ask for permission on whether...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, I learnt that the differences between claim right and liberty right.A Claim Right is a right which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties regarding the right-holder.In contrast, a liberty right is a right which does not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder.Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person has...
    </li><li>
      As I investigate more into surveillance capitalism and how technology is weaving its way into every one of our moves, the more I wonder how many people actually know what is going on. I assume that the average person is not reading the fine print of the technologies they are using everyday and fail to understand how they work. Yet when made aware that their devices are "listening" to them and tracking their data, the general population is absolutely appalled and made incredibly uncomfortable.
    </li><li>
      I appreciate the concept of "weaving" from The Social Fabric Project. However, it is quite sad that the listed qualities of "weaving" need to be discussed and promoted, opposed to being natural to everybody. For example, it states "A weaver treats neighbors as family regardless of outward differences". I wish this was a universal trait that didn't need to be discussed. It really shouldn't be hard to treat others with proper respect and care or be an advocate for positivity. Hopefully one day we can get closer to the perfect world where people are inherently good.
    </li><li>
      Most people seem indifferent, but I have found the topic of rights and responsibilities online to sometimes escalate quickly. In the end, it is always the lack of transparency or education that causes confusion, and even anger. Times have changed dramatically but some mindsets have not. In this information age, it should be obvious by now that there has to be some level of responsibility online. If all we care about is streaming Netflix and shopping online, or worse, we believe in the “nothing to hide argument”, then perhaps our data collected is warranted.
    </li><li>
      In the previous meeting an interesting discussion was held on the topic "Claim rights and liberty rights". I would like to get more knowledge about it and we also discussed it in the breakout rooms.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 15 we discussed about the critical examination of computing. In the breakout room we discussed abut the challenges faced by computing. We also had a scope of the assumptions.
    </li><li>
      In todays class we discussed about liberty rights and claims rights . A claim right is a right that requires other parties' responsibilities, duties, or obligations in relation to the right-holder. A liberty right, on the other hand, is a right that confers no responsibilities on third parties but only rights or permission on the right-holder.A negative right is a right for me to be protected from harm if I try to get something for myself. A positive right would be my right to have something provided for me.
    </li><li>
      The class was about claim right and liberty right and discussed about peoples right on group discussion. Moreover, I learnt something new which is social weave, they are taking really good step to help people. I am excited to attend the seminar of the scientist from NASA.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about rights: Claim rights and Liberty rights. At the end of the meeting we also had some discussion on Weave project that I want to discuss more.
    </li><li>
      I am really very excited and eager for the meeting regarding the NASA mars rover. I learnt about the liberty right and claim rights and discussed in group discussion in what aspects they are different from one another and wanted to learn about liberty right especially.
    </li><li>
      The topic of last meeting was claim rights and liberty. From meeting i have learnt that liberty means freedom and everyone has freedom to do whatever they want . On the other hand claim rights say that other parties or authorities have the responsibility that claim rights of right holder should not be violated by anone.the breakout room topic dissolved was on some basic privacy rights
    </li><li>
      I got to learn about the Claim rights and Liberty rights which was interesting. It was also pretty exciting to know about public even happing on Robotics Mars Exploration.
    </li><li>
      Professor gave us insights about liberty rights and claim rights in the context of technological world. He also enlighten us with a term “weaver” which implies weavers make the effort to build those connections and make others feel valued. This term should really mark a great influence on ourselves and the programmers who develop a platform.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a discussion on Claim rights and Liberty rights. Moreover, at the end of class we had a breakout room to discuss some relevant points to that.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we talked about our rights and responsibilities as online users and its a topic I look forward to us discussing more. Also, the most interesting thing I learned was knowing about the social fabric project called Weave that aims to build social trust to address the root cultural cause behind many of America’s social problems.
    </li><li>
      In past meeting it was a great discussion on liberty rights and claim rights. also in breakout room we discussed some points of project with few classmates. I am very excited for meeting regarding NASA.
    </li><li>
      In the class, I learned that the mission of perseverance about life's possibilities on another planet and Dr. Larry Matthies was awarded for his work. Moreover, Weave is a project to build social trust in a society. In other words, Weave is a connection of happiness and be weaver is to care for others. Next, claim right is the right holder's duties on other parties, and liberty rights are the freedom for the holder.
    </li><li>
      I learnt that about the differences between liberty right and claim rightliberty right means people's right, freedom to do or have whatever, while claim right means obligation on people to allow or enable him to do or have whatever
    </li><li>
      I found it quite interesting how weaving can be something to be considered when creating social media platforms or what already created social platforms should plan to move towards as through this a safer community for everyone is created as everyone cares for one another
    </li><li>
      One thing I found interesting and amazing from this meeting was WEAVE. It's true that we have less trust on people around us and it will grow even bigger because of how our life changes from social gathering and interaction between people to social media where we communicate and show how we feel. No matter what social media and online interaction can never replace or give feeling that a physical interaction do and as result many people have started to feel lonely and less important to society. I think WEAVE is a nice way to bring people together although it...
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discussed about arguments and liberal rights.
    </li><li>
      Weave sounds like a cool project, a lot of people have social problems and being able to address that is very important. I wonder what else the future has in stock, I doubt we would've known about weave if we didn't have the technology but if people really do care i bet there would still be similar things without technology
    </li><li>
      Freedom is a social right—namely, the individual's right to choose the affairs involving himself. The choice right includes acceptance and rejection, or we can choose to be both "yes" and "no." For example, "belief" is a matter of personal freedom. The right of claim is the right to be realized by oneself, which requires the obligor to fulfill the obligation. That is to say, fighting for rights is the obligation of the obligee to himself.Therefore，Claim rights and liberty rights complement each other.
    </li><li>
      in the last meeting, we discussed about an interesting fact how internet data get tracked and how its insecure. Even though i am bit familiar about this thing before but we get in detail in the lecture and come to know how data is manipulated.
    </li><li>
      I learned about claim rights and liberty rights. A claim right involves other persons' responsibilities or obligations towards the right-holder, while a liberty right involves the right-holder's own freedoms or permissions. This means that a person can only have a liberty right as long as another person does not have a claim right which forbids them from exercising that right. In other words, a person has a right to do what they want so long as it does not infringe on the rights of another.
    </li><li>
      In my opinion, the so-called rights and obligations are difficult to be defined as a formula. So, in our life, how claim rights and liberty rights are realized and what are the constraints on these rights? At the same time, how do claim rights and liberty rights play their role in the cyber world? And will there be more limitations or overuse?
    </li><li>
      Everyone has a right to protect themselves while they are using the Internet. The difficulty with this is that claim rights and liberty rights interact with each other in really unclear ways and it is difficult to regulate them. Since the internet gives us an access to information it should be our right to make clear informed decisions based on information gathered. Moreover, rights and responsibilities of an individual online depends on how the developers implements the system. Rights and responsibilities online should depend and mirror the offline life. Overall, user's privacy on Internet is a right and it is...
    </li><li>
      Most of the current websites or network "facilities" are not disabled-friendly especially for people who can not see the screen. The current network is not barrier-free, for the disabled people, and I think that's what we still need working for.
    </li><li>
      In previous lecture the most important topic that I learnt about was of civil and liberty rights. I was also able to learn about social weave and moreover I am looking forward for NASA seminar.
    </li><li>
      Claim rights and liberty rights which we learn today is an instructing concept. We got to know about who this right is very important to make balance.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we saw a couple of things which included the Robotic Mars Exploration, aspen institute's weave which is the social fabric project and the wikipedia article on claim rights and liberty rights. Aspen's institute's weave project showed as the weaving theory which is basically method of lifestyle and emotional state and doesn't include a group of feelings or actions. also, it is nothing but basically regarding how you show your feelings or bring out emotions while interacting or communicating with the other person and not expecting any kind of thing in return. The main aim of this whole...
    </li><li>
      I learned about weaving in this meeting. I think we should all support weaving as it rebuilds and helps to strengthen the environment.
