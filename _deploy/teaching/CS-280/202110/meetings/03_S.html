    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I'll put those links up today and For for next role, watch the videos for next meeting. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So let me Go to Your courses here and So thank you for your intelligence on Thursday. For having to leave early and So just to give you an update. So my dad passed away over the weekend so Just dealing with a few issues there. From time to time over the past few days some phone calls and things But she was 98 she has a Good Life. Anyway, Just an update on the situation that Caused a short class on Thursday. Mother and I are able to have a video this it was here before she passed away. So that was a Nice. Reward of the technology. That we have these days. Thanks for the messages. I appreciate that. I'm I think I'm on track with everything now. And I just following up on my puppy video from Thursday we found out that Elgar's in a commercial first asked out And if anyone's seen this. Since 32nd video so just I don't need to play it. Anyway, I'll make sure that I put the link up for you if you're if you're like to look at it. This is Algar here is a Much smaller puppy. It's not doing much in this case. It's just being held by a little girl. So there's no No action. Anyway, I want to share that with you. Now let's go back to the To the your courses website.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Let me
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;See The people that it supports that these are good ideas but I couldn't do them in your courses. So, one of them was to Create
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;A
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;calendar entries for my office hours with a zoom link in them. Because I have three Three active classes this semester. This 1205 and the seminars. So would have been three sets of editing the calendar and I just didn't feel like that was gonna be a good use of my time so Here's the zoom office link. And here's the schedule. So I'm going to put The link in here as well. I haven't thought of a good way to do that. Let's see here. Here's the office, our schedule. So Monday to Monday to Thursday I have office hours every day. So from 1232 30 Mondays and Wednesdays and from 330 to 430 On Tuesdays and Thursdays. Okay, so there's that. And now I have The zoom meeting link. So this is the same link that we used to get in today. So use that. So I'm not going to send you this specific the separate invitation for every meeting. So just use this link for the semester. So that's only for class. So we don't need to share it with anybody else. Who might be inclined to assume bomb. Well, anyway, I won't even I'm loath to even create that possibility. And again, I think that was a 2020 think so we don't need to think about in 2021 Okay, so then engagement with meetings so i i thought i had set up this heading. For you on Thursday. But I'd set up in the other class. I'm trying to I'm I want to have two or five and two at look very similar in well. Because the things that are the same. I want them to be look the same. So I have this for two or five as well. And so my mistake to have Put it in one spot, but not the other. And this is another thing I talked about with your IT support. Because what I'd like to do is Well, To get feedback to get your input about The important thing we did with the last meeting. So, So they don't have to be long. But just to get you to think about what was the most important thing To learn from in the past, meeting the concept from the past meeting that was most difficult for you to understand what you'd like to know more about Something you encountered thats related to the past meeting. So if there's a Good story you read online or some other resource that you could include Those are the kinds of things that like you put in And so I had with my discussion with IT support. I said, I'd like to have these questions. time limits so that every So that you can Write something before the next meeting. And then Great. And Are really acknowledge that And then move on to the next one. So they said, we don't really need to have a separate form for every question. For every meeting. And I'm skeptical. So I'm going to test it again today. And I think what I need. What I need to do is have a separate For Engaging with meeting to meeting three is meeting for although we have to meeting 26 And so to get the 10 marks. So what I'm thinking of is Again around meeting three but so give a few days to get this sorted out. And then we can Take the 2020 best Responses you have so And then that'll come up to the market of 10 Every one of them is not Not worth a lot, but it's a process to keep you involved. And That makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I'm sorry, can you just go over that again. I think I got last one away.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I'm good. So this time. Oh, I didn't realize there were that many Okay, so a lot of people wrote for the meeting to and So I'll put those in I won't let those go to waste. So what I did for meeting three was So I just create a question for meeting three and I said include your response. So the response should look like. This your response can include one or more of the following the most important thing you learned from the meeting. The concept from this meeting that was most difficult for you to understand what you'd like to know more about Something you encountered that is related
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;The meeting.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I'm asking. So when I have a question for meeting three and next time we'll have a question for meeting for I'm just, I want you to give me some your response. Like what you felt was most interesting all this was most difficult to understand, what would you like to know more about sending encountered thats related to the past meeting. Or something like A resource. That make more sense.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Yep, yep. Thank you. Um, and then one, one last thing. Can you also Turn like allow us to turn off notifications, because if everyone replies to it, we will be getting 96 like responses in our email box and that seems a little bit excessive.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So no, it does. And I was going to do that for me. Too, so
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Okay, cool. Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So why don't we do that right now. So this is a get to see a bit of your courses interface. Well, it's, it's not so much your course. It's mostly Moodle a few customizations. So you're doing better with responsive design here accepts it maybe it's a little squished. The left hand menu with it. A little bit better. Description See Dave plumbers talk in December Task Manager. Okay. So he told a version of this story about Microsoft help So he used the helicopter. See, I've heard it with a Cessna or small single engine plane pilot is lost any You see that there's somebody an office building with window open, so he knows where am I, and the guy says you're in a plane above Seattle. And then you really figure out where he is, and is able to find the airport. And the, the punch line is that The response we got was Actually correct but not helpful. So you news at Microsoft. And then you can just navigate the airport there. So So Dave Palmer worked for 10 years at Microsoft. He was He was the Creator of Microsoft Task Manager. And he was a he's an alumnus of the Department So the twist that he threw in the story was That the people who are now a copter. Which makes Conversation with somebody new office building a little easier to Manage I think This is I was gonna Say that the help in on Moodle is a bit like that. Like it says what the subscription disabled subscriptions lot Doesn't say what the implication of subscriptions, not being allowed up is That's not the one that I want. Tracking I'm not seeing it. A hand. I thought there was a notification thing. I don't need you to
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Wouldn't you want to just change for subscription to optional subscription, because then we can take if we want to subscribe to that forum thread or not.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Why don't we just make it Disabled how's that
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good to me.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Like that. In the read tracking I think could even be optional.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Sure. So we'll see how this goes for option. Then you'll know that they're there, and where they'll be
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I'm also would you, what would we could we get an approximation of when you'll be reading these or is this just like a Participation mind.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So, My intent is to to grade them. Before the next Meeting so So what I'm thinking of is If you don't, if you don't write anything then you zero If you write something that But it's not really If you give kind of The Help like Just stating something And I don't see where you've engaged with the meeting. Then I'll give you a one. And then if you do something thats related to How I've laid them out and I'll give you a to So, My echo there. So the idea is if you can get up, he get 01 or two for each of 20 now 23 meetings and then that takes the best 20 of those. So that gives a market of The highest mark for that could be 40 And And converts into a market for the final grade. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So,
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Make sense
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Yep, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I have to struggle with the I don't want to say struggle. I have to engage with the gradebook to get that setup. So the comes up properly. Categorization stuff doesn't Work as well. I'd like to Where's the way that I think it should work. Okay, so This is a topic. That will be looking at. So maybe I can If we're not subscribing to them, then I'll see if there's a way to point them out. Anyway, so then one nice thing about your courses is that You can't see what other people have written until you write something yourself. So it's an episode called a Q AMP a forum. Anyway, okay, Okay. So that was a screen annotation by Dave. It looks like. I think there's lots of interesting features here.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I want to encourage your engagement in the in the meetings, but Just be mindful of. How you're interacting with your engagement interacts with other people. Okay, so I I promised I was going to have a syllabus ready in PDF form last week and I was editing today. But then I got network problems and I kind of ran out of time. I just just fix some links on it, but I'll show it to you. So we have individual assignments were 35 And then a project that can people either individual or in a small group is 25 small group that you pick And then the final exam will be 25 and participation will be five. And we'll I'll get the attendance set up for next week, next meeting. My offices in zoom and the hours. I'll put that link in to my schedule that I showed you earlier. So the click along. So this is, are you our courses link that we're in presently And this is my Web page. For the class. Final exam is sometime in April, I think it's Season 20 20th, the 29th. I believe Figure out those details. So the calendar description for the course is social context of competing case study human computer interfaces and their evaluation. methods and tools of analysis professional and ethical responsibilities risk risks and I believe computer based systems intellectual property privacy and civil liberties professional communication sustainability cybercrime So a range of topics. And This has kind of been a nice reference to look at So it's nothing to buy, but it's online. I haven't checked that link this year, but I believe it's still good. So you can download the chapters. Individually And there's some other material there. So a little bit about expectations. Technology provides many benefits to enjoy. But there are also risks. That this course is an introduction to the life in this digital world. And a conclusion of the course, you're expected to understand these risks and rewards and the trade offs. Involved attendance and participation in all aspects of the course are encouraged your tenants will indicate year agreement to be involved into encourage the involvement of everyone in class. So have individual assignments were 35 And first one I will Ready for you to discuss starting tomorrow in our next meeting. And then the project. Ideas, you can have a number of different ways to You can have different deliverables and different kinds of Not, not just writing an essay, go to could be Writing solution Wikipedia or writing something for writing some code and so on. So we can talk about that more that comes along. To the final exam. So see my father passed the course. So it's not meant to be a threat. And I'm not so nor am I trying to Get somebody to not pass the final So I believe we have some options for how the final is delivered. So we can discuss that over the semester. And we'll talk about that. In in the coming eating. The coming weeks of the semester. There is no midterm exam. So five markets are for participation. And then I have some discretion. And then there's research credit Can be 101 or 2% depending So you can participate in most two studies. But then there might not be any so then that would be the zero So you know that one leaves any marks for there not being any opportunities, but Possible possibility there. So if there are any there. I will let you know. Anyway, so This looks like I've competed on a spreadsheet, but I've done it by hand. And I believe that it does add up to 100. So let me just check here with you so 35 plus 25 Is 60 plus 10 is 70 Plus 25 is 95 And then participation is five. So that makes it 100 Okay, so I'm just gonna fix up the links and then I'll make it Available later today. in PDF form. Okay. Okay, so Many people get a chance to see the videos from last day. The moral operating system and Code.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Yep.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. I'm gonna try something. So it's kind of planning using Polls but the pole in Zoom is
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Not
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;It has its limitations. I find To give you a sense of what Computing is useful for is The purpose of computing
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I mean I think basically they were saying that computing is an expanding industry that crosses multiple fields, basically.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I found that it almost felt like kind of like a recruiting drive to get people to go out and do coding because of these cool workplaces. We work in and how many jobs are available. I felt very I felt kind of weird about it. So I felt very like Not cruelty, but kind of very showing just all the positives of coding and was kind of good contrast to the second video. So it was very recruiting driving branded
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Different People from different aspects of life and different professions are interested in coding and how it can provide that creative outlet to some people as well.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I think one of the big focuses was a kind of how focus or how are coding it, it's like limitless basically like with possibilities and the routes you can pursue and different things like that. There's just so many opportunities in decoding world.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Another aspect I found on the second video was how much or how little should be used personal user data that is given to us from our programs and from our coding
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so I think the connection with the second video is something about Let me just say rah rah rah. Where people to write code or come and join us and see like you can skateboard inside the office building and have Free And you can have as many cappuccinos or Chia Seed smoothies, as you want. And everything's good.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Was also to get rid of the misconception that coding is difficult, although people said that it doesn't. You don't have to be a genius to do coding
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I definitely liked how they touched on the fact that it's not all math, particularly, you know, there's a lot of community and teamwork involved in creativity, stuff like that.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;From what I understood of how they talked about coding and learning. It is. It's like using an instrument. It's like using a tool sure you'll be it'll be tough in the beginning to learn but You can make create amazing things out of it. Once you're well versed or even professional using set Tool.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Mm hmm. So I think it was Doug Engelbart the fellow who Developed the first mouse computer mouse. Said that You know, Is easier to to ride, but it's I'm paraphrasing substantially because I don't recall the Industry called the the the generalities, but I'll look for the specifics You know if you think between a tricycle and a bicycle. Bicycle is easier to get on and go somewhere right away because it's stability but It's limited. I mean, you can go further and faster with a bicycle. But it's harder to learn So that that may be relevant to us. Occurred to me when we're talking about Learning Curve. So how many people are finding my writing. Legible or Not so bad, or
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;It's pretty good. I can read it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, well, I'm pretty good. I was. I didn't think I would get that that high rating.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I can read it, but I've been known to be able to decipher pretty bad writing. So I'm not sure I'm a good person to ask
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah so i i i have the handwriting of a medical doctor on prescription pads, I guess. Anyway, which which are notoriously bad which is Not a standard for legibility right But I can try and correct the slant here. The name. Introducing So a few other this Is maybe a good way to Press to engage with our discussion by creating some notes like this. And I'll make them available this picture. Okay, so So there's one out there. The people there that come to mind when I look at that video. Heidi partovi He is. He was with Microsoft And I'm not sure what he's doing now, but he's associated with the code.org and our code. There's the group who puts together the code stars video And I I know he said make a lot of money. The purpose or one purpose. And I can't remember exactly the other phrase, but Make something that lots of people use So those are both kind of individual pursuits, not necessarily Related to relation related to public good, or public interest. And then there's another woman who talked about that she she had understood that software is about helping people. Is that ring true for people for us is, is that what software is about making a contribution. Helping people
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;For me, that's definitely my personal focus
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Mm hmm.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I think both of those things are true, they're just not the entire picture right
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;This is something you could write In your response to being three is What is your understanding of the purpose of computing that's Something to cosplay include We think about the second Video We need a moral operating system. Dude, do you think that's Possible. That's an important thing for computer scientists to Consider
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Hugely important
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I think it's something that's not necessarily talked about very much like When University and places like that like generally with coding. We're just assigned to do certain tasks and not ask too many questions. But I think it's important brings up the point. It's important that it brings up the point to kind of question your Your morality when doing task.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. So we're going to talk about it this semester so
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;The second video talks about the power as the data is the power and which states that the humanity as well as the respect of the people, the privacy.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so there's a choice. So we have the choice to collect that guy's data. To increase his Experience with the product. And maybe, and this is again. very timely where we might be interested to see whether he's up to no good. So then it's It's either So there are a few reasons. We might choose to collect data.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;The intent to collect data is usually To increase people's experience online or to pay more attention on that particular website or service instead of Crying him improve their lives generally overall Just increasing their online experience may not always be the best for their Lives.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;When we Sign up to say, we'll just collect this data. And I'll give you this 10 page document about are going to use your data. But it mean. It means that You know, there's an adage that if if a service is free. That means you are the product. You know, so it's not really A service to Help you do anything in particular. But collecting the, you know, like on Facebook and YouTube and so on the models that they have for making Money. That involves Tracking What people are interested in who they talk to you.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, and in bringing them back again and again to serve them content that Interest them the most. So they can increase their advertising revenues or other avenues.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;And sometimes people can get isolated ideologically because they are getting fed the same content from same ideological or political beliefs that they fail to see the other part of the picture.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Which then translates into the offline lives as well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. So that, that's getting away from the Question about should we collect his data or not.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Being enticed to come down to agree trade off between security and user data. The operating system has to decide what is agreeable trade off between security and user data.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. Oh, The operating system is going to decide for people who write the operating system.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Individual states that it is hard to make the decisions because you're breaking The rule of personal privacy for the protection of humanity, which involves the ethics, an adequate so it is hard to make the decision, which involves the ethics, so That's
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so it's hard to make those decisions that we need to To make them. And the question to me the question and as video is How we're going to make those decisions.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Right, he's suggesting like a moral framework, I guess, um, Yeah, or like a set of professional ethics and like principles, basically.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. Oh,
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;This is where the first video also comes in. You need people on various each to give their opinions about this because the decision by a certain group of people will also be biased by their own beliefs. This is where we need people from different fields to come in and they ended up
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;In there. When to Follow up on the idea of crowdsourcing So, Years ago when we were talking about the denominator of web two point O You know, so as a reader right when You know the benefit was that the world's going to be so many gatekeepers. Then people could express themselves. And I was going to be a benefit. Now, it's not just, it's not only seen as a benefit. When people can Post things And have their If they're not posting factual material. Or Presenting not opinion but a false ID. And the platforms amplify that. You know that. Then there's another risk that comes to bear. I caught it. When we didn't have when we had gatekeepers. Not everybody could easily voice their opinion. But at the same time, there were some There were some protections in place by the, the fact that was difficult to Communicate directly and bypass the whole infrastructure. Of newspapers and TV and so on and so forth. Opinion. Is to be taken with a grain of salt, I guess. And if you're expressing an opinion. He should be able to back that up and create a solid argument. To support your case. So I thought there's interesting connection between The first video, and the second video because in the first video We have jack Dempsey, who is the founder of Twitter. And that they're now. In the news a lot again. So, on what basis do they decide to permanently. Permanently barred barn account. So it's not just Media would be nice for them to articulate a framework that's applicable to everybody. So not just One set of rules for Common people for everyday people. And then another set for more influential users.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Well, and I think that's the interesting part about these types of, like, you know, moral frameworks, especially if they're not clear because they can be taken totally subjectively. So when you don't have clear principles of what is, you know, hate speech or what is harassment or what is anything like that, then it makes it difficult to make those decisions.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Mm hmm.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Well, on top of the league. There's a thing where they banned a whole bunch of people that were retweeting people's speech, but they weren't banning the person that was tweeting all of it in the first place because they were a person of influence well So you have special privilege on that too. So it's like it's not, they already defined that speech is hate speech, but then it's the person has special influence on top of that, so they don't get banned.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Hmm.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;There's actually a news report today talking about how they're like encrypted messaging platforms have been getting like they went from an average of like 50,000 signups a day to over a million a day in the last couple weeks. Which was kind of interesting.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Because like
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;From the
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, can you can you send me the link or can you share your link that link and
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I'll do my best to find it. It was actually on my Google homes. I'm just like morning broadcast so
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;mentioned already, so we're out of time today. But It will be. I have a couple of videos. About filter bubbles. So that was mentioned a bit Earlier. So let's focus on that for next Talk or our next meeting. Okay. And I'll put I'll post the links. This afternoon. Okay. Anyway. Any other questions or concerns.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;What was that you're wanting us to put on the forum posts for this week here.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, so for meeting three Some Ideas for something related to our discussion today.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Are you enjoying the purpose of coding to as well earlier.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Also, do you want us to put our response to the farm by before the next class, or is it like by the end of the weekend.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Before the next class, please.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Suffer the one we're going to do meeting three, it's going to be tomorrow before Thursday and then meeting for is going to be before next Tuesday. Right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so I'm gonna set it up, check.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Also about the individual assignment or we do you know how many assignments. We're going to have, is it going to be 2356 like how does 35 persons going to
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Get out. Well, since we're out of time today already. We'll talk about it. On Thursday, okay.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Awesome. Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;And will you be posting the notes from today online.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I'll Post my My pictures of my scribble Very quickly.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;So, thank you. So a meeting to forum is might be this similar as meeting three so it, it will be okay for you, sir, because We just the same thing in the meeting to forum so it might be
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Same India yeah I I don't want to make this too onerous. I just want you to be engaged with our discussion. So I didn't give you So, We're just trying to get things set up here and we'll By next week or by even even Thursday, while ever sorted out. So well oiled machine.

    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;how do we add our response there?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Reply to the first post
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;oh thanks :-&gt;
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;You wont be able to see the other posters on it (at least the case for meeting 2) until after yours is submitted.
    </li><li><strong>S51:</strong>&nbsp;How do you record your attendance im new to this class
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;We have not done that yet
    </li><li><strong>S51:</strong>&nbsp;Ok
    </li><li><strong>S51:</strong>&nbsp;Is there anything crucial that I missed last week?
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;do we have to post for each meeting?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;yes!
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;Nothing crucial, just watch 2 videos on his website
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;Question: Could you allow us to unsubscribe from the Engagement with meetings forum because it sends us a separate email every single time that someone replies and it can be a bit much
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;agree
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;^What Brandon said. 96 emails per class is way too much
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Definitely agree
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Does anyone know how to mute, I tried but did not work?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;You can change the user preferences so it summarizes the  whole day around 5pm
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;But for meeting 2 the meeting was just for 12 mins so how can we write about the meeting 2?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Meeting 2 he had asked us to write a response on the videos
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;For meeting 2, you have to write about the videos
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;You had to watch 2 videos
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;deepek if you goto his site there was 2 videos
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;bout the Dr. David?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;no man, go and have a look
    </li><li><strong>S56:</strong>&nbsp;One from Code.org about the importance of learning to code, one Ted talk about a moral operating system
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;You can find the 2 videos here: http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/notes/CS-280-M02.html
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;CS280-&gt;Meeting 2-&gt; Plan for Today -&gt; CS280 Meeting 2. Those two
    </li><li><strong>S56:</strong>&nbsp;On the CS280 website under plan for meeting 2
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;follow what cutis said on this site
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-280/202110/
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Ok Thanx Everyone
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/notes/CS-280-M02.html
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;wouldn't you just changed forced subscription off?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Kurtis* my bad
    </li><li><strong>S57:</strong>&nbsp;for meeting 3 is there a question there already?
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;It seems like whenever you reply to a thread it 'subscribes' you to all other replies in that thread
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I think we can go to preferences in our UR courses settings and change the notification preferences to not us an email from subscribed or open forums
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Why not choose ‘optional subscription’?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Was everyone getting individual emails or the summary ones? I've only ever gotten "these posts were made today" across all registered classes
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah Optional subscription looked like it would do the job
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I was getting individual emails. I'm not sure how to change it to summary but that would be helpful.
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Everyone can individually go to their URCourses Preferences -&gt; Forum Preferences -&gt; turn off Forum Auto subscribe
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I turned off forum autosubscribe, that may help
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;what is read tracking?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Shows if you have "unread" posts
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;oh i see, thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;So under the forum tab, it would say "unread post" when he posts a new one (or someone replies to an existing one)
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Also, I would strongly recommend everyone who was getting the multiple emails to click your name in the top right of UR courses, click preferences, forum preferences, and change email digest type to "Subjects"
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;That way you get one email every day at 5pm with a summary of anything across al your courses, instead of a hundred emails a day
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;Pro hack: post your response at the very end so you would get less replies
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;oh that's useful Kurtis, thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S49:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;one problem with posting late is if power goes out like it did the other day, it would be bad
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;how do we give attendance
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;we havnt done any attendance yet, assuming he will get to it once he gets the chance
    </li><li><strong>S58:</strong>&nbsp;sorry bout that
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;Can you please elaborate that how many individual assignments contribute to 35%
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;yes please ^^
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;just how it is
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Also, the more people who follow the pro hack the less effective it becomes, and it doesn
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;doesn't reduce the total number of emails sent - only puts you in the later side of the trend
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I think even if you respond late, once the previous responses open up for you to view, you do get the notification to them
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;nope
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;only the responses that are posted after you
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;it does
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Pro hack is to post 5 times and get 5 times the marks
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;I dint get, lucky me
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;yes!
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S59:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S60:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;they were fun to watch so it was nice
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;The final is on 20 or 21?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Bill Gates is such a rascal
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;That's the Syllabus for last semester
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;my bad
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Ours is 20th
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Final is April 20, 2021
    </li><li><strong>S56:</strong>&nbsp;I think he said he was still editing it
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;according to self service it's on Apr 20, 2021
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;what about just an online poll and then just give us the link?
    </li><li><strong>S61:</strong>&nbsp;I'm having some difficulty reading the writing
    </li><li><strong>S62:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I can’t really read it
    </li><li><strong>S61:</strong>&nbsp;I'm okay with the handwriting itself but the screen mirroring seems to blur it somewhat
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;i suck at reading hand writing but its manageable
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I write in block after being 10 years old
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;typing in txt file could be better.
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;i agree... a doc for typing..
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;or go on word and type in a cursive font
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;+1
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;you can scale the readability
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;+1
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S61:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like software is about helping people in theory, it's when it's put into practice that things get complicated...
    </li><li><strong>S63:</strong>&nbsp;Its a part of what it should do imo
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;It's the implementation of it which brings forth different type of problems
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;like American democracy amirite
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;sorry...
    </li><li><strong>S63:</strong>&nbsp;Softwares are like tools, just virtual &amp; enable us to do tasks which are at times impossible/Not feasible to do without them
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;What was the question? Can someone type it here
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;What is the purpose of computing?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;What is your understanding of the purpose of computing
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;What is your understanding of the purpse of computing
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;His screen is super blurry for me
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;yeah
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Computing is a tool
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you guysss :)
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;a powerful tool
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;art
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, but which one?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;he talked about 2 or 4
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;different approaches
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;could you please type instead of writing?
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Like the TED talks guy said over and over, Data is the most valuable resource on the planet.
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;could you please type instead of writing
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;I hope same
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Actually a very interesting topic, does anyone have any opinions on twitter and facebooks recent bans?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Should have banned a lot sooner
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Agreed
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;signal?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;yeah
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah those people came mostly from WhatsUp
