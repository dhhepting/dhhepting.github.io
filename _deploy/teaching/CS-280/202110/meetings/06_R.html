      Our conversation about digital design and moral responsibility had me considering our obligations as tech creators to the disability community. I know a number of people who have accessability needs when it comes to digital content - some just need the ability to enlarge text due to natural deterioration of eyesight with age, while others are unable to read text either because of ocular issues or neurological conditions/injuries. For those who rely on text-to-speech readers to browse the internet, the way a website is encoded directly impacts their ability to access the content on that website - for example, a...

      In our 6th meeting we discussed about what should future designs be like. One example is getting rid of push doors that have handles since they waste time, infuriate and increase the stress of people. We also talked about possibly dangerous future designs of cars having bigger and bigger touchscreen which can distract the driver.We were also put in groups to talk about the responsiblities of programmers. One idea we had was to take in more privacy concerns like not silently activating a feature that a user does not know of. Another idea was to stop programmers from becomeing car...

      3 good designsDesign that subconsciously doesn’t overwhelm the user. Make the user experience fun, couldn’t function well but fun, less frustrating. Could be a harmful experience and put yourself at your risk by doing so. Fear and anxiety can help you focus on your work because you’re already thinking about the risk of not getting your work done. Fear and anxiety are like taking risk prediction; however, it is making your brain tunnel vision focus on that fear and anxiety alone and not looking at the bigger picture. Visual, behavior, reflective - attention you get from other people.Creative ConfidenceChild confidence...

      Design and the Greater GoodToday we watched multiple videos on design, with the intent of considering what 'designing technology for the greater good' means. This is the topic I want to bring to the discussion today.In my opinion, designing technology for the greater good means improving ease-of-use and making technologies more enjoyable to use. If something is easier to use, more people are able to use it. An easy-to-use technology that improves people's lives is a great thing. Regarding enjoyment, if things are more enjoyable to use, it makes the entire experience for the person using the technology more positive....

      I got the impression that everyone has different opinions on how to fix the filter bubble problem. I think that the ideal solution is allowing users the option to enable filter bubbles. If a person thinks that they are a good idea, they can enable it. If a person would rather not have their experience altered by the app, they can have it their way, too. Everyone would be able to get their own ideal experience.
    </li><li>
      https://youtu.be/KwdYUIQzu-o &lt;---- Just a link to a silly sketch for a bit of levity concerning the conversation we had about door design today. ;)I really enjoyed the class conversation surrounding filter bubbles and our responsibilities and obligations as computing specialists. A lot of clashing opinions! I agree very much with Daryl that a lot of the conversation comes back around to transparency. For me, I feel that if we expect the onus to fall on consumers to make choices and take responsibility for the technology they use, then transparency about that technology in terms of how it operates, its security...

      Todays Class we have learnt about how search engines yield the result of every query which is different in different locations.
    </li><li>
      During class I find it hard to think that company's should be forced or not forced to use filter bubbles. Personally when using social media I want to see what my friends post rather than just what the site thinks I want to see. However I think that as a private business they are allowed to use whatever algorithm they want. If consumer's do not want the use of filter bubbles they should seek and use options that have features that they want. It is the ouns of the consumer to be more aware of what they are using then...

      I believe that the role of programming should always be intertwined with the focus of the greater good. The main goal of programming should be building something that will make somebody's life easier. A programmer should always think about who is able to utilize their program and optimize it to be useful to the most diverse crowd possible. For example, when building an app, there should be options to aid the visually impaired and hearing impaired. For example, building another UI with larger and more defined icons for those that have poor vision.I believe that part of the greater good...

      When designing solutions to "help others," one can often become enwrapped in a saviour complex, believing it is their duty to jump in and solve another person or group's problems. Doing so without being invited by a group of people can be harmful, creating a divide. This may result in the act of "othering" the group being "helped," as well as placing the developers of the solution on a higher pedestal of self-righteousness. From both an anthropological and problem-solving perspective, this approach to serving the larger society is flawed.I believe it is essential, especially as a future computer professional, to...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, during break out room we discussed about the responsibility of a programmer, we all had same idea that programmers should give the choice of applying filter bubbles to the users. it should not be automatic or mandatory, instead it should be optional. As people can choose whether they want the filter bubble on their search or not. Like it will make easy for the users like if they are going to search for hospital or schools, then they will turn on the filter bubble so that they can see nearest locations of the building they searched. but...

      In the video, 3 ways designs make you happy.He talks about visceral, behavioral, and reflective designs, and how they contribute to something being beautiful and making you happy. I thought this video way very confusing and convoluted, but I will say that I do agree with him on some points. Beauty is what draws you towards something, and so there is definitely a visceral aspect to that because things that are unique and uncommon draw our attention. But that is only half the story, for something to be considered beautiful it typically has to be received with a pleasant response....
    </li><li>
      After watching the videos, here is what i learnt.Way that good design make you happy- Fear brings focus and less distraction. Happiness brings creativity and more ideas which makes things work better. Behavioral design is all about the feel of your control. Most are done unconsciously"How to build your creative confidence - Fear of judgement makes people avoid creativity. People with fear of not been creative can be taken through a series of small succeses and this fear becomes familiarity.
    </li><li>
      In our most recent discussion in breakout rooms, my group had the most trouble understanding/discussing "responsibilities of computing for the greater good", as we found the question too open ended and abstract. For one, we could not find a clear understanding of what the "greater good" actually meant or is. What is the "greater good"? Obviously, sometimes computing can be used maliciously and to the detriment of others (such as malware), but other times it is not as black and white. Take for example a platform like Facebook. Facebook can be used for a lot of good things (such as...

      After reviewing Don Norman's "3 Ways Good Design Makes You Happy" Ted Talk, it really put into perspective why a moral framework for creators is so crucial. He used a few products as his examples but it really applies to anything someone is using in their daily lives (could be a household item, technology, software, etc.). When people are using and interacting with these products, it is physically altering the state of their body. Making them feel certain emotions that are triggered subconsciously without the user recognizing exactly why they're feeling that emotion. If creators have the power to do...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed in our break-out rooms morals in coding and how many different software and services have become something that is in some cases harmful to the greater good of society. I found this topic very interesting because I couldn't agree more. I think that the more software and anything that humanity is able to produce with programming will come at a cost. Anything can be taken and used in a negative manner with one major goal in mind, that being profit. I think no matter what anyone does to try to keep a good moral...
    </li><li>
      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting?The most important thing learned from the past meeting is why is creative design important and how to build creative confidence. Both the video which was outlined in past meeting depict the same purpose and vey well explained by Dr. Norman and David Kelly.something you encountered that is related to the past meetingIn the past meeting we discussed how search algorithm changes for the search engine when we describe something. One gets an example by Dr. Norman's website when he searches "Design and Emotion" and "Design Emotion" (he gets different suggestions)....
    </li><li>
      As I saw a Ted Talk by Don Norman about how good design makes us happy, I came to know about three different aspects in which good design has an optimistic effect on our mindset. I feel the first one: Visceral is very much connected to the subconscious, since when people see unique things, they just buy them without knowing about it. That's what happens to me a lot of times. In addition, there are 2 more forms that are behavioral and reflective that are really demonstrated well. Though I came to hear about this for the first time, I...
    </li><li>
      Don Norman’s video “3 Ways Good Design Makes you Happy” , tells about people’s subconscious mind. And according to him , design can be recognized in three ways : Visceral , Behavioral and Reflective. First two are connected to subconscious mind while the last one is connected to conscious mind. Visceral : We humans are attracted towards bright colors, nice cars or fancy bottles in subconscious state of mind. This happens with everyone and once happened with me too. I didn’t get the concept of Behavioral. In Reflective , we usually buy things that we can show off , or...

      The video about bad doors shows how we as in a society face some common psychological issues and how the our brain has been accustomed to believe how a thing should be used/treated based on its shape.In class, we discussed our responsibility as a computer programmer towards the society for greater good. In group discussion, we discussed how a person's security should be a huge concern, and violating a person's private boundary is unethical. We came to a conclusion that the contents that we see or are provided to us should be customized by us. That is we should be...
    </li><li>
      In the TED talk by Don Norman he talks about design and its importance, and this heavily applies to the area of computer science and programming. Programmers have to think about not just how their creation will work but also how good it looks to users and how appealing it is to bring in new users. If a programmer makes a really cool app that they want people to start using then they have to make it look interesting to people to attract new users. But there has to be a balance between how something looks and how well it...

      In the first video the host talks about the subconcious activity the mind does and lot of things it does without us knowing or basically the explanation at least i dont have, the three level of mind was very intresting topic i learned from the video and also the nature of feeling controlled.In the second video the new term "Guided mastery", i learned which was kind of a ignored term according to me, and i believe the theory of taking baby steps towards the fear such as the first scenario he talked about the creative blockage, which will reintroduce them...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we talked about two main topics: design, GameStop shares sell off after Robinhood, TD and other brokerages move to limit trading.First, I would like to speak of design after watching two Ted videos “3 ways good design makes you happy” by Don Norman and “How to build your creative confidence” by David Kelley.For “3 ways good design makes you happy” by Don Norman, a good design is about neat and fun, like the two example he shows us, the Philippe Starck juicer and fish interaction Ping-pong table, juicer is neat and fun, the ping-pong table is...
    </li><li>
      I really found the news about Robinhood restricting trading in shares including GameStop amid dizzying run-up interesting. The brokerages decided to make a move to restrict trading after they see the immense profits being made by traders . I believe this is a political move because the hedge funds was trying to buy into it and right now the price is pumped back up. (rich just trying to keep getting rich)
    </li><li>
      People will be attracted by some specific things, such as good design. It is also worked in internet. Through the Ted talk 3 Ways Good Design Makes you Happy, we can know that are ways to attract people. These ways of design is really strategic and should be used for us in many ways like programming or designing. When designing things, we should also focus on people's psychology and think about what kind of things can attract others most.
    </li><li>
      meeting 6 started with GameStop news and made its way through the filter bubble.a question was asked for the breakout rooms, what as a computer professional one should do while providing its service to the public.-we discussed some moral value of a programmer like making the service public-friendly, letting them choose what content they want on their screen rather than imposing their search-related content and trapping them into a filter bubble, in this way people will get to know both sides of the paper and will help to eradicate the manipulating and mind driven tactics which are currently used by...
    </li><li>
      vyomesh ‘3 ways that makes you happy’.I learned that one should see the beauty of the objects, the neat and clean design that makes the thing precious which makes you to enjoy. The chapter of fun with little emotion that makes the thing much simple and subtle even if it does not make any sense but still it will make one happy. Happiness makes one to do breadth for search which then helps to do out the box search. ‘how to build your creative confidence.’I learned that the lack of confidence has done many negative impacts to the people.  People can be...
    </li><li>
      for me the most important topic of this class was the concept of what obligation the programmer has to producing programs that improve quality of life. in my opinion the programmer is first responsible to complete the task they are given assuming it does violate there own moral code. the secondary responsibility is to insure that there are no easy way to violate the users rights as best they can.
    </li><li>
      In the breakout room of meeting 6, we are taking about the impact of stocks and the volatility of the stock market.

      From the bad door video, it was interesting to learn that even though we are technologically advancing every day, we still have issues with usability on products that were invented many years ago like doors. I learned that observation and feedback are very important in innovation and improvement. As engineers, we have the responsibility to take many things into consideration to create user-friendly software and products.The topic of discussion today was regarding our responsibilities with advancement in technology for the greater good. Similar to discussions in previous classes, filter bubble is one of the major issues in this topic. Collecting...

      Door DesignsThe video posted by Vox Media on YouTube, titled “It’s not you. Bad doors are everywhere” relates to the design of the push/pull handle on certain doors. Serving as a gateway into a more enlightened discussion about design and design centric ideas. It’s easily proven that good UI/UX serves to enable the user further. Giving them an option that’s chosen based on instinct. It relates quite easily to doors since they are the almost the one thing that everyone in this world interacts with on a daily basis. Even within your own house, the tirade of doors doesn’t end....

      Both the videos uploaded under meeting 6 were helpful. I understand how much is the design important whether the projects is worth or not also after watching the second video developed understanding about creative confidence. I still wanted to learn more about the creative confidence if possible can get more links to read or some type of discussion related to that would be great to develop a brief idea about the term.
    </li><li>
      From first video I learned that being happy and positive helps you think out of box and come up with revolutionary ideas. Happiness helps us being creative and deadlines help us being focused. We need to have a balance of both being creative and being focused.Second video talked about creative confidence and how creativity is suppressed by negative feedback. I learned that creative confidence can be achieved by anyone who wants to be creative. There aren't any non-creative people just people who believe they are non-creative. Anyone that is willing to put in effort and follow creative principals can become...
    </li><li>
      I agree with the idea that was brought up that we should have the option to choose on whether or not a filter bubble should be used.
    </li><li>
      When we talk about programming for the greater good it's hard to define. So many things are meant to be for the greater good but then people find exploits and ways to use it in ways that go against the good of humanity. For example people use Facebook to connect with people, which could be seen as something that is for the greater good. On the otherside people use facebook to scam others and spread misinformation, which can be seen as something that is against the greater good. It should be the responsibility of programmers to make things that have...

      In the lecture, we discussed about anomie. Anomie is a cultural condition characterized by lack of any ethical values, guidelines to be followed by individuals. Anomie may arise from disagreement of belief systems and induce the problems of social relationships among people and groups. The video 3 ways good design makes you happy by Don Norman. In 2003 his talk, layout critic Don Norman transforms his thoughtful eye to beauty, pleasurable, happiness and emotion as he stares at the architecture which brings happiness among people. He identifies the three emotional states which must be hit by a well-designed item in...
    </li><li>
      From the first video I learned how the visceral level, behavioral level and reflective level design makes happy.Learned about what the visceral level is all about like what we like or dislike .Usability and understanding of design also includes feel.The last thing which I learned is reflective level.it is easy and important for a good design to get attention by it usage or beauty.The second video taught us how to gain creative confidence with the help of self efficacy.everyone is creative in their own kind of way ,we can’t divide world into creative and non-creative.It’s all about people ideas,every idea...
    </li><li>
      In the recent meeting, we talked about how to design a particular web design for greater good? I consider this as a really important issue now because the ethics in computing is decreasing gradually. The reason being is, there are several illegal activities done behind the curtains what we call is Dark Web.I think a developer should design a platform in such a way that doesn't harm people's sentiment and maintain the proper integrity.Mediocre people find it really hard to connect with the technology that is being developed now. With the pace, the technology is heading in such a way...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 6, we talked about design and the control that a developer has on the way his product is marketed and consumed by the consumers, is majorly dependent on its design. The more user-friendly, attention-grasping the design is, the more the consumer is attracted to it, even if it is not of much use to them. The concept of aesthetically pleasing items, with little to no practical use has been the reason why people buy them to 'decorate' their surroundings. How many times have you ordered some tech device from Amazon, which you had no 'need' for and could...
    </li><li>
      We discussed how important is the design and the structure of the platform especially for social networking site. In the breakup room we discussed about should tech companies use filter bubble on us, it was a great discussion that we donot required filter bubble for sccial networking sites, news sites but it is important for the social networking sites to disclose how they use filter bubble and the algorithm they use must be made public hence they cannot do any fishy business.The the concept that I want to learn more is about how can we design and structure this sites...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, it was worth to discuss about the shortage of new creative ideas in the class breakout rooms and it was also interesting to know that why filter bubbles are bad for us.other than that, i have viewed the two given videos in which the first one was about Design and emotion and i got to know about three steps; intense fear and anxiety, behavior /subconscious and reflection.second video was about design and happiness in which he talked about the visualization of happiness through designs. Apart from that, i really had difficulty in completely understanding the concept of...

      Can anyone tell me that what we have to do in this course??
    </li><li>
      what I learned from the last meeting is that the internet has memory and you don't have any privacy on the internet. Everyone is responsible for what they post on the Internet. Things on the Internet not only affect yourself but also affect others. The Internet is not a place of lawlessness. As far as the current course is concerned, I have not encountered any difficulties. In future courses, I want to learn more about the Internet and society。
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we discussed about the filter bubble in detail and also did the group activity by joining the breakout rooms.In breakout rooms we discussed pros and cons about the filter bubble, we discussed about what apple is doing in today's market to gain the profit, like only showing the apps and games created by them and not showing or allowing 3rd party applications.Some of the benefits of filter bubble is that we will only see the things that we are interested in and not the other irrelevant things.Some of the drawbacks are that we will not even know...
    </li><li>
      To expand on the question we were given last day during the break-out rooms, we were to ponder if we as 'computer professionals' have an obligation or responsibility in designing technology for the greater good. The consensus that we came to was obviously yes -- because otherwise what exactly is the point? Seems a bit silly really to even question, unless someone is getting into computer science to do nefarious activities with their skills (such as phishing or something), it should be our responsivity to ensure that we are designing good, lawful, technology that is intuitive and accessible to everyone....
    </li><li>
      Well from meeting 6 and from my breakout room discussion in that meeting I learned that there are mixed responses about the filter bubble thing. From the TedX I discovered why designing is important and to what extend. What I did not like about this meeting is how unmanaged we were after the breakout rooms. I am looking forward to having more planned and productive meetings.
    </li><li>
      From the recent class on Thursday, I got to know about the google search engine. The most interesting fact was that the google search results are generates on the basis of location of the user and the seraph engine display them according to the rank of the webpage. The ranking of any webpage depends upon the number of traffic on the webpage or how much the page was further shared by the person who is consuming data from the page . In short and to encapsulate the class it was fun to learn about computer space by the videos and...
    </li><li>
      Meeting 6 Response:I think that this is a pretty general issue, and really depends on the individual user and their needs. I think generally people should care more about the information they see and the sources it comes from, but I also understand the desire to be able to step away and just let some intelligence pull up the first site for you. It's similar to how when we google, we usually only look at the first few results. Really, there's just too much information out there for us to dig through anyways, I don't think letting go of the...
    </li><li>
      from this last meeting the thing that i learned is the one is about the filter bubbles that is they useful to us or not and then the breakout room discussion question that is also so interesting one that what should we do and want to do if we got the opportunity to do anything in the CS field for creating a new ideas,other than that i also get some information by viewing a new given videos in which the first video is explaining about the design and motion from which i got the knowledge about the new three steps...
    </li><li>
      Last meeting I learned a lot about the stock market. I learned about short selling, a little more about how shares work in general, and the power the Robinhood app had over the market. Last meeting also brought into question whether or not the decision to limit trading was a morally sound decision from the people at Robinhood. However, on the other hand, the people of reddit caused firms to lose billions because of short selling. There is no denying the change a group of people rallying on the internet can lead. Many people believed that the restrictions to trading...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learnt after watching ted by David Kelly is that we should not give up on things that are really important in our lives instead we should focus on that things and this could only be done if we all gain this confidence. We all should let our ideas fly and do what we are suppose to do so that we could reach a place called creative confidence.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned was from the video on how to build your creative confidence.I found this to be interesting because it talks about how people who are scared of actually accomplishing certain tasks should not believe they aren't good enough. The video made me realize how we are all naturally creative, and all one needs is to set their mind onto something and we will be abe to achieve good results. A good way to become confident about ideas, goals and tasks can be taking small steps to attain results.
    </li><li>
      Norman is a psychologist and cognitive scientist. So his writing of his grievance was so incredibly comprehensive that he changed the way design works. His "human-centred design" revolution has changed not only how designers work, but also how people work in areas such as public health to make the world a better place. That's why Melinda Gates believes human-centred design is one of the changes that could save the world. To see how all this has to do with lousy doors. If one slows down to pay attention, there are Norman doors everywhere, and most of them aren't really doors...
    </li><li>
      In the first video, we learned about design and emotion, also learned other three steps. The break out room in which we discussed regarding filter bubble and related concepts. Moreover, the second video was regarding the good visualization and design which was quite good in understanding. More influencing the design will be, the more interactive it will be for the user.
    </li><li>
      In last class we discussed about about being in computer science field what technology we will bring.Further we also discussed about filter bubble and learnt how filter bubble will bring change in result.
    </li><li>
      For meeting 6, we discussed about designs and our responsibility as IT Professionals towards design and I just wanna say that according to me, we need to design things considering their effects 5 years from now. That being said, some things to look out for would be it's reflections of our thoughts! We need to design something that would not be deemed hostile after years. With social media having such a huge impact, our biggest challenge has to be to design something public friendly!
    </li><li>
      The GameStop stock situation showed an example of ethics when the Robinhood investing app blocked people from investing in the GameStop stock during the most important days. Robinhood was obviously being manipulated by hedge fund billionaires to stop people from participating in the free market, which I believe is very wrong.
    </li><li>
      Regarding the videos, it shows the importance of implementing creativity into our work and how it should be encouraged. What the second video mentioned about encouragement is certainly true, when I was in preschool my teacher told me that my drawing was terrible, and it certainly has been a psychological burden to come over to try to overcome the "I'm bad at this, why bother". Same thing we can apply to coding or design, it is hard to want to learn new coding methods and new solutions if we are down ourselves, or are told by others that we are...
    </li><li>
      Well from what i learn is that really i understand that we as progrmaers need to push the common good since in my mind its like asking the construction worker how do you push the common good. Seconed that i dont see how the search engine are discriminting against people really theres no benifit to it at all. I mean All it is the links are just a massive popularity contest

      Anomie, additionally spelled as anomy.it implies that in social orders or people a state of shakiness coming about because of a breakdown of guidelines and values or from an absence of direction or standards. Durkheim considers anomie to be a condition of social breaking down. Subsequently, general social guidelines are not, at this point noticed the aggregate request breaks down, and a condition of anomie arises. The results of this are expanded self-destruction and crime percentages. Anomie is additionally interpreted as normlessness, when things occur in the public eye, change happens so quickly and we don't have the foggiest idea...
    </li><li>
      In our last class we checked bing, duckduck and some other website to check on filter bubble once again. The interesting part was the vox video on bad doors are everywhere. I watched the video way before randomly. The video talks about how design is suppose to be user friendly. It should not give us the hint to do the opposite of what is suppose to happen. When our design inherently tells us what we are suppose to do with it, we can make better use of it, hence making every stuff more user friendly. I will say its basically...
    </li><li>
      From the videos, I found it fascinating how our subconscious works towards the things we do regularly. Also, how we, humans look at objects in a totally different way than we think. For example, the luxurious watch we buy to show others how good it looks rather than buying a cheap and more functional watch just because it is not as good looking as the first one. In the second video, I learned what a cruel comment or discouragement can do to someone psychologically.
    </li><li>
      In the Thursday' s meeting we discussed about our responsibilities as a professional programmer for doing something good for the society. Also, we discussed in the breakout rooms that we should keep in mind about the privacy of the people and all that but after watching the video on gaining creative confidence. The example of Doug Dietz give me a clear view about how we can do better for society with our creativity. That was so interesting to know.
    </li><li>
      In the meeting, we were put into the breakout rooms where we discussed the term "Greater Good". In this modern world, all these tech companies claim to create new innovative ideas for the betterment of humans and for the greater good. Although we discussed that how at the end of the day it's all about profit. Sure all this new technology helps people to live a better life but still, companies will never sell a product if they don't get any kind of profit. Also, I've watched the two videos where Don Norman in the first video talks about three...
    </li><li>
      I can see how many people would call themselves "not the creative type", as David Kelly describes. Many people are quick to dismiss their abilities, or their potential, because they are slightly discouraged at an early stage in their progress. The example given in the talk is of a boy in third grade creating a sculpture, but this concept can apply to many things. This information will make me more conscious about encouraging other people in their own development, and seeing where I may have been discouraged in a similar way.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 6, I have learned about emotion is one of the factory that influence people. For me, I hate assignment in university having deadline; deadline make me feel uncomfortable on the day before it due. In the video of meeting 6, the talker said that deadline will produce anxiety to make people pay attention on finish the job. On contrary, positive emotion is help on get new ideas. I can not say anxiety is exactly bad or positive emotion is exactly good, it depend on what situation am I on. Such as deadline, I feel uncomfortable of it; but...
    </li><li>
      hey,In the last class I really enjoyed how we able to give our thoughts on the videos we watched with the other students in the breakout rooms as well as the different perspectives of other students on the videos.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, discussing about our responsibilities as a programmer was quite interesting for me to discuss. I want to know more about that what else we can do for making our technology better so that it will serve for the good of the society.
    </li><li>
      I've encountered many instances of people who were afraid of things they didn't understand including myself. I used to be afraid of jumping in the deep end of the pool as a kid because of all I've heard about how dangerous water can be, but once you do it once in a safe environment like at a more shallow end, it's much easier to work your way up into comfort. I'll be conscious of this in the future when introducing new concepts to people by first giving a simple example, many times have I seen people become disinterested in a...
    </li><li>
      The first video talked about how one can buildup creative confidence.I learnt that the term self-efficacy is the sense that one can change the world with everything one can do.Fear and anxiety cause one to do what is called deaf processing to be a focus and not being distracted
    </li><li>
      Don Norman wrote the Norman door that Norman door is a message that we need to do the opposite of what we are is the key to solving many problems. Things require principles called discoverability and repeat the process until we have a solution spread worldwide to solve the issues. Problems are doors and doors are confusing, and we need to discover what we can do.
    </li><li>
      I can’t help but wonder just how many of us are actually driven to design technology for the greater good. It is more common that many people will be hired on to slave away at a desk for a salary. The contribution an employee gives will only help to further someone else’s financial success. Perhaps computer ethics should be merged with entrepreneurship, so that we not only challenge the idea of why we design technology, but also set out to create leaders.
    </li><li>
      The importance of structure and design is very important in humans life. Though it may not be visible to an individual but it affects how they approach different tasks in their life. If the things are not managed or not in the according to what is expected, it may result in difficulties to complete the stuff. Moreover, if the person is made happy, they can achieve things they cannot think of.
    </li><li>
      The video by Don Norman “3 Ways Good Design Makes You Happy” has an impact on our subconscious mind. Based on what he said in the video Design has 3 ways of consideration Behavioral, Reflective and Visceral. A good design makes you to feel that you are in charge, to make you to feel the item can accomplish the function admirably. The ideas that emerge with these designs need a lot of time and hard work.
    </li><li>
      Well in the last meeting we got information about the different topics like about the filter bubbles that how they are harmful to us and then we discuss a topic in breakout room discussion on which is the new one and interesting one for us as what should we want to do in science field like the what inventory we have to do that is good for the my field byApart form that i viewed two videos that is given by Prof. in which i got information about the new topic the first video is about design and emotion in...
    </li><li>
      In the first video we learned about how good creation of design make individual feel good. Here we learned about three aspects in which good creation has very important effects on our minds. In addition, there are two more forms that are behavioral and reflective that are demonstrated well.In the second video, we learned about little appreciation or desppeciation will effectively or brake the confidence of people.lastly, a littsupport in building can hold the strength of changing the entire life of an individual in positive way
    </li><li>
      I learned from the video "how to build a Creative confidence" if you stick with the process and work with things you can be super innovative at the end. It also like you have to take step by step in order to build your confidence. Once you start making your self comfortable you can sometime surprise yourself how innovative you can be.
    </li><li>
      Things have changed a lot from past and are gonna change further in future which gonna be benefits users in terms of time consumption. Filter bubbles are used in search engine, social media and many platforms provide best user experience than ever before
    </li><li>
      I enjoyed the discussions on the filter bubbles with the other students as it allowed me understand why some people may or may not want to have filter bubbles
    </li><li>
      Creative confidence is also very important for an individual to become a good human being who believes in supporting society and its growth. It changes the way in which we look at things and make them so that we can make others happy.
    </li><li>
      The fact that all these sources and search engines restrict us from viewing everything but specifically brings up what we want grows this ignorance in everyone. The people who were reading the false stories keeps on reading those false stories and aren't ever shown the things that are true and have been proved. The covid vaccine is a big thing, people think its bad, no one should think that, this is created by a team of very smart people in order to stop a pandemic and save our economy. People who don't take the vaccine and live past this event...
    </li><li>
      In last class we discussed in groups, being in the field of computers what kind of new technology could you bring. Accordingly, what first thing comes to my mind is security and safety about users data secondly it should be superior to what we already have, easily accessible to all. Further in last meeting I learned about filter bubbles that how filter bubbles bring so much change to an individuals search results.
    </li><li>
      According to me, the things which have the important place in our life to take decision requires us to be mentally and physically happy. Happiness comes from the things around us. We have structed house and planned cities because it makes us feel more organised and thus, happy. Structures and design plays an important role to govern an individual's decision making power. It is seen that if a person is treated well, they show an extraordinary results in completing a task when conpared with other individuals. Similarly, if a person is happy it will automatically enhance there creativity which is...
    </li><li>
      The two video I have watched are both very interesting an fun. The first video “3 ways good design makes you happy” was about fun. people usually buy anything just because how they are fun looking and interesting not because how they work. The speaker gave an example about watch how people like to show off their expensive watch because they are stylish, but no one is interested for the cheap watch even though they have better functionality. It is because the cheap watch looks ugly. This video gives a message that fund and interesting deign make an item valuable.In...
    </li><li>
      The essential thing to make things look good and pleasing is to have neatness. Neatness comes with design and structure. More the things are structured and have a good design, the more it has neatness in itself and look good to ourself. It is psychology and it is proven the neatness makes a person happy. If the surrounding is neat and structured, it enchances the ability of a person to complete there task. Also, with a happy mind creative confidence can be achieved. Creative confidence makes a person believe in becoming a good human being who helps the society to...
    </li><li>
      So here in the first video of Don Norman he was explaining best ways for a good design. He also gave few examples on it. Moreover, in second video David Kelly gave knowledge of building a confidence with giving example of Doug Dietz. So now let's see something new and discuss in next class.
    </li><li>
      We discussed in the class about the importance of design. How big impact can the design have on the success of a product. Sometimes people buy stuff that they don't even need but it just looks good compared to a product which works great but doesn't look good. This shows that modern society people care a lot about the design and might even pay a bit extra just because the product looks good.
    </li><li>
      In group we discussed about filter bubble and experimented it by searching for clothes in google. We got different pages and result because one group mate got searches related to women clothes because he was looking to buy clothes for his mom while other simply got images of normal clothes. So we discussed about the factor on which google shows us a particular result. But later as discussed in video that something should be in control in our hand so we tried to find out solution and I came up with a idea of field filter when you search for...
    </li><li>
      Today we learned about emotions and design with few examples. And the main point i learned is pleasant things work better. If you are not in a good mood or not happy you won’t work good but if you are in a good mood and happy about what you are going to do, it will have much better outcomes. So that is a really good thing we learned. Other thing was reflective which means if you see something is looking good weather it is perfect or not you will get attracted towards it. That is reflective emotion and i think...
    </li><li>
      The things I learned from the video is do not to be afraid of make changes of myself, like become more creative, or doing the right things, the things that I really want to do.
    </li><li>
      I think the most important thing we learned in this meeting was that not lose your creativity or idea you have, try it out and see how it turns out no matter what others says about it. Keep the good and positive response as an encouragement but negative ones ignore them or use it as an improvement. Also I learned that no matter how ugly or uncreative something is try took at the good and positive side and always try to encourage people on their idea they have and support them.The news of Robinhood to limit trading was kind of...
    </li><li>
      This shows that how people are creative with making new and different types of creative things. Most of the people's emotion depends upon the things, especially the design of the things.The things also help the people by building confidence in them, and on the other hand, the creative things can also make a person disappointed if the things do not work properly.
    </li><li>
      The interesting thing that I learned during these meeting was that people have quite a diverse view on filter bubbles. Although, I do appreciate the usefulness of filter bubbles in certain situations, such as when looking for a pizza shop or a home depot close to where I stay, I can certainly say that I do not admire their algorithmic functionality when it comes to filtering news and opinions. This sort of filtering can alienate users from conflicting viewpoints and isolate users ideologically.However, I observed that many students in the class do not share the same enthusiasm about their dangers...
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we taught about how the design of the software has a huge impact on the user interface. Both the videos talked about it in detail. If the design is friendly and less complicated the user would have more trust towards the operating system and the application.
    </li><li>
      After watching two videos, I felt that your emotion and your creative is the main key for solving the problems. The way of how you solve the problem depends on your feelings. If you are anxious or under pressure, you cannot solve the problem in a great way, a creative way. Otherwise, if you are happy or excited, you will figure out many ways for solving that problem. The creativity could help you to do many things in a brilliant way. Every good design needs a creative designer. A good design could make the customer, user feel pleased. It would...
    </li><li>
      I learned from the first video that good design makes people happy, and one of the reasons is that some designs subconsciously make us feel happy. If the design doesn't have any of the qualities that make people happy, it kills the base design purpose.From the second video, I know the relationship between confidence and creativity. I think confidence can affect one's creativity very much. If one is very confident, he will be very creative because he believes in creating something more perfect. Moreover, confident people will be very calm, so they are more likely to succeed to make a...
    </li><li>
      The design of the software has a huge importance on the user experience. More complicated design is less trust people would have over the software. Design of car also has a huge importance for the accidents that are caused. Both the videos talks about it in detail. I would love to talk about it int deatil
    </li><li>
      what is a good design makes you happy when you use it ?
    </li><li>
      Speaking of software design, I think as a computer professional one should keep in mind the possible risks of designing a software &amp; then take measures to mitigate or eliminate those risks. As far as the question regarding: "people might use it in the wrong way to cause harm" is concerned, that could possibly be controlled somewhat by the designer(s). I believe that ultimately it is he individual's (user) responsibility to take care while using the software designed by professionals because pretty much anything around us can be used "to cause harm" if we think about it.
    </li><li>
      the most important thing learnt in the class was what is the responsibility of being a programmer and developer and the anomie concept.
