<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so welcome cst students and welcome. Visitors today to hear a special presentation. From our guests so i'm pleased to introduce. Our guest today Thomas box oh who's Vice President of kips of Scotch one. soon to be President. And he's an alumnus of the department. And he's going to talk to us today about http and a little bit about the. career service certification career path that you might follow after you graduate computer science. So please help me welcome Thomas for a presentation and if you have questions. Please raise your hand or we'll keep an eye on the chat as well. Okay, so no further ado let's welcome Thomas with the presentation.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you Darrell and.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I muted okay good Thank you Darrell and thank you so much for inviting me to come here today and speak to the students. i'll start by sharing my screen here. Sure, so i've got the list of participants here, so that if you have any questions. I encourage you to raise your hand or put a question into the chat box. The point of our presentation or my presentation here today is to provide you the students with the information about the associated it professional designation. So please feel free to ask any questions at any time throughout my presentation I I encourage it, so a little bit about myself, I am an ISP and I tcp. It professional So those are the other two present other two designations, in addition to the http designation that kips has. I have been in the IT industry for its if you include my military time over 20 years, but if you just conclude the it professional part for about 14 years and i've worked for IBM. I was a manager application development for a while, with a small company called lex calm and I am now a data scientist with SAS tell. As Darrell pointed out, I am a graduate of the University of Regina and. The computer science program and. The greatest thing about this program was that that it is one of the kips accredited programs, and hence the the reason we're coming here today. it's all back to the http designation keeps accredited programs are why the tp designation was created in the first place it's very hard for once, you get into the industry to. Get that extra foothold. When it comes to your. When it comes to applying for jobs and any advantage, you can take take advantage of is something that's that I encourage everybody to do so. The http designation is a very easy way to do that, so today what i'm going to be going over in this presentation and like I said at any time, if you have any questions, please feel free to put up your hand or put it put your question into the chat box and I will answer it at that point. I hope to go over what the ITV designation is why it's important to us, specifically and then finally we're going to do a quick demonstration of the application process so that. That you'll have a chance to see how it's done and also importantly, what you'll need to do to get your http designation. So. So the ICP designation is the associated it professional designation, it was created by kips because the fact that we wanted to acknowledge all the students who graduate from it kips accredited it programs so here's an example of the the. tp certificate that you get. All that's really needed is if you're if you're in a kips accredited program is to fill in the information and or fill in the form and upon your graduation, you will be given the designation. There is a path for people who are not in in accredited programs, so if we have anybody on the chat right now, that is in software engineering or is getting the the computer. certificate instead of the computer science major or the computer science with honors major there is another path that you can go down to get the to to get the http designation, but it's additional steps that we won't be covering today. In addition to to the being a part of an accredited accredited program there is also what comes along with the ATP designation is kips membership. And discounts for students in that case membership. So why is it important. Basically, the biggest advantage that the http gives the applicant is that it covers over a major components of both the ISP and the I tcp designation, specifically the the main the the education component of the ISP and I tcp designations. If you have your Ai TV destination, we completely wave that criteria so for the ISP. What would be required after that is once you have your http designation is two years of work in the IT industry and then reapplying for for your ISP designation and then you'll get it. For the it CP designation i'll have to double check what the requirements are and that's something that if somebody is interested in. feel free to reach out to me and i'll i'll make sure that my contact information is available to everybody, and we can go through the it CP designation. The ISP is government recognized within saskatchewan so as a result. Your designation is backed by the government and backed by the end comes with that that backing as per legislation on it, the it CFP designation is a internationally recognized designation, so you can take that designation and show it to clients in the States Britain Europe. Most of the countries throughout China, India and so forth right into Australia, New Zealand, as well. So it's a it's a globally recognized it professional designation. Second point is when it comes to your resume. Any advantage, you can get on your resume is a good thing anything that's that says that you have that one more notch that you can you put you above the the rest of the lots. So this is one of the it's an easy way to to get this you've already done, the work being in an accredited program just by you graduating you have you've already. overcome one of the major steps of this and it's an easy way to indicate that on your resume. Finally. It gets you access to kips resources so for those who are unaware of what kips is kips is canada's it professional organization and specifically what we provide to our members is, we have a job board that that we manage so. These are job positions that are only available to to kips Members, we have regular monthly presentations i'm. Sorry little interruption here regular monthly interruptions that are part of our. professional development, we have a mentorship program which we we open up to students, regardless of their members or not, but once you've graduated. The mentorship program becomes available to kips members, and this will get you. Direct mentorship with an IT professional in the industry, and someone who's been in the industry for a while. This program has been running for the last three years and is continuing to run it will be restarting up again in September and finally network opportunities we have a wide range of different it professionals in a wide range of different. Areas of it, and when you attend our events, it gives you an opportunity to to reach out to these individuals and. expand out your your personal and professional network. So how do you apply.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;This point i'm going to. bring up the so the main thing that you're going to need when you're sorry. The main thing that you're going to need when you're applying for the the the form itself is you're going to need a headshot so I recommend. Since you're going to be giving us you're going to be uploading a headshot into your form anyway, this would be the same sort of headshot that you would put on your linkedin profile, so it gives you a vantage to do kill two birds with one stone. Finally, what you're going to need is you're going to need your you're going to need to have all your graduation information so you'll need to know. Your student number your your program and the program and the institution that you're. you're graduating from. Sorry that's probably my throat here and then of course you'll need to have personal information that that that you'll fill in as well, so email address mailing address and so forth, and the mailing addresses so that you can get your certificate in the mail. So, and the application process it's free for students, so they said you'll. drop in.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;A picture of yourself.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;If you want to put a prefix so for any of those who. are going on to get their. masters or doctorate you can throw in you know your doctor in there, I will not because I am not a doctor. shame. If you want to be included in the kips membership directory. You have to put in here, yes or no, this is just for if you want to get emails on kips events uh. I would recommend that you do put true in there just because the fact that this gets you access to when the mentorship program comes out. Our presentations when we have those and so forth we're really good at not spamming your inbox with with emails you'll get one per month basically from us. Here you put in your.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Which ones, this.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So this you think you put your name in here. Oh sorry yeah. Yes or No, this is so, we have the code of ethics. This is built into your program it's the the full code of ethics is available on on the site here, you can review it and. see what it stands for and what kips as an organization stands for and then, once you've filled it in. confirm, but your graduation date so my case. i'm old. 20th. Your number which I cannot remember. And then. And then your personal information. If you have a personal website, you want to include in there, otherwise you can leave it blank phone number, if you want to include that any of your. social media, if you want to include that this contact information gets populated into your membership into the membership database for you and the only people that can search the membership database our other Members keeps members. So feel free to put in whatever contact information you wish other it professionals to be able to see if you feel uncomfortable, the only thing that you really need to add in here is your email address so that. you're you can get your your. certificates in additional form. Likewise. You want to include your mailing address, for this is not included on the membership directory, this is just for just for you, so you can get your designation. Are there any questions about the application process.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;don't see any hands.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, great. i've also included in the in the slides and i'll make these slides available to. Dr happening for for people to review as well. Access to the application process as well, so if anybody is not a part of the one of the accredited programs in here will be the method that they need to to to to get that Oh, I see some questions coming in. How long does the application process take so the process time like it has to go to an approval board, who then reviews you're. Basically verifies that you are a student of your of the accredited program or, if you have, if you have to go through the non accredited Program. That you qualify for the other components that are other requirements for the designation and, at which point, then, then it will be completed if you. If you put in your. Your process prior to graduation. With like in some cases, we can make, we can make an agreement with with your institution to. Make your certificates available to your institution to be handed out to on your graduation day. So yes, so for current students do we have a separate process, or do we fill up same graduation up same graduate application. Okay, so for current students do we have a separate process, or do we fill up the same girl so. This the application, if you do not fill in the application for your http designation, because we are separate from. The University, if you don't fill it in you won't get the the decks nate designation so while you're still a student, in fact, you can fill the application within the last year of your. of your degree, so, while you are a student, you can fill this you can fill this this application process up is not filled in by the University of Regina on your behalf. So, David asked in the past, yet to fill a professional certifications for for work cna. Do you need to take any certification tests in order to get certified or for just for the application process for the http designation your. graduation from an accredited program is the certification process so that is the that is the requirement for the http designation. For the ISP and I tcp designation, there is a code of ethics exam that you may have to may have to take, but for more information, like this is more of a conversation that if you're interested David reach out to me and and we can go through this process. At a later time about the ISP and I tcp designation. So is the membership registration free so as a student's the membership resume like while you are a student at the U of our membership into kips is free after you graduate there is a significant discount for the first two years after you've graduated. From the from university so and I those those specific details will will be on the kips website so that'd be on the kips.ca. Are there any other questions. A has a range of years with programs the bar to do, does this mean if I didn't. know this does not mean that that if you graduated in 20 2023 that you're not going to be credited What it means is that the bar is currently in the process of being re credited. They have to re accredited their program every two years, and this actually let's segue into that because that's that's a very good question too. So the accreditation process as as a whole, so in 2022 the University of Virginia will be doing their re accreditation, which means that. If they're successful and, by all accounts, it looks like they're going to be successful, by 2023 they will be re accredited and that number will go from 2022 to 2024. and So aiden with regards to your question about do you need to be in your last year to apply for this, you can apply for this at any time, the worst that they're going to say to you. it's free, so the worst that they're going to say to you is you don't qualify at this time reapply it at a later date, the biggest thing that they are going to be looking at is your graduation year, so if you have your graduation year in there, they may. Again I can't speak for the the committee that does the accreditation process. The worst case scenario that they're going to or best case scenario that they're going to do is they're going to hold on to it until you graduate. and verify from the University that you've graduated worst case scenario is they're going to say. You don't apply at this time for this designation so we're not going to we're not going to give you the accreditation at this time, please reply at the later point. So that's that's a in my personal opinion that it's it's not going to hurt you if you apply Now you can always reapply later on, as you get closer to graduation. The answer your question. No, you do not need to take an examination to get your your Ai tp designation, you will you you potentially may have to for your ISP and I tcp designation. Okay perfect so let's go through, because there's a lot of questions here about the accreditation process so let's actually go through a little bit about the accreditation process so. The accreditation process is a is done at multiple different post secondary institutions. So in saskatchewan we are blessed in the fact that both our universities and SAS Polytechnic have accredited programs within the province, we have the highest representation per capita of post secondary institutions within the provinces across Canada. And, as a result, we have the highest rate of. designations per capita of any chapter or across the country as well, so this is something that that sketch was very proud about. So the accreditation process is done through a series of multiple interviews and. They includes onsite facility an onsite facility. Inspection where they inspect your classroom your labs all the facilities that that when you are at the university that you'll be using they. inspect the student projects and the students assignments or samples of that are that have been anonymized of projects and assignments that. They review to see a how it's challenging the students and be if it's meeting the criteria of the the accreditation process. They go through your textbooks and your training materials and they do a gap analysis between the industry, best practices and the course material that's being offered. upon the completion of each phase of the accreditation, the committee will provide the results of the gap analysis to the institution. And this is this provides a list of recommendations beyond the requirements that the institution can implement to further improve because kips is all about it, professionalism and the constant improvement of. Of the programs so yeah. And it says here the the process usually takes about 12 months to complete. So, as I alluded to earlier oh does a clockwork term experience count towards your ISP and I tcp certifications. I don't know, but I believe it does so I I won't say it with 100%. confirmed authority that that I think that it does count but i'm i'm confident that it does count towards it. That is a question that I can take to to the the the committee that's that's is involved with the ISP. Accreditation process, and I can ask them on that, if you wish. Does your designation expire, yes, it does the ISP designation expires every three years, the it CP designation expires every five years, so you have to reapply every three and five years. Okay, and. contact me afterwards i'll have my contact information at the end so that contact me about that question, so that I don't forget, and I can get you an answer. So, as I was alluding to before there are there are two programs at the University of China that are kips accredited program so it's the bachelors of science computers majoring in computer science with honors and the bachelor of science majoring in computer science. We have a list of all the accredited programs on our website for every institution across across Canada, and I think there may be some outside of the country, but I don't quote me on that. Any case here's the link here's the link to it, and again like these, slides will be made available as well. Yes, so kind of your your question about whether you're majoring in something other than as long as the core component is that BSC computer science. It counts towards that so double majors or a concentration in business communication or doing a double major in computer science and fine arts or computer science and business or computer science and engineering all those count were things that wouldn't count would be. So deepika know the deployment does not count uh so where where it doesn't count is yeah the diploma program at the bar is currently not accredited nor is the software engineering degree through the Faculty of engineering, that is not accredited either. So they're looking for that bachelors of science, from the U of our. So that being said. Dr deepak sorry deepak if you are still interested in gaining at Ai TB designation, there is still that process. Through this link here and I will put this. Let me just put this in the chat for you so that you can take a look through it. There is a process in there for non accredited programs, if you wish to get your http designation it's just a little bit more complicated so you'll have to keep that in mind. So, yes I major in computer science and a minor in in another science does count. So Martin is kips equivalent to a degree, no, it is not equivalent to a degree, it is a designation, so the. Designation in the in the industry is meant to be a. is meant to be a state of so. What your designation tells employers is that you are on the path to becoming an IT professional, so there is this means that. You have gone through the training of an accredited program and you have gained the knowledge necessary to to be considered an IT professional within their eyes and. If you continue down this path and get your ISP designation, this also means that you reaffirmed that you are following the kips code of ethics and are under the. Under the the the government recognized authority of that designation. So that's that's what it is so it's if you're trying to pass this off as your degree that that would be disingenuous it is, it is specifically. designation, not a degree you're you have our degree is your degree. So def has a question about as long as their major is computer science you're good that's that's correct, as long as you have. A major in your major is computer science, or you gain the badgers computer science, that is, the it's the majors that that they're that they're interested in that's the accredited Program. So a student membership, so we touched a little bit on this a little earlier on, so a student membership within the saskatchewan chapter of kips is 100% free. It gets you access to the students area of the of the organization, including access to our mentorship Program. And the invites to our presentations when we have our in person presentations I know that it can be difficult for students to be able to to attend some of the in person presentations. But. Since coven one of the biggest advantages has occurred is that we've been able to expand our events to virtual events and as a result we've we've been able to provide more a it professional. career advancement training to our members in the in the last year, then we have an in quite some time, so I do encourage everybody to go to the the kips website and take a look at it it's free. So it's it's you got nothing to lose by becoming a member. You do have to be a Member to maintain your designations so that's one thing to keep in mind after you graduate you do have to keep your your kips membership in order to keep your http designation if you're no longer a Member then then. The. The designation is no longer recognized by kips. A if you're an international so if you're an international students you're on a student visa there may be some. Some restrictions to your to your Member becoming a member, that is something that that I encourage you to reach out to myself or to kips the sketch, and to see if you can still become a member. We have been drastically increasing the number of international Members, especially, specifically those wishing to get their ISP an Ai tp designations as part of their. their desire to become a Canadian resident and to work in Canada. And finally, there is discounts for the first two years after your graduation so every year, while you are a fully registered student at the U of are your membership is free. After you graduate it's a. You pay for a full membership. But that full membership gets you two additional years in it, so you essentially are paying for your one year's registration counts for three years of kips membership so. Basically it's a 66% discount. So this is just a, this is a comprehensive list of all the different companies that have that higher ISP and I tcp. kips professionals is where where we draw our membership from, as you can see it's a quite an extensive list, and this is, these are just the ones in saskatchewan there are there are similar lists for. For the other provinces as well. Some that will be slightly different. So darryl you had a question about whether the http designation expires, no, it does not it's the one designation that doesn't expire, though, if you are no longer a member of kips your http designation is no longer recognized. So you can also apply for your http so if, for instance. So the it like, for instance, if our take myself if I wish to apply to get my http designation, I could do so because I had I have graduated from a kips accredited program so I can do that at any point, and as long as I maintain my kips membership, I can maintain my ATP designation.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Was there a question. I thought I heard something okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Finally, last last part I have is, this is a the general contact information for kips of scattering itself so i'm going to leave this up and then open up to questions and feel free to ask any question regarding with the http designation kips it professionalism. Expectations within the work environment at this point i'm i'm hoping at the any question i'm going to leave this information up here. So York has a question about. If I let my membership laps and then I reply a year later on, are my designations still recognized. While you are a member, they are recognized So if you successfully got your http designation, but your membership lapsed you don't have to reapply for your designation. We don't want to do that paperwork, when we know that you are qualified. But we won't we won't recognize the designations of anybody who has laps memberships. Does the http etc appear as a requirement in any job ads. Yes, it does so, specifically, you will see it as a it won't be a requirement for a job, but it will be a. good to have for the job so specifically the Crown corpse are are big on to that so you'll see in a lot of. Mid range and like mid to mid career and advanced positions that they will give preference to the ISP and I tip it CP designations. And then there are others minor companies as well, like silveira comes to mind oops.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So Vera comes to mind is as a company that i've seen on a regular basis that they have a request that you have your ISP as for the http designation in of itself, the http designation is relatively young so as a result, the, the number of companies that are are. explicitly asking. applicants to show that they have their http destination is extremely low, that is something that is on the kisses catch wins. Agenda for we're doing we're in the process of doing a marketing initiative and part of that is to raise awareness of the Ai tp destination, especially in these companies here. Because we want to be able to see it become more relevant That being said, in any of these companies, if you were to apply for a position and you say you have your http designation, it will, it will be seen as a step towards getting your ISP designation. Basically you're saying to the employee employer that that. While you don't have the the time in to get your ISP you are on that step towards their.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;just going to.Exit presenter mode here so that I can.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;i'm going to also include. My contact information for you guys as well. I did somebody have a question I thought I heard some nice microphone come off.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;time to ask questions. So. Is the ISP a good investment for students for professionals is accreditation important. Because it's not required.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Right so.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Should it be required, maybe.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;In my personal opinion, yes, it should be required um That being said. What i've known noticed personally within my own career uh when I went from not having my designations to getting my ISP designation and then again when I got my it CP designation was I saw a pay increase and a other responsibilities increase in my in my career. So when I worked for IBM uh i'll go back to the. Very beginning here when I went back to when I were a when I worked for IBM, the big thing that they way says they call it your apple alphabet soup was the number of letters, you had after your name. Every grouping of letters worked out to roughly about a $200 per year increase to your base salaries is what it roughly roughly equated to. And now, this is back in $2,007 so that numbers probably gone up because of inflation, but you can expect like that, like, I saw it with when I got my ISP my I gotta pay rates very shortly thereafter I forgot my tcp I got a pay raise or promotion actually after shortly thereafter that. Having that on your resume having that like that the whole key to it, is that you're making yourself a more valuable a. more valuable. Applicant and anything you can do to make yourself more valuable to to employers will always make you a will always increase your chances of getting at pay raises and better positions. So, while I won't say that it is. It is the only thing you want to get. I will say that it is, it is something that that does have a lot of value to it. So i've put my email address in there and i'll also put my linkedin as well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So if there's somebody who has their ISP designation.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;and
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Is. found to be acting on professionally all right, are there. Disciplinary yet.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So possible.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So prior to becoming the Vice President. I was on the discipline committee. kips so Scott or kips in each of their chapters has two committees that. That we spin up that's mandatory for every chapter across the across the country one is the prep professional conduct Committee and the other is the discipline committee the professional conduct committee is we call it our police. As a complaints of unprofessional behavior or fraudulent claims of it professionalism or. Any other infractions that would follow would go against our code of ethics are brought forward. That goes to the professional conduct our professional conduct committee and they investigate the matter, they take testimonials from from both sides, they gather evidence. And then they make a recommendation, if the recommendation is that somebody did act a counter to the code of ethics and the. body of knowledge on professional professional it professionalism, then that can be. submitted to the discipline committee, so this is made that I was on, at which point that discipline committee determines whether. This has to be a criminal case or whether it is a internal case, and if it's a criminal case it's handled, like all the information that we've gathered gets handed over to the rcmp and that's handled by them if its internal We then in the discipline committee. go through all the evidence point by point, see how much of an infraction is and apply the appropriate. penalties which can include. conclude it up to and includes revulsion revoking your designations. and banning you from being a member of caps. Does that answer your question.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thanks. So. Now the software systems engineering degree. Is not accredited by you, but if they do, they do go through an accreditation process.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So do you have comments about. Because if i'm on a position about. soccer systems engineering versus.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So in my. In my personal opinion, and this is my personal opinion. And does not reflect the opinion of kips as a whole. I would love to see the the software engineering. program be accredited by kips and I think that it should be accredited by kips. That being said. they're accredited by the the apex and as results, a. software engineers that come through that program are considered engineers legally and like professionally and legally, this does not stop them from getting their http designation after the fact, and some software engineers, we have we have one on our board. do go on to get their ISP designation so it's. I think it's a shame that they they don't get both their kips end apex. accreditation. But that is the choice of the Faculty of engineering and i'll respect their their choice. As as for the what's better software engineers or computer scientists. i'm not gonna touch that with a 20 foot pole.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;not trying to get you in trouble.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I have opinions but i'll keep them to myself. Is there another program called software systems development is there any information on the program the Th. So software systems development.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;theatre science.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;it's under computer science.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Is that is that included in the is that included in the the the computer science degree.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;it's a concentration like business.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so I think, as long as the as the applicant has their majoring in computer science, the specialization doesn't matter as much. Like it matters it matters from like the point of your degree it matters, and it will also matter what you're going to do when you get into the industry, but from the point of view of your qualifications to the ICP designation, it is included as part of your degree. pender had a question.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yes, so, while i'm getting my graduated four year degree in computer science and if i'm working part time does that count towards my experience. For ISP.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So, again i'll have to i'll have to. i'll have to defer to the the accreditation like the ISP accreditation. Committee to know for sure. But. It is my understanding, based on what is on the website that yes, it would count towards that any it professional. job is what they tend to look at so and i'll go into a little bit into the ISP getting your ISP designation when you're getting your when you're putting the application for your IP ISP designation. you're you're including your resume you're including a list of contacts like you're going through the same way that you would if you're applying for a job. And they're going through and checking that the positions that you held were a recognized it professional positions and that you were doing something as an IT professional so that's that's what they're they're mostly looking for, but again, like the specifics of whether a. A co op term or a part time job i'm more lean towards a part time job was probably probably more closer to the definitely included. versus the Co op student but i'm also confident that the Co op student is also included in the in that, in that it professional time as well, so included in your resume. And if you want to, if you want me to reach out to the committee and ask that question. I have my email address there and I have my linkedin feel free to reach out to me and I will get that those answers gee.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So our employers. recognized or accredited in some way.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Currently, they are not so the only recognition that we have with employers is through sponsorship, so if somebody is a recognized kip sponsor we recognize them on our. At our presentations and our conferences and and such so but like there is no. corporation accreditation process. We we focus on the it professional and not the it company just because we don't want to have to. go through that process of crediting every single company and then recruiting them every every three to five years it's it's it goes outside the scope of what kips kips intends to do with the with our accreditation process.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. Is it easy, is it. A factory if the employer has somebody who's got an ISP designation. Is that to make it. Is that a. factor in their favor that the consideration.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;If a company is known to have a to hire and. allow for ongoing it professional development. That is. The work experience with that company is considered. Such your question.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So in and of itself, like where you're getting your it experience. is not like it's not like company a is more viable than company be just that we want to verify that. Company A and B are it professional jobs and that you're doing an IT professional job. And that's what's that's what's more important than whether one company is better than the other, but we do know that certain companies that the positions that they have like we know that. With SAS tell every business metrics analyst is an IT professional job with IBM every programmer analyst is an IT professional job. Were there any other questions.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;explain the difference between ISP. And I see tp more.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So the the biggest difference between the ISP and the it CP designations, is whether it is a. Canadian or international, the ISP was. Created accredited and managed through kips it was it's a complete completely 100% Canadian created it professional designation, it is recognized in. In most of the Commonwealth nations so as part of the there's a there's a pact with education that's that it education that. is shared amongst the Commonwealth nations so, for instance, if you take your ISP designation and go to Australia Britain a New Zealand South Africa. Bahamas so forth, they will recognize your ISP designation, but if you were to go to the States, they may or may not. Be it CP designation is an international designation the the organization that created, it is called the IP three organization and while kips is one of the founding members that helped create the ITC P designation and to ensure that the ISP designation mix up. somewhere between 80 and 90% of the requirements for the it CP designation, it is still a internationally recognized designation and the application process and the application committee for the tcp designation is with IP three out of New York, rather than Ottawa.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;tcp then ISP.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;marginally but yes. The sort of expected natural. path for the designations is. We would expect somebody to get their http designation right away, after two years, get their ISP designation and within a year that get their it CP designation.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;dammit.keep on doing that.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;There we go. With any other questions. Was the application process you showed us for the kips membership or the a it does, it was for the ICP designation. Would you like to see the would you like to see the. application for membership.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;terrific and talk about people who aren't in the fourth year it can, or they can sign up for student membership okay.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So what you do is go to kips.ca So this is the national website. Then you go to join us. and student membership. And then just download the application fill it in all right well actually it comes in, so keeps the sketch, and were you there we go see we're free and only place it still has a charges if you're in P, I. And then you just fill in your application as per per per normal so it's very similar like the everything from the. The directory down is the same as the http designation So yes, you're going to see sort of like that it's going to always say rhyme essentially but. it's the big thing with it is, is just yeah make sure you select saskatchewan in the desk in the membership process. And it's free. kips the sketch, one is dedicated to providing. Free student memberships for as long as it's financially capable, for us to do so. And while you're on the side likes it like we have our our job board that's that I encourage you to take a look at there's. Specific. Events for the national events so being a member of kips the Scotch when does not. prevent you from attending other kips vents in fact. Especially if their virtual events. I encourage you to take a look at them a lot of these events will have definitely our events in saskatchewan will have discounts for students to attend.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Any other questions. So you're in Alberta right now on a Co op term do I still apply for saskatchewan. The which the the chapter in which you wish to join us, should be the the the chapter that you feel you're going to be associated with the longest. So there's no restriction for anybody like if I wanted to right now I could become a member of kips P, if I wanted to. Though in my case, it makes way more sense because i'm in saskatchewan and i'm under saskatchewan intend to be a member of kips the Scotch one. So as an example, people who live in like minister, some of them joined kips Alberta, some of them joined kip saskatchewan even though they're in both provinces at any given time, so if you're on your if you feel that if you feel that you're going to. Work in Alberta after you graduate and you want to become a member of kiss Alberta at that time, then I would recommend going to kips Alberta otherwise there's no restriction to say that you have to be in Alberta or saskatchewan. Can you be a member into kips organizations, no you can't once you put your application process in for your kips membership. So this is gets into a little bit of the structure of keeps us as an organization. You are a member of a provincial chapter and that provincial chapter is a member of kips national when you apply for your membership, you are you're paying your money to kips national who then. donates that Martin not donates gives that money a portion of that money to your chapter for the purposes of of your membership, so you cannot be a member of more than two two chapters that being said. at any point that you are a member of one of the chapters, you can always switch membership just by filling in a form. For for us that are on the the Board of Directors we don't like that, when that happens, because it does mess up like you know somebody paid their membership for the year and then they switch to another province mid year it, it does mess up our our budget but. it's less of an issue if you're a student.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;it's not based on resident.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;No it's not it's based on activity. Though I would say that. Within kips the sketch, when a X looting our are like we have a we have a large number of international Members who are so kips or sorry. This saskatchewan government has a immigration program where, if you have your ISP or end or it CFP designation. That. It will fast track your your immigration process into the province. So, as a result, we have a large number of international members. If you exclude those from our membership base and look just at people that live in Canada. The majority of ours, our Members are like well over 99% are from saskatchewan and I would expect the same to be for every other chapter in Canada. The only exception to that is go back because Quebec doesn't have a kips chapter so anyone that wants to be part of kips are us you a member of kips Ontario.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, any other questions. Alright, so. let's give our speaker. Virtual round of applause. Thank you, Thomas again for talking to us. and we're almost at the end of class time so to end. Our meeting this time as well, thank you, Thomas. Thanks students and we'll see you on Tuesday. And if we had any non CS students, thank you for joining for the presentation today. Okay, thanks again everybody. Okay. So you're free to go Tom.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Great.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you so much Darrell for for giving me this opportunity to speak to students, I really appreciate that and. Let me know if if you need anything else from from us and. At least i'd like you're more than willing to you're more than free to use this to repair it anytime that that you want to any other students.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Take care.

<ul><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;congrats!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Welcome Thomas! :)
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Welcome!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Welcome!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Welcome!
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Welcome!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Seems straightforward enough.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;How long does the application process take?
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so for current students, do we have a separate process or we fill up the same graduate application?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;In the past, I've had to take professional certifications for work eg. CCNA. Do you need to take any certification tests in order to get certified, or is it just an application process?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Is the membership  registration free?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Okay thank you
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;The accredited programs page has range of years with the programs and the UofR being 1982-2022. Does that mean graduating in 2023 would not be accredited
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have to be in your last year of school to apply for this?
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;we need to give any examination to get cips certificate.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, thank you
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;thanks
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Does a Co-op work term experience count towards ISP and ITSP certification?
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;does cips certificate expires?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you, that would be much appreciated!
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;If I am BSc Computer Science w/ Major Concentration in Business. Does that count?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;is Diploma in Computer Science does counts?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Oh great, thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Major in CS and Minor in any other science counts as well?
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Is CIPS equivalent to a degree?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;https://cipsresources.ca/AccreditedGraduateApplication
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;As long as the major is CS you're good
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;thank you!
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;does AITP expire on its own, like I.S.P. and ITCP?
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;If I lose membership for a year, and then reapply, do I still have the certificates or do I have to reapply for each of them again?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Does AITP, etc, appear as requirement in job ads?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;thomasboxall@gmail.com
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;https://linkedin.com/in/thomas-boxall-5a7b7131/
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;There is also another program called software systems development. Is there any information on that program related to AITP?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Good to know, thank you
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Was the application process you showed us for the CIPS membership or the AITP designation?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;I am in Alberta right now for a coop term do I still apply for Sk?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;So follow up question, can I be member in 2 CIPS?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for the talk Thomas, much appreciated :) I will definitely be checking out the AITP  designation for myself
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you so much, very informative!
