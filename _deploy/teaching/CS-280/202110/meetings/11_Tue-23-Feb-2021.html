<ul><li>
      The most important thing I’ve learned from last class came from the TED talk we were asked to watch. The TED talk ‘How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every day’ by Tristan Harris, discussed how many modern apps and websites have only one goal: Keeping your attention for as long as possible without regard for how much value that app or website is actually adding to your life. This idea is important as it shines a light on a major issue with modern apps and websites, opening up discussion for a better way and better solution....
    </li><li>
      The most interesting thing that i learned from the video is the example given by the speaker that if trees in a forest can live by being with each other why not humans can live that way. It is true that nowadays we are trying to develop a better technological world, we are not focusing on making a better world for humans. It should be technology for humans in future not humans for technology.
    </li><li>
      I thought the most important thing in the meeting 10 plan (i don't recall if we went over it in the actual class I don't think we did tho) was how oblivious the general population is to the amount of manipulation we undergo every day through technology. That really resonated with me and kindof highlighted how even the simplest of things influence us. For example, anthropologists/historians will know information told out of the eyes of another will always be tainted.
    </li><li>
      I think the most difficult thing for me to understand on this meeting is the concept of "new problems". On the one hand, problems can be deconstructed to be like old problems, which one might think can be solved like old problems (for example, a technological communication problem can be viewed as an underlying communication issue). However, on the other hand, these new problems are in a completely new environment, society, and context (thus it might be inappropriate to look at new problems in the same vein as old problems). Thus, which is the correct approach to problems?
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about how companies make sure they hold people's attention. When pointed out snapchat's streak feature was a way of keeping attention blew my mind open. It didn't exactly seem obvious to me at first but once pointed out it is clear that they use the to make people come back day after day.
    </li><li>
      I appreciate you trying to make the website and response forum as accessible for us as possible, but I think we should spend a little more time discussing course content and expectations of assignments. Through the lectures, I find it unclear what we are supposed to be learning about and it is quite frustrating when we make it through an entire meeting without talking about topics related to the outcomes of the class. I apologize if this is coming off the wrong way, but I value the class time and I think we could be spending it more wisely.
    </li><li>
      I thought the most important concept of mtg10 was the ethics of 'attention engineering', if you will, of the technology industry. Harris explained it best in the clip we watched; how big tech designs interfaces in which to keep your attention. But the obvious concern, is that healthy for the user? It's no doubt that the auto-play feature helps grip our attention but at what cost? An increased market share, more users, more profits, all over the fact that it may not be healthy for users to stay “hooked” on the platform.
    </li><li>
      I think the most important thing I learned last meeting was that no matter how inclusive or open to feedback a designer or developer can be, there will always be someone who will criticize them. Criticisms should always be taken seriously, but at some point there is only so much you can do to make a tool enjoyable, functional and accessible to all users. Some people will need to put more work into using the product; some may never enjoy it. In the quest to make a good product, developers should understand that perfection is likely not achievable.
    </li><li>
      In our 10th meeting we discussed something that happened in the news with Zoom technology. A lawyer accidentally left his Zoom Cat filter on and decided to proceed with the trial. We then discussed about our first blog assignment and its 900 word requirements. Lastly we discussed if the class needed to rework its meeting review submissions. The outspoken student majority liked to keep the current submission. However, me and my zoom break out roommates would prefer if we can submit on a weekly or bi-weekly basis since we believe as of right now it is tedious and easily forgettable....
    </li><li>
      The last meeting included a breakout room discussion regarding the UR Courses. So by noting everyone's opinions I got to learn that no matter how accessible one makes an interface for public welfare, people are gonna expect more of it rather than appreciating the efforts. So in such cases, I think the developer/professional should just strictly impose his/her interface amongst the public as they got no other alternative rather than using it.thanks, Dr. Hepting I know how much efforts it takes to set up such a platform, I do appretiate your work.
    </li><li>
      Tristan Harris' video explains the insecurity of social media, but it also helps us to recognize our weakness and to set boundaries. We know from this how tech companies quickly notice our thinking and feeling, and if we take sufficient precautions, we can turn these awful observations into optimistic ones.We are no longer valued for our creativity, but for the data, says Rushkoff. He motivates us not to use technology for market efficiency but for enhancing our career with our skills and knowledge and also promotes teamwork.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 10, video "I'm not a cat" is funny. It reflecting the powerful technology will also accompany with complex problem. Various tools and features are showing up, But for most of adults born before 90s are hard to understand or learn as fast as we can do on computer. If we learn and know how to use a new tool in 10 min, they might take 1 hour to figure out how the tool run and how to open it. In the video "I'm not a cat" it reflecting this problem obviously.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learnt from ''Team Human'' video by Douglas is that we have to stop technology to improve human beings for the market and start improving the technology for the human future.
    </li><li>
      I think that the 100 words limit for each response is a good suggestion. There are over 100 students and the time it takes to look at every one of them is just too much for one person. The audio transcript is a great tool for everybody, protecting their privacy. Privacy is one of the few things that people think they still have.The engagement for each meeting is good. The layout is clear and concise; there are varieties of topics. I like the touch on current events. That is helpful with the assignments, as it is so much is going...
    </li><li>
      I really liked the ted talk by Tristan Harris. He pointed out about the digital applications or social media tricks that make us get more addicted to it. Whenever we see notifications, it automatically scheduled us to do something that we didn’t plan, Such as Facebook notifications. When we swap it over, it make us spend more time into it and distract us. All the apps trick us to have our attention and thats why it focused on how our mind works. Youtube use really clever idea to make us spend more time into it. Once a video is finished,...
    </li><li>
      I learned many things from this meeting, one foremost thing is to protect people from crazy gadgets as human is a team. Human can communicate and elaborate things whereas technology cannot. Humanity is on one side and technology on other so no one can replace anything. From other video, I learned about the state that apps control all people with there mesmerizing tricks of making things simpler and attractive because of the race between all apps.
    </li><li>
      I really liked the ted talk “I’m not a cat” by Tristan Harris. There were many things that blew my mind. This is very true reality about the snapchat streak, that how teenagers just so addicted to it. The Netflix and YouTube’s autopay tricks also pretty much relatable for me. Whenever I start watching any show, even though I promise myself that it will be just one or two episode I end up awake the whole night and finish the full season. This is the reason why I liked that ted talk as it pointed out about today’s reality on...
    </li><li>
      Well first then first i do find it interesting on how discussing the fact that how we have a common sense that developers need to make everything perfect or candor to everthing need but a lot of software is made then shipped and with the custormers feed back is given it is used hopefully to change the data to better help the consumers use the software so over time it changes. More on my thoughts
    </li><li>
      Is Team Human still going strong?Team human is a really interesting video on the TED talk by Douglas Rushkoff, a promoter of human autonomy in the digital age. He presents his thoughts on a few of the new realities faced by the human collective “us” against the newer developments from technology. This, however, is even more critical when one begins to apply those thoughts to today’s reality during a global coronavirus pandemic. Far from just controlling our thoughts by push notifications, technology is in control of our career, entertainment and ultimately our growth as humans in society. Some of us...
    </li><li>
      could you please explain the difference between ethical and professional conversations. And after watching the video again do you think the digital landscape has repressed creativity and novelty (what makes us most human)
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned this meeting was that technology is not evolving randomly. Technology is evolving in a very specific way in a race for our attention. Subliminal scheduling via notification or snapchat streaks was a concept that was difficult to wrap my head around. I would love to learn more about targeted media, adds, and how Social media uses these to their advantage. I've encountered many targeted adds on YouTube, and even YouTube personalities that are always speaking about the recommended feed of others and the dangers of targeted adds on seemingly children's content.
    </li><li>
      I think Tristan Harris' speech is spot on with what is happening with social media and the current trend of technology/apps. This predatory design philosophy of maximizing time spent on the app keeps us entertained, but there is certainly a social cost. I do enjoy that he provides actual solutions to solving this, as it's much easier to state a problem problem without offering a solution. Some of his solutions come from the designer-level, but the one that stands out to me is that we have to individually acknowledge that we're all persuadable. I think it's easy to think that...
    </li><li>
      As Tristan Harris said in his speech, today's Internet giants, from Facebook to Netflix, are trying to attract more attention. I would like to give an example, let's say TikTok, it's an app that for the user to share their short videos, also to view the videos. The app uses the user's viewing history to push the next video and keep going, it's easy for people who aren't in control to spend hours on it. Meanwhile, there are a lot of kids that using this app. Children or teenagers often lack self-control so they could sit in the room and...
    </li><li>
      The struggle to find balance in our society is interesting. As explained in the videos, companies are trying to maximize their profits by designing algorithms that control the behaviours of their users, while we have to find better ways to spend our time. Unfortunately, it seems impossible to convince these companies to persuade people into doing more meaningful things because they have to please their shareholders. We have to modify the structure of corporations to see real changes. I'd like to learn more about whether or not these companies are actually taking steps to improve the wellness of our society....
    </li><li>
      I enjoyed Tristan Harris' TED talk where he talked about how tech companies fight for people's attention in unethical ways. He spoke about how these companies use outrage to hold people's attention and this is something I have noticed in my life. When I view the replies to a tweet on Twitter, it seems to intentionally show me replies that make me upset, or that I disagree with, because those are the replies I am most likely to interact with. Even though seeing these replies affects me negatively, Twitter will continue showing me upsetting replies because they hold my attention.
    </li><li>
      There are a lot of definition on the philosophy of science what the most efficient i can define is as a problem of reliably distinguishing science from non-science. Modern philosophers of science largely agree that there is no single, simple criterion that can be used to demarcate the boundaries of science that the history of science can be divided up into times of normal science (when scientists add to, elaborate on, and work with a central, accepted scientific theory) and briefer periods of revolutionary science. During times of revolutionary science, anomalies refuting the accepted theory have built up to such...
    </li><li>
      The interesting this that I learned in this meeting was about conceptual distance between human and computer. If the distance is small, the system is easier to use where as it can become unusable if the distance is large.Another interesting thing that I learned is the use of metaphors in computer interface that bridge the gap between person and device.
    </li><li>
      Both of these Ted talks brought up interesting points about the manipulation of big tech. We have been manipulated to live out a life that we don't necessarily want, all these small little things, like auto playing the next video to keep us engaged on the website stop us from living what we want. It feels as if tech companies see humans as numbers, some way to profit. We have become aware of the influence technology has on us I think it's time to engage in real interactions and change how the next generation interacts with technology.
    </li><li>
      Tristan Harris gave wonderful example about Snapchat. I also maintain streak with my friends. But we need to bring radical change by following three rules laid by him: We need to understand that we can be convinced, We need new templates and structures of transparency, We need redesign renaissance.Douglas Rushkoff says that nowadays value of person’s creativity is way less than their data. Rushkoff encourages us to stop using technology to optimize people for the market and start using it to create a future based on our pre-digital values of interaction, innovation and respect.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we had discussion the resourses availble on ur courses as the professor made a great efforts on bringing the resouses from his website to Ur courses, we had same discussed about same in the break out room and everybody was happy as everything was now availble on a single platform.
    </li><li>
      The digital future is erasing the essence of mankind, and the relationship between people will become weaker and weaker in the future. The digital future is actually not as good as people think. The reason for this phenomenon is the competition of capital. People receive higher education not to learn but to find a good job. Major companies compete with each other for the attention of users, just to get more benefits. If this phenomenon of vicious capitalist competition is not dealt with effectively, the digital future is desperate
    </li><li>
      As we see in the crash I think the accessibility was ok according to the requirement but accessibility was very poor because the captains were down to check which distracted and caused a disaster, which was not sufficient of course but I think it was not only the system's fault it was an also the captain's distractions were also at the fault, so the light bulb can be a coincidence we can improve them by adding cameras at such places which can be important
    </li><li>
      In this last class, we talked little much about blog 1, and then we had a good discussion on a few topics such as metaphors and analytical design that how metaphor is an unexpected comparision of two dissimilar objects that the main thing is that the similar object but with diffrent innovations in them.
    </li><li>
      It is a common fact that almost all the social media platforms create a content-profile for an individual users to provide relatable content and keep them engaged. This keeps the user engaged with the platform for a long time by keeping the users attention on content they are more likely to enjoy. This attention hogging ends up taking our minds off the topics we do need to focus on and keeps us engaged with topics which give us a short-live dopamine boost. By the time this ends, we are presented with similar content and the cycle continues taking up our...
    </li><li>
      The videos incline towards how persuasive technology is used to attracts engagements in different platforms. Basically, it is a technology used to change attitudes and behavior through social influence. The social sites such as facebook, Youtube, etc.. are designed in a way that lures engagement from the users to that they get the data. These companies sell the data to advertisers to make revenues. By analysing and assessing their content, using existing psychological research theories and techniques, Persuasion design is the design of messages. Andrew Chak claims that the most compelling websites concentrate on making users feel good about making...
    </li><li>
      It was really helpful
    </li><li>
      I found Don Norman's speech very interesting, the ideas of ”Anxiety can make people focus, and happiness makes people think more creative “. When I encounter a time-limited problem in study or work, my attention is often more concentrated, and when I study in a relaxed atmosphere, I often come up with some interesting ideas to solve problems.
    </li><li>
      Speaking from the video team human, I want to understand more about the concept of the digital renaissance which was about the unbridled potential of the collective human imagination and it spanned everything from chaos math and quantum physics to fancy role-playing and Gaia hypothesis.I got from the video that education is compensation for a job well done
    </li><li>
      Meeting 10 helps me to understand the need for accessibility and usability of an interface. the accessibility of an interface will improve its usability. Using the examples like Facebook and discord in class, I help understand that when we are building an interface we have to acknowledge that there would be a diverse number of people that would use the interface, and therefore the interface should be built "easy to use" whilst still maximizing efficiency and usability for the problem designed for.
    </li><li>
      It is something to think about how there is nothing random in this universe. The newsfeed we see, the videos we are recommended on various social platforms are the results of the various algorithms they use. It is like, in the democratic country, there is no democrat. It really got me when Tristan said that From Facebook notifications to Snapstreaks to YouTube autoplays, they're all competing for one thing: your attention.
    </li><li>
      In last class we discussed about blog 1. And we discussed about the digital future is removing the mankind and relationship between people and I think is due to the money or capital income and tristin harris speech is about waht happening with people and technology.
    </li><li>
      Tristan Harris’s Ted talk:He talks in his ted talk about how all the big tech companies are fighting for our attention. These platforms design their interface in such a way to keep you more and more engaged with their platform. All the design elements like streaks on Snapchat or auto-play on youtube are all designed and engineered to keep us more invested in their app. This is a major issue for our mental health, our democracy, and even our personal relations. We could use this power of technology to be more productive and connected but it just looks very poles...
    </li><li>
      One of the points brought up during the meeting was what we should do with the information that we collect, if we should examine it or leave it be. And honestly, it depends on what we are building. If we are collecting information such as the browser the user is connecting with, I would say that is useful information we could use to better optimize our application, as if we have a large portion of users connecting from a certain browser, we should make sure that it works properly in it and monitor for potential updates that may cause further...
    </li><li>
      In this videos I have learned that all the internet apps like you tube, Netflix, and others use the technology for control the minds of people to earn more money. For example, You tube and Netflix use the next video option to increase the time of the screen. and snapchat uses the streak option to maintain the usage.
    </li><li>
      Hello,Basically in this meeting we just discussed what should we improve to make the engagement section better and meaningful. I totally agree with Dr. Hepting by maximising 100 word limit for the response. The main advantage is one can read more responses in short period of time and also because of the limit response will be precise and unto the point.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about blog-1 where we went through the topics and all. Also we discussed about the video which discusses the difference between human and technology. We also discussed more about ur courses and hoe everything should be on it which makes easier to us. Overall, the meeting was really helpful.See you in the next meeting.
    </li><li>
      I like the idea of keeping the meeting response concise. This encourages students to respond to the meeting with one point, instead of jumping around to many different things.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we saw 2 videos . In the first video, Tristan Harris who worked as a design ethicist at Google talks about how digital media like youtube or social media platforms like facebook and snapchat is trying to gain users by gathering their attention. For example , sending notifications and updates. So for this they design their UI using persuasive techniques. humans tend to blame the content that is shared by others on the internet is useless or a bad influence but actually the companies who create these platforms are the only ones to be blamed.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing to take away is how we are being guided by the AI to do things that we weren't planning of doing. It's like we have become a doll who's entrapped in this Doll House where these AIs controls our lives and make important decisions for us. I'm also surprised how there is actually a lab to teach how to control/influence people using technology.  On the other hand I am worried about how people think using a chip and downloading all the knowledge in it will make us a better and smarter humans in contrary I think...
    </li><li>
      We learned form the video that internet is seeking our attention. They always need our attention and to get our attention they add more options and use methods to suck us in. And i think self awareness is the best way to tackle it. Knowing where to spend your time and with whom is really important and not using phones all the time is the right way which everyone of us should know.Human beings are different from computers, we are aware of what is going on in our life unlike computers who just does same thing everyday. Humans are special...
    </li><li>
      “How a handful of tech companies control billions of minds every day” is an excellent video that I really enjoyed watching. I learned how big tech companies use persuasion and covert techniques to get our attention and to hook us to their platforms.“How to be “Team Human” in the digital future” taught me how technology is killing creativity and novelty. We need to build a world we don’t need to escape from.I would like to know more about the techniques we can use to not be persuaded by social media platforms and how one can overcome cellphone addiction.
    </li><li>
      In the class, we have discussed about the user interface design and how it should be designed to make it user for the users. We have discussed that how discord is fuzzy and confusing. Afterwards we had a group discussion where we discussed about the design of UR courses for this course.The class was more about sharing point of views regarding user interface design. According to me, a website should be designed to be simple and user friendly so that it can attract more audience.
    </li><li>
      At the last meeting, we heard an interesting news of a judge on the court through zoom has the camera with a cute kitty filter on his camera. Which is very funny. we should always make sure to turn off the filters before we join in a formal zoom meeting. Also, we’ve discussed the design for the class meetings and website. For my point of view, I am ok with the personal website, which is easy and styled instead of making lots of operations on UR courses.
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about how to make user interface good. Like for designing the websites there are 5 E's criteria so I would like to know if there is anything like that for that.I really liked the example of discord for user interface and later in group discussion we all agreed that professor is trying his best to make ur courses easy to use. And it is really easy to access.
    </li><li>
      Both of these Ted talks raised intriguing focuses about the control of large tech. We have been controlled to carry on with out a day to day existence that we don't really need, all these little seemingly insignificant details, similar to auto playing the following video to keep us drew in on the site prevent us from living what we need. It feels as though tech organizations consider people to be numbers, some approach to benefit. We have gotten mindful of the impact innovation has on us I believe it's an ideal opportunity to take part in genuine cooperations and...
    </li><li>
      Tristan Harris's video has lots of talk about how the companies are trying to attract their users by different-different design. he also gives some example such as Facebook, Youtube has an auto-play option for the video. Moreover, Snapchat has different thing is streaks. So he was explaining these all things by giving an such an great examples, and keep the users more engaged.
    </li><li>
      Being creative and building yourself up to doing just the little bit of extra step, personally, cheers me up and makes me feel good about myself. It gives a weird level of satisfaction, the ability to go past my limit just a little bit. I try to do different activities so my creativity is always getting something new and then I can apply this to my work and get the satisfaction I want!
    </li><li>
      I have not attained the lecture because of some reason so I don't know what we discuss in class.
    </li><li>
      From this meeting, there were many things to be learned.There were two videos the first one was the Tristan Harris and the second one was the Team Human.From Tristan Harris, I learned that tech companies control everything while we are using the simplest technology such as mobile phone.He also tells us about how the thoughts of the people are ethically stalked. How things are planned so that we perform a particular task at a particular time. Every app every application are built in that way that seeks our attention and there is a competition between the developers about how to...
    </li><li>
      in the last meeting, a girl told us about a the news related to judge on the court through the zoom has the camera with a cute kitty filter on his camera. Which was very funny for me. Also, i really like the example of discord user interface and later in the group discussion we all agreed that professor is trying his best to make ur course easy to use for us.
    </li><li>
      The purpose of digital world is to improve the quality of human life, saving people from the problems that we had before. However, the role of humans in the digital world is more like a vehicle for providing data so that people are losing the ability to love, forgive, and communicate. In so many ways, people's behaviors go against the nature of things without noticing that we are making the world even worse. People have to realize that human beings are the foundation of the world, and technology is only an adjunct to them.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, I learnt about user interface and 5E's criteria and watched Tristan Harris's video that I am not a cat and control our feelings. Suppose we are sitting somewhere and our sense is the same as the surroundings and I learned virtual reality and mental reality from Team Human video.
    </li><li>
      I appreciate the change to a 100 word limit because it allows everyone to stay on topic and encourages people to read more opinions in a direct and concentrated manour.
    </li><li>
      we discussed in class meeting about first blog like how to write and upload that.
    </li><li>
      As seen many websites and social media use thinks like streaks to manipulate user to use that application very often. It is like you loop which never ends. If you start scrolling the feeds you will never know where the time went. The useful thing like internet is used in very wrong way to just earn money.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Hello. how's everyone doing today. Little rushed around i'm trying to organize. An event and. I want to get your input on that. Never a dull moment around here, it seems. So we have an alumnus from the University of Regina. did his bachelor series grow. warning me raised in China. He said NASA and he's in charge of. robotics division Program. So there's a. wired article from July when perseverance was launched. To talk about building a self driving car from Mars. His name is Larry massey's and. So he's like he's agreed to do a zoom seminar for us. So he was he was here in 2004. So you don't remind remember 2004. Like I do but anyway, he was here giving a battlefield lecture. Which is. Now we have the science public lecture. anyway. started the science public lecture. To replace it. So he came to talk about in the earlier. Mars Rover mission. Anyway, so it's time to have him back. semester. Ninth and after April 9. i'll try to make it a weekday evening. Okay, so i'd like your input on that. Okay, so still waiting for about. 15 people to reply to the pole so goodness 30 seconds. Okay. 30 seconds we're still waiting for a few people but. i'm going to end the poll now. Okay, so. Have a slight preference for before March 29. So, looking at the calendar. i'd say about. That last full week of full week of March. So we need to pick a date between the 22nd in the 25th of March that's a Monday to Friday Monday to Thursday sorry. And we'll try and have it at the same. 7pm. time slot in the evening. I can ask. One more question. Okay, so i'm making a multiple choice multiple. Answer vote for as many days as you like. But it's that week march 22 to the 25th. Now, where did it go. keen on Friday, because that's just. included. ready now. 30 seconds. Okay, so any 6% of you voted. i'm going to end the call. So Tuesday, is the least popular day and Wednesday is. This edging out Monday, as the most popular. So i'll just take this information and. Oh, see what his availability is like. So let's let's see evening, going to be like well introduce the speaker. and Then we'll talk for I don't know. 45 minutes or so 45 minutes to an hour and then they'll be some live question and answer. So he'll, be it won't be like Dave palmer's talk, because it will you won't have a pre recorded talk don't do that live. preference. Speaking of Dave Palmer Let me give you. A promise video. Okay, that should be the. link to the first seminar with Dave Palmer the guy who created windows task manager. So I edited that video on my MAC. Some of the bloopers from the live meeting. anyway. What the idea would be for. This talk by Larry massey. So thank you for your input about scheduling it. no guarantees that they would come up with all natural we've talked about here. Data point. I tried to keep up with email on the questions about the assignment but. seemed like most people got it in Okay, in the end. And the marker and I will be understanding, if there are some issues and. So it will be in touch with you about things that need to be clarified okay. So I put up the second blog. Entry description. And, as anyone had a chance to look at it yeah. Okay, so anyway i'm open to some clarification, yet about this so maybe we can just. Let me, let me share my screen and then we'll get to. OK so. The details are writing. well. This paragraph that. describes what i'd like you to discuss in your second blog post. So that deals with.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Upholding are defending the public interest to public good and examines how to define it in a practical way. sedation code of ethics says that the code. gurus principles formulated a statement of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good, is always the primary consideration. Now. I have a link there to Defense distributed anyone heard of Defense distributed before. Not so much in the news of present, I think. They created some 3D printer files for a gun. I can't remember a single shot. gun and. So that was their claim to fame. and interest in the Department of Justice in the States. I think that case is dropped. And now, they have some. they're involved with. cnc. devices to do some. parts. and so on. So I remember hearing. cody Wilson, who is the founder of that. Company, who is talking about. Their work being in the public interest. and It seems like there are lots of people who companies who would say that. Their work is in the public interest. But maybe. Maybe they benefit from the. idea of. or a lack of a clear definition of what the public interest or the public good, is. So i'm not saying you have to look at. That company. Or that history that particular story for your blog post that. Something where. claim or. The claim is being made. Public the public good, is being. placed with highest importance. And then, then to explore what what what is it what they meant what that. What definition of the public good, is implied there. isn't really in in the interest of the public good. So find an example of a claim that the public good, is is a primary is the primary consideration and critically examine that claim. Further than we can. discuss and clarify is required. There is a there is an ongoing discussion about Facebook in Australia. Seen seen in the news. So a version of this is. The Australian Government is trying to. pass legislation that would. not allow Facebook to scrape. Australia news sites. free of charge. And then have. Mark Zuckerberg make more money. To have them pay for that content. So that the local media ecosystem in Australia is supported. So in Canada there's similar. Like legislation being.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;contemplated.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So it seems like. they're talking about some people were. Saying. Rupert Murdoch is. Trying to keep us stake in the industry, and it was about. Protecting the little guy. So I thought we could do a little breakout session here for 10 minutes. To discuss. Ideas around Facebook. Is Facebook. The bad guy here are the. Okay yeah i'll do attendance in a second here. thanks for the reminder. Mention is that. Facebook removed Australian. News content from the site. So Facebook users couldn't. can share news stories, but then it wasn't always just about news, it was about. Public health information was also unavailable. So related so think about that is also related is the question of free. I think, because I listened to. ads on TV. comment about already proposed to replace them. Can. anyway. Everything is being proposed to be. free to the consumer, all these like. sell your home via home it's all free. Everything is free. Now is that the model. says, this is a sustainable model. When it comes to. news on the Internet. Talk about. Facebook and free. there's legislation being prepared in Canada. i'm not sure the details have been released, yet it's still being worked out. Okay, so is that seem clear enough. Okay i'm going to. Do breakout rooms now. Okay i'm opening the rooms now. For 10 minutes we'll get back. here. Okay, so do you want to share some of the interesting things that were going on. New breakout rooms, either in chat or. With the whole group with microphones. So what is the hardest subject. Okay, serving see the password for the. attendance. Any comments about Facebook discussion. centers encouraged.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;That um I think you read a little bit that there was a backlash and Facebook restored the. News articles or something like that, but it didn't day it's going to happen again like Facebook has not learned their lesson. Most of the time, all these backlashes are kind of pointless because we're just gonna keep doing it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;renews a proprietary platform to. enable our communication. it's not. We don't have the same relationship with telephone providers and. Maybe. The Facebook situations, a bit like the power outage in Texas. Is you don't have public accountability, we have private companies.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;But on the other hand, Facebook, is a private company, so in a way, they kind of are allowed to do what they want, with their system. Like. Like. Like the only thing that we can really do is basically go cool you're allowed to do that, but we just want us anymore and we'll make our own system so. yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I noticed, for example, the CBC or. Well, not, not a single to CBC but. They make use of Facebook. And, to me it seems like the public broadcaster should not be using private. platforms like that. Then we know some complicated issues, I guess, in terms of. Managing. Managing the accessibility and. Providing platforms that are always. And then, if we don't. We don't require them to be. used because they're all these different options, then. Will they be enough uptake to. Keep. Keep the public platforms. open and. Relevant. So it's not an easy issue. well. Bad. Anyway, thanks for your concern. didn't sleep last night. At the coffee's not strong enough today i'm not sure. My apologies. So let's talk about the project proposal on the project. project is. So originally in the class some years ago. 2010 or so and I started. There was an essay. group project. combination of them. So you can, if you're interested in doing a research paper. You can do that. But you can also do a book review. You can contribute something to Wikipedia. Creating promotes online content. Like a video blog or a podcast. You can picture yourself as a competing professional. and So I had something particular in mind there. In the sense of finding pictures of. People who would inspire you to as a competing professional. and talking about. The connection, you have with that person or persons. So you can also discuss your contributions to an open source project. Where you could write some code to test, an idea. So the question of small groups. So let's say. Since we have a large class. five people in the group. So you don't have to have five, but you can have up to five. So I can give you some examples. One from a couple years ago as weapons of mass destruction. And they don't have this math myth. So what would be the topic to discuss well the idea would be. to explore something that's of interest to you. relate to the class name so it's. Something that's connected. To the. Knowledge units were discussing. give you. Okay, so. Yes, you can be less than five in the group. Yes, I did say that I thought thanks. for that. Okay. The idea is. To give you a range of choices to. deeply consider some. Some topic related to class. and I didn't I don't want to close. The door and your creativity. So you're writing blog to blog posts so. I see I figure. That, if you and. you've got some writing in, and if you want to do more, reading, you can. In some different ways. In the proposal. You just outline what you're going to. Work on. You give a plan. Put in here. So one mark, so the topic. OK, so the way. Instead of. doing the group thing ahead of time. Well, you know the group. So stick with my first thing instead of doing the group's ahead of time. If you have. Your you make up a group for the project and you. clearly indicate the group members. On your submission, so you only need to submit one copy. Then we'll make up the groups based on. The submissions. That make sense. Okay, so. Take a look at that resource and all are given it. will make an addition to the. To the assignment description in terms of a sample. For your proposal okay. So I don't have one. And two the link to at the moment, but all create one. And we can talk about it. On Thursday, if needed. Okay. Okay anything else. That, I may have neglected or you have questions about. Today, so. 230 to 330. So. I investigated my issues with zoom and office. Do you know where to find the schedule. So let me. Go to. My office hours link. That can you see where i'm pointing at. i'm not there all the time, so here's my schedule. So today's Tuesday. And then I have an officer is gone hits the button. Yes, the proposal is one or two pages. Okay, and this should also link you to the meeting. I click on the link here. i'm not gonna leave the class. Back to. The knowledge units. yeah I thanks Nicholas that's what I was gonna say the knowledge units or the discussions. Why stop at font size 3070 or 100 and. Some. So that would not be the. spirit of one to two pages, so one to two pages and 12 point. Now, with. crazy timelines facing or. or very quiet and narrow margins and small tiny face but. You could do a. Little say single space. And default margins whatever editor using. say the word limit, so I don't know. yeah. I said pages so. You know when. So the reason i'm talking about the. size of the. Or the lines facing in the tightness of the margins and. So on is because when you give a. Page limit. And people want to write as much as they can they. Can they. can fill in the details as much as possible, so every nook and cranny. So i'm not. i'm not trying to. i'm not going to entertain this discussion anymore, since it's 1246 so i'm going to say goodbye for today. And we'll we'll talk about similar things. and we'll go through the. Is a video about self judgment. That I didn't get to publish before class today so i'll do that. afternoon and see you on Thursday. Take care everyone stay well.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.

    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yup, I heard, now Facebook just banned almost everything else including weather XD
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Microsoft already proposed to replace them
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I hope they do better, MSN is not very good
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Does anyone know how Canada is following up?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;on what?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;I heard they were looking at doing something along the lines of Australia
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Canada could be next to propose a bill just like Australia
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Has their been attendance please?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;There hasn’t been yet
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;just when thinks got Interesting 👌
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;things*
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;hehehe
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;we were discussing about what is the hardest CS subject...
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Good, pull news off Facebook. Unmoderated platforms like that are dicey to have unvetted news sources
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;And a little about WhatsApp new policies
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Lol^^
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;What were whatsapps new ones? I heard they made new one but didnt botherto look as I dont use it
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;We discussed whether money should be involved in news altogether basically
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;All users have to share date with facebook
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;data
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;HAHAHA
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;switch back to BBM
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Facebook took down the news regarding covid lockdowns and any related information as well, and I think that makes it in to be in the wrong in these times
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;I said learning and writing assembly language
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Oh man I loved assembly
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;CS 215: particularly the k maps
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;so tedious...
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Assembly just made sense to me? Am I okay?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;I liked assembly hehehe
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;cs 100
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;also tedious with all the registers...
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I loved assembly
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Wait K maps were CS 215? I thought it was 201...
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I liked assembly as well! I found CS 340 to be the toughest
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;cs340 I agree
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;I don't like assembly at all
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;what do you use kmaps for in 340?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Anything with logic diagrams is troubling
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;we can build robots with k maps so I hear
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I gotta agree CS 110 was the hardest, can't argue
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Wasn't the backlash to the government, and they agreed to amend the law?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;cs 310
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;No, we don’t use k-maps in 340 haah
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;kmaps were in 201
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;lol panth
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I was gonna take 340 next, but now I guess I need to rethink lol
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;wow I did not know their was so many assembly lovers. I truly envy you guys hahahah
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;cs 310. The old final were 70 percent worth of the final grade
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;301 has more about assembly
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Its like annoying but it was like basic coding with an etra step
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;CS is very easy
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;🙄
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;I always thought coding needed an extra step ahahahah
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;^^^nice
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;hahahaha
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;professor, you don't seem okay. is everything alright?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I just finished my all engl courses last sem and was so relived that I don't have to write any more essays and here I am writing blogs
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Dr. Hepting, if we have time towards the end class, would you be able to give us some direction on the Project Proposal?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;End of*
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;^^ that's true
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;need some information regarding final proposal
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;How many people in a small group？
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have any book recommendations?
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;what would be the topic to discuss?
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;it should be discussion from class
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;??
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Do we have to be 5 or could we be less than 5 in a group ?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;He said you can be less than five. Up to 5.
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Ohh ok
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;What do we include in the project proposal itself?
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;Is there any outline or sample how to write a proposal
