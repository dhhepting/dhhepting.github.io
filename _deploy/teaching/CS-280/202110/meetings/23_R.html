      I think Oracle should be credited for the API code. Yes, Google brought their API from Sun. But Sun is not there anymore so they shouldn’t have to pay for the license of the API to Oracle since they already brought it. When Oracle purchased Sun, they already paid for the entire company. That means that the transfer of license too. So why would Google need to pay again for the same API?
    </li><li>
      In our 23rdmeeting we discussed more about ethics for computer science professionals andabout how the final exam will go. We first discussed briefly about Associationfor Computing Machinery’s Ethics number 2.9: A computer system must be designedfor safety and usability. This led to a case study of a legal battle betweenGoogle and Oracle. Oracle claims that Google plagiarized Oracle’s unique applicationprogramming interface (API) Java code for their phone operating system called Android.Coding in Java and obtaining certain prebuilt code is open to everyone online (opensource) but Oracle claims Google disregarded the possible copyright on the companymaterial.
    </li><li>
      The main thing wediscussed today was a court case between Google and Oracle. What Ilearned from this is how difficult the ethics of computer science canbe: If you don't have enough technical knowledge in a specific area,it can be very difficult to make an ethical decision about who was inthe right or wrong in a related situation.&nbsp; This could bepartially why the ethics of computer science are lagging behind interms of laws and regulations.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we discussed about the the google vs oracle matter and we their were many different opinion on those. I personally think that sometimes companies use code of developers without the developers knowing which arises such kind of matters. In addition, we also discussed about the format of final exam.
    </li><li>
      This meeting was quite interesting. We discussed about the exams and its format.&nbsp; We also discussed how usage of codes from other developers arise the matter of conflict between companies. Great example is goggle which used code from oracle without their consent but google said that they asked and paid sun to get that algorithm.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      We continued our discussion on AMC code of ethics in this class, specifically the discussion about the principle 1.5 relating to intellectual property rights. We discussed in the context of recent court ruling in Google V. Oracle case in favour of Google. A lot of people were of the opinion that Google's use of Java API was more or less fair use as Java API has traditionally been open source and there are millions of lines of Java code available online. Moreover, Google created a open source OS (Android) using Linux (with GNU license) and used Java in that process,...
    </li><li>
      In a MIT article concerning the expanding ethics of computer science there was an interesting perspective posed - as the possibilities and implications of technology continues to grow, the ethical responsibilities, morals, and laws surrounding the possible challenges new to grow with it. I noted on the ACM Code of Ethics site that the most recent update was made in 2018 following the last update in 1992. It seems that the possibilities for new technology in the recent years is growing exponentially, so would it be necessary for the Code of Ethics to be reviewed more frequently than once every...
    </li><li>
      One thing I would like to learn more about is who is making the rulings (like Oracle vs Google ruling). One thing I fear with computer science legal rulings is that those who are making decisions may not be qualified to do so. The rulings made today may forever impact the landscape of the future of computer science. We should not let those who are uninformed/uneducated in computer science make decisions upon things they don't understand. If we do, we risk the future of computer science in layman's hands, and that is very risky/dangerous.
    </li><li>
      We discussed the final exam today which was nice, good to know ahead of time what to expect and so far I've enjoyed researching and writing the blog posts so I hope it goes well.&nbsp;The discussion today was good as well but I think cases between major corporations are always extra messy. I believe Dayne Blair had mentioned she wondered what would happen between two smaller developers which I definitely agree with. I think code does need credit, but I also know the importance of sharing tools to benefit everyone. It can be a hard line, just have to not...
    </li><li>
      Hello just wanted to ask if you can update a section which states information of the final exam in brief that would be great. I know you explained a bit in lecture but still if you can do that will be very helpful. Thank you so much!
    </li><li>
      The Google vs Oracle case makes me realize how much you need tounderstand about technology to even understand the basics of thecase. The case is quite complicated and neither side is entirely inthe right or wrong. On one hand the developers who created the APIsused by Google should receive credit and compensation but on theother hand, Oracle as an entity isn’t really responsible forcreating these APIs considering they were developed by Sun prior tobeing purchased by Oracle.
    </li><li>
      I&nbsp; think people should be paid in some form or the other when their code gets used in another code. A lot of work is done while creating a code so it should not be used without some reference or payment to the original creeator.
    </li><li>
      Well for the topic that we thought of is quite an interesting one we mostly focused on google vs Oracle. The thing about this thing is that honestly we do need to be careful with it yes google did use fair use code but they should still credit where the code came from. Like if that’s not happening then oracle should win the court case they are not being credited with that system. Honestly if it is free that gives no excuses for not citing the source like if you dont then you should.
    </li><li>
      In the class, we talked about scandals committed by the tech companies in one of which was the lawsuit between Google and Oracle. Oracle was the company that owns the programming language Java, and it accused Google of using their code to build the earlier stage of the android operating system. This lawsuit has been going on for decades. Google said that the code is the part of the API that constituted fair use and on the other hand the company oracle claims that it was under copyright to use the bits of code in their API. The decision can...
    </li><li>
      Computer ethics are very important. This code is intended to encourage and guide the ethical conduct of all computer professionals, whether current practitioners, students or anyone concerned. This regulation covers a wide range of content, in a word, the hope is to promote a healthy computer environment, for the user to use escort.
    </li><li>
      The argument of being able to use other peoples code for creativity is pretty tough line. We seemed to all agree on compensation if you used someone else's stuff is needed. The problem I find is who decides whats fair? If I make something and someone else uses it and I think I deserve more compensation then they are giving me and they think that they have paid enough who gets to decide who is right?
    </li><li>
      The way I see it, an appropriate acknowledgment of authorship of part of a program is acknowledgement and credit to the author in the documentation of the program. If a license was purchased to produce the code in question, then financial compensation was already provided to create/use the code.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed about the multibillion-dollar case between Google and Oracle. The supreme court gave its decision in favor of Google and I think that was right because Google had used the code that was not under any Copywrite. Later we were also asked to get opinions from each other about the same in the breakout rooms.
    </li><li>
      Overall for this meeting I had a lot of trouble wrapping my head around the context involved in our discussion of Google vs. Oracle. I'm not sure what API code is and in order to really understand how severe the theft was I feel like I need to know that, especially the use of the code that was lifted from Oracle. In general, copyright disputes make my head spin and so it's difficult for me to even understand the line between fair use and copyright infringement. 
    </li><li>
      The last meeting discussion was about&nbsp; the older topic that is code of ethics. we looked at some major points like respect privacy and&nbsp; respect the work required to produce new ideas, computing artifacts and so on. in addition,&nbsp; the breakout room topic was also on above discussion; ACM code of&nbsp; ethics 1.5 and google v. oracle. Though, this class's breakout room was quite interesting to participate as we discussed about privacy breach in different ways, now a days and how to value those who expend the effort to create new ideas and inventions. i think govt. should participate actively...
    </li><li>
      The last class conversation was about&nbsp; code of ethics . we saw some significant focuses like the point 1.5 respect&nbsp; the work needed to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works and computing artifacts.&nbsp; The breakout room point was&nbsp; on above conversation; ACM code of morals 1.5 and google v. oracle. However, this present class' breakout room was very fascinating to take an interest as we examined about breach of codes in an unexpected way, and how to esteem the individuals who consume the push to make groundbreaking thoughts and innovations.&nbsp; what i think is that inventors should pay for their...
    </li><li>
      Whileit is very important for people to be credited for their work and paid for thetime and effort they had put into something, so much of the internet andeveryday software we uses relies on API’s from other companies, that if thiscase was to go the other way, would set a very dangerous president for futurelawsuits. This case was especially interesting, as at least to my knowledge,google had re-implemented the code of said API’s, but kept the package namesthe same so developers don’t have to re-implement their java code. While somecode was kept the same to ensure functionality remains. This is...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about final exam format. Also discussed little bit about the code of ethics. We discussed about code of ethic rules and also talked about google vs oracle in the breakout room.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      The dispute revolves around the use of portions of the APIs for the Java programming language, owned by Oracle, in early versions of the Android operating system by Google. "Google has acknowledged the use of APIs ..." It sounds like a win for Oracle. Oracle owns Java, Google admits it used 11,500 lines of Java code - Google was supposed to get a license from Java to do so. But don't take our word for it too seriously - take Google's words. Email where Google admits to stealing intellectual property to create Android: The lawyers defending Google against the patent...
    </li><li>
      Ethics in every environment can be a very difficult matter to define sometimes. Different people might interpret certain statements that could be listed in some organization's code of ethics. Certain members might also have different views in terms of priorities when it comes to their profession, which could also affect the definition of ethics to some degree.
    </li><li>
      In pastmeeting we talk about the code of ethics. It was about positive term ondefining behavior norm in computer professions. We also spoke a bit about thefinal exam. Professor will provide more information in next class about it.Then we had a breakout room about google vs oracle and ACM code of ethics 1.5 (Respectthe work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, andcomputing artifacts). So, it was basically related to google controversy.&nbsp; If you use someone work then you should givethe credits to them or take their permission before use their work. Especiallyif you are using someone’s’ work to...
    </li><li>
      &nbsp;In the last lecture, we discuss the pattern for the final exam. and also discuss the code of ethics. so, the purpose of the ACM code of ethics is known that ACM reinforces the processing calling's aggregate voice through solid initiative, advancement of the best expectations, and acknowledgment of specialized greatness. ACM upholds the expert development of its individuals by giving freedoms to long-lasting learning, vocation advancement, and expert systems administration.
    </li><li>
      We learnedmany things in this meeting, I was self-taught about the word copyright. Thisword seems to be simple to see but difficult to understand. The Copyright issomething that reveals that one cannot break any privilege and copy or dosomething congruent that matches with other product or any application or device.So, in short one cannot copy others’ work and claim that to be theirs. Since, I learnedmany disputes, likely between Samsung and Apple Inc. The Apple Inc, claimed about how Samsungcopied their iPhone prototype. Since, in the end Samsung were proved guilty. 
    </li><li>
      At the last meeting, we've talked about our final exam questions and topics, Also, some extended information on computing ethics, Dr. Hepting has shown us the website of the ACM code of ethics, and he emphasizes some really important codes such as 2.8&nbsp;Access computing and communication resources when we access the computing and communications, we should it only meets the public goods, I think that's very correct since the computing professionals always serve the public. and we have a separate group to discuss this topic. each of the members offered good ideas about the public goods service methodologies. Overall, this...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discused about how final exam is going to happen.In the break out room we discussed about the ACM code of ethics on google vs Oracle case. In this case I think that Google was ethically right for using this API's as they were publically available. In my opinion Google had not harmed any ACM code of ethics.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      Reflecting on the Google v. Oracle ruling it is rather hard to digest. While it is good that Google ultimately had the ruling in their favor, I do not feel that this is a definitive win for computer professionals as ultimately this was a squabble between two large corporations. While copyright and protections on work is important in the long term it seems to be more of a hinderance than beneficial, especially to computer science. In my opinion computer science should be collaborative and open-source. If someone has already devised some algorithm to do x, why waste the time trying...
    </li><li>
      The topic focused on google vs Oracle. Google need to credit their code sources.&nbsp;if that's not occurring after that oracle must win the lawsuit they are not being attributed with that said system. Truthfully if it is cost-free that provides no excuses for not citing the resource like if you don't then you should

      In the past meeting, we discussed about the code of ethicsin which we had a discussion about google getting a law suite from oracle forusing their code and not giving them a credit. We also had a breakout room inwhich we further discussed about google vs oracle. We also discussed a bitabout the final exam but professor will provide more details in next class. &nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In last class we discussed &nbsp;the previous class topic about code ethics. Breakout room discussions on respect privacy and respecting the work, ACM code of ethics 1.5 and google v.Different ways of privacy breach and to respect the one's who put forward new ideas and do hardwork. Also, this should be the priority of government to balance the give and take between the inventors and tech users
    </li><li>
      The concept about code of ethics ACM was the topic that was more interested to me, it states the responsibility that a person need to consider while working on the computers or any services provided it has contributed to the internet society and their well beings
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we deeply discussed the issue of the ethics and professional code of conduct of the Computer Association. I deeply realized the importance of this criterion.&nbsp;If my future work is computer-related, I will strictly abide by these rules
    </li><li>
      In the last class meeting we had a discussion about the code of ethics which we discussed already before that In this we talked about the respect of privacy, respect of hardworking. Apart from that we also discussed this topic in BRooms. Though this class BRooms was interesting one. As we participated in BRooms and then discussed the same issue in group as about the privacy and all.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      We discussed in meeting that can we use other person software or not, according to me that, their should not any restriction to use any other software, everyone should be able to use, but credit should be given to creator.
    </li><li>
      The US Supreme Court ruled that Google has won the decade-long copyright dispute. Google's use of the code from Oracle to develop the Android operating system is legal and does not infringe copyright. As Google indicated earlier,&nbsp;there is no copyright protection for the basic, non-creative programming code such that the code cannot be rewritten in any other way. The Supreme Court's decision is a boost for tech companies and software developers. While the decision will not change the way of copying code and protecting copyright, it recognizes how it is currently operating, which will be good for innovation in the...
    </li><li>
      I am interested to learn more about why codes of ethics are not followed as seriously as they probably should be in the tech industry, and what we can do to make them more like rules rather than guidelines. In some cases is it a good thing that they&nbsp; are followed more like guidelines than rules?
    </li><li>
      The last lecture, in my view, was crucial because we discussed the format of the final test. I suppose it was something that made us feel more comfortable and relaxed during our tests. Also, I liked the idea of taking the exam at home because it allows us to think and respond rather than only answering questions in a rush. I am pretty confident that it would lead to significant improvements and positive results.
    </li><li>
      With the advancement of society and the development of technology, computer has become an indispensable part of people’s lives, but in the mean time, the code of&nbsp;ethics of how we using computer become what we need to consider&nbsp;and be more careful.
    </li><li>
      April 7th 2021Shrey Shah200377176CS 280&nbsp;On Tuesday, we chatted about the ethics ofsoftware corporations when they make and publish software. Specifically, thetitle fight that occurred between Google and Oracle over Android OS code.Google ended up winning, which was also a win for ethics. This is due to howthe open-source community for Linux is created. Essentially, the operatingsystem for Android is based on the Linux Kernel, (optimized for mobile). Googlebought the license and software publishing rights from Sun Microsystems. WhenOracle took over Sun, they felt Google owed them a share of the massive royaltyfees from Android. &nbsp;
    </li><li>
      From our previous discussion regarding the ACM code of ethics 1.5 and google v. oracle, I think that the reason why oracle did that was because they saw Google making money with what they have made using snippets of code from oracle. If oracle's purpose for having the code to be open to everyone they should not expect any credit. I think giving credit to others is really based on how ethical those individual are. But we should not expect everyone to give credit to work that has been made available for everyone. Otherwise, people who care so much about...

      I don't the break out rooms are helping because no one wants to ever communicate even when I try initiate conversation. And can you tell us if we will be using prototrack for the final exam and discuss it's content!.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we talked a bit about our final exam and we were put into breakout rooms to talk about ACM code of ethics 1.5 and google v.oracle. I would like to learn more about copyrighting and intellectual property when it comes to the use of softwares by different companies.
    </li><li>
      This meeting was very interesting as we talked about the software ethics code in google versus oracle scandal. Software engineers should take care of public interests( for both employers and client).&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was about copyright in the tech industry. With the advancement in technology, plagiarism is a major issue in all fields. Google v. Oracle was an interesting case for discussion. I agree with other students that even if you waive all of your rights to your work, you should be paid if someone is making money off of your work. I'd like to learn more about the legal side of copyright in the tech industry.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 23, we talk about the law addresses the aspirations and practices of computer professionals and expresses their professional conscience.
    </li><li>
      Ethical programming is a must in a society that is ever changing. Companies need to be held accountable for their products and code towards the greater good. If any ethical issues come up there should be investigations and consequences. We can't allow companies to get away with things, or else it sets a precedent for other companies.
    </li><li>
      In the meeting, we learned about the code of ethics that positive nature for defining behavioural norms for professionals and usability designs different systems that are not secured. Sometimes, in computing professions, things need principles to handle understandable errors. If the creator launches new something, then the credit goes to the creator in the form of copyright, but the software is free and open-source in the public domain, then computing professionals should not claim it.In the discussion room, we talked about the ACM code of ethics and Google Vs Oracle?Oracle sued Google, and software patents are more important for some...

      Case study : developing connection with google oracle case and Code of ethics 1.5 ie., Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, Creative works and computer artifacts.Things learned from the case:- acknowledge others work&nbsp;-work with ethics and for society&nbsp;- no stealing and misusing of others data/work
    </li><li>
      The code of ethics of computer science was the topic of conversion for this class. The question I have from this class would be is there any reasonable time where you could break this code? I know in class we talked about how it’s not always followed especially with giving credit for code. What other parts of the code of ethics could you break if things fall into the right place.
    </li><li>
      I believe google should pay programmer of oracle if the programmer has sold its copyrights. Because if programmer java didnt pay for what he built nor google and use it i believe its not fair
    </li><li>
      In the meeting we discussed about the scandal between oracle and google and the code of ethics in the issue. According to our group in breakout room, we discussed that the hard work of the programmer of oracle and they have the right to get what they deserve. So the decision on favour of google might discourage programmers to work hard.
    </li><li>
      Today in class professors gave a brief explanation &nbsp;about the final exam and then we talked in detail about the code of ethics. All students were very much involved in this discussion.
    </li><li>
      In our last class we discussed code of ethics again a bit. Specially ACM code of ethics and its updates. We also talked about the final exam, the monopoly of google, the strain between google and their unothorized use of software. In the breakout room we talked about ACM ethics 1.5, that mostly deals with plagiarism
    </li><li>
      Google used oracles database and made money. Google got the idea of making money through that but initially it was of no use but when google made money then oracle claimed . Supreme Court favoured google and I think that correct as there were not any copyrights . Google should have given some credits in this case though .
    </li><li>
      I really enjoyed the discussion about oracle vs Google and the code of ethics discussion we had in our breakout rooms. Thanks, Dr for the opportunity to share my ideas with my classmates.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we learned more about the Oracle and Google case and I was mostly surprised to learned how difficult and time consuming it is to solve a dispute if it is not solved quickly and off the court room. This&nbsp; case tell us that as a programmer we should try to be professional and avoid from copying others work but in the same time I think it is important that if an issue arise we should try our best to solve it between ourselves because once it hit the court room it could take decades before we get...
    </li><li>
      I am not well versed in writing code yet, but after readingthe article of the case between Google and Oracle, I feel I lean more towards the idea of not being able to copyright code. We all draw inspiration from each other and shouldadapt a more open-source concept to inspire and fuel innovation.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we discussed about principle 1.5 of the ACM Code of Ethics which states that the creators of ideas and innovations need to be credited properly in order to protect the intellectual property and protecting the author's original work. I agree with the point the credit should be given where credit is due, however there should be no limitations to the use of an author's work to bring about improvements and better implementations. This requires a better and stricter law regarding intellectual proprietorship and what constitutes as an ethical use of another author's work.
    </li><li>
      In the last class i enjoyed the discussions had in the breakout rooms and one thing that stood out to me was talking about how the code used in another software and then mixed with some other code and changed a bit could maybe be claimed as something different. Personally I think that it can be claimed as something different however, credit should be given to the code referenced.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we continued the discussion on same topics ‘Code of Ethics’. We further discussed about the case between Google vs Oracle. We discussed how they pursued the case in court and the outcome of case. In the breakout rooms, we further discussed about the privacy and how some of the companies breach their customer’s privacy which goes against the code of privacy .
    </li><li>
      In the class, we talked about scandals by tech companies. We have seen a lot about privacy in our past classes, but there are many scandals where people have trusted the company to make revolutionary technology but didn’t promise to fulfill it. One of those was Theranos. It was a 9 million dollar scam by Elizabeth Holmes. She wanted to make something that would detect the blood sample and make antibiotics, but she didn’t fulfill her promise. It is our duty as engineers to make people trust in technology that they cant understand and not scam them or else people...
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we discussed the scandals and scams by tech companies. We learned about many things on privacy in our regular class&nbsp;but there are many scandals done by many companies in the IT world where people have trusted the companies with everything but the companies failed tokeep that trust.One of the scandals is by John Carreyrous bad blood in Silicon Valley, he builds up the whole company and also partnerships with other companies&nbsp;on the promises of the technology which does not exist. He not only fooled the companies but also their employees and the people as the users...
    </li><li>
      We faced a issue logging in UR courses and then we discussed about code ethics on CIPS, even discussed on the format for our final exam and how long it has to be and date should be as per syllabus or a day prior.
    </li><li>
      In the class, we talked about some scandals that are committed by the tech giants. Sometimes the CEO of these tech giants promises great technology with the people’s money and they fail to deliver it. The same was for CEO&nbsp; Adam Neumann. He hyped up the company WeWork with the ideas to make revolutionary space and even wegrow as a school to change the schooling system and the company was valued at 9 billion dollars. It was the second most valued startup after uber on paper. They couldn’t live up to peoples’s promises and they wasted people’s money.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      The most important things we disscussed in the class was about oracle vs google that is the lawsuit about the nature of the computer code and its copyright.
    </li><li>
      In my opinion, the last lecture was crucial because we explored the structure of the final exam. It was probably something that made us feel more relaxed. In addition, taking the exam at home appealed to me because it helps to think and worry less.&nbsp;Personally, I believe the take-home exam would yield positive results.
    </li><li>
      The case of google being a monopoly is a wild thing, this also relates to facebook whose been buying their competition off at every turn, like Instagram. The one very noticeable change that i saw when facebook got hold of Instagram was the amount of ads exponentially increased thus the information they got from their users also increased. I personally enjoy using google and I don't think its case is similar to facebook because you can still use bing and yahoo search but google just seems so much more user friendly.
    </li><li>
      Last class, we continued to discuss Code of Ethics. Regarding this topic, theprofessor showed us the knowledge points that we need to understand, whichwe need to master as a student of CS major. I also discussed the time and formof the final exam, and spent about one day to complete the correspondingquestions and publish an essay. I think we'll talk more about that in the nextlecture.Name: Yiming Zhang StuID: 200404814
    </li><li>
      In the last zoom meeting discussed the last topic of last to last zoom meeting which was the code of ethics. Also, professor make the breakout rooms for us. the topic of the breakout room was about the ACM code of ethics. it was really interesting discussion in the breakout room about it. Basically, we discussed about the privacy breaches in the sperate ways. in this field.
    </li><li>
      In the past lecture, the importance of code of ethics and the way it is implement and used to protect the user was discussed. It was a great thing to learn about as the user must know their rights and their data must not be misused by any company for their personal benefit. To ensure this, ACM and IEEE looks for any kind to unethical work to avoid such condition. User's privacy matters and should be protected at any cost.
    </li><li>
      In last we talked about code of ethics, specifically to the inclination towards 1.5. It dictates about the copyright infringement. To thoroughly understand the topic, professor gave us the reference of google VS oracle case. The case was about google stealing the code from the JAVA APIs of oracle. Eventually, after 10 years the case, Google won the case with the historical win.
    </li><li>
      The past meeting was about the ethics and respecting the privacy of the user. The way in which ACM and IEEE governs the computing industry makes sure that the user are safe and protected from the frauds that are currently present in the internet. The ideas of the coders while writing the codes matters to a great extend and this can help us to build a secure place for the user.
    </li><li>
      In the meeting we discussed about the ehtics that a computer professional should follow. The code of ethics and how to protect the privacy of the user. In addition we talked about the ACM code of ethics. It was good to have a more elaborative&nbsp; discussion on this topic again as we have alredy talked about it in the earlier blogs and classes.
    </li><li>
      The last meet as concentrated with the Code of Ethics. the "ACM" approach od dealing with the computer professionals and their responsibility towards the society. There was also feedback on the the empathy maps and different view points towards approaching the problem.
    </li><li>
      	I believe the Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals. The Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur. A code of ethics is important because it clearly lays out the rules for behavior and provides the groundwork for a preemptive warning.
    </li><li>
      Last time, we discussed the code of ethics, specifically the proclivity for 1.5. It specifies what constitutes a copyright infringement. Professor provided us with a case study of Google vs. Oracle to help us better understand the subject. The case involved Google stealing code from Oracle's JAVA APIs and we also discussed about pattern of our final-exam.
    </li><li>
      I was actually not sure on how the final exam will be like if it going to be a real time time exam or a take home. So I was clarified in this meeting that it going to be a take home exam.Thank you prof for the clarification.I was having challenges with my network so I couldn’t follow up with the class before my network got interrupted.
    </li><li>
      ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is beneficial for our society, but I think some people may not fully adhere to these guidelines. For example, In 1.6 Respect privacy, some computer-related personnel may be under the company's pressure to collect their privacy, such as Facebook has such a thing. Or, some computer-related personnel sell the original company's program code because of huge profits. But I think even if not everyone can live up to these principles, everyone should learn and understand them，so some things that violate the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct will reduce the situation's occurrence....
