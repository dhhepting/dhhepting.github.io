<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. how's everyone doing today. that's pretty good I think can be considering. You know, turn the stage.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;We cannot complain about the water.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. I was worried when I was raining on. Monday night and then snowed and I thought that might be a lot of slippery ice underneath but. Because I fall under those conditions before. But it was. It was nice to watch. Nice to walk pardon me. and actually sell it to my neighbors. And conversation with them. Socially distance of course because you're wearing masks especially. Anyway, you know it's a nice. Nice interlude I guess. let's go right to attendance. Let me share my screen. Here we go. This privacy. To work on the navigation. So these are actually a couple of videos. Anyone has had a chance to look at them. The first one is. steam is cathcart. he's in charge of whatsapp. And the second one is. Glenn greenwald who says the New York Times and worked with Edward snowden to. publish stories about surveillance programs in the state. A couple years old, but. Still. Okay, so. We come to yesterday with our discussion about. rights and responsibilities and privacy. Any thoughts about that, like to. comments or. Even questions. Start us off today. Okay well what's the point right if it's not respected. can't always be. In terms of kind of think of the things in terms of rights. and responsibilities as well. So there's interesting. The second part of the comment is. That privacy rights violated simply due to lack of knowledge. So. How many. How many people are. confident in their privacy settings a set up on different platforms. Read the terms of service and understand the law. and How many people are willing to not use a platform if the terms of service aren't. aren't supportive of you have your own privacy.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I do feel like there is something coercive about the way in terms of service or use just in the sense that I think most companies know that. No one or most people are not going to take the time to read every word of these documents, and so they can essentially put whatever demands on your privacy, they want. We use so many digital services now and we have to agree to so many terms of service that clicking yes, except just becomes second nature and we signed a lot of way in that process, but what choice, do we have we want to use these services now.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;mm hmm.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Exactly so between a rock and a hard place, so to speak. And you might think that. there's so many. People using these services like there's something like billions of messages sent per day on whatsapp. yeah so there's so much traffic going on who is going to be interested in me. So this is your losses taught chatting here both things, so why don't we start with a breakout room about. let's see. out and. have some agency or your privacy online. Is that a general enough topic yet specific enough. Right now. Okay, here we go now paste the question as a message to the groups as well to the bigger rooms. So See you in 10 minutes. From. The breakout rooms. We missed her last a few people, but that because that's. What happens raises operation and oh. Sorry, that was. A humor. anyway. Any ideas come up that you want to share. This is a good discussion.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I know my group there we were chatting a little bit and we got on to how hopeless it feels right because these companies are so massive and it's We just have to rely on the government to hopefully do something and that's it's it's hard to handle sometimes.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;In our group he thought that we don't really have a choice, right now, like you, can't really be private.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;We had kind of a quieter more sedate discussion in our group, but it came up a bit we talked about. The fact that there's applications out there that are explicitly designed to harvest our data and disregard our privacy and it's challenging to maintain privacy in the face of things like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. platforms to. To do things to protect our privacy, not in their self interest. So please don't do that, so that I can. Messages everybody. Okay. there's an interesting comment about what is somebody with agency look like on the Internet. The person could be using tools that are available Internet to create their own. profile online. So that is. reputable sources or authoritative source of information about the person. online. So that, of course, implies that people want to be online. You don't want to be online. And it's a bit more difficult, so in the year in the European Union, they have. The right to be forgotten as far as the gdpr. General data and privacy regulations that came into effect. Almost three years ago. To. give up some privacy is some control over your information. For convenience or. So there's a poem written after the Second World War. I believe, is a first, they came for the. Here, let me. Let me look it up. description. yeah. So I mean. We can say it depends. And we can say it a little bit more. easily when we're not directly affected, but if we. If we don't. Work to. send the importance of privacy. For others. Then, maybe. It will be so eroded by the time. We we hope to apply, then that. Our own privacy is threatened. Maybe. yeah okay so it's really a brilliant business model. it's a very. it's not it's not a very pleasant one. Because. Software is designed to prey on. Even weaknesses. and And, especially when it's not clear. So and. Anyone familiar with the terminator series of movies. yeah there's so many of them don't remember, which is which. So Facebook and these other platforms are. Are not marketed as having. A terminator, on the other side of the screen, are they. mean so we talked about metaphors. yeah. yeah. metaphors so if we think of. representation of what the processing power of. Facebook and other platforms have going. Have going for them. And it's not to support people. To get connected to family and friends or to learn about something. that's interesting to them. But it's. What we want, because they're trying to monetize every bit of interaction. So if we were. Take the. Mark Zuckerberg mark Zuckerberg face off the. business model and replace it with. something a little bit more scary. I would be improving the. Transparency around. Around the around the interface and. picture with mark Zuckerberg screen. mime attacking from the ocean, as some. references to it. privacy as relates to our use of technology in this class. Are some issues here. Get identified. In. The chat. And in the transcript. audio transcript. i'm. i'm trying to remove names from those places. urination those places. There are still more concerns what are other issues. Ownership of. This class. Sure, so I think. I think the idea. Is that it's your choice, so this is a bit of the agency issue. You can decide what we want to have. You on a claim that this was caught if you're a student s 13 and this discussion. there's a way to. for you to reclaim that identity for yourself. If you want to do that. If I can. give you that choice to. To make a claim. And having it. forced upon you that. You know the tennis student s 13 and today's. transcripts.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Where you. I kind of want to hear your thoughts on. Pro track since you're you're talking about the security and all this data stuff. What do you, what are your thoughts on that whole matter because it's kind of relates, I feel.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so I mean one one of the issues, is where the data is being stored. And so, for the pro track. The data is stored in Canada so it's not. it's not a cross border enterprise. So. Because this data is stored in the states, for example, then it's subject to other things like Patriot Act and. But in terms of. The features in pro track. track pardon me. there's some flexibility in terms of what kinds of things get logged and i've heard horror stories about. People failing exams or people who are coming so stressed out because. They are flagged as cheating when they needed to go. Have a bathroom break and. So on so. say the student is to. fill in the blank to. make any judgments about that, but making association between crying you're showing emotions. Maybe that's like. kind of a recapture. kind of test. So. I think the idea is with project track is to. Do do its best to ensure some conditions. A level playing field for the exams. So. I could see that. You may not want to have any other devices connected Internet browsing cable devices connected to the network. yeah you can go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Well, my thing with, that is if you're wanting no other devices in the room, you should you should need their full room scan not just this wasn't an exam that required a full room scan so. Since it wasn't required to full rooms, can you know, theoretically, I could have my laptop and I could have my other computer behind it, and I could be scroll on my computer behind it right. So I don't see why it needs to know what every single device is connected to my network when they're not necessarily in that same room so it's going into your network now where else is it going to check that you're not have other things on like. I think there's better ways, it could do it, that would be more privacy protected as all.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so maybe talk to your smart fridge and find out whether you have some performing enhancing smoothies in the fridge that are. Going on a limb here but. wired up the Internet connected fridges. Could report to your health insurance company or. You know whether you're. In following the doctor's advice and whether you deserve a good premium on your life insurance and so on. So I mean there's certainly. Lots of issues, the issues Ariel enough. and related one I don't want anyone sees these all state ads on. Anyone who watches TV, I still watch TV with ads. broadcast ads. And it says. Show she was a safe driving APP or something like that. And the APP is connected. runs on their phone and. They take a listen when they're driving. And I think it's not very far away, to say that they would monitor. It was connect with a car and. see that you're following the speed limit and so on. So. i'm. More concerned. scanning the network. It should be. transparent about life scanning the network. Anything that there'd be some kind of. permissions involved. So if I want to use. well. I guess is a nod to. My own agency, they absolutely COP and say such and such would like to use your camera or your microphone is that Okay, yes or no. He would like access to your contacts, yes or no, and so forth. So you think. Maybe your computer. would be on your side and say. This proctor track application wants to. scan your network. yeah go ahead Keegan.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I don't recall proctor track ever asked me if you wanted to scan my network it asked for hardware of your computer access to your camera and microphone but I don't remember it ever asking me if it could pro my network. Which is why it was concerning to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So, how did you find out about it.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;um well, I had a fire stick plugged in, and it was on on like a different level of like my house like somebody else was using it, and it was like Oh, you have to turn this device off to continue. A fire stick is just like a streaming things you like plug it into an hdmi port and you can stream like netflix and stuff so basically turn your TV like into a smart TV. And for anybody that doesn't know what it is. So, like.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so i'm i'm just wondering like why it doesn't why there's in the permission for that.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah That was my problem with it like I brought it up with my teacher time was actually David gearhart so like he investigated for me said it was Okay, but I don't know I still wasn't a fan of. The probing all your network when I don't think it's useful for what they're trying to do when they have other things that I think would be more effective.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. So anyway, it could be clear we're not going to use proctor track in this class. I just wanted you to. The empathy map assignment is about. going through the process and. Thinking about. pick up on how that's presented and. If there are opportunities for improving the presentation. Kagan.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I just didn't have any.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Other Keegan. zoom I see that the rectangle is shifted to the other Keegan. I wonder if you have that happened many, many classes. I remember one year in public school, there were five girls in my class, including me. names were installed, the same way, but. That was an interesting year I remember. Anyway, so you're welcome. I know not to rely on the rectangle but, if anyone wants to make a comment just put your. emoji hand up and. we'll go from there. So. yeah so there's a question about your courses and as a question about proctor track. And how to set a practice track so that appropriately. invasive. or records the things. that are necessary for. individualization. But not anything more than that. i'm trying to fall on in the chat here. So your courses is too difficult for people, then what. So how many people are. comfortable with your courses. who's not comfortable with your courses. So I think it's a discussion about. platform. And there are so many platforms out there, some of them are free, students, some are free to the university, some are. not free. I mean, some are proprietary or some are paid. To the university. involve some involvement big. purchase for the university some. involve purchases for students. And I think at some point there's. needs to be agreement on. The platform, and so I think you are courses as a version of moodle, which is an open source project. which has gone through a lot. And it gets a little better all the time. Too much clicking for me. set things up. So I think the issue is proctor track in the. data breach last year was. resolved. and I don't think that. invalidated selection. Anyway, so some some people some classes make. Use of different platforms i've heard people use school ology and. different things like that. Lots of issues. I see the scrolling by quite quickly now. But in terms of. Can we maybe need to have freedom from choice about the different platforms like somebody will say, well, we should use top ad. Creative so creative. or. or. School G or. etc, etc. So. can agree on your courses and agreed on. proctor track when required. So I think there's lots of interesting. ideas. To. Keep the exam. exams, like the final the take home exam that will have. In. In this class and have it. be challenging and stressful. and difficult to. phone in and as well not fun in. So I think there's ways to have it be fair valuation be fair. and reasonably cheap proof. and Now require individualization. Any questions. In terms of Canadian privacy law. grace from the University of Ottawa is. A restricted authority. and i'm just gonna. post. A blog post about. His. Analysis of. Canadian privacy law see 11 I think it is. And it's not it's not yet law. A bill. to revamp the privacy law. So there are other related posts and. here's a sample to get you started. The identification of data. So we may want the identify the data records, so that we could make some aggregate comparisons, without compromising the identity of individuals. The problem is it's difficult to de identified data that. Or the data looks de identified. At first glance, can be. We identified fairly easily. And one of the best ways to identify people is real estate. So how many people are, how many people protect their birth date. From. From widespread online access.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I used to protect my birth date but I no longer do that because I find with. recap password recovery if I forget my password I often need to know that, as part of the credentialing process, so now that we all need so many passwords and password managers to track all the dozens of accounts, we have in our lives, I feel like I don't have that freedom anymore.

    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;moring
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;morning
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;morning
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;good morning
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Good Morning!
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Doing okay thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;good morning!
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;found a new company that makes a battery that lasts 28000 years
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;loll
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;does it use carbon fibre?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;that's a long time lol
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;radioactive waste haha
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;ah that makes sense
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I saw them this morning but too late as I have an earlier class
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Not yet.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;No, haven't seen them yet
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;What's the point of having a right if it's not respected? Online I feel like a lot of privacy rights get violated simply due to lack of knowledge
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;true
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;And it can be manipulated with design flaws or norman doors
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I do the best I can
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I do my nest
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Neutral
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;*my lol
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Same, do my best
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I do my best, which is generally just clicking "No" to everything
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;^same lol
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I would say so, between browser selection and limiting location services
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;"Agree or you can't use it" so it isn't really a choice with Terms of Service
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I skim....sometimes...
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Ok I don't read terms of service hahaha, it takes waay too long
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Depends what the platform is.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I will immediately use other platform without question
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I even ignore the sites that forces me to accept cookies
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;nowadays the media will do that for us
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;if the benefits outweigh the cons
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;But like at the end of the day, more end users need to take responsibility for the data that they upload...
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I usually skim over it just to have an idea how secure my data will be, but in the end it all comes down to how badly I need to use that app
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I agree privacy laws and all but like it was you who agreed and uploaded the data..
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;The terms of service that require "your immortal soul" always gets me
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;there's always an option for me so I am not really bothered by the compulsions to accept cookies or terms and conditions or show them my location
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;when you get a car you go through hours with an agent
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Works for me
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;How to have some agency about your privacy online
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room: how to exercise some agency about your online privacy?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;good discussion!
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;Yes!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah :)
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;my question beyond the breakout room: I wanted to know what people think a person with agency on the internet looks like
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;@Dayne My image, to keep it brief would be some very tech savvy person
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Well depends on what the definition of agency is
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly - everyone defines it differently haha
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;@Dayne someone who emulates their operating system on a vm and bounces their ip using a vpn
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;That's a tricky phrase
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;...god people, this is the nth time we direct messaged the prof...
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;So it might be good to clarify what agency means and what that SHOULD look like.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;The fact that your mobile devices are listening to you all the time, and if you speak something around it, you will get ads and recommendation based on that topic.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I f it is two parties being transparent with each other then they kinda have it they just can tell us all the bad things they are doing and all the good
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;we need an universal agency?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;time to put my phone in a faraday cage...
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;lmao
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;maybe it is because social sites are basically free so they ARE taking data to make money?
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;some of those things I don’t even think about anymore
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;But like us end users decide to use it so can we really put the entire blame on the companies?
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;sites that need payment upfront to use do not sell data or privacy
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Are these companies really doing anything wrong? Of course it's an invasion to our privacy, but we're all agreeing to it in the terms of service
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly, I 100% agree with @Reanne
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's ethical
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;time is money and they aren't leaving you enough time to read
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I also agree with that point
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I'd say yes it's wrong. Legality != morality
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Just my opinion though
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;agree David
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Everyone's in a business LOL. Everyone makes money by somehow doing something ethically wrong to other person
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I do blame the companies. If they provide a unique service - like Facebook, whose user base is part of the value of the service - the terms of service can be coercive. If the user doesn't accept them, they can't use the service - so they may agree to things they normally wouldn't.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;When everything we do is highly dependent on the use of internet services, they need to change the legality of it to protect our privacy
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;waste of time to try because I like my life easy so it’s just a little price I pay for it
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;It's definitely not ethically right but I think that's how they're avoiding conflict with the government
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Depends
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with you, Michael.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Unlike you Bilal, I won't give up
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Yes it's totally fair in my opinion
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I like to think so
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;its my privacy so I should decide what I want to do with it
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;It's a bizarre twist on 1984
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;It depends on what service I am giving up my privacy for
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I will bite my foot off of facebook's trap if I need to
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;aah watched that film
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;a good one
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I wonder how gives out our cell numbers to spammers
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;*who
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;job sites most likely
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;i am not any of them
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like what the data is being used for and who will get to view the data needs to be defined.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Like to the user
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;anywhere that you give your phone number and it’s public can also be used against you
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I think firm and fair regulation is the only way to ensure consumer privacy. Companies have incentives to seek data for profit, we can expect that they'll do so as long as it's legal, so the best way to address the issue is to draw clear and firm boundaries around how to respect privacy.
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;never read the poem, watched the movie on pol pot genocide in the same name tho
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Interesting poem, Prof
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Ok let's look at it this way. We all agree that "selling" data is ethically wrong, well then how is retail business ethical where they sell a $3 product for $100? We don't mind that LOL
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;That I agree with
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;because retail only harms our pockets
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;not our souls
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;data is worth more than just currency, true
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;@Panth If someone sells a $3 hammer for $100, that's different from if someone is selling my private information. I value my privacy more than some object, and someone selling it affects me in ways that someone profiting off selling an object doesn't.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I mean people did have a problem with massive mark ups when they bought out all the santitary wipe ans stuff when the pandemic started
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;yes!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Of course!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;true
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Yass
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;loved judgement day
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;agree
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I just lovethe Skynet memes

    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Mark Zuckerberg is a terminator IMO...
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;yeah same clothes everyday, just need to peel that mask off
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;With Starlink coming up, what is to stop some rouge AI to just turn that into Skynet?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I must loosen the face skin with excess sunscreen lest people find out....
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;but I though zucc was a lizard

    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;google "MArk Zuckerberg sunscreen"
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Hahahah that is a good image
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;ill admit, he does work out his glutus maximus...
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;When we get identified, we can be judged with a bias...
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Your efforts to anonymize the transcripts are much appreciated, thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Why? should I not have ownership of the ideas and thoughts that I share in this class?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I think you've put in a lot of effort into making this class an ethical course and I think you've done very well :)
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;no, give em to me!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I had a friend flagged for crying lol
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Ok ill stop
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I have a computer science professor who is very firm on using ProctorTrack in a 400 level class lol
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;that's interesting things to flag for
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Gotta hold those tear back next time ahaha
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Proctor track probes your entire network. It told me I had to shut off certain devices and I dont see why it needs to go that far through my privacy
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I have a question regarding privacy: What term/condition would completely turn you away from using an app?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;That is the one thing software don't have
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Panth, do everything you can to thwart the proctal exa...I mean proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;People will find a way
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;play games, and get played
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;It allows cross website tracking
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;hahahhaa
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;ahahah
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;fuggin, put a laptop right outside your window XD
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I had no clue it looked into your network too, that’s kinda crazy aha
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Prof, TV is still like $60
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Ya I didn’t know that either tbh
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;people are still cheating even in proctored exams idk what the point
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;its expensive, I like the free radio
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;true Raj, I would even say it people are more entitled to cheat
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;But with those things they are usually voluntary. If you want a better insurance rate because you follow the rules of the road go for it
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;cheating is best rebellion to prototrack
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;"If you are not hiding anything, you got nothing to worry about!"
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;already heard lots of student to say that they pre-recorded and uploaded that in proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;oh my my my lmao
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah it lost it at my Chromecast Audio too
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;i still haven't had any proctored exams till now so i dont know much about it
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Well the teacher allows that I have multiple devices hook up with the wifi and it did not do anything
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Lucky you, proctortrack really spikes the cortisol
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;thank you prof
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I've had 1 proctored exam and the prof kept it open book and allowed us anything to search up the answers, so I'm really not sure why he used the software in the first place
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I have proctored exam tomorrow aha fun midterm worth 30%
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;good luck buddy
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;what course bilal?
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Wait so in my room itself, there are 11 devices connected to the network, will that be a problem?
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;yea thx aha, cs 310
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Woops not used to haveing two keegans
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Many of the teachers outside of the filed of CS just really don’t know how it works I feel.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;field*
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;no offence nor judging but many are still not familiar with even ur courses
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;if UR courses is too difficult for people, what will they use then? homing pigeon?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;mail?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;The online transition for some profs would've been pretty large, I could see that. Especially if they aren't in a technical field
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;What are the topics for blog 2?
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;no i am talking about proffs
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;and not the whole ur courses but mainly the quizzes and exams that are given through UR courses
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Its fine
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;me
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;It works fine for me
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I am comfortable with URcourses
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I'm definitely comfortable with it
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I like UR courses makes handing in easy
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;all good
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I am totally down
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;UR courses is fine for me
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I like its dark mode so far
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;me too
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Dark mode is great til you have to use a comment field, and then its dark grey on darker grey
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Ur course's exams are better than TopHat ones
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;its got some issues but better than being flashbanged
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;This semester alone I have to use Wiley plus, vital source and urourses just to monitor what’s up in my courses
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I like UR Courses quite a bit, very easy to navigate, allows for easy communication with professors
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I mean you could also argue that the money spent on proctor track could have been put to better use
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;faster servers
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah! Or even more simple approach like having a pdf document to be downloaded, then scanning in your solutions as a different file.
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Proctortrack was hacked last year, makes no sense to use it
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;If people want to cheat they can still cheat.
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;if you are in a class with more than 100 students, UR courses is definitely going down during exams
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Money is not a problem, our tuition covers the cost no problem hahah
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;true, services like TurnItIn are reasonable!
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Money is always a problem haha
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Why there is Scarcity
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;wiley plus needs member ship as well as vital source needs subscription for the book.
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Instead professors should design exams that are harder to cheat on..
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;or assignments
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I mean a sticky note beats proctor track
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;hahahah thanks for the idea Keegan
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;time limits can be too unreasonable I would say
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Literally hear of people using a sticky note on the monitor yeah lmao
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;So was it a good use of resources ?
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;I had a professor for math class last year and it would be near impossible to cheat on that exam as students could barely finish in allotted time if they had done all the studying
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;ah yes
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;rushed math got us to the moon
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Mandeep was that for 221?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^^^^
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;my engl final was 6 hour long, imagine it being proctored , thankfully it was not
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like I had the same prof
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I hated 221
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Ya I was in that class to keegan
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;116, 221 was similar but I was talking about 116
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;but mine was in person
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah I thought you were in a couple of my classes
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;before covid
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;What prof was it for 221? I am currently taking it and now I'm worried lol
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;do not take Fernando for math 221
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;^
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;before covid, people had a chance to meet in person to study, there is more to learn than just colors on a screen
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I second that Rhythm
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Guys has anyone here taken CS 473 before?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;It was Fernando hahahah
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I'm retaking 221 with Remus and it's 10000% better
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;well I'm bad at math theories and he focuses on that heavily. if you have no issues with theory go for it
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;No, I really liked the conversation today though :)
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Remus is an angel
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Also yes Remus is an angel
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;221 by karen meagher, might be the one
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;REMUS RULES
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;yes I heard that haha
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.michaelgeist.ca/2020/11/privacy-pressure-points-a-closer-look-at-ten-consumer-privacy-protection-act-concerns/
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;you guys can try Juliana if she is teaching, good prof
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;So not even necessarily encryption, but just removing the metadata that relates the data back to a person?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;the bare minimum, just the way the government makes em...
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Always born Jan 1, baby

    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Haha Panth
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Eg when I worked at SaskTel, birthdates were a verification option
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;sometimes it works being born just last year
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I tried but another organization has my birthday just posted online first page when you google my name
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I just always use jan1 1985
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;ah yes but now we know that, David..... *evil laugh*
