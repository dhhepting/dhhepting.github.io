      I asked a question during the meeting: what does someone with agency on the internet look like?Many people viewed them as a specialist - either someone knowledgeable in virtual machines, cookie blocking, security, or a lawyer who can read and understand the TOS. If this is true, then that means that most people on the internet today do not actually have agency.Some people felt that it depended on the definition of agency - and that's true, the OED has like 15 definitions for "agency," which makes it difficult to figure out what that means, and it is difficult to determine...

      Privacy and WhatsAppThe TED Talk on Digital Communication and Privacy, published in June of 2020, sees interviewer Chris Anderson debate with Will Cathcart, Head of WhatsApp at Facebook. Will gives an insightful view on how the end-to-end encryption allows users to communicate matters of importance, especially during times of Covid where members are unable to meet online. End to End encryption is a form of cryptography where the sender scrambles their message using some sort of hashing algorithm (for example SHA-256) and only the receiver knows of the private key to decrypt the data. This encryption applied by Facebook is...

      I would like to understand U of R's reasoning for using proctor track better. With a lot of other universities opting not to have this and to do open book exams instead why did U of R decide to use this program that invades privacy more than necessary. With its clear faults is it worth invading students privacy, even after the servers were hacked? Could these resources that the university spent be better spend somewhere else?
    </li><li>
      I think privacy is very important. It's our private stuff. In today's online environment, because our devices record and store a lot of information, like credit cards, or home addresses. It is very important to protect our privacy because the Internet is full of traps and our privacy will be exposed by the slightest mistake. It's not hard to steal information from our devices, and sometimes a piece of software we download can do it. So I think when using the Internet, we should pay attention to download links, otherwise, our privacy will be threatened.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing, in my opinion, I learned from the past meeting was from the discussion we had regarding online privacy. During discussion, I researched a couple different ways to protect my privacy online. From this information, I think the easiest way to protect yourself online is through software. For example, VPN's can make you less traceable online. There's software out there that will read Terms of Service for you. If you're really into tech, you could try something like onion routing. The only problem is that software can often cost money, so the trade-off is money for privacy....
    </li><li>
      In our 16th meeting we discussed what are online terms of service (TOS). The TOS are used in every online service with very few exceptions, It is a contract between a user and the online business. Since time is considered as money most TOS are made to be as expansive and as unreadable as possible. With time and attention restraints the TOS can force users to immediately use the service and to just accept any privacy concerns that can arise.
    </li><li>
      With our talk about privacy and our personal agency to maintain our privacy, I would like to learn more about the tools we can use to maintain our privacy, such that I will have more agency in the future. I know about the popular tools like VPNs and some more obscure tools like websites that review private policy/TOS for us (such as TOSDR.org) but is that really all we have at our disposal? It appears that the demand for privacy is ever-increasing and thus I would find it probable that there are many tools I have not heard of.
    </li><li>
      Protortrack or get Covid-19? I honestly don’t believe even the data is stored in Canada is even safe. This could mean anything as there could be some Canadian privacy laws that are not updated with the current world. I would say corporation have team of lawyers that can help with them bending around the law.Second, we can talk about privacy for the entire course of the semester. As there are always some kinds of news about privacy breach or laws. I think privacy laws need to be revamped or update every 3 years or so.
    </li><li>
      The way in which privacy matters to a person and affects their life could be understood. The pandemic has led a great number of people to shift their work to online method and this is the reason that the privacy of the user should be protected at any cost. Even if the person say that privacy does not matter, there are times when an individual has some sensitive information that should be protected. So, privacy matters.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we had an early discussion about what privacy rights online and why the organizations need to consider the privacy issues which can arise with the use of their applications.
    </li><li>
      I found the quote "people that say privacy isn't really important – they don't actually believe it" from the 'Why Privacy Matters" TED Talk a significant point to highlight because, at least in my own opinion, I find this an entirely accurate statement. Take VPN's for instance, why are they so popular right now? Is it because their users have something to hide? Or is it protect identities, protect sensitive data? Or because privacy matters...
    </li><li>
      In the video Why privacy matters, I heard that only people doing something wrong have things to hide; I think that is very naive. When your privacy is monitored, whether you are a good person or a bad person may be between others' thoughts. Moreover, Privacy has been increasingly capitalized, and many companies can use your privacy to make money. on the one hand，Our personal information and privacy often are obtained, used, and even exchanged and profited without our knowledge or authorization now. On the other hand, we do not get any benefits or even have to pay the price....
    </li><li>
      Can you please discuss the content of the final exam. I feel like privacy is important because, it gives us the power to choose our thoughts and feelings and who we share them with. Privacy protects our information we do not want shared publicly (such as health or personal finances).
    </li><li>
      In the digital world, the concept "social life" is changing rapidly. To emerge social media, users should publish articles which are generally supported, and those materials should be communicated in public areas. Location-tracking, surveillance systems, facial-recognition innovations, and technologies for recording messages and calls have all advanced in sophistication. Will Cathcart, on the other hand, believes that "to our enhanced reliance on online communication methods during the COVID-19 pandemic, our basic right to privacy is much more essential than ever."
    </li><li>
      In meeting 16, we discussed about the privacy. After discuss, I got few conclusion about it. First, privacy is important for everyone because it is a human being things. second, we can not totally get rid of the environment that being monitor, it already become a normality in the internet. Third, people want to have privacy not meaning they done bad things that don't want others know, Sometime the embarrass things they done also don't want others know.
    </li><li>
      We learned many things in this meeting, the video ‘why privacy matters?’. In this video, I learned many things like mass surveillance is an important thing that people are unaware of. ‘If you are doing something that other people does not know those things should not be done’ an interesting comment by Eric Schmidt. The privacy is something that people does not wants others to know the activity and there are few people those deliver themselves to be transparent, but their social activities negate that. So, privacy does matters from everyone’s perspective.
    </li><li>
      We discussed why privacy matters. What are the issues one can face due to lack of privacy in a medium. Also wanted to know more about what are the ways programmers and developers are using now a days to improve for better results.
    </li><li>
      Ted talk "Why does privacy matter?" was one of the best talks I've ever encountered. I like it, maybe, because of the subject that was really fascinating and attractive. I believe that although we don't do anything wrong, we have things to hide from others. Everyone wants to keep their private life a secret, but when it comes to famous celebrities, people want to know everything about them, including every single aspect about their personal life that I think is unfair. In my opinion even they want some privacy, so we should respect it and should not interfere in their...
    </li><li>
      in response to the question in our previous meeting: how to exercise some agency about your online privacy?I think the only way to exercise some agency about online privacy is by using VPN or by also reading the terms and conditions before joining a social network platform. Online there companies that would usually state what data would be collected, so I think taking the time to read about it before signing up can be a way to excercise some agency online. Otherwise, I think the best advise for those who really worry about their whole privacy online is for them...
    </li><li>
      Rights online is an interesting subject matter to discuss, as with what we discussed in class, many of the rights we have online are claim, not liberty. Realistically, we don’t have any control over our data online unless we choose to simply not use the services that we know are abusing our privacy, but even then, take Facebook for example, can still have a online profile on you from using websites that have integrated like/share buttons, analytics, or advertising from them. It isn’t a liberty right, generally speaking we aren’t giving them direct access to our information, it just comes...
    </li><li>
      ResponseIn the last meeting, we watched a TED speech named why privacy matter by Glenn Greenwald. To be honest, i think his opinion is right and i want to talk about my understanding of privacy. First, i want to say those people who say that privacy isn't really important and don’t believe it are double standard. Cause when they are saying these words, they are taking all kinds of steps to safeguard their privacy like put passwords on their email and their social media accounts or  locks on their bedroom and bathroom doors. In my opinion, People’s awareness of privacy...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I leaned from last meeting was that not many people actually read the policies and agreements for the services they are using. The concept from the last meeting that was the hardest for me to understand was how much the user can do to be private. Whether its just being careful of what they put out on the internet to using a virtual machine and a VPN, there is so much variance in the levels of privacy. I would like to learn more about how private I need to be online, and how much companies are...
    </li><li>
      Last Thursday, we saw two TED talk videos. One was "The future of digital communication and privacy" by Will Cathcart(head of Whatsapp)which was regarding how social media chatting platforms like Whatsapp messenger has the feature of end-to-end encryption and they say billions of text messages on the daily are protected from government firms, some institutions and the company of Whatsapp themselves. The other video "Why privacy matters" presented by Glenn Greenwald at TEDGlobal 2014 brings a whole different point of how and why do people need to know and take proper care about their privacy even though there's nothing you...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we discussed about the threat to our privacy from the social sites like Facebook. How these applications are using our personal information for their own profit even without us knowing about it.
    </li><li>
      The Internet is developing very fast now. Personal privacy will be leaked out inadvertently. Privacy is one of the serious problems at present. Every year, there are countless property losses caused by privacy leaks. Therefore, you must protect your personal privacy when surfing the Internet, and do not disclose it at will.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we talked about privacy and its importance in our life, especially about the digital world and the privacy concern. In the breakout room we had a short discussion about it too. We also talked about how violation of said right can be violated and are we willing to allow limited violation in return of free stuff. We also talked about using proctortrack and how some students felt unsafe about it.In the ted talk Glenn Greenwald discussed why privacy is important and mass surveilence is problematic for individual freedom and liberty. When we surrender our privacy its...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 16 we discussed about online privacy policies of the online websites in terms of terms and conditions. We discussed how can we have an agency for our privacy online. We were divided into groups to discuss further on the given topic. The terms and conditions posted by the websites are hardly read by anyone. People generally skip reading and go straight for agreeing to all the teams and conditions written on those online contracts. There are obvious reasons for skipping those long agreements, the most common one being that they are really time-consuming and boring. Most of the...
    </li><li>
      Thinking about the Ted Talk that was linked about privacy, when it comes to the internet there really is no such thing as "privacy" -- you may have anonymity, but you are still vulnerable to hackers, large technology companies (like Google and Facebook) and the government. One of the things the talk mentions near the beginning is touching on the idea of 'if you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear'. This reminded me of the blog I wrote earlier this term, Amnesty International did a good article on why this line of thinking is fundamentally flawed: https://www.amnesty.ca/blog/7-reasons-why-%E2%80%98i%E2%80%99ve-got-nothing-to-hide%E2%80%99-is-the-wrong-response-to-mass-surveillance
    </li><li>
      I think privacy is power and power is something that needs to be contained. In the video 'why privacy matters', Glenn brought the point where he said that people who say privacy doesn't matter still put password on their social media, emails, etc. and keep it private. It shows that actually they do care about their privacy they are just not aware of how deep far it goes.
    </li><li>
      Privacy is something that we should hold close to ourselves, especially in this digital age that we live in. Companies like Facebook and Google have access to so much of our personal information, it is kind of scary when you think about how much these companies actually know about us. I also think these companies are hypocrites since they want to know anything and everything about our personal lives but when the public wants to know about them they don't like it because it is an invasion of their privacy. Yet they expect us to give them all of our...
    </li><li>
      Nowadays poor mental health has become one of the major issue, which needs to be deal, although there might be many ways but one of them is about connection with people there are many platforms and groups on internet who shares there experience and help other masses which is actually fascinating and interesting
    </li><li>
      The video that the professor shared on his website about “The future of digital communication and privacy”. The use of WhatsApp has increased drastically due to covid and it is because people believe in Whatsapp. The end-to-end encryption that WhatsApp uses to secure the conversations is that they scramble the message once it is sent and then only the person on the other side can see it. Not even WhatsApp can see it. This was the biggest reason people trust WhatsApp and it should be this way. There are so many benefits to have the technology. Governments can talk to...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing in the meeting is about the privacy matters and future of digital communicationthe topic related to previous class is about privacy concernsthe difficult part was to understand how future digital communications have privacy concernsi want to learn more about this privacy concerns
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about the privacy policy of the companies. We talked about how to make the privacy policy easily accessible i.e, to make it more readable to the common public. The more people who are aware of all the platforms they are using, they would have less chance of getting scammed by the big tech companies. We also proposed some ideas of how companies can try to make their privacy policy more readable to the common public but it is also the duty of the people who use the app is to try to understand what...
    </li><li>
      On meeting 16, we’ve talked about privacy, And we have read the two source site which has deeply study of public communication and privacy, The two websites with Ted talk :The future of digital communication and privacy, Why privacy matters gives us the how the privacy influence public, individual and our culture. On The future of digital communication and privacy, there is a conversation of a reporter with head of WhatsApp talk about how to design the model for the software to protect privacy for users and One the why privacy matters which Greenwald makes the case for why you...
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about how encryption one of the best inventions in computer science has helped so much in the current covid times. Due to lockdown, people were forced to stay at home and have conversations virtually but due to end-to-end encryption provided by companies like WhatsApp people can trust that their information stays private. Even governments and doctors have used WhatsApp in order to send out the word about prevention and the information that government sends needs to be secret. It’s good to see technology for the greater good of humanity, It proves that we can...
    </li><li>
      I find the issues of privacy to always to be an interesting debate. I have noticed there is a growing concern, or at least an acknowledgement of privacy issues by most people I encounter, but in the end we are powerless. Surveillance is ingrained into our daily lives. From the voluntary participation in social media platforms such as Facebook, to the compulsory use of Proctortrack in Universities, there is no escape.
    </li><li>
      When discussing online activity, an important question arises: do we, as users, truly have agency over our online privacy? Although we have the ability to grant or deny applications access to our personal information, I do not believe that this ability involves full liberty. While it is our choice to accept conditions or policies, this process does not always seem transparent. Few users, including myself, take the time to read such lengthy documents, simply pressing accept instead. Applications often require users to accept location sharing and grant apps access to our devices in order for the applications to function properly....
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we discussed regarding how we can exercise some agency about our online privacy. That means how how an individual can protect their privacy online. Nowadays our privacy online is very fragile, for instance we all know our mobile phone keep track of our conversations and search history or almost all of our activities and finds out the information that they send online. That's how we get those daily advertisements of the products on certain websites and social media that we have never mentioned on that platform. Sounds scary but it's true. Moreover whenever we agree to the...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we talk about the privacy and the ways in which we can protect ourself to get our data protected. In the break out room we discussed about that their are much better plaforms where our data gets protected instead of this big social networking sites such as facebook.
    </li><li>
      From the videos about privacy I saw how important privacy is as people usually do not do things as they usually do when their monitored as well as how WhatsApp tries to put in effort in order to safeguard the users privacy by encrypting the messages being sent and I believe other platforms should imitate their efforts  In protecting the privacy of users 
    </li><li>
      In this class we talk about privacy in digital world. The companies guarantee the privacy of the people information from being miss used but who knows what might happen because in digital society anything can happen. People are always worried about thier privacy and raising flag against some companies.
    </li><li>
      The discussion about maintaining privacy through WhatsApp's encrypted messaging service is intriguing. It seems as though we have reached a point where we can't have both privacy and crime-prevention on the same platform. I enjoyed Will Cathcart's comment saying that we _could _cameras in the living room of every household to catch criminals, but all of the law-abiding citizens would suddenly lose so much privacy for nothing. 
    </li><li>
      From the video " Why privacy matters " I learnt about the importance of privacy and how privacy is important in the society we live in now.
    </li><li>
      After watching the video “The future of digital communication and privacy” by Will Cathcart, I learned how WhatsApp encrypting the messages that the health care and government are using this app for sharing data during COVID. I think having privacy in apps where we can share data without worrying about it being lost is important.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the importance of privacy on the social media platform can be understood. It is the most important thing that the privacy of the user should be protected so that it does not go in the wrong hand which can lead to misuse of that information. The amount people joining the social media and interacting with each other has grown during this pandemic, so it becomes a critical thing to be looked after.
    </li><li>
      When it comes to ethics surrounding the collection of data particularly on social media platforms, these big companies are taking advantage of misinformed consumers. While the legality of it all is valid (they disclose everything they are collected/doing with your data) in the fine print agreement, they take advantage of the fact that consumers don't take the time to read and analyze this contract. So from a legal standpoint it is technically fine, but from a morality perspective they are taking advantage of their consumers.
    </li><li>
      “Why privacy matter” by Glenn Greenwald talk about the privacy and how there is someone who are always watching us. Even though, if we want to do something in private but it is hard to say that the work is actually getting done in private because there is always someone watching. He also said that long-time google CEO Eric Schmidt said “If you're doing something that you don't want other people to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.” I think this is not correct if I want to keep my data private I should have...
    </li><li>
      In the past class meeting, we discussed about the importance of privacy on the social media platform can be understood. Well we know that It is the most important thing that the privacy of the user should be protected so that it does not go in the wrong hand which can lead to misuse of that information which is not good at all so The amount people joining the social media and interacting with each other has grown during this pandemic, so then it becomes a critical thing to be looked after. We discussed in BRooms also about this discussion...
    </li><li>
      In this lecture most important thing that I have learnt is about privacy in online space.I learnt how can we protect our privacy online through various softwares.I also learnt about terms of services,I learnt the important of TOS as a contract between user and company.I learnt about TOSDR.org a site who review the policies of different information technology companies.Overall in this lecture I learnt about privacy,it’s importance and ways to protect it in online space.
    </li><li>
      Its cool to know that there are technologies like end-end that provide privacy to us. I recently learned about this in another class. The positives are certainly massive of this technology and obviously, this is used to conduct business that can be good or bad but id like to think or hope that the good is better than the bad or evil that happens.
    </li><li>
      I myself have thought, "I have nothing to hide, I don't care if the government knows what I'm doing", but after watching this Ted Talk, it is so true, privacy is very important and I wouldn't want people to parooz my emails and social media accounts. It's easy to say, when you don't believe that anything of yours will ever become public but in actuality if my information was published it would be a traumatic experience. Privacy is so critical, it allows us to have a part of us all to ourselves, I think this is a necessity.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discuss about the business strategy and how online agency companies represent their business online.we also discuss that are we doing something wrong by agreeing to the term and service privacy policy of every website. sometimes because of it they can see some of our personal information also. May be This topic take a long discussion in class also.
    </li><li>
      I learned in the meeting that what do companies to make privacy?Companies have IT experts, and they guide them in many ways.
    </li><li>
      Although the world is becoming more public with the advancement in technology and social media, privacy is one of the most important rights that we should protect. In a democratic society, I believe there should be no surveillance of its citizens. It is mistaken to think that privacy doesn't matter unless you have something to hide. It is one of the government's responsibilities to prevent crimes without the full surveillance of every citizen.
    </li><li>
      It's alarming to see how we are forced to do more things online but unfortunately the thing that the head of the WhatsApp talks about it and focused most on is how their app is encrypted end to end but the thing they didn't talk about is how they collect users data even when its unnecessary. For example Signal the same app for text messaging does not collect any data on it's users but on the other hand WhatsApp collects over 50+ different types of data on it's users which tells you all the talks they put about privacy and...
    </li><li>
      I learned from the video that end to end encryption lets you send a message directly to the receiver and no one else can see that message, not even WhatsApp. It is also very helpful for doing business online where you can do it privately without any doubt.Due to COVID-19 we are force to do everything online so will it remain same after COVID-19 or it will change is a question which will have an answer after the pandemic ends completely.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we talked about the privacy policies of the companies. We talked about how to create a privacy policy so that it is easily available to the common public. The more people are aware of the privacy policies the less is the chance of them being scammed by the so-called big tech companies.. We also proposed some idea of how the companies can try to make their privacy policy more readable to the common public but also the duty of the people who use the technology to understand what does the company has to offer and what...
    </li><li>
      Meeting 16:In this meeting, we discussed the different aspects of privacy and various avenues that we have available or lack thereof to protect our privacy online. There were mixed opinions as some people thought that we have to give up our online privacy in exchange of free and better(optimized) services while others thought that we need better and stringent regulation from government to protect our privacy.Meeting 15 response (I was unable to do it in previous forum):In this meeting, we discussed our rights and responsibilities on the Internet. I feel that any rights that we have offline should automatically extend...
    </li><li>
      In class we talked about the basis of privacy and how to keep privacy well still using the internet. A question that I have that stems from this topic is how can you keep privacy if we’re loving more and more technologically because we’re beginning to store almost our entire lives online. Some company has to have that information so there isn’t true privacy.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing in the meeting what I learned was about the privacy matters and how it is interrelated with each and every individual and future of digital communication using AI.the topic related to previous class is about privacy concerns.The difficult part for me to understand was how future digital communications have privacy concerns.
    </li><li>
      I think it is important to understand the different types of "rights" one has in a certain place. On the internet it becomes obscure what ones rights and responsibilities are but in my opinion we should try to accommodate the rights which we can at least prehensile, such as freedom of speech and right to express an opinion.
    </li><li>
      In the zoom meeting we discussed about privacy rights and also about the need consideration of privacy issues in organizations which can increase their usage of applications or number of users. according to my perspective privacy is very important in every field.
    </li><li>
      In the recent lecture, we talked about privacy on internet platforms. The Ted speaker has coded the scenario very correctly as he implies the shift from freedom to mass surveillance from the company services we use such as Facebook, google and many others. We also have had a breakout session regarding the topic and interesting points were raised to tackle the privacy such as legal obligation from the government, conventional way to making a platform in the context of ethics, and many others.
    </li><li>
      “The future of digital communication and privacy” by Will Cathcart taught me a lot about WhatsApp and the technology it uses. I already knew that WhatsApp uses end to end encryption but I was unaware of the business model and the scale of the application.“Why privacy matters” by Glen Greenwald is a brilliant video. Very powerful speech. His arguments are very strong. I will definitely be recommending this video to people who think that if someone is being secretive that they are hiding something. I would love to see more video from Glen Greenwald.
    </li><li>
      I think that privacy is very important in the age of technology because companies and governments have the ability to get so much information about a person; keeping that information private is vital. Surveillance can be used for important reasons such as stopping criminals and terrorists, but more often it is used to invade the privacy of normal people who are doing nothing wrong, which I think is a problem. I think the freedom and privacy of the majority of people should be valued more highly than fear of a small group of wrongdoers.
    </li><li>
      Nowadays, with the development of Internet, online privacy becomes a common concern of many users. Recently, it appears many businesses operating and working by collecting online users' data, personal information and selling them. It is definitely harmful to our privacy on the Internet because we do not know whose are bought our information, as well as what would they do with our information. However, that is basically how many businesses make money in this modern world. Everyone makes money by somehow doing something ethically wrong to other person. In general, when everything we do is highly dependent on the use...
    </li><li>
      In this lecture discussing about the privacy why it is important? So if for example the transaction detail of your account is leaked and the confidential detail is shared every where it will have a great concern regarding it. So the privacy play an important role in persons advantages and disadvantages. Talking about future communication so it really has a great preferences regarding the future digital communication. In todays world we see a great change in our communication which is going fully digital. The future communication will be still more that will have a great preferences. Privacy is a thing...
    </li><li>
      From meeting 16, I understand why privacy matters. I believe that having privacy as human beings helps us to understand a sense of who we are and gives us the freedom to live without fear of our information being compromised. After watching the TED talk video on why privacy matters, I understand how privacy helps us define our self-relationship.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I leaned from last meeting was that not many people actually read the policies and agreements for the services they are using.
    </li><li>
      In this we mainly discussed about the privacy polices of the websites and how these privacy works. Every website has different policies which requires to be accepted by the user. But all these policies are protected for the user safety. However these policies are too long to be read and sometimes user misses the important information and accept the policy. Which sometimes may lead to trouble, but these issues can be sorted by shorting the lengths of the policy and only mentioning the importance information.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about how privacy matters in all social media apps that we use day to day.
    </li><li>
      In class we discussed about the proctor tracking and how it can breach our privacy. This will be helpful for next assignment of empathy map.
    </li><li>
      We talked about the privacy issues regarding the procter track software and it is really nice of the professor he understood the major concern.We debated on the topic how the information stays in Canada only and do not go anywhere else when we enter in Proctertrack software but still it goes through our network layers without seeking permission from us

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. today. yeah so far, so good. My second cup of coffee here. yeah So the question about feedback for the. Chris blog. He ran into a few. difficulties, but I should be able to. As the marks posted today. I remember. So I spent some time working in New York state at IBM research. and My boss, a fellow then we'll mental growth. Because I was also going to be too. I had I had moved or I was going to move to Vancouver. To do my PhD at Simon fraser university. And he was commenting on the. On the need for caffeine on the west coast. Can to match the level of intensity on the east coast. Without the caffeine. So. I kind of. Remember that so here in Scotland we're kind of in the middle of so he's a little bit less caffeine attacker. More than. in Toronto or New York. anyway. So last day we talked about privacy, actually, first let me do this. Okay, so we talked last week about privacy. And I was talking to a friend. Over the weekend see today's Tuesday right yes. Talking about his. wife taking a job with a big company as mad as a manager in charge of sustainability. And the comment was that his boss her boss didn't understand what sustainability is. And I thought it'd be interesting to explore sustainability from our. Computers in society perspective, a little bit here. So how do you understand sustainability. will do, maybe one or two one maybe two breakout sessions. today. sustainability. We start off with one. Sure, so. How do you understand, sustainability, if someone says, sustainability is important. What is it really. Being able to. use. Your own mug for coffee again. You go to TIM hortons or something like that. David doesn't give you enough said enough elaboration. Let me get that setup. make sense. Can opener. i'll do five minutes and we'll keep. will keep the same room circle back to them later on. Okay, so you came back the last five people are so. sure when when that. Was that was going to are coming back from the rooms anyway. So did anyone have some ideas about sustainability they'd like to share. Okay. So, can you please stop saying me direct messages. Just messes up mother chat. So talk about questions about the blog in a second or two. Sustainability in terms of. maintain. A healthy company or project, they want to think about healthy planet. making decisions for the future in mind all right. doing something now, without compromising the ability to do that for future generations yeah. Okay, so there's some comments about data. So this. I see this as a connection to our discussion last table privacy. and discussion about smart meters smart electric meters. So if everyone has a smart meter. That means it's good in essence we're getting data back to the utility. So they can understand peak usage and. there's. no better way than that. Okay, so I said I would talk about the blog in a minute. So let's stop. discussion and talk about right now. So would anyone be offended if we allow the due date for the blog to be pushed to Tuesday next week. Okay, so. The idea. blog is. Just to clarify it's not necessarily. about looking at Defense distributed, although you can use that as your case. You can use that as. The example. Your focus. But the idea was more generally could be more general to say. There are different groups claim to be in the act in the public interest. So Defense distributors, one of them. So you may think I claim is somewhat dubious. or not. But i'd like you to critically examine somebody claim to be acting in the public interest. And that is that's the focus of your blog post. Clear. Okay, so I already talked about the blog one i'm gonna release marks. Such as they are today later today okay. public interest, I think we could make a case for that. Okay, so let's. let's. make that change here, let me. make a change right away and. Your courses. Dealing with zoom windows here. Coming up. The settings end to change for the assignment. The empathy map. i'm inclined to well. We can talk about that next week, see where people are at okay. or. not opposed to. being flexible on the date. Okay. So I just said i'm not opposed to being flexible a dates, but we'll have that discussion. Tomorrow next meeting our next week. Well, I suppose you could have it now. Since we're having this discussion. So I can move to move at the same amount to from the Thursday to the next Tuesday, so the 30th. Anything else. questions that you can send to everybody. And not direct messaged me about. Things not related to our discussion today. Seeing none will continue with our discussion, then. So. Last year we talked about privacy and. collection of data and the risks of being identified, even when data is de identified. So this to me relates to the smart meter idea as an example. Smart power meter does anyone. Remember the well. There were some effort to get smart meters in China in saskatchewan. The then the meters that were selected caught on fire. And i'm not sure the overall status of the. So those meters are replaced and i'm not sure the extent. To which the smart meters have been. implemented here, I need to check that. But what I found interesting is. When I was looking at that. problem originally so there's the idea that. you're going to have aggregate data, so people can. Compare their consumption and make. decisions based on data. So we don't want to be too. To clear about whose data is. which belongs to whom. Because that could. Put somebody else put a target on somebody. Somebody else is using a lot of electricity. Then they might be singled out if we could understand. Those would be. So the other thing is. So it's sharing enough data. To make comparisons interest that useful. Say that we're above. Their utility customers above the average or below the average at the average. And then doing some analysis to say here are some ways to save power. So there's also. An issue about. Making a data available to. The household. So even if we're not sharing. With the with the Community with back to the utility and they're not. The identifying data. it's still be nice for the household to see what is going on a throne you, with your own utility. So I know is water meters. And I think this is a drive by and collect them. there's a transmitter. connected to the water. So that the city can. Read read the information once a month for billing for the billing cycle. But the issue is there's no way for me to see that. Information exactly. So I can't make use of that data it's going to utility. And it's going. to know that i'm not sure where else it's going it's not being made accessible to me. So I can do my own analysis on the data. which might be interesting and useful say you know so for you the water. And for the. power. goes up to good sources so when I was talking to. Someone earlier about. Some one of the suppliers, that those meters, they said. Well, we can give you a console you can install on your home. And they were they were able to sell me, and I think there's a subscription involved as well. Some. access to the data. For my house and then I could. I could do some maybe do some analysis and. gain some understanding of what the sources of the power consumption, where are in my house. So we talked about data and sustainability. About singing. The planet. i'll do me, is there a way for information technology and computer scientists to make a contribution to. Sustainability on the planet. Considering that. data is an important part of understanding. how things are sustainable and things might not be so sustainable. I put I just posted this before the meeting but. I just give you an overview of some of these things. The first video that I posted was. What cradle to cradle design, this shows an architect. So he worked with Elsa does to work with a chemist. And talked about triple top line. So cradle to cradle design is the idea that. You design things so that they can be reused and their components can be. reintegrated so they're easy to. When something's at the end of the end of its life cycle, it can be components can be repurposed to create something new. Without much waste at all. And so corresponding ideas, a triple top line. that's the idea of having information about. alternatives. Measuring. measuring the impact collecting data about the impact of. processes and products and. and materials. And then. I was choosing. The one that is the most. Effective. So the one that has the most. benefit for. Or is most easily. return. To the cradle after. After its. What it's been used for has come to an end. And so the one that is. most easily returned. To the credo without to a new product without. severe impact. Those are the best choices, and so we need. A triple top line ideas that we can. make choices, you can cut cut gather information and. make choices about the impact two different choices and then. And then, as the last effective solutions are placed by more effective solutions and no less effective ones. fall out of use. So you can see that's an information problem. And then i've included. taught by TIM burners Lee both the next Web. And this is interesting because he talks about raw data, making it data, making data available through the link. Through web standards. And it's also interesting because it's from 2009. So you can see the. The maybe there's still some work to do in that. So, in terms of how it can be used and. made more useful or usable. And the third link is to the Wikipedia page for spine. So Bruce sterling who's a science fiction author. I don't know him as a science fiction author, but maybe some of you do. Anyway, so he gave a talk at siggraph, which is the computer graphics Conference, and I think he gave the talk a similar talk at some other meetings as well. We talked about how. We need to leave this. things better. than we found them current and future generations. And what he talked about was the idea of a spine, which is. Where it gets coined by combining space and time. So that we can. track. objects, so when they reach the end of life, and we know that. there's this much of materials X, Y and zed available. When. The original. Product. lifecycle. Is. Now, I think this is often used as a. Internet Internet Internet of Things kind of. example. opportunity with. The different sensors like are fed or. or other technologies. The question is. In those cases, when do you. When do you want. example of her boots and some videos. So, when does a pair of boots they're finished and when they entered the landfill. And when can we activate. The scanner to say reuse me. Some issues. In our in our homes. That have. This technology in them to. be activated once there. Once they're no longer. serving their purpose. For us. We don't want to accidentally turn on the identification, while we're still using them in our homes. Or to still. or two well there's the risk to certainly some privacy concerns if we. Understand who's got which pair of boots. and which other. items in their homes. technologies and sufficiently secure. Then might be a big problem as well. So I think there's an opportunity. For not just Internet of Things kinds of. Technological. implementations of this idea spines. And I think that there's. Opportunities using link data and so forth on the web. Help us keep track of. Which. pair of boots or. Which office chair, or whatever the case is. which ones are the best or the most effective choices. For the environment. So the question. Is a little bit of sense. In terms of thinking about. Sustainability and data. So the second question for the breakout rooms is. What is the computer science angle on sustainability. Okay, so i'm going to open the breakout rooms again and then we'll take 10 minutes for this. So it's not just a guess it's so there's two angles two parts to that So what can we do as individual professionals. And then, what kinds of. software and systems can we create. That contribute that contribute to sustainability. Okay. So here we go for the breakout room. same rooms. How is that discussion was just. Productive the questions come up and he. Okay, again, please don't send me direct messages. So I know that groups aren't always balanced. Okay, so CS professional should release more data to the public. yeah I can see that. So this is seems to be also related to our. Ongoing theme of filter bubbles and polarization and. not accepting. or resistance towards having a. shared understanding of what the truth is. So it's about transparency and then it's also about. Agreeing. Yes, means yes and no means no and so forth. So who is the CIO Sri or they could just do what Volkswagen did in live but.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;There is a really interesting discussion in the chat just about how transparency tales and what these companies, and I think one of the hardest concepts is. corporations that are still operating for financial gain it's kind of hard to tie them down and get them to display data that that doesn't necessarily look good on them all the time.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So Okay, but VW.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;i'm not sure if you heard it oh. yeah a lot of decent while ago um Volkswagen had emission ratings and on some of their cars and they. underestimated significantly on those emission ratings and then I think when a third party company, later on, like a couple of years down the line investigated them, then it came out that those admission ratings were far above the minimum limit Rom enforced by the EU.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so the. The falsified their. Data from the test, so they could. Essentially, tell the car that they were in the special in the laboratory so they should. not admit as much, so the settings were. tuned to make the test look good. In practice, the cars never delivered and so Volkswagen paid a hefty hefty price for. That. problem, and so there. was a another angle on in terms of computer professionals. Because. It was a software. solution, they used to enable the the testing settings. So it's a question of. that's computer impression on you are asked to falsify data or educated. create a setting so that we could fool the. regulator. Something. that you would like to do. So. Now I didn't mean to. put a damper on discussion there it's gone quiet now. So we have to agree as a set of rules, we play by. and Have. Penalties that discourage cheating. that's one thing. and David go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I just want to talk about something I think is pre closely related to this, an ECON 130 this concept that we talked about. And it's the idea of a social cost versus a private costs, and I think when it comes to anything to do with corporations, they never look at the social cost of what they do. They only look at how it will affect them, so we need to find a way to make the companies pay for the social costs so that they're interested in actually you know, protecting the environment and being sustainable, for example.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you. He can.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Do yeah what you're talking about is basically the carbon tax rate since market equilibrium didn't consider the pollution to the air like that's exactly what the carbon tax is trying to. six.

    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Everything's okay so far
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I forgot to have coffee so I am barely alive
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;^^^^^^^^
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Will we get feedback for the first blog before the second one is due?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I had coffee and breakfast already which is better than usual hahaha
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Ayyy NYC, the city that never sleeps :)
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Awesome, thank you
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you

    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Care to elaborate a little first? I'm not sure what to talk about
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room: what is sustainability?
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yes I think so! Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Our group seemed to think sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or project. Wise use of resources and time.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;In a general sense, it means doing something now that can continue indefinitely, without impeding the ability of future generations to do so.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Mostly as a neither way we can look at sustainability is that its also a way of stagnation since there is no need to bring in new ideas since they have a steady source of income
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah! In our room we floated around the concept of sustainability in terms of data. To what extent companies can continue to harvest/collect data on us before it comes to a turning point where that data is too critical to be collected.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;in our group we discussed sustainability is the tern used to describe the management and disposal of it in a way that it reduce the harm to environment
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Our group did
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;In a very broad sense, sustainability is when the resources you can consume is less than the maximum that the planet can regenerate is what I wrote in our group discussion
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I think true sustainability would be that the resources you consume should be less than the MINIMUM the planet can regenerate, to ensure no deficit
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Is it possible to extend due date for blog 2 please
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I saw sustainability in context with this course to be more so about developing in a sustainable way, as abusing the things we are able to now may lead to increased restrictions online for future generations
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;No
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;That’s fine
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;that would be good
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;more time works for me lol
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;That would be nice
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I'd much prefer that, gives me time to reflect with what I needed to improve on with the first blog
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;that's good
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;that would be good
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;That would be awesome
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;yes it will be good
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;great
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I'm done but feedback would be great before I submit #2
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;That would be great
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Yes would be nice to see how the first one was to see if we need to improve things
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;yeah feed back for blog 1 would be great
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Would the Empathy Map still be due on same day then?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Would "social good" also fall under public interest?
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;so the due date of blog2 is March 23?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;cool cool thanks Daryl!
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;The blog2 2will be due on 23rd march and the empathy map on 25th?
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;what about blog 3
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;What blog 3?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;That’s fair
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I meant the empath map!
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;so it's not due on 25 then
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Hmmm, I hadn't thought of that
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;there was this Canadian show where they built a home 90% with reusable landfill material
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;He's new to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Bruce Sterling?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room 2: how can computer professionals contribute to sustainability ?
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Yup
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It was good
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;I said that CS professionals should release more data to the public
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Ours came to it usually comes to insentives to be sustainable. For example the deposit on aluminum cans
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;let the public have a better chance at making more informed sustainable decisions
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Solid discussion on how hard it is to nail down the sustainability concept to companies.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I think being transparent about those things would increase accountability - people can make more thoughtful choices. I like that.
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Make it law to let their data be more available and transparent
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Back to transparency hahaha
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Or they could just do what VW did and lie about it. :)
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Privacy for the individual, transparency for the corporations seems to be the idea
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;The VW jetta I think
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;other than corporate manufacturing secrets (not slave labour obviously), true
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, they used the sensors to trick the tests for emission ratings
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It was more than just the jetta it was like all their parent companies diesels wasn't it?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15339250/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-vw-diesel-emissions-scandal/
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, I found out recently that my car was upgraded to a Turbo engine during development to meet emissions standards because otherwise it didn't meet them lol
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;But turbos are more fun so like theres some utility
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;But most of those penalties are an extremely small fraction of the companies profit
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. That's the argument for it, I agree
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I don't know how youd make a law for that in computer science though
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;That's the big question
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl! Good discussion today!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for the interesting discussion! See you Thursday
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for class Professor Hepting, Take care :)
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you! Great discussion today! Have a nice day!
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;thank you,teacher.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I have a question sir
