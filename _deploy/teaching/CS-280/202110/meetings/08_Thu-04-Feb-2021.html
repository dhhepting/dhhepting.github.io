<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;morning. how's everyone doing today.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Good thanks for asking.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So let me go over a couple of things with a. With a course here. Okay, so. It doesn't show any activity for me in the recent activity but. attend some things so. i've arranged things like this, based on our discussion. So here's a link. today's meeting, although I realized that I didn't fill in all the details of are going to talk about because research. Continuing interfaces. and the impact they have. Anyway, here's here's the came up with with. It support for. Raw audio transcription. The video system in your course is called culture, and so, when I upload the audio files. To counter are due to be me on your courses, then it generates its own transcripts transcript audio transcripts so. If you click on captions. So by default it's off and i'm not sure what options, there are to turn them on. If you want to see the captions as you listen to the audio. Wait to. See you can also see the condensed version of the transcript so the time codes here. You have a sketch. read out of. everything that was said so you can search for it. spot on the video and the audio file. anyway. So there's a transcript is the culture of transcript. And then. The txt file is the chat transcript that you open another window. So you can all see. Saying good morning and then. The chat transcript from zoom. And here's the audio transcript from the zoom. So this is actually is a web tracks custom html standard for doing closed caption. that's useful. So you can let me know how that goes, and you can give me some feedback or suggestions about it as well. Okay. Any feelings about that setup. i'm trying I think i'm leaving this page I don't seem to go anywhere. Okay, so. attendance. today. Any questions or concerns about. Your courses set up. So if. An issue comes up, you can post them here. Okay, so. you're having problems with the browser. Maybe. Well, we can talk about that in just one of these discussions. Know try and find.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;My headphone microphone went off let's see the second.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Here we are not, but so let's have a discussion if people have discussions about the browser issues. Then. can go from there, and I can follow up with it service it support. there's one of these two different voices that I have. As well and sound like i'm on the international space station that's what I was told once when I had the. minutes talking through my headphones.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;anyway.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;hear me mention one thing about. editing html. In your individual student blog area. You can get an editor. html. And I just want to point out that this first one. gives you more options in the editor So if you want to create a hyperlink or without writing html you can do this link. You can create a an ordered list and non ordered list and different. Different types of. Adding. All the talent. add an image video, and this is the counter. media. Managing files. You can like to file. If you want to look at the code and an html you can click on. This one here. So it doesn't always nicely space things, so the code itself can be hard to read. And this one gives you full screen view. Which is the SAVE button, so if you're doing stuff. click to regular screen view and then save changes. And if you'd like more information about that, let me know if you have more questions about the editor let me know okay. OK, so the Those are the two interface videos any thoughts about. The main ideas there, the one with don Norman. About happiness and then also the one with David Kelly about creative thinking.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;interesting.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. So. Any thoughts about what kind of responsibilities, you might have. in designing interfaces. Let me say that away, is there a. If we're going to look out for the common for the public good. Do we. Do we need to. make people happy, do we need to take care of certain things in the interface.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I really liked don Norman kind of talked about the different types of. I guess how the brain interprets how to use something. Like visceral behavioral reflective I thought that was really fascinating, especially because you know a lot of the time when you're using something you don't think about why. you're enjoying using it, or why you're not enjoying using it. For me, I think intuition, is a really big thing like, if I can look at something and know how to use it that's really important to me, I don't think a lot of people like to read you know, a manual just to be able to use something. And that doesn't make it very accessible So for me, I think intuitive nervous. is a really big part of it, and I mean the bad doors video kind of exemplifies that. um.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, any other anyone else, want to contribute anything thank.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Feedback the point about feedback was very important as well, when you. take some action you would want to have some feedback to let you know that you are actually successful so whenever you design, something I think it's very important to build that feedback into it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah okay. So what about intuition so. The feedback that's one. Back in 1994 I think don Norman. Class we Jakob Nielsen. capitalists have 10 years to X Ray interfaces. And the stand, they stood the test of time. well. So. You mentioned intuition Dane. I want to talk a little bit more about that. So how do we, how do we know if something's intuitive. Or how do we get intuition about something.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, personally, I feel like intuitive ness is really like. You know what is your first like, if you look at something and, what is your first. I guess idea of how to use it. And so, like i've heard that the way that they test this stuff is to like you know they'll make software and then there'll be like hey you try this and see what they do. And if they immediately know how to use it, that means your software is very intuitive means you can look at it and know what to do, however, if people are like. clicking on the wrong stuff. Like, for example, I personally hate discord a lot of people really like it, I use it, I think it's one of the most intuitive pieces of software out there. So.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I think it's also worth mentioning that intuition can depend very much on a person's cultural background and, like their neurological makeup that you know there's people who have certain. Learning disorders or conditions that process information in a very different way, and so the cues that might make a human interface really intuitive to an average person may not be intuitive to them, so it very much depends on who's looking at the thing as well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;We have to. Talk about designing something Designing an interface. For a particular group of people. it's not general generally it's not one size fits all.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I think I think that link that you left to on like the the veil of ignorance, is also really helpful because it's like you know if I didn't know how to do this. How what would be the best way to make it obvious to do this, so I think you kind of do have to implement a sort of veil of ignorance when you're designing a product as well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;As interesting. We do that in a different way. We can talk about having empathy for.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I totally I totally know it's like an actually like an ethical you know standpoint but I mean you could also. apply it in lots of different ways, I think.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. As designers. In this is why we have London do some testing of interfaces. So that we don't have we don't rely on our own sense of. Just complete makes complete sense to me so therefore everyone will get it. And so, when we were testing as it responsibilities designers and just to. put something randomly together and then throw it out to the users and see whether they like it or they can understand how to deal with it.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Now.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;There are some. techniques that we can use to. And then. The interface heuristics are a good starting point. So make our best effort. And then get feedback and then improve it. go further vote intuition so. We don't come. We don't have experience. turned off. I was a kind of a heavy handed approach can you see that, but I did. Participants window up and I said you'd all. I was waiting for the. box to have a ring around it. So they knew to see which one was active. didn't work as expected so.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;anyway.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So, even though i've muted everyone you're free to unmute yourselves when you have something to say.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;anyway. So we don't come with an understanding of interfaces necessarily built in so intuition comes from experience. So might be from another experience with software, I might be other experience with.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;With.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Doing tasks. So we transfer that. Experience to the interface, and if it's a good fit if we have a good idea of how it should work, then we can. make a smooth transition and then. we're just focused on the task we want to accomplish instead of having to fiddle with the interface, and so that way we can think of. interfaces being satisfying. It takes more work to figure it out, then. Maybe it's only comprehensible. So we have to go back and figure out. It might be logically make like make sense, logically, how to access functions. We certainly derivative work console is comprehensible, we like to say that. And then, if it's. If we know the interface can accomplish something but there's no clear path. From. From our our goal to the desired action. And we know the softer permits it then. You can say that maybe it's just an effective, so that we can do something. We don't get any help.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;accessibility. This is an example, I used to work at SAS tell his technical support and there was a lot of customers that were to call in for a Max TV issues and they were always a lot older. And I think it's really important that when we're talking about accessibility to know who your target audiences when creating some sort of technology. For example, if you have really old people they're not as experienced with technology, you probably shouldn't have a really complicated setup if that makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it does really old like 56 right. Not until April is why be 56 but anyway, so I can still talk about people coming 56 and really well.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No that's true, I mean even. I get frustrated now because I have these. I can't even think. I have my glasses are are not single focus there. what's the word they used to be bifocal or trifle but now it's some.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;glasses.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I guess that's the one yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah well. I think that that works yeah. So I have to look through different parts of the glasses to see for different purposes, and that makes looking at the screen. And and zoom likes very. tiny fonts. And that makes it more difficult for me and. And it's just so much harder to. I would like to be able to figure out how to get the. text to build bigger without having to go through five screens of settings and read some documentation about it. But I can still help right. anyway. And not.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Enough of that but.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;certainly true that you need to understand the audience. And if you're similar to designing for senior citizens, you need to talk to the community of senior citizens who have. Who are going, who are going to be using your software or your product your technology it's not enough to say i'm doing is going to do this for senior citizens, but because they don't know any senior citizens i'm going to talk to you undergraduate computer science students.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So, making sure that you're including your target demographics when you're actually doing the designing is important yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So that's about. So emphasizing the. You know, taking on. Being able to identify with the feelings and. ideas of that the other group or the other people. So empathy is a much better approach, and you can also have sympathy, I suppose. for users and thank all go. So the idea, there might be. Oh. Poor so and so he has to do all this stuff and i'm going to. benevolent benevolently creates some soccer for him or her. crew for them. Because kind of sympathy and then. that's not that's not as good as emphasizing. And still versus maybe having an APP. Having apathy towards the user well okay here, I met. The functional requirements. So i'm done. I don't care what. You see, the user is unhappy or unable to use it. Because by the letter of the law. I followed the requirements as laid out. And so there we go.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Let me see.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;New share. Christian. Technology, I have a plan. Something I want to accomplish. I started with a goal and then turn it into a plan, and then I. I convert the plan into commands. at the interface. So, then, the state of the computer after I execute those commands. And I get pixels and then I interpret them. Do the state is the interface of the system. After. My last.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;command.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I mean we might start out by interpreting we might look at the computer and decide what state it's then and then. And then execute then decide which commands to put into the system. But if it's easy to understand the state of the computer and understand what commands I need to use to achieve my desired state. So we can maybe we love this part is execution related to execution. And at the top of my screen here that's right. evaluation. conceptual distance between these during the interface between the person and the computer. So if it ends up being large distance you might it. might be unusable, so that we can talk about. In this case. A golf to chasm to cross between the person on the computer. One way to make it smaller. metaphors in the interface. People aren't. familiar with online shopping say well it's like going to a grocery store or. going to a store we walk through a physical bricks and mortar store. You grab a cart or basket and you go through the aisles you find what you need you put them in your basket and then you go to the checkout. So this is the idea that. We don't have. We don't need to take all the all those ideas to the interface, we can use some of them to convey essential qualities. that are important for the user to understand, so if they have the idea of a cart. And so the card. Something or you can look and see what you have there and take things out or adjusted. And when you go to checkout and you have to. Have a payment method and so on. So all those steps. So we don't want to make it the metaphor. We don't want to invoke too much of the bricks and mortar store experience, because that. might create unrealistic expectations for the user for the person. To say well. I want to make sure I get a card that doesn't. It has good that rolls nicely. doesn't jam up and. I can steer. So you don't want to convey you don't want to carry on that much level of detail, I think. That, if you don't give enough detail than that. Then it may not be. enough to get them. focused on the tasks that they need to do. So it's not enough information well. Maybe they want to go to a bookstore online, but you say well it's like going to a grocery store. So maybe just having going to stores. isn't enough to to convey. The things you need to be concerned about. That make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So we want to make it analogous to like the key points of the experience without fully stimulating them and.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. I would say so. Because, if you have too much detail, then people like. can get some mind focus on. Things that aren't helpful for them to understand how to use the software. So. I was gonna ask you discovered, so why do you see it as. The world's worst.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Worst interface it's just. To me so like the first thing that happened when I got discord and this was a couple years ago, is it was like Oh, you have to start a server. And I was like what what is that I don't know I don't know what to do with that Okay, and so I started to server and then I didn't really know like. How to add friends or what servers were or when I finally did end up making my own servers I was like, how do you make these like what's important, what do I need. It to me it is really designed for people who. already have an idea of what this is supposed to look like when it's finished. And for me, I was just like I don't even know what the capabilities are I don't know what I can do, I don't know. And so it involve me doing a lot of researching and I was like God, I just wanted, you know, like, I remember back in the day with msn you just bit, but it but it's talking to a person right like it wasn't. wasn't hard, but this to me was like so different and, obviously, it has a lot more usability. In a lot of different ways than msn would but you know. For what most people are using it for it's not very intuitive, in my opinion.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;mm hmm.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I would say.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I was gonna add to that you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Can you raise hands, please, so I can. Show on you. Austin.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so I think that with discord I think compared to some of the irc clients that came before it like stuff like team speak. discord is very easy to use and it's really good but that's specifically for people who have used those previous irc clients, I think, for people who have never used something like that, before. it's super unintrusive but it's definitely way better than stuff that came before it like I don't know if anyone else has used to speak but it's terrible compared to the discussion.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, I haven't used it. anyone else. One person up or there's still me notice it for me for. anyway.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I was saying, for most people like who use this call, just to communicate with others like without adding bots or anything it's pretty much I find it pretty much similar to just creating like a Facebook group or like a messenger group right, you went to add friends like you just search.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah okay. So does that help if they say well it's like a Facebook group. So what's, the question is what's a good metaphor for discord I guess. So, nobody else can I get everybody wants to speak.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, I think that's what I find so difficult about it is that I don't really know what to liken it to because when I initially signed up for it, I was like Oh, it must be kind of like msn or something like that. And then I was like no it's not and I don't know how to use this thing mm hmm.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Alex.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Well, just to put this point out there is, I have a lot of experience with not knowing what to do, and a lot of sense, and I will admit discourage the pain, but like. The problem with interfaces is that you can't assume another person knows how to use them, because if we do that, that anyone that doesn't know work is they can't do anything. And to kind of well i'm like i'm we if you use an interface and it's horrible enough times you'll eventually go now this isn't that bad because you use enough time you know to navigate it, you know learn the tricks of moving it. But at the end of the day it doesn't make you a good interface it just means you're used to the pain of using it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Right. And people are very good at. Adopt adapting to. interfaces so. I mean that's that's often a situation, you know that comes up that. People. Are because people can adapt, then the onus is on them to adapt instead of the onus on the designer to. design. helpful and. and good software David you had a hand.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah I just want to add this, I think this is a really interesting case because, even though it has this really kind of crappy interface. For some reason everyone's still using it, so I think it shows that there's this balance between utility and ease of use and if it's useful enough. People are still going to use it like if you've seen, like, for example, Skype or as Dan said, Ms and stuff like that it adds so much more utility compared to those platforms that people are still using it, and I think I think it's really interesting to note that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah that's right. Oh what's his name. Terry winograd. He talks about the threshold of indignation. So what point do you throw the TV or the window, or you know sort of easier, well, we don't know if he's using the word I wanna throw any new terms that you young people. Sorry that's that's the old person talking they're. realizing all my standard references are. outdated now. But. yeah absolutely that's a problem or that's that's an issue it's like. If I want to do this. What a combination, so I have to make. have to bite the bullet and. and go from there, so Michael first and then brandon.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;so well, one thing that comes to mind for me about discord is this sort of trade off between the simplicity of the interface, and the simplicity of using it. I think a lot of the challenge with it comes from the fact that it has to be this relatively simple interface, but it has this whole complicated set of commands and things you can do with it, but. there's too many of them, for there to be a button on the interface that clearly explains what each one does. it's I guess it's not dissimilar to c++ or javascript that way and that those are both very simple you just type characters into a field of text but because it's that simple there's a lot more onus on the user to master it and to understand what's going on under the hood.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay that's that's true enough. Because that's awesome that might be also be a little bit of a cop out. in the sense that. You know we're not expecting enough of programmers. to design. To be thoughtful and design the interface.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;That would help people.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay brandon. Thanks. i'm sorry. Can you turn up. your microphone.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I think.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I can hear you say that. Okay stranded thanks for typing that in so can the user interface be to user friendly isn't going to be so simple that users, find it insulting in a way. So that's a possibility. mean. If there's a lot of command if there are a lot of commands available. And the interface only pre approved presents a few of them. And it doesn't let the user dude as much as they would like to do. Then, that could be an issue. So we can talk about user experience and usability. there's another distinction to make. So user experience might be good, very. helpful but there. they're not getting. What what the what's provided is a is a good experience but it's not. letting them do what they need to do with the interface. So that can be an issue, so I also heard this thing. You know, a tricycle is easy to ride for right off the BAT you can do you can go much further and faster at the bicycle.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;You know so.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;The icicle might be a bit more. A good entry level. interface. But you're not gonna be able to go as far as you can as fast as you can the bicycle. That make sense. Okay Dania your hand up.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I think people are bringing up some good points in the chat about like also how you know, sometimes a product might initially start out with a particular target audience, but then due to say pandemic. That target audience become like the scope becomes larger and then all of a sudden, a bunch of people that weren't expected to be using the software are using it now. So, I guess, my question is is if that happens. say you have you know a thing like discord I mean there, it was for a very specific use, I think, at one time. But now a lot of people are using it to foster communities or teach classes, or whatever, so, is it the responsibility of discord to adapt to that or is the responsibility of the users to understand the initial I guess intent of the product.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Oh that's a good question. So if I write the software and you don't want to use it, the way that I intended it or you, you find a new ways to use it.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;mean.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we can talk about something like Meta design. You know, so that we designed, something that that it can take on unintended applications. Or, so that we can design it for. For people doing new things with it. But I would say that it's not. it's not my responsibility to. Make software that's going to. do everything that. That you that you see that should be doing. With the software. I mean that's why it's nice if we have something like an open source platform, or if I read some open source software, then you can then fork it and make your own version of it. You can use github to manage it talking about things that are designed well for users. anyone's ever experienced get up.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;The easiest thing in the software thing that now forget the question. I think it depends on what suffer or interface that's been news for example discord the prime purpose of discord is communicating I. don't know what the original purpose of it was, but its primary purpose its core purpose is communicating, which means that. Sure, most people use it to play video games with friends, but I use it to talk to people that i'm playing dungeons and dragons with. and set up other games people can use it for school it's it's the key putting all those is communication it's not hey we're gonna play video games on discord. If the design is allow that then returned change completely the key point of discord is communication with another person so like. If they need to make it better so communication can happen, then yes, I would say the designers it's their responsibility to make it more easier because of. Maybe they need to have a way, so you can click something else to tell you what things do better these last things and just start I started naughty Jerry and I just clicked around buttons now i've learned stuff and. i'm like okay that makes sense. So clicking on buttons but that's what I usually do like, for example. I think it depends on what it is kinda like. i'm you're not going to have. The apple store and they're going to step away for people communicate with each other, because people want to use it to communicate with each other. That would be silly that's that's not the designers purpose to meet the interface for the apple store so song continue to have another person it's i'm selling a product to you this is how you get it. If that makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Thanks for talking about. Companies designing software. In the day there's an issue about. The renovations sure they'd like to add features that includes their customer market share. But ultimately they're deciding which features in which to what design direction to go into. Based on. Their own on. A company's. metrics and. which might be different than. David had your hand up they didn't get the column.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, no that wasn't me.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Oh.Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I apologize. If you do a anyway, so you know how to raise your hand and take it down again. Anyway, about discord I think that's a good example yeah so. So we can think. we're at a time today actually. Have will continue a bit more about interfaces next day, and if you want to have an. offline discussion. You can think of a. metaphor. For discord like discord is like Dr. seeley come up with. Okay, any questions or concerns before ago. Okay well thanks, very much for a lively. lively session today. Take care stay well.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Darrell.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you. All right, we'll see you. Thursday so see you on Tuesday. that's right and i've got office hours you know, to get me an office hours okay bye bye.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;bye.

    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;*waves*
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Doing well here thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Livin the dream
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;tired
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Good, how are you?
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;That's the spirit David =D
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;:&gt;)
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;my site says the cookies are blocking third part ones and asking to update the settings but no change after updating also
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Why are they called cookies again?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Because your computer fills with chocolate chip cookies
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Tech is a weird field
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;ah, I thought it was a metaphor of sweet decadence that is personal user data tracking
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;pffhahhahaha
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;It was coined from the fortune cookie actually, cookies with an embedded message
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I honestly have no idea it says "It seems your browser is blocking 3rd party session cookies which are required for the Kaltura application. To resolve this issue, please update your settings to allow 3rd party cookies."
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Are you using a cookie auto delete or incognito browser?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;"Shareef ate an entire oreos container, give weight loss ads accordingly"
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Very helpful, thanks Daryl! :)
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Agreed, sounds good!
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;@Lahari I had the same problem w Safari, but Kaltura worked on Google Chrome. Try switching your browser
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;iam using firefox and not any incognito tab
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;da2apr
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It's great, thanks Daryl!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;No questions, looks good :)
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;All good! Thank you for taking the time to walk us through it (:
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;It would have to be an extension of a privacy setting you have turned on Lahari. My Firefox and chrome do that if I leave cookie auto delete on, or am in incognito, but otherwise works fine both for me.
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;See if your firefox has tracking protection on Strict.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Wow that's 2 very different voices
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I use the Brave internet browser and I just turned off my "Brave Shields"
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah this one does a lil bit.
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;my lab instructor says I have a really good mic, I got it from London Drugs in Regina south
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;$60
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Are we done with the attendance?
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;oh I missed it
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Don't be even one minute late next time, some professors are relentless...
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;ok
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;da2apr
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;sorry just looking back at my notes
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;when you don't have a second thought on using a design
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;...also highly unmoderated...
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;+1 on that Dayne
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Deriving an action from instinct also takes quite a bit of construction cost. (team members debating which action works best)
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Nirmal your audio is on
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Nirmal
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;that works
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Buttons will always be more satisfying than touchscreens IMO
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I got that Sub-Gramophone for my hearing aid radio...
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Before Discord came to be, every server was paid. Discord's business model was selling user data right?
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah teamspeak a mess
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with that outlook on teamspeak
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;holy teamspeak was a headache
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;So clunky :)
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Discord polished a lot of it
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Teamspeak is trash
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;Team speak is not good, Vent is worse. xD
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;ElectronJS really out here with that nice UI
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I ended up using Steam chat :P
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;it causes discord...
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;In discord you don’t really share so much of your personal data. You can create different servers with subserves making it very convenient to use. And people who don’t know how to use it are probably used to other ways. A 5 min YouTube video might help.
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;yes, you are right, I just did a bit or research
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Discord sells merch, a subscription service...
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;and online customization
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I saw the lion king on vcr, we're good
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;VCR/VCP I saw Disney movies on them, The Lion King, Pocahontas etc etc
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, I'm not saying that Discord is bad y'all. I use it a lot and have adapted to it. I'm just criticizing its accessibility. Just because everyone uses it and there are tools to understand it doesn't mean the onus should always be on the consumer to do that just in order to use it.
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I saw Neverending Story on VCR it taught me to never love because SPOILER the horse dies as with all thing :(
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;It took me months to get familiar with discord
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;I've been confused with discord too. I always just let my friends set things up
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I've been using it for years and I still learn more about it all the time ahaha.
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve been on discord for years and I still barely understand how to use bots
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;My original discord account is a mess of servers, ive made my new one for school way more managed
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;We just discovered the text to speech feature last night and that's been a blast.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I cant hear him either
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;/tts is great
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;What do you peeps think is best alternative to discord out there?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Even fainter
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Steam Chat
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I kinda agree with Dayne on the fact that to act like a simple messenger, discord is complicated
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;yeah discord is much more complicated
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;but just because my friends and other classmates used it I had to too and eventually I got adapted
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Honestly, not anything I've found. The "better" programs like mumble and teamspeak are something you probably won't be able to get your gramdmother to use, while discord you can at least get them going.
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Can a user interface be too user friendly? As in, could it be so simple that the users find it insulting in a way?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;XD I remember when professors made us all go to Discord and everyone had to change their discord icons
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Hahahhaa
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;discord seems like an airplanes cockpit to me, everything is infront of me but baffled
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;all the notifications everywhere, true
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;I guess that is why client’s need keeps changing.
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;discord is hard for new one's to learn but once, one is using it consistently as communication it might be easy for them.
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;its called a J curve in economics I think...
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;both
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Like Facebook as a news/science portal.
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Communication for gamers*
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;its hard for people to use a new technique or technology but after the dip, the economic multipler is pretty much doubled
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I would say it's not the designer's responsibility at that point. If I, as a developer, start adapting to that, it will be a never ending grind for me and so it would almost not be worth it
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;DND..its been a while
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I played Pathfinder last year... :(
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Just for clarification, Discord's motto used to be something like 'designed by gamers, for gamers'
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;I am a tech-savy person and I usually don't mind complex interfaces but Discord is a bit obnoxious. The first time when I wanted to add a friend I had to actually search for that option...which shouldn't happen IMO.
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Discord now is trying to rebrand now that more than just gamers are using it
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;I did get used to it pretty quick though &amp; I think its a great tool.
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Every time we try to stream our screen to someone, and go to end the share, everyone in my channel disconnects from the call, since its the big red button and not the greyed out "stop stream"
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Most of my classes my a discord server
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry for starting a debate about Discord haahhahah
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;should we all make an alternative for discord??
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Nah its a software a ton of people use, but has awful usability
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;i say it caused....discord among us...
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Its an excellent alternative
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;err example
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Eris: goddess of Discord
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;similar to discord but much more user friendly
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you sir
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;bye, have a good weekend
