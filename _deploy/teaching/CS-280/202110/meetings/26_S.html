Be back around 10 years back, and then I was actually worked i've worked with Oracle so I have, I have. kind of Wagner multiple companies and seen a lot of culture and one thing I always have gathered from this experience is having a good mentor always help you grow and kind of. stays with you, even though no matter how many companies, I have changed my mentor who's from my first company is still in touch with me distal still you know, like. I almost always go back to him, and we are encouraged to kind of I sometimes ask for guidance he's always practically telling me what he feels and then based on you know, like.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Our discussion we. move forward and he actually helped me.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;make the right decision, which I feel is good for my future so that that is what I know from the mentorship if you have any questions on my bio I have my linkedin. Link as well, feel free to connect me over linkedin and we can actually you know, Chad and, if you want to know we can do that post. The session as well, going to the next, what does mentoring and mentor coaching mean so basically it's informal. You know, like basic association between two people and it actually helps you grow, and you know, in your carrier and also personal growth so. long time people confuse it again okay mentoring is merely carrier, you know, like it's kind of focused on specifically. of you know at target of technology or something no, it is, it is very, very, very like highly integrated view which were personal growth as well, so you're you're. Good as a person as an individual and also in the character, because if you grow as a person as an individual, then it will help you. convert that growth into your carrier or what whatever you want you want to achieve, so it could be, maybe, if you are actually working in the. 70s job and going towards like you know, a CIO position or if it's a like you I will be going to a partnership. Or if it's a if you're an entrepreneur you kind of you're trying to establish yourself as an entrepreneur and going to be Elon musk one day, so all all those. journeys, as always, even have mentors and then you have right to guide you and kind of share their perspective of you know, with you, and what works best for them. So with that i'll let you add few things so what i'll do i'll give a pause and I want to know from at least one or two of you what mentoring and coaching me to you. Because I just shared application my language, but I want to make sure that I understand what you are looking for a new order entry, so please anybody feel free to speak up.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;You can also put it in the chat box, if you want to shake we can come back and see what comments have been made, yes awesome.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;You can do that.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. We might have some shy people.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Should don't. don't worry i'm very passionate calling names, so I may pick some random guys just to you know, like. I kind of asked you questions i'm just kidding yourself don't worry about that feel free to speak of, and you, you want to so, but then. The idea of this particular meeting is having a informal discussion with you and understanding your perspective, we just don't want to be, you know, like another speaker going on and kind of just talking is, we want to have a dialogue rather than monologue. So agenda, I just go through the onion nearly complete, we will talk about the kids program what we are doing and how we have done so far and. Like it's a great thing for us, we have been recognized why our mentorship Program. Internationally, we have national mentor and mentee relationship we have a we have mentored so many people, and we have set up fast experience like Doug. lauren said he he runs his own mentorship of farm and he has mentored a lot of leaders who are actually coming in our country in the. high positions and he is such a wonderful networking, you know what vote and what now like does not our word for some when somebody is is kind of making their carrier of. Because it's always good to have knowledge but experience tell you okay these decision work for me, maybe two time cheese, maybe it's not productive that sharing or tech perspective always help you. In second again mentor and mentee what does you know we from kiss protective orders mentoring and mentor means, then, what kind of timeline we're looking for who can be. Who can take part in this program and, at the end up is again open forum, please don't be shy, we will check check the chats also so feel free to write your life of questions or the chat. So. Maria to you wanted to slide so they can actually give some. background on the gift Program.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;mentorship there, I also wanted to mention, we have a few. comments in the chat box and Doug if you're more if you want to check some of the comments I will check if you're comfortable answering some of them, you can, and I think Doug can i've been where you might want to add some more comments. Sure sure the mentoring program started in 2018 and that was thanks to our public appointee board member Doug Lawrence. We happen to lucked out when he was appointed, and that was his background and. kept the schedule and decided to launch a mentoring program to give back to our Members. But we also noticed that some of our students probably would have been interested in it as well, and even though you're not in the workforce, yet. what many of you may have had jobs during the summer or you know may have jobs during the school year and it's kind of hard to identify. Who a mentor is what a mentor should be doing or how they should be exchanging conversations, the relationship between a mentor and the mentee. And I think when we're younger it's like we're being told what to do and how to do it, whether it, whereas a mentor. You share your thoughts you share your challenges the mentor shares their experience and so that's an exchange of conversation. And we're finding that we have that even in the workplace, even with people who have been in the workplace for over 20 years and have had lots of experience, they may not have had a mentor they don't have to work in your field, either because what you're looking for is some you know. Just shared experiences or learning from someone else has been in the workforce, or has had challenges with. You know, in other fellow employees or in the workplace, so I think that. it's been very successful since we started we've also as Pacheco alluded to, we have international members so number of years ago sketching immigration nominee Program. made it mandatory that the kips designation would be part of the immigration process since then we've had to we've had many international members. who've come to us and wanted to be part of the mentorship program so that they can learn more about Canadian culture Canadian businesses what's expected what's not expected and again just to share experiences and learn from us. And the program runs from September to June so we're kind of late and getting to you guys this year, but with your membership as. A student and their last year of this program you're able to remain an active member with kip saskatchewan and you can join the mentorship program at any time, and so you can just let us know if you're interested. Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you, my friend, thank you and I just wanted to highlight that's a very like good points which you have put in like a difference between the mentorship and coaching how a second you know, like. You kind of doing the coaching is more kind of feedback and kind of teaching maybe you know I kind of more. More in terms of teaching or that they're teaching mentoring coaching that they're very is norms for everybody and database 10 line between where you actually cause. So, and the idea is actually to kind of have your to basically the mentorship, in my view, is kind of sit on a covering your idea is to have your. be successful know is kind of whatever you decision you take, whether it's there's nothing right and wrong is all about kind of. telling you Okay, this is, this is something which I have seen this is something which I have maybe you have read you know, maybe I have. You know they experienced our effort towards it so it's kind of sharing the good to mindy what mentor has perspective to an idea is to have this more successful normally. you're you're you know the kind of life and teaching becomes you know you have. Reading about a subject, maybe a yard you kind of reading about how to be good at SAP Oracle or or any salesforce.com. or any of those stats but it becomes a teaching that you kind of doing a particular teaching, then the coaching is in the middle of a you actually have. You you want to be a i'm just giving example of these system because i'm from that background, so. You want to be a consultant and Oracle functional or maybe SAP function or Sep technical or whatever line you choose so that to be that person you kind of have the coaching you know. To be be be prepared for that for so it's very telling and actually goes hand in hand and one person can play multiple roles. In in your life so it's not your teacher can be your coach and mentor so it's nothing that your your teacher cannot be your coach and mentor, this is not is how far you. And relationship goes really long is not a short time short term. goal like very you actually you know it's not something when you're done with your schooling you leave your mentor there, and whoever you have chosen your mentor in the school in time. know your mentor relationship with course for life and sometimes I have my longest mentorship relationship with I have is 20 years so. That is something which still stay and be a student Dutch sometimes some years it's less some years more but yeah if there is still in does that's that's what one of them, moving to the next. piece now again I was always already are touching base on how the mentor and mentee relationship box so far. Our mentorship program in terms of skip, we have to be they have to be current members escaped us numbers and. You know you will say okay why gifts program is accessible to what I have seen and i'm fed is. Why, we are have been successful in this this area, and this mentorship program to call them, the experience of Ross expediency good so. If you when you actually see the, the total number of experience, so if you if you're talking about number experience in terms of mentor committee. Maybe i'm just maybe you know, like 10% plus minus, we will have at least 100 years of experience sitting on Ted that slide I showed you. mentorship Community like Maria has like 20 years or 30 years like Doug has to maybe wouldn't 25 to 30 years so and then josh me everybody's coming with average 2025 years experience so all six of. You know all four of us, including has ended year of experience, and when you combine that henan European towns boss because. there's a difference in knowledge, but you gave and there are some differences experience experience cannot be replaced anywhere, so you. Those things you see things, who died, is that is the reason which I personally feel why gifts membership program is catch when membership Program. Successful and has always been in my other people because experience and loss of connectivity of network of the book, who had seen so much. Are there like we have a board member traveler who's says power, and we have like bev so all others are who are leaders in their sectors, who are actually working across and you have international Members who actually have a. very vast number of experience, and I am myself as a mentee i'm learning at each time if for some I may be playing the role of mentor as for some I am on Monday, who am I learning every day so yeah. So again, this just sum up all there you can go ahead and feel free to read them again mentee you need to be skipped Member so that's something which, if you are your friends few that you want to you know, encourage somebody to be in that arena than one of the requirements is to. Have membership of the script. Again and again it's a two way relationship, both from both sides, so is you, placing the trust because trust trust is very important, you have to trust someone sometimes. The dissonance or maybe you know, like things we shared, you may not know a lot of background, and you know, like, I may have feeling, so you do we have a trust on each other to kind of go with that. So this is, this is the idea and then again it commitment. We are committed, Maria has been committed are two gifts and dog and others, like so many people will be committed to making this successful made sure we can help whoever we can and i'll sharing our thought process with you guys is something I feel is a blessing for us. On this anybody I Doug ellin Susan or my you want to add anything before we move forward or anybody audience anybody would want to share some. points will be will be move forward.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;i'm good with this.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I will ask our attendees. Would they they want to share their. thought process if what they as a mentee because, like if you are an idea, what do you want to see what are you looking for. Anybody. Are. Like please feel free to let me see if I can.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;See one.Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;awesome so Doug Doug has also provided this perspective of personal and professional. bias and with that i'll share the experience right, so I have changed multiple companies and whenever you resign from company there's two types of people. Like one who feel very bad that you're leaving them and you kind of leave the company and you're like, why are you actually doing that and. Now they'll they'll try to make you work and all those things and other other person who actually see the happy for it, they won't say Okay, are you. There are more concerned, whether you are taking the right decision and you're carrying. Wherever you're going so they will try to not discourage you from me, but from try to understand whether you are taking right decision which will make you, and if they feel that this is the right decision to say yeah go ahead and you know. Good to that bus, so that you can actually go much, much further in your in your career journey. So those are the mentors you want to always are fine and kind of stick with because those are the people who always note in terms of your successful story and where you are being successful like Oh, my first job back in 2002. I like and i've been there and I was. Like I, as I said, I have a European data and they were updating er they were doing an implementation and implementation and back into them to. In India, it was not that common of a yuppie still it was still have like a very sought out like today was you have Apps at that time. It was crp so I found a mentor who actually said Okay, no, you should focus on which areas which will make your carrier, you know which areas and a certain time, he said okay in this organization, where you are. If there's already been 10 people who actually looking at finance, so you don't want to go that area, as you should focus on supply chain, because there's only one or two people since you're already fresh. You know, you can actually move to you know those things you this okay Maybe you can actually pursue some tactical for because there's something so those kind of small our. Guidance, which actually helped me and i'm still in touch with that person is still thought, yes, so David David said what i'm looking for that with someone. She tried to get into feel make the right decisions. If that makes sense. Yes, definitely because from I know from a student perspective, the most important thing is getting the right job and also helping you get a job and that's why it's important for you to kind of have someone kind of have a discussion where you want to take your career. What what what exactly your strengths are you know which which area is actually you know you feel their credit, because when you actually doing a job interview, can you speak about that with passionately, because I do a lot of. pressures hiding from Einstein young, so I know we always when we take the interviews from from the students be more more look tend to look in the software soft skills, rather than you know, like. of technical skills, because from from from the screen perspective, what exactly you are good at, so the discussion goals on how what were you articulated. So if I asked you a question, then, based on your answer those discussion will go so it's important to know what they are you standing which areas, you are good at which area is also have your interest.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Somebody saying.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;share value i'm just needing it out. Yes, yeah well it a feedback is also very good, so, as you know, like. Give a positive feedback and also feedback, as you know, like. Feedback la I tell you once i'm so i'll give you example on the feedback so there's there's no like the quality feedback it's like when I was. Around seven eight years back, I was new to us, and I was doing you know I kind of I was doing a project, where we are responsible for checking the revenues and I like cleared an excel sheet for them to have their. numbers of vetted by the CFO and what are the client who's working what he actually kind of. told me that Oh, can you wish I can you actually send me this numbers and can you use, you should have it and go ahead and send it to me. So what I did, because I was new to company and I thought okay if trying disaster me I should go ahead and you know, like I should share that with the client good that you know that's what i'm here to do so, I went ahead and share that. Like the working accelerating and then. Next week I got a feedback that I should whenever we're doing some work, we should always review it internally. So it was a very positive feedback my manager came to me and say okay i'm sure you did put up at the I snore there's there's some mistake, there is still working is great, but it was not client ready so from my perspective. I want to make sure that going forward this time that's Okay, you have done it as we're done, we can always take care of it but going forward nature anytime the client asked you. We do have our internal checks in the reviews the as a team has to be saying Okay, this is good, this is good for our client to be. Seen or, for instance you're you're you're predicting on your end you're actually creating a project group project your professors is your client. So you want to make sure your for people who are in group are everybody senior did i'm totally fine with that output and that's when you actually shared it with your. Professor who actually said Okay, you know this is this looks good rather than one person thinking of professional saying Okay, can you just. Show me what you're working on, and you know, without concerning because you don't know what other where other people are thought process. So you just share with them and then other piece, we are not ready so that's always very good so do we have been dealing with mental question about that anymore, I think they're asked to do things yes. Yes, I have, and I tell you the example so. The normal example is the dog i'm just giving my example you know turn yeah we are a professional services firm, so we do lot of. Like building to the client and time and a lot of you know, so we have we have a strict. strict guidelines ethical guidelines, you have to be we do audits so and we have a reputational like you know things to provide and there are certain cases where people. You know they tell you to do stuff which is not in line with the you know our company policies or company guidelines which you are, you have been trained on. So at that time I I what I have always done, as well as politely tell them that no I think i'm uncomfortable with this and I will not take me to you know from dead. is true is like you know there's a lot of people, and then you have to so I always say Okay, if you have something do you mind emailing me. Or that because a lot of time he will say oh let's, let us do you know do do it. Like why don't you actually do it, and you know go ahead and performed his activity and now it's Okay, the policies are just for paper or or anything it's just lucky, but no. I personally believe that nothing is on paper, if if you feel it's not come comfortable, you should say no. I know you should hear your concern with whoever you're working with because it's always know like it is not advisable to be a yes person. is always good to be someone who actually can say no, and I have learned in the seminary in my initial days by manage to complete it, why you always say yes to every everything said no, you the value comes, then you can say no, and you have a reason behind that know. So yeah so anytime you feel ethical dilemma, I know, make sure you actually whatever you're comfortable with if you know it no, this is not a policy, this is not ethical. And you should press you know, like your concerns to the right person and also, we do have obligations and report certain you know ethical. dilemma, so if you feel if you there's you know you're seeing some activity which is not good, so you as a person, you should report if it's not in ethical dimension, because how would anybody else know otherwise. Because if you if that's not ethical, which is going on, and if you if you as a spectator does not inform about that medical practice then it may, it may go into rapid It made it. So it's always advisable to you know kind of raise your concerns and in an appropriate manner, you don't have to be you know barging in and kind of making sure you. concerned with your mentor saying how best way, I should like raise it because, again there's different personality types intimate like where the sophistication of a working relationship, you have a lot of things, but yes, you should always do that does that answer your question there. I was considered it does add but yeah any other questions. Am I still available to everybody, or no. just want to make sure.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;awesome so please.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;shop.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good microphone muted, so I.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;don't know issues stay. awesome so yeah we can hear you do I, like this Thank you so much, David and loud so eligibility I move forward to this eligibility for mentorship program you guys already know it, I already. Know like in a spoke about it too many times and I think you also have had a previous session with our escape members in you know dollar bills, you know more than what I do. So yeah it's great in you know and share with your friends or you know other students, if you want to take part of you know, take part in this thing, there is, you can always refer to that that to Maria and. that's has been how they can be bought off if they asked already not escape number or they're not even they they're not us our students yeah. So. Now, now, this is the best slide which I would say so now here the time when I will open the forum and i'll give a 32nd pause for you guys to speak up or or write something whatever you're comfortable with so that we can actually discuss those rather than you know. doing a monologue. To or floor is open, now, this is the. Is David going.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;So, just a quick question I was wondering if you could. kind of give us. A quick overview of how to get into the mentorship program just a quick one.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, oh. My. That or do you want me to run through.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;into that for you, you can take a break and have a drink of water, if you need. Thanks thanks David so if you're in an eclipse accredited program which I believe you are in right now. than it was it's as simple as sending us an email and letting us know that you want to be in the mentorship program and I would send you an application and you complete it, and then we would match you. In cases where we don't have a mentor available I would let you know that, and then we would just put out a call out for mentoring. candidates.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;gotcha Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Oh you're welcome awesome. Also, as a third year student or the last day or is everyone in their last year on this call or not.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No okay good varies quite a bit.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so in your last year of the. CS program you are eligible to be a student Member at no cost, and in that year in that timeframe, you can apply to be a mentor or mentee. And that's for all students coming from this program in the last year. If that computer just send me an email. And I can chat with you so.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Maria it's Doug I just saw him, one of the other options we could offer for when we're short on mentors is, we can provide them access to a mentoring circle.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Doug great. So if everybody on this call is interested in doing something like that Doug send quite a few of them so i'm sure he'd love to host another one. Darrell you can let us know.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;What is that what would that involve he tell us a bit more about it.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so a mentoring circle what I typically i'm running them every second Saturday and we're doing them virtual but what it is, is it's instead of having everyone matched with a mentor you have two or three mentors that facilitate a group discussion. And it can be you know it's about all things mentoring is typically what we do, but you can get into the. You know, into the personal and professional development of an individual or a group of people, and what we end up doing is we learn from those that are in the group, so it becomes that collaborative approach to to to learning.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thanks awesome.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So yeah I think I think that's a great idea, and that will be like it would be great learning from. The matrix in that ways we can cover a bit bigger portion and if there's more than based on based on how you actually go work you actually do one to one mentoring, because it is not that mentoring is about Okay, if I have, I am good at something and just have to be. Like mentor have asked with someone who's actually in my area is only as as as long as the broader. idea in Texas story connects, as you can always find those metrics mentoring circles also very good kind of see your learn from your peers and colleagues or students or themselves and learn from their stories. On below cushion the volunteer opportunity we are working on that, so we will definitely come back to you, once we have laid out upon we are thinking about kind of. Having some water create an opportunity where we can actually give you some some experience and they might kind of get you more connected to gifts, so that that's something which we are working in background. awesome see and then Maria is the best person to reach out, and you can reach out to us as well, so feel free to connect with us so and we will be happy to answer your questions any of them. Any other questions, since we asked the. Are there's no more slide for me to kind of go over and kind of speak about so any other questions you want to or. And again i'll tell you my story, so I I was basically working in us up for last eight years and then, when in US I got connected to like someone in my organization in Canada and I was having a good mentor relationship with that. You know, like that person, and we were in touch and there was opportunity where they were looking for a person to have of my my experience and they asked if I would be interested in I said yes, why not, so I took that. Decision and kind of moved, you know to Syria and that time of when I was taking their decision i'll tell you it is not that. I took that decision, because it wasn't it wasn't What do you say. I when I was in bad position or no, no, I have to take the decision I was really good I was progressing everything, but then this a good option and. And the great opportunity came in, so I discussed with that her than you know okay what it would be for long term what we will better for me know. Week, because in both both part goes to right now right direction, both are good, so now have a choice to walk into two different part, maybe you know, like. Google myself and either I can actually progress in us keep keep practicing us or I can actually be in Canada, so when I was talking to her and she she thought okay in ocala is great, I must have been international. Movement and and all of the law of a student who who would be similar and all of a sudden, who actually are from the local area. You know who had been from scratch and always so so I decided Okay, maybe moving to Canada right decision and. My time out for my carrier and for long term, and I can do the network, and I am happy about that CNN i'm actually very glad that she. helped me take that decision when I was you know in dilemma, or what to do so, definitely that that is the role of which a matter of place. So any any other questions before I I can actually add more studious us issue, but I want me to answer specific questions for you, rather than sharing, something which may only be relevant for you. everybody's okay anybody has a question. We have a we're winding up at I think 1215 so feel free to ask you, questions and i'll be happy to answer that for you.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;You can also share your questions in the chat box yes. Since he knows me the word kidding i'll share my.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;story, so I have also done a PhD in the area, so when I was doing a PhD at that time, like when I taught not I was doing I really thought of doing a lot of people actually said okay why you were doing a pst why you know. Why, you want to like first up is why don't you actually do an MBA like that is more bid and more like stuff. And then I had certain things in mind, I have my I have done my own calculation, I went to him and I said Okay, you know. What what should I do should I actually go for PhD which. is definitely difficult I don't know whether i'm leaving to complete it, because a lot of people are already is discouraging me that you know or just not a great bar, you may not able to finish it. Is takes a long time, and you know, like all sorts of things and you'll it will not be that grateful and then to me is definitely a you know much vetted route everybody knows once you're doing MBA good basement and. You get so and the person does not have any idea what vcs which is not that that is that was his. idea, he and neither he has done MBA so he was sort of shake out from my perspective. Again, both are good, you know, like, if I have actually look at it from the outside, both looks to be a good area again. majority is definitely I will go smooth majority i'll say NBC for now and bsd is kind of you know at 20 20% only. Successful so but I would ask the question, what do you want to do, and then he said okay tell me convince me. Why, I should say yes for you to do business, then we had a good discussion of one hour and then, finally, he said yeah it looks to me that, even though after do this can look to me, you are kindness, if you are convinced, then go ahead and i'm with you. Then our MAC because the idea was to kind of whether you're able to the end of the journey and he said yes huge based on our discussion I feel you're ready, and you can. Take the journey of going through a bsd and you can complete it, and then he said yeah move forward with that, so I have moved ahead and completed a lot of. My friend, we were kind of surprised that yo we because they are the one who actually saying discouraging me that Oh, this is very long why you're doing that. Part so that is important role of mentor mentor may not know where you actually heading. You know, like very, very you are not where you want to go, he may not know if you want to work with tesla not everybody works with tessa right so not everybody has worked with. If you want to work with mobile and Google, not everybody, but to understand, to help you Okay, whether you are convinced, you are ready to be on that journey that is something which mentors job is to help you take the decision. To make sure that you in the long run, whatever I do like you know decision you're taking that makes sense to you. That you know, to show that whole whole big picture end to end picture, when you actually talk about not just a one piece. Whether it makes complete sense in thread 30 years when you will your profile when you pull your resume it. Is that, as you may have a person who you who you want to be in 30 years, whether it's a mosque weather is you know the project. Whether it's you know any any CSE I see your CIO or will will, are you inspired to be so, the idea is in that 30 years for next from now two or 35 years can you be that. Can you please, if not be that at least close to that our journey, so that is the better, you know, like goal is to help you. guide you through that process and give this year in design is always out in the field, but at least give the perspective. So with that. Any other questions I know we are already. Beyond over Prescott times so. So do you so let Okay, let me ask you do you feel this is this condition was useful. So if If yes please raise your hand I see someone doing it, so I use one you know, yes, I have one or he is so please, I want to see how many hands are raised to see if it's if it's useful or not. Because I know you and you're shy, and you know, like you, don't want to speak, and if you have if you feel that Okay, this is something which you want to do it. A personal your you have a personal question, something which you don't want to share with the group, you know the via here i'm here so yeah. This is good to know that a lot of people feel that way, so thank you so much for raising your hand because we don't want to do that, that if you don't like it and we come in and we can. kind of go ahead and. do the same thing again, but with your doctor you on that whole thing, so you want to do something which works for you and that's, that is the reason I was asking questions like tell me what do you feel that is what you seek out a mentor so yeah. So.

In the chat about the presentation today and together days. yeah yes so i'll give you 24 hours to do the. To do the questions to do the exam. Okay, so it'll still be doable in the three hour time window sure anything's possible. The idea was to give you. Okay, so I got a direct message here, and then in the. In the chat so please avoid doing that, if you can just send it again send it to me. Not to me, but to everybody. Whether. we're not doing proctor crack. we're not. Okay, so now let me. So, in terms of what kinds of questions. We primarily write a blog style entry. On a topic that you're given at the start of the exam period. Now. i'm open to your suggestions for exam for top question topics for questions.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;hey Darrell. I just have a another question in that same line of thinking, so I guess my input to your question would be. I think blog one was handled really well like pick a topic from the list of topics that we have and choose one from there, I really like that idea. And I also just wanted to ask if the timing of this, so I see a lot of chat saying it might start on Monday and then continue to the Tuesday date, or are we starting to standing going to Wednesday thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No okay so i've tried to be clear about that. The the closing time for the exam as a closing time for the exam that will start. Early. Start Monday at 5pm.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thank you i'm just gonna make a note of that, on my calendar.

    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;it's going to be write a blog style entry question. and Maybe one or two other shorter questions.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, is there anything that oh. Is there anything that we have. The from like anything that we can. Make useful to study on from. Our like just it will be something pretty much like a discussion forum.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. things we talked about during this to master our will will focus on. So. I i'm. i'm working on making sure that all the all the transcripts and summaries are available. I think i've got most of them are there might be one or two that are missing still. So I would say that. that those are the. Things to study the resources listed there and the discussion we've had in class.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;hey Professor sorry just. Just one more question. Sure, I was wondering if once we're done this discussion, if, before the test begins, if you could. Put the details of the exam like what it's going to be on stuff like that either in an email or as opposed on your courses, so that way, if anyone forgets any of this they'll have that information that clears things up. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, I can do that.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;awesome Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;um when it comes to your expectations on the blog portion of the exam will they be similar to the blog. itself assignments that we did like will you be marking them the same.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;same. Expectations are similar yes. And i'm going to be marking the exam.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;So, will we be required to use online sources for the blog portion of the exam like we did in our assignments.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, that's. Certainly possible and encouraged.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;hi.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;hi.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Just one more question that we need to submit in any. Doc file or something like or. PDF or something or it will be on like you, are courses like. exam thing so i'm not sure.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So it will be a your courses squares structure so you'll. you'll see it that way. And it'll you intend to settle us, you have a turn it in assignment.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Okay okay okay you got it, thank you, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. sure you review so look at the materials that are online. Reading details. exam. Certainly, the use of sources are encouraged and they can be links. message. Today at 330. To 430. So I have to apologize, because I. started out with the intent of using discord but. Because i've had computer problems I haven't kept my login. Active all the time. are forgotten to restart it, and so I looked at it yesterday, and I see that there's some quite active discussions which I haven't contributed. To which I haven't contributed so I apologize for that. i'm trying to get through email. as well, so if you have. Questions about marks on assignments and work. i'll do my best to get them sorted out before the exam. But I will definitely get them sorted out before the final marks are in place.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;hey Darrell I just had another question again on the project, so if we're doing a research paper and we're talking about it, and our topic is kind of lengthy. I saw an arbitrary limit of 1000 1500 words on the the page if we go over that by some margin is that Okay, or is that a hard limit of 1500 and nothing else.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I would say. it's a suggestion. But at the same time, if you're gonna write twice as much. That might be a little bit of a. I wouldn't encourage you to do twice as many do double the size thinking it's twice as good.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Definitely not trying to like blow blow it up, which is wordy paragraphs, but I mean if the content is still there and the content is still fresh, then, are you okay with that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks a bunch.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I will. I will provide as much detail as possible about the way the exam is going to work. i'm. I will have it set up tomorrow earlier in the day, so you should see it on the list of upcoming events. The exam I mean. swinging for more awesome thanks. And you're not waiting for more, but just. noticing it. anyway. it's been a long day already. For me, but that's I mean that's not a not a complaint. So i'll be around during the exam. If there are. issues that come up. I will do my best to help you resolve them. So Can somebody provide. The password. cuz i'm stuck on a direct message again. So I hope this semester you've had the opportunity to think critically. develop your critical thinking skills and ask. Important questions about not not only of how to do things, but why we should do them. And I appreciate.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;WE HAVE another guest from CIPS for the first part todays :-)
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;email: daryl.hepting@uregina.ca
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Good Morning!
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Good Morning

    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Hi professor, Are you going to have office hours today?
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I can not record myself
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;it is fixed!
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Attendance password anyone?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;vfalvf
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;vfalvf
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;vfalvf
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Attendance is done?

    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;I've always considered mentoring to be more like, "learn by watching me, ask questions" whereas coaching is more about instruction, benchmarking, feedback, etc.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I'd say mentoring is kind of like having someone to go to for guidance about a specific subject, that will also teach you about how to work on said subject properly
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Coaching is more formal, comparatively, where you only get training from that person
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;That's my perspective, anyways
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Id say good coaches are considered mentors
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Mentoring is defined as a two way trusted relationship where both the mentor and mentee will learn and grow together on a personal and professional basis
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;What I'd be looking for in a mentor is someone who could offer guidance as to how to get into a field, make the right career decisions, and how to be an effective employee in said field - if that makes sense
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks David, yes that makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;I personally learn by example and through hands-on stuff so I would need a mentor that shares my values and would trust me to do things with them. I also need one who can give good feedback (including positive feedback) so that I know where I need to improve but I also know what I'm successful at.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;A good mentor is a story teller and shares their lived experiences with the mentee through story telling.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Do mentors (here) have experience in dealing with mentees’ questions about the ethical dimensions of things they are asked to do/consider?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;yes you're good
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yup! We can hear you Abhishek
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Keep in mind we are done at 12:15.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;almost me
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Is there any volunteer opportunities in CIPS during this spring and summer? Next year is my last year.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Bilal, our volunteer opportunities are sitting on committees. If you are interested please send me an email. executive.director@sk.cips.ca
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;thank you so much!
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Your welcome and it was our pleasure.

    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;its always interesting hearing stuff like that
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Tbh it's a little early to think about for me, I'm in year 2 lol. I'll keep that stuff in mind though for 4th year
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;It was cool, I'll definitely be looking into that when I'm closer to graduating
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;So Monday 5pm to Tuesday 5pm, instead of Tuesday 2-5pm
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;It would still be doable in a 3 hour time window though, correct?
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;I feel if these presentations were done earlier in the semester, there would have been more time to look into it
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;So it’s one essay type question
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;What kind of questions will be on the final
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;What will the format be?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;so what is pattern going to be like?
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;is it open notes?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Or we have questions like in sample
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry didn’t mean to direct message
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Can we use hypertext references in research paper?
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Is the final open or closed book? Will we be proctored as we write it? Is there any study information we can find?
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;^^^^ Kurtis’ message (that it is doable in a 3-hour window)
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Philip he answered kurits message already
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;so, one we open it should be complete immediately or from Monday 5 pm to Tuesday 5 pm
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;imagine 24 hour proctored exam haha
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;was the attendance code given out at the start of the class?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Literally sleeping haha
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Get reported for cheating
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Shoot. Keegan can you Y/N for me then?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;EH said yes
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;well he said "sure"
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;He said anything is possible lol. I wouldn't recommend leaving it until the last minute though.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;My bad haha, I was under the understanding that we had a 24 hour period to open the exam, but only 3 hours to complete it from the time we opened it
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;He said anything is possible. So I'm assuming that means you might want to allocate more than 3 hours for it lol
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Would it be possible to send us an email with exam information, or make a post regarding the exam on URcourses?
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Long as its doable in 3 hours I'll be fine. Got two exams on Tuesday and one on Monday
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;^Kurtis
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;what time is exam?
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;Starts at 5:00pm Monday
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;Ends 5:00pm Tuesday
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;5pm to 5pm, from Monday to Tuesday respectively.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds like we'll get the question/prompt on Monday at 5 and then we'll have until 5pm on Tuesday to hand it in
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;so basically 24 hour exam, nice
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;How should we review？
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;So we’ll use the same type of hypertext references as we did for Blog 1 and Blog 2 ?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;I mean depends if you got a good mark or not
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;If you did id assume yes if not maybe dont
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;did he reply this question already?     Can we use hypertext references in research paper?
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;So we review assignment only or you have other material can give us
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;A pdf or post on UR courses with final exam information in detail would extremely help with helping us prepare
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;Very appreciated Daryl! :)
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Awesome, thanks
