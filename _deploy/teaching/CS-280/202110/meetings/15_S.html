<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So back in a bit of white today after. Taking it was maybe spring was coming too early. seem to be proven right. how's your weekend.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Good.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It was okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good. So the first thing I want to talk about is. Details of the. presentation on the 24th from. The alumnus from NASA jpl. I don't like. So many times and everything. Facebook event. 15 or 20 people register on. The zoom link so far so. You want to go ahead and do that. No pressure, of course. To promote this. Let me just show you the rest of the description. So, Dr Larry Matthews, to the dispatcher science here in 79. or completed his bachelor of science in 79. Is. NASA jpl. Where his job allows into personally participate and putting robots and other planets like perseverance on Mars. The public lecture series by alumni and friends of the product computer science, please be sure to register in advance. So this actually is a link, even though there's a few cards in it. So the perseverance Mars Rover line is in general creator or you can see from orbit that it river floated to the crater which hilda lake and adult is formed at the mouth of the river. mission of perseverance, is to explore the around the delta to improve our understanding of these ancient climate and to examine the possibility of life or precursor molecules evolve their. Rover also acquire set of samples and lead information that the US and Europe plan to send back. Send send later this decade to bring back the samples to earth. sequence admissions is called a small sample return campaign. perseverance also carries a small helicopter called ingenuity, which is intended as a technology demonstration of the first heavier than air aircraft ever to attempt played on another planet. Electrical give a brief introduction of Mars exploration and these mission. So the both him and then. So. If you see less if you choose to see less than you get nothing. fits into the. First. Page. long enough to trigger the see less. You can look at. Some of the details of his work, if you like. mars.nasa.gov. So the title is a bit longer. Good Facebook forced me to use hundred characters including. His name, so all included, so we came up with it, this ever shorter title, which probably is a better thing anyway, but. So if I wanted to spread the word about this, what other social platforms. places, would you suggest, I put it. Facebook account is unnecessary here, let me just. Okay. So i'm curious about Okay, so I understand discord and instagram. Wherever we're on stack overflow. Ensure. That being. A destination for. event postings or information. Okay well fair enough. So. What kind of. go under, China. So what i'd like to. target is a little bit for. A local audience, so people who are around region in the university. yeah so we're gonna put on the your guns counter so. that's true, we can put it on your courses. Well, I think I can. So I was thinking of sending. an email today to see students at. Everyone on the. account. i'm a little nervous. Because I may not. nervous, since my experiences Twitter. I love it wouldn't want to. yeah okay. So there's a vote for me not worry about reddit so i'm happy to take that advice. Okay. I guess I would. Okay tick tock. that's another one that i'm not going to touch, I think. snapchat. support. chatters diverge from. discussion here. linkedin. who's on linkedin. Okay. And the news this weekend i'm not sure exactly when it happened, but I saw it on the weekend. It was about. Anyone heard of a weave the social project social fabric project from the Aspen Institute. Is the website. yeah. So, the reason I made the news was because. there's a columnist for the New York Times, who was being paid as a columnist for the New York Times. But did not make clear that he was also being paid by the Aspen Institute. and The Aspen Institute is funded by Facebook so nonprofit. So here's the description, as we, the social server project, you have a crisis of connection in this country, people are isolated. and seen and in Warren camps social distressed in isolation underlie our most pressing problems from continuing to racial and economic justice to political gridlock and epidemic of loneliness rising deaths from suicides and directs. The stress keeps us from tackling issues like poverty homelessness hunger and climate change we've supports the many Americans in every community are working to create social trust and we've neighbors together to strengthen our communities. nonprofit organization, so I guess it's all normal. well. In a sense that. there's some philanthropy going on. Sometimes grab the MIC on. i'm just gonna. mute everybody you're free to unmute yourself. As required. Okay, so it's not about encouraging philanthropy but maybe it's encouraging. it's a question of. whitewashing, so to speak. The activities of. These groups are these companies. Facebook and Amazon can both give. money to worthy causes but. Is that distract from their own. Core. yeah better than bad behavior is odd. To be here without anything else to go with it. yeah. i'm. watching the documentary on Lincoln so he's not quite as. he's a bit more pragmatic then. idealistic, I suppose, it seems. yeah okay so. let's see incentive well. it's the question of is there a right or. wrong way to do things. Perhaps. And maybe it's just a. call for more regulation, more. legislation. Okay, so I appreciate the conversation going on in the chat and I don't want to. diminish it, but I also don't want to just. couldn't. Read the chat with all of you. So thinking about the theme that I proclaimed for today rights and responsibilities. So we have. We don't want to diminish. The company's rights to right to make. A profit. To get a return for their shareholders. Then the other question is. Do they have responsibilities at the same time, and what are those. Talk about rights and responsibilities in a different way. here. So i'm looking at the Wikipedia page for claim rights and liberty rights. celebrity claim. is one where we have to where we require. behavior and support from. Other others to enforce it. So claim right is a rate that and which entails responsibilities duties or obligations and other parties regarding the right holder. So if I have a claim right, I could say that I have a claim right. For. Other people to not kill me. And that's compared to liberty rights, which is. isn't about what other people do what I can do. The freedom. that I have. The freedom that doesn't impinge on anybody else I have the freedom to. To. drink coffee her my favorite mug. The freedom to choose which month. Are you. So claim right. Really relates, the responsibility of others. So if I have, if I have a liberty to speak. speak about my feelings. about a subject. I speak freely on a subject, and I also. If I, if I have raised as a liberty right. Then. there's a claim rate that says. Other people need to respect. My right to speak freely. Miranda rights. In the States. I believe. Yes, Sir, I remain silent and so forth. So that would be. The elements of both because you know, the right to not say anything but then. you're also. Putting on to the. Law legal authorities that. The requirements that they. Not. do anything untoward. The face of your. you're free. To not say anything. seems to me that. there's. Elements of both. kinds of rights and lots of things that we encounter. Not a straightforward thing. Somebody. Wanting to speak or turn the microphone on by.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;mistake.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So let's think about. rights and responsibilities in terms of Wikipedia. So we might have a right to. Encourage to. write articles about. What else what are. The topics we. know which were passionate. So we have the freedom to choose a topic. If we're going to participate in the Wikipedia community, then we need. Also to. uphold the standards so. This is a. This is a header that can be put in by editors I believe. see this article needs additional citations for verification, please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. And so I satirical may be challenged and removed. So that's been here for a while it looks like 2011. lens of claim rights and liberty rights. How do we view. Do we have online. How about let's make a question for breakout room. yeah so there's. Stories I don't know what that one in particular, but there are stories with people who have become. fairly high ranking members of the. editor so 40 pedia. And they were found out that they were not. found out to them, not be who they claim to be and so. That brings into question. enterprises are not vetting. candidates and vetting information properly. On what r. return. Wikipedia is a good place to start and not a good place to finish. So okay great good room question, what are your rights responsibilities online and upon what do they depend is that. sufficiently. Concrete to. Have a discussion. Okay, so i'm going to make up for. groups now. And then we'll take 10 minutes and then we'll. Come back at 1230 to discuss. time for good discussion. Okay, so anyone want to tell me what they talked about. or share with the group what was discussed in your breakout room. Okay, can you tell me more about the right to protect yourself online. So is it what's. The question discuss does anyone actually have responsibilities online.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;People or users have responsibility to share the correct information and do their due diligence protect facts and not just share. misinformation and lies. Sometimes they're hard protect what people should have our expect that responsible behavior from other users. Who. That information against.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Being truthful. So, in terms of. see what what. So if. greater responsibilities as individual depends on. The developers. So what are the. Well, what are reasonable rates, the responsibilities of. developers as a platform providers to. engage with the population yeah go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I would just kind of ask why i'm we would have specific responsibilities or rights defined at all because, like these are basically based off morals and each individual's morals are different it's different globally cross culturally. So how do we define like what's right and wrong for everybody versus. As an individual.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;that's.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Certainly, a question, but we have a. Declaration of Human Rights from the UN. mean, so there are examples where we come to agreements beyond. The scope of our individual. or individual. model campuses, so to speak. So if. If online were. Dealing with people from different cultures and different groups. Then needs to wait for us to. communicate respectfully. And if we don't have a way to communicate respectfully then we get. The polarization. which seems endemic on social media platforms. So, in answer your question, how do we, how can we define something. I think that the, the answer is what happens if we don't define something. some common ground. with which we can work. And we're. And we're going to. be in a much more difficult place. So i'd encourage everyone to. See the social dilemma, if you can, if you have access to. The documentary. And people have seen it already. So I just encourage you, because it's interesting and thought provoking. presentation. it's called the social dilemma so netflix. So. It features people from the Center for humane technology and that's the link tonight right, the other day. anyway. Simple as. You know. printing. Always. Having the responsibility. to publish things that are well cited. Alright, that. can be supported by reliable sources. and taking care of. not spread false hits. It is a big issue and when social media platforms are interested in. Adding things go viral and encouraging activity on their platforms. and call Center lot more lucrative in terms of monetization on the platforms. So what about privacy or we consider privacy is a right. And the responses are the elements of responsibility to that as well. So one thing about privacy is. That allows us to do is have some agency over our. lives and the. And the way that our. story that we share our own story with others and with the world. So, if everything that we do. Well, both good and bad is. Online then we can't. Make it we don't we don't lose the ability to make decisions about. What things to. sharing with whom to share them. I think that's an important. aspect as well. Okay, so now, you can say that. There are privacy settings that can be applied. or they meaningful, in the sense that. in the sense that. clear what to do to achieve a certain level of privacy.

    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;where?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;can't see the link
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;link to register
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;The link is on his website
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Under todays lecture
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-280/202110/meetings/15_Tue-09-Mar-2021.html
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;thank you Kurtis
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;is fb account necessary?
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;no

    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Reddit
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Discord
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Reddit is a good one.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;The CSSS discord and instagram pages
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Could always get someone from the CSSS to share it in the discord
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Stackoverflow mayhaps?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah the CSSS discord would seem fitting
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I agreee
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;done
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;link to register: https://uregina-ca.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJYkdemuqjsoHNBOgCAnv4b84GwrZzlT81Es?fbclid=IwAR36d4OQxnAUpeyZbiBUBE8ibfyPAxQUSkzU5miHcGfp34F4P1ViQ882nUU
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I don't know, I was just kidding
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;sure
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;r/space
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Computer Science ?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Robotics
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;NASA
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;If hes targeting U of R students reddit doesn't seem like a good fit, other then maybe r/regina
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;You can add it to URcourses or your website - everyone should be able to access it from there ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;at least everyone from this class!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;you're own personal reddit account and link the event on there
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;the UofR website would probably be the best place to advertise locally and more officially
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Can also see if they'd let you utilize the announcments email through UR Webmail to let other students know about it
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;That would be perfect
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Reddit is pretty pointless if you have a specific audience in mind, especially if there isn't an established community for your target.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Instagram
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;TikTok
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;XD
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;dance the mars preservation away
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;not among the young'uns really ahhaha
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;get a bucket and a mop, that is some wet @$$ planet
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;dear god no
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;oh god, no
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;don't ruin space exploration
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;linked in is great
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;linkedin would be a good idea
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Please receive this politely and respectfully, but I am really tired of discussing this and would like to receive instruction in this class time.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;me
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;No, I haven't heard of that.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Outside of looking at it before this class no
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;That's new to me.
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Facebook funding a project about building trust, great!
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;well amazon supports non profit organizations, so I guess its all normal
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Good step, plenty more to go...
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Better then bad behavior with no beneficial distraction
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;attempting to balance the scales. "but look, we did the thing!"
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;true
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Humans have been doing that for centuries
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Hitler was the first to promote a non-smoking movement
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;He also gave his troops meth
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;war on drugs as you do
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Plus as bad as those companies can be, what is the incentive for them to do anything about it if we give them crap about it anytime they try to make a positive change
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;tax exemption, somehow
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;I mean first of all amazon could just not treat there employees like crap to start? Instead of just throwing money to calm the fire maybe put it out
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;i am but a drop in the ocean but I will take my droplet elsewhere if I don't like that particular ocean
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think the criticism is that if your business model is exploitative by nature, doing superficial things to change things is more of a bandaid or a PR move than an actual good thing.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Right or wrong is impossible on a large scale like that though. Theirs always bad apples.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;A lot of companies do this sort of 'bandaid' cover-up. Bell with Bell let's talk is a good example. Its a little slimy IMO
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry but could some tell me the attendance password think I might have missed it
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;The thing is, that exploitive model has worked for them and now they will not be changing it because it is earning them profits, they are doing all they can to steer away from that and have this fake front where they are doing everything good
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I'd say they certainly have responsibilities, giving employees a safe work environment, living wage, etc. But, if there is nothing to "enforce" it, realistically they don't have any incentive to do so other then "being good". Which, if a company is there to make money, generally will come second
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;what is the miranda rights?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;claim or liberty?
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;none, but slightly liberty
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;I would think that's a claim right on the state for expected behavior when they arrest you.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;"This genocide is incomplete...you can help by expanding it" muhahaha!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;*genocide list
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I would say Wikipedia is a right or a responsibility. Having users who don't know about the subject working on it wouldn't be great for the integrity of the article, and while open access to information is something I think should be a right, practically it isn't.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;there was a story of a 14 year old boy falsely writing up a scottish dialect until he was caought
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I would choose Wikipedia source links over a decade old book
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;as credible as possible ofcourse
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;well in some topics Wikipedia info is manipulated so many times by so many people its hard to trust
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Its a good place to get a base line, but same as everywhere, don't take only one source as the entirety of your knowledge on something
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room; What are your rights and responsibilities online and upon what do they depend?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;you can't just use Wikipedia as a source just like you can't use "the library" as a citation
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;true
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;sure
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;is there no attendance code again?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;there was
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Attendance was posted about 5 minutes into class
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;th26oc
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;yup
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I think so
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think so, we had a decent chat
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Yes!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;you have the right to protect yourself online
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Does anyone actually have responsibilities online?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;don't just sue websites left right and centre for your unsecure behaivor
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think the difficulty with this is that claim rights and liberty rights interact with each other in really unclear ways and it is difficult to regulate them.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;In terms of online anyway.
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Since the internet gives us an access to information it should be our right to make clear informed decisions based on information gathered.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;not to threat anybody else's privacy or security.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;do proper citation? mayhaps
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;We discussed about how the rights and responsibilities of an individual online depends on how the developers implements the system.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;cite from credible sources unlike the Onion
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Onion is a weird example considering they are intentionally satiricle
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;The developers must punish racist ideologies
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Just because there is no jurisdiction doesn't mean we should not have responsibilities
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I love the Onion, they make me practise my online trust of news
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;You could ask the same question for in-person rights, why do we have them if the moral compass of everyone is different?
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;We've also discussed that these rights and responsibilities online should depend and mirror the offline life.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I don't go running around saying my address and my SIN
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yessss that's a great point.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I like that, Daryl
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;We discussed the relationship and precedence between claim rights and liberty rights. Although we have liberty, there is a responsibility that supercedes this. So we have freedom of expression and speech online, but to what extent? We also need to have responsibility and regulation of hate speech, cyberbullying, and so on. So then we need to ask where this regulation comes from/how it will be enforced. Will online speech be regulated by governments, committees of people, or bots, for example? Also, can this regulation even be implemented in the current systems in place, or do we have to redefine and restructure the systems altogether?
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;your sin number is the amount of money you have, how rich are you, xD
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I have, its interesting
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Which documentary, sorry? I missed it.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;The social dilemma on netflix
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Its a great documentary
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I really liked that video on "Remaking the Internet" for that reason, how he talked about how negative stimuli are cheaper.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Honestly that set of videos made me want to throw my phone in the garbage lol
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;what was that quote..."what I want to see is what I will see" something like that...
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;privacy is a right
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Privacy is a civil right
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;We mainly discussed privacy rights in our group.  Given the current state of the internet, I personally think it's safe to assume that you really don't have any privacy rights at all when posting online, or at least theyre being violated.  Basically everything can be tracked or recorded without your knowledge. However, there should be protections to protect privacy rights. Using something like a VPN can be used to help protect yourself, however
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;you can however choose how much privacy you want
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;....one day...
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;I think the user is still accountable to whether how much of their privacy rights they want to give up online
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;+1 Maria
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah, i'm not sure that there is transparency on how those settings protect your information
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;true...
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;do your best to protect yourself regardless
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;often times things are set up with full permissions and you have to go in and change them on your own
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;and if it's hidden in a deep submenu it's difficult for you to find or even know of its existence
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl! Great class.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good, thank you for class Professor :)
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for an engaging discussion today! Have a nice day (:
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Thank!
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl.
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks :)
