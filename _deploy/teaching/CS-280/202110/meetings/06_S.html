<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. how's everyone doing today.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;sleepy.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;sleepy is. An appropriate reaction when it's cold outside. And it's kind of a Gray days well. Not even sunny day in the schedule and Canada sunniest capital city. Even know that about Regina. Any questions or concerns of where we're going so far. Okay here's a question about response. responses and I was going to talk about that as well, so let me. share my screen right away, but. Let me look into that first to answer that question about. necklace I don't see your engagement for meeting five. Can you say. So. The email that didn't get centered and form messages didn't get posted if you still have a text, maybe just included with your response today. would be my suggestion I wouldn't worry about. Having the. Sound so much the idea of having the response for last meeting but. i'm more interested in the ideas. me share my screen with you, first of all. You can see. What i'm doing here. today. So if you find that i'm. At the end of meeting. or whatever the meeting number is and there's no question. posted here. Let me know. Okay, so now let me switch to in case people haven't. I knew, to the idea of doing these responses. And I had a student I was communicating lesson. You seven problems, adding to the response, so let me just go switch to a student here. These are a question and answer. means you have to post something before you see something. For you see anything else, what other people. So the idea is to go click on a response. The discussion here. When you get to this. group reply to this. Once you reply, once you add your own message here. Then you can see other people's responses. For those of you have done this before if I missed anything. clear to everyone. If you miss the password for attendance. I had some problems. I know, last day was a bit of a hack problem because of. snow day can go by without any problems, right. Having said that, here. i'm going to do the password now. she's given me. Permission error, when I try and do something like that, instead of a blank page. Okay. OK.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;OK.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;today's stuff. I wanted to. seem that we're getting. giving me Google responses, so I thought I haven't tried duck duck go. and Now here let's do that, so this is the Google or sponsor. For me. seems like these are the top three sally's baking addiction our recipes and Betty crocker. So here's duck duck go. To PS and teen dot dot dot. Five boys Baker. maybe.com. And chocolate chip cookie. Center cut. co.dot.so those are completely different. And then, following those first three results we get an ad. And then we get another all recipes. very best faking. At cracker. Oh wow chocolate chip cookies are in the news. i'm. kendra cookie pie that's got to be on par with eating it drove me to tell, I think. The tie sounds better. Anyway, so the top results to be different for duck duck go. and check out being. US being.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;accidentally sometimes yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Anyway, okay So here we have the being results. So reading from. This kind of looks like a pinterest thing. Now I don't know whether you should read down the columns or across. The chatelaine has the. best. rated recipe, I think. In terms of positioning and search results. i'm not sure if these are the same. kind of cut offs here. same. or not. So, for that reason i'm going to say that the next one, is this entry COM. stars and 1000 reviews wow that's pretty good. And chocolate chip cookies dinner then dessert. And in 22 reviews five stars. Chocolate chip cookies emails. la times. Chocolate chip cookies for stars 1900 views. So I think we're not talking about chocolate cookies anymore in the chat. yeah the link to the story about Robin Hood. We can talk about shortly. Chocolate chip cookie. chatting. anyway. Okay, so there's that now that me. My page some things I haven't updated on. gave you a couple videos related to design. Any thoughts about. Everyone. For find find the links okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. The previous day. Is cargo shifting to design. In sort of a human computer interaction perspective. This point was because of the. filter bubbles one, but the. Second, one of what what allegation to social media platforms have to the greater good. And how do we think about designing spaces and. As we are. Present and future computer professionals. What what obligation, do we have to think about design. As a public good. yeah so this. is a nice little video of. Norman doors limited to their calls Norman doors after don Norman. You talked about them and so those are the. doors that have. ambiguous controls so. If it's a flat panel, you know what's your I need to push the door open. But official handle that looks like it should be pulled but really need to push. that's that's confusing and that's. that's a problem and that's where the term Norman doors comes from. I remember a cartoon from the far side. really has imagery of school for the gifted and the kid is pushing on the door. Where it seems to be, I think it seems like a. season, a flat powder push, no, no, it is. Anyway, so. he's pushing on the door and this mark Paul. This is one example. That i'll put this video up here. Oh yeah okay so that's a good comment about securities feature. Because in this video as other video but Norman doors there's a scene from a movie about. US being stuck in that room because of the. feature. window.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah good good.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;audio.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;caption. yeah crystal yeah anyway, let me see again, if I can.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Make.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Let me see if that's going to help with the audio.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Professor just a quick question. yeah. So, last week the videos we talked about they were all about social bubbles stuff like that, for example. And this week we're talking about design i'm just wondering, do you think a good tie in, for that would be the power of influence, for example, you're more likely to use something if it's easy to use or a nice to look at.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I was thinking about it from the perspective of happiness.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, fair enough.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. So I think you know, the idea of having influencers and so on. I mean we'd like to follow recommendations. without necessarily going and trying things ourselves. You know if you see somebody else doing it then we'll just do that instead. But, so the first video from last week for the filter roles one was the idea. And we didn't well. Because of the discussion there is about the algorithms that are being used and. To provide us what we wanted, so the question is maybe not just. How do we do this, provide tailored information to people but. Should we be doing this, and why should we do it. And then that goes back. To the. To the moral operating system.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;You know.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;simple questions like. iPhone or android. And then. Should we take this guy's data and then what's the moral framework we should use when deciding to take this guy's data. So those are questions that got fewer and fewer responses. So I don't necessarily think there's all. there's enough. Enough why questions asked. Compared to, I think. Mostly in technology they're talking about. As asking and answering how questions. So then. The second video from last day about social. What kind of. connection with. Which What should the platforms, but to the platforms or us in terms of their contributions to the greater good. And I pride in the design. To me, and so that's why I went. shifted the. pride in the aspect of design so it's not just a matter of. To. me it's not just a matter of. Meeting the specifications but. meeting people in a train it to the public good.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;that's okay so basically. What you're getting at is that with our design with the design of these different platforms and technology, this could be a way to contribute to the greater good.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, I understand, thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So just following up on the chat discussions here a little bit. about the cars with their touch screens. I agree that. they're a little bit distracting maybe a lot distracting. And the fact that well. Sometimes I have a cook I hook up my iPhone and. It sometimes says to me that the keyboard is unavailable, which is good when i'm driving. But still I can touch. do a lot of touching and. That sounds funny anyway, I can still i'm still free to touch the screen for other functions like navigation and and music. and I think that people that companies think Oh, I have this ability to touch screen, and so we can create this one piece of for the. Center of the dash that's. That can take on all these functions. and We can just replace it all as one unit if it fails, and so on and so forth. But I mean the question isn't. What kind of design. it's the technology in search of a problem. You know, we don't want to create other ones. So we do. It is to not. it's not just think technology. Is a solution now that's the problem. But rather. To me it's computing as about. How do we augment. people's ability to perform the tasks they want to perform without fundamentally altering the tasks. And I saw the Mercedes. I don't know what car, it was but they're planning a moto with it with a whole dashboard is. The touch this I don't know if it's all touch capable or part of it is just display. That seems. It seems nice if you didn't have to drive as well. stirring the cauldron I talked to like Sam Jackson. expletive deleted expletive deleted. anyway. today. So i'm gonna try a breakout room. And the question around would like you to discuss this. What is their responsibility to design in designing technology for the greater good. That makes sense is that. Open ended enough but specific enough to. Have you go.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;make sense to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. anyone else, like to. So your responsibility as. Computer professionals. As future computer professionals. And we'll discuss the idea of what makes it professional. At other points during this. This semester okay. Okay, so having said that, let me make 2020 groups and we'll take it from there. Okay, so video for about. 10 minutes. Now checking on you and then we'll. Come back to discuss. So there's a. You can continue this discussion on. asynchronously with the our courses forum for breakout discussions. as well. Very good. Okay, here we go opening rooms. And a good discussion.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Have you heard about the Microsoft for some companies are pattern that is some sort of software that will that can use deceased person as a chatbot have you heard about it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you mean to observe provide. Provide companionship from the deceased person.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I don't know the full detail, but the topic is that they'll turn a deceased person has a chat Bot i'm not sure how they're gonna do it, but they'll be patented. And that's.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;patented it yeah. No, I haven't heard some of those details about the patent and so forth. If you have a link please you can. invite you to share that. So did you get put into a room. And, and you left the room.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;room want to be silent, we talked for a while and we run out of ideas, basically.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;um.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, well then, I better.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yep link to the channels.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Other stats something recently played a video game seven bronco December seven I hope people heard about it, so in that game, there was almost the same idea like one of the main characters friend died, and one of the company recreated almost recreated that deceased person. He talks, like the real one, but doesn't have all the functionality like lines are limited, what he can talk about isn't limited but the basic idea is saying and the game is set on a dystopian future.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Okay, so how is that going to go room.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;It was.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;It was good wow okay. So two owners about.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;rate.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;or no time.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I would say a little too long.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;We actually got cut off so.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yeah we kind of ran out of stuff to talk about so yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;OK so i'll make them. i'll be more. Strict with the time then. Okay, so. Anything you want to share with the whole class. In the vein of. responsibilities as professionals to the world to the greater good.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I think we all had the same thinking that filter bubbles should not be there. This was the common point between all of us.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so. So, on what basis do decide to to not provide filter bubbles. Is that.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;The rationale.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;i'm. On the basis of searches.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, no, I don't mean. Technically, how to do it or to not do it, but. But why would you not do it. what's the basis for decision to not do it. Is it a. Is it a practical issue is it a moral issue.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I think it's a model, as well as practical it just limits us.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay anyone else, want to.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;um i'd have to do with. Getting rid of filter bubbles I think it's more of if the consumer doesn't want filter bubbles then you'd have to move over to a platform that doesn't have them rather than limiting them it's not on the choice of. The company i'd say it's more on the choice of the consumer, like if you're against filter bubbles, and you only ever use Facebook, well, I think that's. More or less your point and, if you think you can make something better will amaze will why don't you make a better platform and not include these things.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;What about the like apple and, like the APP stores limiting them, so you can't even buy or can't even use software's without filter bubbles. Because like that's what they did with. parlor.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;don't buy an apple them.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Well, just.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yeah that's fair, that is a fair point but like.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Even know that those things exist.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I think if you take an ECON class it's it's on the onus of the consumer right like.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;A consumer you haven't deployed.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. We kind of discussed that be more optional rather than like whether you wanted or not, which.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like. I feel like i'm platforms should make it's an option issue once it's not I mean.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Have you guys. used to trust or other sites that mostly shows pictures so when you have an account they give you an option, what kind of pictures do like is. zadroga watercolor stuff you if you want, you can create your own filter bubble, if you don't want that you can skip it out.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;When you pick what you are interested in yes.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I don't hold as long to talk about Hollywood and stuff sometimes I want to say about other stuff now if I don't have any food travels i'll get news from around the world, probably not the one i'm currently looking for I need to have that option, at the same time.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so that's what we discussed that to make an option. And also like keeping in like all the. security concerns and everything in my.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;With the filter bubble we're not choosing what. What are the gaps, but if we don't have any filter bubbles it'll be a whole math. i'm complete math there is no order at all.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so filter bubbles I don't care about sports. These are a lot of sites that like basically scan me or something like that they'll never give me sports because they never click on anything about sports they only give me everything instead of what I do enjoy, but I can always look up sports if I truly wanted.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;No.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so let me just make a comment here. So I appreciate the. The discussion. That in terms in terms of. So about the discussion. it's not clear it so if we want to say. pick a platform that has filter bubbles are not filter bubbles are these different things. Then we need to. there's an expectation there's some transparency, but what features exist on the platform. which I don't think we didn't you don't think is. required or. discussed very much at this point. And secondly about our going to run discussions. I think. Since I enjoyed all the conversation, but I think we need to use our. raised their hands from the participants window. or not sure whether it's a blue hand or an emoji for you on your list. Okay, so it looks like it's an emoji for me on this list. So if you'd like to speak, please let me see your hands up and. yeah sure.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so previously, I was thinking that there are mixed opinions about filter bubble so just you know, to get everyone's you should we have all or something like that about whether our platform should have filter bubbles or no. That you can start a poll right now.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I could do a poll I don't like those polls, but. i'll do something in your courses. Okay, so i'll put up a your courses. instrument this afternoon. Okay. So that'd be something to. Attendance was right at the beginning. let's see. So it's after call 45 now. Okay, so I don't want to make a big deal about attendance. alright. So, only one way to indicate participation. And maybe it's. Not a great way. But I will keep an open mind about that. Go ahead yeah sure.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Oh sorry it was from before I didn't do it again.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Okay, so. So the engagement with meetings is just a general asking you to write a response to today's meeting. And the breakout room, you can talk, you can enter something about the discussion from the breakout rooms, if you like. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;i'm sorry, are you referring to the engagement section.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So i'm just looking at the comments here in the chat. The prompt for the discussion is the same every day yeah so that's the engagement with meetings, if you want to talk continue discussion about the breakout room. And there's a forum for that.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Thanks for thanks for clarifying oh you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Have a good weekend and we'll. See you. On Tuesday. Take care everyone.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you bye.
    </li></ul>

    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;can you see other people's response?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;if you can then it should be there with your post
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I can’t so I don’t think it will be available at all, I was hoping maybe there was some sort of drafting system the professor could see
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I woke up this morning and saw it was still just on the submission page :(
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Alright, thanks anyways professer
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;can you still access the text? Maybe include it with today’s response?
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, that’d be great
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Just to confirm, we don't have the attendance key yet right?

    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;what's*\
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;they don't track or something
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;but apparently they did
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Google gamestop see what comes up
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;^it is 'comparitively' more secure
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;oh interesting
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;it does not store anything one use to search. so no history!!
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;try tor browser as a whole, safer than most other browsers
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;^gamestop is going to the moon
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Gamestop is the French revolution of wallstreet LOL
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Not anymore since robin hood shut down trading
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;nah it won't, they shut down trading lol
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Only on robin hood though
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;no, multiple platforms have now
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Ahh shame, I was really enjoying the memes
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;stimulus checks rocks
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Heavy political backlash though, I think they'll resume before End of Day
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;when the poor people start making money you gotta shut it down to protect those billionaires /s
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah even international markets are shutting it down, seems like the hedge funds are manipulating it really good
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I mean hedgefunds manipulated it to make it go down in the first palce
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;I heard 2 of em are bankrupt already
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Yep, $3bn+ in losses already
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I read 5 this morning
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;this turn into financial + economic class now
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I see the link
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;sorry I did not see them
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;People who put door bars on pushing doors are lazy cun...
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;creating online spaces would follow to design, absolutely
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I mean I think it can be used as a security feature, thieves got stuck on them as well
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;kicking, pushing, even shooting the god damn door XD
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, we've all pushed a pull door, haven't we?
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;^
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;sure!
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;sure
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;sure!
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Sure!
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;no audio
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;zoom doesn't share audio
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;hear in your mind...
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;yup
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;read the captions just like anime
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Castlevania best dub btw...fyi
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;watched ep 7 of AoT by any chance?
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Which season
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;4
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;No spoilers please
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;don't spoil I haven't seen it yet lol
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;haha, nutcracker goes brrt
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;no sound?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;So basically he's talking about intuitive design
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;is it only me tha cant hear?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;no one can hear it
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;its fine
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;read
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think zoom shares audio when you share screen
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;nah but that's ok, I can read :)
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;i think a dangerous design car companies are doing right now is replacing all car dash buttons with a touchscreen
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;it def won't work here in frozen Regina...
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;you can share audio there is an option
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Zoom does share audio, my CS 205 lab instructor shared a video this week and we could hear the Audio as well
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Mercedes just released a model of a 60inch touchscreen as your dashboard...
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Not everybody buy mercedes
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;Zoom doesn’t share computer audio directly. It might be able to be configured for that, but the simple solution is to feedback the audio from the speakers to the microphone. Since Dr. Hepting is using a headset, the speakers can’t pick it up.
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Tesla's always used Digital Dashboards
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;Mercedes 3&gt; lol
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;i know but I don't think I wont want to distract my driving butler...
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;or like any major EV company
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;most of the car companies are going for aesthetics over user-friendly flexibility
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;honestly other than my gf who is saving for a BMW, i don't mind getting second hand cars till the day I die
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;My Mercedes from SGI salvage works just fine
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good, just don't get too distracted by touch screens
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;My McLaren in Forza is also really nice xD
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;lol I used to buy total loss and fixed by myself then you pay a bit for inspection lol
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;can't wait for my Bluetooth seatbelt, however
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;the only time I use Ok google to do stuff for me
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I talk to it like Samuel Jackson
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Say "i'm sorry, I couldn't get that"! Say "i'm sorry, I didn't catch that"! I dare you I double dare you!
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;Our responsibility as programmers or just
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;individuals?
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;Ok thanks
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/microsoft-chatbot-patent-dead-b1789979.html
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I think it went well
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I guess good
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;great isn't alex?
    </li><li><strong>S45:</strong>&nbsp;too long
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;we just got started on AI
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;and how to program them correctly
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;The market will decide, just like Robocop?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;the police ended up privatised?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Don't vote conservative then
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I dont
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;sure but regardless of political stance, im sure no one wants to be too exposed
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;we need some control mekasures
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;*measures
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;For sure and get people in office that would make changes
