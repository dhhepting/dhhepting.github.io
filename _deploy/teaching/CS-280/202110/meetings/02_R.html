      Hi everyone,I watched the videos before today's class (01/14) so I figured I might as well kick us off while they are fresh!"Code Stars" was awesome - it's so nice to see that positivity.  I don't know about anyone else but I have members of my family who have gone down that anti-technology Facebook hole where they are terrified of Bill Gates and basically all computers (that doesn't stop them from owning cell phones of course).  I've actually been told that studying computer science is dangerous for me somehow - it's such an odd thing. It was refreshing to see a...
    </li><li>
      I'm not certain where I should be posting this but since Warren has already opened up this forum I thought I would post my reactions here. Thanks for taking initiative, Warren!"Code Stars" -- I actually thought this was a pretty cute and empowering video that really talked up the benefits of entering computer programming. I wonder if much has changed between 2013 and now with education on how widespread and important computer programming is as a career choice. It's true, often times when you ask children what they want to be when they grow up, in my experience you get...
    </li><li>
      Hey everyone, here’s my reaction to the videos from last class.‘Code Stars’ is a video made in 2013 promoting computer programming as a profession and suggests that programming should be taught within the general school system. In the video it said that there would be 1,400,000 jobs requiring computer science graduates within the next 10 years, and only 400,000 graduates to fill them. Given we are at the tail end of those ten years, I am curious to know how accurate those numbers ended up being.The second video titled ‘We need a moral operating system’ discusses the ethics of people...
    </li><li>
      Hello everyone, here is my reactions to the videos:"Code Stars" - After watching this video what I thought was that wow, such a positive message is being shared to the public. I believe much has changed since 2013 to today, underlying things the video mentions. In the video the kids were asked if they know about computer programming, and they are like no, and if we see today, there are tons of people pursuing this as a career; not quite the same amount as a teacher, doctor, chef, sport player, but it sure is changing. I felt from the video,...
    </li><li>
      The two videos made me believe that programming is fun. Programming is about creating or building something new from the scratch. Coding involves collecting managing organizing data and it is about thinking differently to come up with something new and challenging. An objective can be obtained by considering different perspectives and opinions. The videos further conveyed that a human has a power to create new perspectives and change them
    </li><li>
      From the past lecture, I have learned that coding is used literally everywhere, in any field. Like who have given the thought to the thing that the simplest mobile games we are playing is build by performing a lot of coding. Also, we can use the programming in both positive and negative ways as a person with a good knowledge of programming can get access to all the personal things of the other which is already happening. So it's upon us that how we are going to use this superpower.
    </li><li>
      I found David Horowitz's "Moral Operating System" Ted talk very interesting. I am interested to learn more about theories surrounding morals and ethics, specifically in the areas of computer science and modern technology. I am also interested to learn more about cybersecurity because I believe privacy is an important issue in the age of technology.
    </li><li>
      Code StarsIn near future mostly everything will be computerized, from household work to commercial work everything will somehow relate to computers. From smart door which notified you if someone is at the door or you are getting any package delivery and car which drives without any driver to agriculture industries and commercial factories everything will have coding in it. So, it is very important to learn coding for everyone. Coding is very vast it is not just in developing websites or making any shopping application or for any social media. It is used in every known industries, the robotic system...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we learned about how easy it is to start learning computer science. And can be helpful in every field that is available rather then only computer science. This also makes people more aware of this field and sends a positive message to everyone that how important it is.There is so much we can do with coding. But it is important to know that what are the right things we should do and what not to do. Ethics is very important. We also learned that we should respect others privacy and need not take the data without their...
    </li><li>
      In the first video, programming was been centralized. Programming entails the explanation to a computer using functions on how you need it to help you. In reference to “Makinde”, Coding is the process of breaking down problems.Code creation and programming is a pattern of expressing creativity or a mechanism to produce executable form of computer programs, Code creation is not limited by our imagination and is totally based on our understanding of the structure of the program. It is said that magic is bound to happen when you team up and collaborate together while coding, this exercise helps us to...
    </li><li>
      It was interesting that in a talk on morality he completely ignored the contributions of Hobbes and Locke. their social contract explains why those with the data should act morally in the first place. I've always understood the social contract to be similar to utilitarianism, which he mentioned in the talk, but slightly more aware of the individual.
    </li><li>
      We have this guys data. There are infinite things we can do. What should we do?It is really a moral dilemma, and comes down to the concerns of each individual's privacy. How much is privacy worth? How much should it be sacrificed for "the greater good" or for the user experience? This has always really been a concern and there's still never been a perfect solution, and I really don't think there ever will be a perfect decision.Some other styles of data collection have come about, things like grouping and anonymizing user data so that it's only the big picture,...
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the most influenced thing is to have the determination in our goals. In the world of coding, the little coding can make you genius, you just neend to have the right choices. The knowledge about any thing will eventually helps you to identified between right and wrong.
    </li><li>
      First VideoI learned from the first video that there are plenty of opportunities for programmers. You don’t have to be a genius to be a programmer. Programming involves breaking a big problem into smaller parts and solving them. Computer technology is very powerful and as programmers we can have a huge impact on the world.Second VideoThe most important thing I learned from the second video is that we should be spending time thinking:Is what we are building as programmer right or wrong?Will it maximising pleasure and minimising pain?Is it morally right?We should be building a moral operating system. We should...
    </li><li>
      As I watched the first video, I thought that programming would be more and more important in the future because all the technologies of modern life might require programming, so programming is very promising. Secondly, programming has many advantages for people. First, learning programming can improve people's work efficiency to a large extent. Second, programming can also make people more focused, help clear people's thinking when they face problems, and improve their observation ability.
    </li><li>
      The most important point is that the rewards of learning to code are huge. The obvious ones, for example, are that people who do it earn a lot of money.
    </li><li>
      I would first start with what I would like to know more about . I would like to know more about this course such that around what concept does this course revolves around and what risk and reward in society actually means. Rest the meeting was absolutely great and there was nothing I found difficult.
    </li><li>
      Code StarsIt is obvious that the video is attempting to glorify the world of programming. I can’t help but criticize the video since it feels more like a recruitment commercial attempting to lure you in with free food, laundry, snacks, video games, and scooters. Being talked to by a cartoon and then referring to coding as a superpower does not help and tells me this is targeted for a much younger audience. While working for companies like Value appear to be more exciting than the average job, I don’t feel this is something everyone should expect. Most people I know...
    </li><li>
      From the two videos that I watched I gained a bit of insight and moral questions about computer science.  From video one we are addressed by many successful people in the field of computer science who tell us that computer science is a growing industry that will continue to grow and that with this growth it would be essential for everyone to learn how to code.  In the second video one man presents into a crowd about the moral side to computer science what we should and should not do. How that everyone sees right and wrong differently and that...
    </li><li>

    </li><li>
      I had watch both video. In the first video, they introduce the outline of computer program that most people are known. computer programmer also telling how they feel about coding. As these worker said, I can consider of computer science is a new world, new form of art; But at the end of the video, there is a guy said: "if you want to earn money or if you want to create something, learn computer science." ; this quote is the high light of the whole video for me.In the second video, the host asked audience should he keep information...
    </li><li>
      It was okay, let’s see in next lecture.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned from the TED video is how the moral framework of ethics keeps evolving and how all the different parameters for it seems equally right. What I would like to know more about is how to have the best judgement of ethics in a situation of conflict of interest.
    </li><li>
      first video: States more about the need and importance of coding in the modern world, it isn't about money and business it is about making the world a better place to live.Second video: it loops around collecting using one individual's data in an ethical way, not to purposely invade somebody's privacy but to give them a better experience of the platform from recording their inputs, and can be also used to protect others from threats by that data when needed.
    </li><li>
      Something interesting that I learned more about in the last meeting is how people involved in the internet consider people's data. Data is a huge deal and I don't think that it is considered enough regarding its importance. The videos really enabled me to think about just how much information about yourself can be out in someone else's hands. I found it interesting how the audience was asked about their morals in using other peoples data to earn a profit and it really shows in today's society where technology is running most of our world.
    </li><li>
      The short movie "Code Start" is about encouraging young people to learn how to code and possibly pursuing them into finding a job in that field. I think this is a great way to encourage young people because they interviewed successful and famous people such as the founder of Microsoft and Facebook which many people know and have respect for.The second video is more about ethic especially how do we handle people's data, do we collect it to make his experience better and make money from it or do we respect his privacy. What is wrong and what is right...
    </li><li>
      This class mainly talked about the description of the task of this semester, although the end of the class was dismissed early.I would like to put more information on the whole site, such as course preview information and so on.Thank you and wish us all a good learning experience this semester.
    </li><li>

    </li><li>
      I am interested in how it can be difficult to decide between using people's data, and protecting their privacy. I would like to learn more about how corporations handle this, and what the laws are surrounding this topic. I can see how using people's data would be valuable and corporations could make a profit from this, but I also think it is important to protect people's privacy. While I am using technology I will likely be more aware of how my data is being used to enhance my experience, and where I might be concerned about my privacy being protected....
    </li><li>
      It was really helpful. Thanks.
    </li><li>
      though there was nothing much discussed in the cass, the videos posted say about the computer programming and its the experts or experienced people saying their experiences about the programming. Sir damon talking about the operating systems
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about whether or not there is a socially optimal moral decision that can be made about how companies can use collected data. Would it rather be more of a decision for a company to make based on the opinion of the consumers? Is there a plan that can best accommodate both companies and consumers or does one get the short end of the stick? Consumers obviously dont want everyone knowing their personal data and companies would much rather have data to work with, so how can each side be satisfied?
    </li><li>
      The videos provided for meeting 2 were fairly interesting. One of the most important things that I learned is that there is a large demand for programmers and a fairly low supply in comparison. What is more, is that the first video speaks on the importance of community, team work, creativity, and that programming is not all algorithms and math. Although it depends on the task at hand, the creative aspect of programming is really what has drawn me into computer science. The concept I found most difficult was what is rights and wrongs concerning data collection. It is an...

      One of the most intresting thing i learned is the number which will be required in the future of computer science (400,000 the garduates) and one of the most applicable and true thought was the forum of truth which has universal objective truth the example was applicable in the coding world as well and also to think every possible outcome before writing

      I found it very interesting. The first video talked about coding and how to learn the whole thing from the pov of the masters of it and the second video discusses once we have achieved that level how to use the power in the right way. I was also astonished to know we have a 1 million shortage on programmers that can be utilized. Also, the decision factor which can't be coded or taught to the computers, its we humans that have to take responsibilities.

      From the Meeting 2, it can be concluded that coding is nothing until you are unaware about it, but it will become an indispensable part when you will know about it. it feels amazing when millions of people use the app that you create by coding. nowadays everything has coding.it is true that programming is epic.

      Hi there,I hope you all are i pink of your health.From this meeting, i got to know that people make a big fuss about coding ( that it is difficult and all ). However, once someone gets to know about it or put a little bit effort it starts to become interesting and eventually becomes an integral part of many people's life. When a programmer realizes that his/her made app/website is being used by hundreds and thousands of people that's where he/she falls in love with programming even more. In this modern era, everything runs by some kind of coding...

      From the video "Code star" I learned how Computer Science &amp; Technology plays a vital role in todays world and how big the deal it will be in the future. I was always into technology but didn't knew how creative and fun it could be and why we all should learn how to code. It's sad to see that how young people think coding is boring and hard but Its one of the think which we all can do. You don't have to be smart or intelligent, all you need is passion, creativity and determined towards programming.The "TED talk" by...

      Meeting 2 we look at two different videos, in the first video we see different individuals who have been favorably exposed to the idea of coding, how youngsters have absolutely no idea about becoming a programmer.Evidently everything requires technology these days and what's interesting is that the great creators of different social media platforms come together to explain how great it feels to have written a program themselves who are now at the peak. This gives us the idealconfidence we need to keep working in  order to achieve what's beyond our potential.   Coding is something very simple and easy to understand which makes it...

      After watching the both vedio I came to conclusion that what is exactly programming language is ? how can we understand the language of coding ? There are so many programming languages such as JAVA, Python, Ajax etc. and each programming language has their own unique way to write and understand as well as how to execute the code So we can get better result and understanding. Nowadays, Peole who are releted to this field or already working in this field for them programming language is very crucial and necessary to make progress in their upcoming future.

      Form the fish video,I learned what is computer programming and what other people see the computer programming .it can do anything like music,doing some stuff but for that we need to assign some work to computer to do that things.another thing is how to read and understand the program.To write,read and understand we don’t have to be genius.From the second I learned about what is right and wrong according to computer systems.it led me to think of more moral systems we need.
    </li><li>
      It is very important for everyone to learn how to read and write code ( even in some basic form) because in the coming years or decades everything around us will have some form of coded instruction.I didn't really got how to choose whether to use the data or not and what morale structure should we go for.How to code easily and efficiently is what I would like to know about.
    </li><li>
      We are living in a Big data age that our personal data is easily to be collected. For example if I took a look on the airplane ticket, the next second the advertisement of it will be shown on another app. Our data is been tracked and the system can easily track it. It does benefit something but in other hand, it doesn't protected our privacy and I feel it can be better if we can find a proper way between giving benefits and invasion of privacy.

      The term computing is any activity that uses computers to manage, process, and communicate information.Computing includes the development of both hardware and software.Computing is a critical, integral component of modern industrial technology.It deals with mathematical concepts as it follows an endless systematic algorithm concept.Computing helps one to advance the way that they think and how one relates to the world in terms of coding languages and processesMy purpose in studying computing is to broaden my knowledge of how processes are done in the real world as almost everything now is being done digitally.Computing is a critical, integral component of modern...

      After watching both videos, here are the things I learned.Code stars - Programming is an essential part of our society.it is integrated into almost every industry imaginable, from technology to agricultural industries.Programming thrives when it is done with a group of trusted people in a conducive environment. Lastly, the world will continue to need good programmers as there is more than enough demand for them. We need a "moral operating system" - Moral operating system is a human method of making decisions between right and wrong. There is no particular formula for making a difficult decision. Most people make tough...
    </li><li>
      The one thing I learned was that "Being determined towards what you are learning is  most important rather than just trying to be the odd one out or be the most genius person." Coding is much more of a depth topic that can be learned from the basics. Social life in 2021 will have much more power than it ever had, so privacy is a factor that needs to be given priority. As the Ted Talks speaker was giving a plethora of examples about the ethics great people had set, similarly, Ethics is the way to learn by heart.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned is that Coding, Computer Science is often misunderstood and is a very underrated career. Also, we need to use our skills for the right things and need to make sure that we follow good ethics as we can make a big difference as an individual. There were a couple of words in the Ted talk video which sounded complicated and I didn't know their meaning. I would like to know more about the current information that the operating system I am using collects. I have faced the underrating of Computer Science/Coding in my...

      Code stars are the computer programmers; they code and decode the logical problems. Coding is unlike playing but needs learning and making algorithms. The future of programming is vast; people are getting in. Everyone starts coding from scratch like addition, subtraction and multiplication. Sometimes, more complex problems need team work to accomplish the objective. Damon Horowitz said, we have data and power like I am a programmer is a my power, but how many programmings can I do ? that is my data. We have technology like a phone how to use it that is in our hands. Today we...
