      In our 8th meeting we discussed what is important design for the programmers and their users. We talk about the free communications app called Discord as an example. Many students alongside me think the discord user interface (UI) is pretty intuitive after a while of using it. However some students raised valid concerns about other types of users not being able to understand how to use discord due to the initial jarring UI and notification spamming.
    </li><li>
      Discord is like cooking, it looks easy but it’s not. The design of Discord is pretty overwhelming to the new user. I would say that it doesn’t share a lot of similar features to some of the communication apps that I’ve used in the past. I think the unfamiliarity throws a lot of people off.
However, you can’t expect things to get easier, as a user you should start learning new things as well. Newer software has more creative and useful features that the old one doesn’t have. So, the transition is a bit tough, I would say, just be more open-minded. So the users and the designer have to meet somewhere in the middle to get the best experience.
For example, social media apps such as Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, etc. have similar features. So, the user can switch from one app to another pretty easier. They have a search bar, post/tweet, sharing options, groups, swipe, infinite scrolling, notifications, and direct messaging. As a designer, you want to make something that is full of new features yet also familiar to currently existing apps.
    </li><li>
      Concerning the meeting today, I think it's very interesting to think about how sometimes we sacrifice a lot of ease of use, accessibility, or intuitiveness of design in the name of utility. I was thinking more on that concept that Don Norman was talking about in terms of design that makes users happy, and it struck me that I use a lot of things that I don't really enjoy simply because it makes things easier or overcomes some type of issue. I don't like Facebook but I use it to keep in touch with people. I don't like Google products but I use some of them because it's convenient. I don't like Zoom but I use it for my classes. None of these products 'spark joy' for me but I use them because it makes my life easier.

So it got me thinking, I'd definitely like to learn a bit more about intuitive, joyful, accessible design and what it is that keeps us from employing it everywhere (or maybe we are and I'm just grumpy, haha). If we don't employ it, is it just because it's too expensive, and the bottom line gets in the way? Is there more research that needs to be done on it? What is it about some products that makes them more desirable or more commonly used? Is it innovation and design or is it just marketing?

Anyway, I ended up in a bit of a rabbit hole looking up intuitive and/or accessible design after class today. I thought this was interesting and relevant to some degree: http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/The-7-Principles/
    </li><li>
      Ease-of-Use and Accessibility

When designing software, as we’ve discussed in class, we want to design our software with ‘the greater good’ in mind. Accessibility and ease of use are a very important part of designing technology for the greater good. For me, this means knowing who your target audience is and their level of technical knowledge. For example, if you had very tech-savvy people as your main customer base for your software, you could possibly make your software more complex if needed. However, if you have a target customer base that has limited experience using technology, you may want to make your software more simple to use.

Accessibility vs Utility

When software has more utility, it is often more complicated to use. Finding the right balance between accessibility and utility for your target user base can be very important. An interesting example of this that we talked about in class is the online communication platform, Discord. Discord is very interesting because it was originally designed for a very tech-savvy user base: people who played computer games. With that in mind, in order to include lots of extra features that added to its utility, the developers of Discord designed their program to be more complex. It was built with such complexity that there was a learning curve to use the program, even for it’s own targeted, tech-savvy user base. Since the COVID-19 pandemic hit, however, this user base has expanded greatly: Discord is no longer only used by people playing computer games, as more people have been required to flock to online communication for work, school, and socializing. Discord’s steep learning curve is even more apparent than before, as it was designed for a different, more tech-savvy user base, not for a person with an average amount of technical knowledge. People still use Discord for its high utility however, even with all of its ease-of-use issues and steep learning curve. With this in mind, I want to bring up this question for you to consider: What is the right balance between ease of use and utility?

Let me know what you think, Thanks for reading!

The meeting started with discussion of intuitiveness. I learned many things about the fact that it depends upon the person if they feel it good then they should be using the following applications. Intuitiveness is more a common for the following instincts more than the conscious ideology. For example, some of the app likely discord has its own convenience and platform for publishment. We also talked about the empathy which makes me to learn different thing about the understanding of others perspective the following difference in the ideology. Empathic computing is the study which deals with the narrowed down to understand the ‘low-level’ subconscious feelings, such as pain, illness, depression or anomaly in the field of computer science.


    </li><li>
      I am getting the idea that some apps can be classified as tools in the sense that they are designed to be multi-purpose for the user. We were discussing how the audience for discord changed from gamers to a general audience, but Discord itself never had to change to be appealing to the general audience. People just used the tool that is discord for their own purpose. Discord does not get to decide in this situation what it is to be used for. This is actually something that is decided by the users.
    </li><li>
      Discord Accessibility and Who's Responsible
In our recent discussion about discord and how intuitive (or not intuitive) the program is sparked an interesting discussion about how accessible one should make their software. Accessibility is something very difficult for me to understand because ultimately, who is responsible for accessibility? I personally don't know. Is it discord's responsibility to make their program as accessible as possible? If it is, wouldn't that limit there creative decisions and limit their freedom on what they can implement (if they are always forced to make things accessible then difficult but useful functions may never be implemented). Additionally, making things accessible is not free. It costs discord time, money, and other resources to make these changes. Why should they have to bear the entire burden of accessibility when we can just learn how to use it? Then is it our responsibility? Do we just have to sit down and learn the software because we chose to download it and use it? Well, we do lots of things for the sake of accessibility. We include wheelchair ramps that less than 1% of the population will use, special bathrooms for people with disability, among other things. Most people will not find these accessible changes to be useful but for the sake of accessibility (and for somethings it is the law) we implement these things for the betterment of those who need the extra help (we often don't ignore those who need that extra bit of help so putting the entire burden on the an individual also seems a little irresponsible). I guess with everything there needs to be a balance. Is discord entirely responsible to make everything so accessible everyone can easily understand everything? Probably not. But are you entirely responsible to sit down and learn the ins and outs of discord because you chose to use the software? Probably not. A balance of the two are key. Of course, this is just with discord. Other software will probably need there own analysis and conclusion.

      we discussed the interface of applications- designers should make their user interface user friendly and learn to adjust with time so as not to bore users. They should also try to make the interface less complicated because the easier it is, the more time people want to spend on it.
    </li><li>
      I wouldn't say that any technology is intuitive. People will design things that are intuitive to only themselves, one persons obvious isn't another persons obvious. I did not like mac's one click "ease of use" mouse, I found it very confusing and annoying. This is because I first started using a PC over a Mac. A lot of our intuition comes from experiences, if you use a new software that is similar to other software it will seem intuitive. That being said though I do think that touch screen stuff is generally more intuitive because you just have to touch stuff. Touching something on a touch screen will do something and I think it be easier find what your supposed to do.
    </li><li>
      it was really helpful
    </li><li>
      In my opinion i will say mac's one click is very helpful than the windows because sometimes the touch screen and light touch on mouse pad are sometimes the problem if you are trying to do something and it get started by light touch and about the application interfaces that should be user friendly as you can see the Microsoft word, Excel. They give you space for typing and also add feedback on your computer screen.
    </li><li>
      Well i found it very interesting on how some people where defeneding there perferend interface during the meeting when there is ligemently critizem from them. It was extremlly interesting with talking about the interface and really thinking about it
on what they should do
    </li><li>
      I believe that the UI of a software plays a critical role in determining the user-experience. As discussed in class, I agree with the statement that Discord does not have a very good UI. However, its still a pretty useful tool with a plethora of features. This is one reason why I appreciate the iOS a lot - it has a minimalistic feel yet has a ton of features in it, everything is easy to navigate to/from.
    </li><li>
      I thought this meeting's discussions were very productive with a lot of really good points mentioned. I think the most important thing is really to know your target audience, and be completely willing to meet them where they are and able to accommodate them in any way necessary while still retaining the functionality of your products. One thing I remember being taught is it's important to be able to trace your websites/applications and see exactly how many clicks it takes to get to a given place. Labelling is incredibly important, but one thing I see becoming more and more common is just way too many options and different drop downs, buttons, and settings to play around with. I think applications are now trying to compete too much with one another, and adding more features than they really ever needed to try to make people as satisfied as possible. I don't think this is inherently a bad thing, but it's very important to remember that it's not possible to just keep packing more and more features into a platform without looking back at the base system and really seeing what needs to change for it to contain a larger scale of services.
