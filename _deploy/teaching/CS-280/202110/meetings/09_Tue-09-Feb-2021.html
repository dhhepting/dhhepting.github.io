      Just what we have to do in this class and on what topics do we have to write about for the 1st blog?
    </li><li>
      <a href="http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/research/inspirations.html">(Engage in critical examination of computing, identify and challenge assumptions)
      </a>
    </li><li>
      <a href="http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/teaching/CS-280/202110/#collapse_OFF_TLO">(List of themes of possible topics for Blog Entry 1)
      </a>
    </li><li>
      what is important for programmers to design for their users? As an example, we considered the Discord app. Many -- not all -- think that it is intuitive after some use (how long? what is intuitive in this context?).
    </li><li>
      Discord is like cooking, it looks easy but it's not. As a designer, one seeks to balance new features with familiarity to currently existing apps.
    </li><li>
      Interesting to think about how sometimes we sacrifice a lot of ease of use, accessibility, or intuitiveness of design in the name of utility. Don Norman was talking about design that makes people happy, and it struck me that I use a lot of things that I don't really enjoy simply because they provide some utlity, some means to accompish something. They don't ''spark joy'' for me but I use them because they make my life easier.
    </li><li>
      What it is that keeps us from employing intuitive, joyful, accessible design? Does the design we practise serve the greater good?
    </li><li>
      <a href="http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/The-7-Principles/">http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/The-7-Principles/

    </li><li>
      <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">(https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
      </a>
    </li><li>
      How do we balance usability and utility? Do we design tricycles or bicycles? Could we transition to the design of unicycles if required? Why is empathy an important capability for designers (especially)?
    </li><li>
      Some apps can be classified as tools in the sense that they are designed to be multi-purpose for the user. Discord does not get to decide what it is to be used for, which is decided by the users.
    </li><li>
      Accessibility is something very difficult for me to understand because ultimately, who is responsible for accessibility? Is it the programmer's responsibility to make their program as accessible as possible? If it is, wouldn't that limit their creative decisions and limit their freedom to implement what they want? (What is the responsibility of users to learn and use difficult software?)
    </li><li>
      Is any technology intuitive? People will design things that are intuitive to themselves. One person's obvious isn't another person's obvious.
    </li><li>
      Very interesting that some people will fervently defend their preferred interface even when there are legitimate criticisms of it.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing is really to know your target audience and be completely willing to meet them where they are and be able (to hear them and empathize with them).
    </li><li>
      I found it interesting that there was a wide range of perception for the interface on Discord, which shows how different users can have a different experience using the same technology, and that the experience of all users must be valued while (designing and) developing an interface.
    </li><li>
      A Norman door gives you the wrong signal about how to operate it. There are many things in life with designs that give us wrong (or harmful) signals.
    </li><li>
      <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/tristan_harris">https://www.ted.com/speakers/tristan_harris
      </a>
    </li><li>
      It's upon us software designers and developers to find a way to create something for the greater good of society by using technology as a tool and not enabling technology to use us.
    </li><li>
      <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/04/has-dopamine-got-us-hooked-on-tech-facebook-apps-addiction">it is important to ensure that the program or app is made responsibly and doesn't utilize too many "'hijacking techniques' that lure [users] in and create 'compulsion loops'"
      </a>
    </li><li>
      I have always quite liked the U of R's UR Courses (LMS -- learning management system, based open source project called moodle), it is a very clean design and classes and assignments are very easy to navigate to and find. I never really liked the U of S's Blackboard (LMS, proprietary), I found myself clicking around trying to navigate to stuff, usually getting lost. (Is open source software "better" in any way?)
    </li><li>
      With getting over the fear of our low creativity, we can achieve a sense of self-efficacy, a term coined by Dr. Bandura
    </li><li>
      Software interfaces are not universally praised for their quality, but people are adaptible and they learn to work with inferior technology because they place blame on themselves
    </li><li>
      Discord is an interesting example for me, as its user interface is, in my mind, both incredibly simple to use (low barrier to entry), but also incredibly complex to get anything unique done. Getting people who aren't very tech-savvy to join a server is incredibly simple. However, that is more or less the extent of the user-friendliness with Discord.
    </li><li>
      Metaphors and Interface Design is about how psychology can cooperate with art. As David Kelley's example said 80% of children need to take tranquilizer before they get into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine. But after working to redesign the interface of the machine with a story background, the rate of children needing to take a tranquilizer to 10%. Children realize that the machine is taking them into the story.
    </li><li>
      There is also a video that addresses the plane crash that took place without any technological complications. Until I saw this video, I wouldn't have believed it could happen in real life. I have come to know how a little thing can cause a great tragedy. However, the cause behind the accident was not exactly known to me, since it was not a technological issue. I would also like to hear more about the circumstances in which the accident occurred, and what actually happened to the aircraft. (Was it a technological issue? Does flight 401 have any connection to Boeing's...
    </li><li>
      I really liked Don Norman's explanation about how good design makes you happy. I would like to have more discussion and more examples about David Kelly's video about building your creative confidence.
    </li><li>
      The state of anomie occurs when there is a blockage of goals for groups or individuals. The moral values or social standards vanish that were already known by the people.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this meeting is how much thinking and research is required to design an intuitive interface. If more people are creative and children are encouraged to be more creative in schools, our society can benefit from more innovations and diversity.
    </li><li>
      If you want people to engage with your products then it is the design of the product that will lure the audience. I really enjoyed the discussion in this meeting. It was so far the most interactive class. Just one request, Dr. Hepting, please type your notes because at least I cannot understand a bit of them. That's the only thing that I don't like about our meetings. Thank you.
    </li><li>
      We should not divide the world into "creative" and "uncreative", because all people are creative by nature. We must be able to achieve self-efficacy and snake touch (in our own ways).
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we talked a bit about accessibility and usability. When designing any website or making any new software, the designer always have to make sure if the design will be understandable to everyone. If the accessibility is available into the website, that it will improve the usability experience. It should focus on if the website is fair to use for people with disability. If the website is navigable, understandable for people with disability then it meets the accessibility goals. When a design is effective and satisfying for the user then it successfully meets the usability as well.
    </li><li>
      From my own understanding of the terms, accessibility means access to all, regardless of technological or physical means and usability is a measure of how easy a system is to use. These two concepts are very vital in the world of technology.
    </li><li>
      I want to know more about interface designing and what aspects should be considered when (designing and) developing a website or software for the people to use.
    </li><li>
      The crash of Eastern Airlines 401 was undoubtedly a tragedy. On the surface, there is not much connection between computer science and society, but through this incident, I realized that computer science can also change society. In my opinion, in the future, computer systems, especially those related to automatic navigation and human health, like vaccines in the medical world, should undergo repeated "clinical trials" before being put into use until the system proves that there are no hidden dangers.
    </li><li>

      </a>
    </li><li>
      Philosopher John Rawls suggests that we imagine staying behind a veil of ignorance that helps to keep us from understanding who we really are and identifying with our own self-interest. This would allow us to more objectively consider the impacts of our choices. And this could make it easier to empathize with others.
    </li><li>
      I didn't realize that a plane crash could occur without any technical fault. (But there were technical faults, including the burnt-out bulb on the instrument panel.)
    </li><li>
      I learned how addictive phones can be and how user interfaces can attract the attention of people, those designs are not there to help us but to make us engage with our devices.
    </li><li>
      The thing that most important when you create something is how you create it and keeping in mind that it could have good and bad effect on people's life. A small mistake or miscalculation could cost people's life so we have to be very precise in designing them.
    </li><li>
      The first important thing for designers is empathy.
    </li><li>
      In the area of anomaly detection and security analytics, humans working with AI accomplish much more than without it. And while not risk-free, AI within security is more likely to create jobs rather than eliminate them, I believe.
    </li><li>
      The interesting part from this meeting was how well-designed things can make them easier to use and evoke a positive response.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. Okay, well, here we are, on Tuesday know. Covering it, so this is the last week before. greinke. And it's bitterly cold in February. Anybody. think this isn't too cold to go outside. Eastern think that cold weather wasn't so bad was kind of bracing but now, now that i'm. Older and have more perspective I think it's just. nicer to stay inside. Let me start by sharing the screen. Put the link up for today. The audio and the transcripts are from the meeting on Thursday or up in this on this page below here. Anyone had a chance to look at it. Anyone find it helpful. keep doing that. So what I would like to i'm trying to do here is. settled on a form that might be useful for all of us here. So i'm going to summarize the responses to last meeting. Here, and then the plan for the meeting. And then, once the meetings done via MEDIA I could whiteboard or other pictures that come up in the meeting. Here, and then a summary which will be based on the transcript. So i'm trying to take into account everyone's. constructive comments. There are a lot more, I did. I went through the responses yesterday afternoon. And I noticed, there are a lot more. last evening, so I haven't updated this to the. For the ones. That came in last night so. I thought this was the most. Pressing. Question to address just what do we have to do in this class and what topics, do we have to write about, for the first blog. So my answer the first part is engaged in a critical examination of computing identifying challenge assumptions. too short. Understand it's also about understanding. What it means to be a computing professional and have. and code of conduct or ethical code or a moral operating system. I think I mentioned this page earlier but i'll just link to show it to you know. there's a few quotes here that are. This first one someone asked me about what I thought the purpose of computing was. So I think this first one is. A good starting point for that. By JCR lickliter wrote this in 1960 at the time, he was head of Defense advanced research project. Administration, I guess that's, the other is DARPA otherwise. So ensure it, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with other enthusiasts for artificial intelligence Ai conceding dominance in the future. In the distant future celebration two machines alone there will nonetheless be a fairly long intro during which the main intellectual diligence will be made by. People in computers working together and intimate association a multi disciplinary study group examining future. Research and development problems in the United States air force estimated be 1980 before developments artificial intelligence, make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving of military significance. So times when i've had the sun slide. This is where I show a picture of terminator. and see if we had. functional Ai in 1980 then maybe 10 skynet would be active and cetera et cetera et cetera. They would still get that reference I feel like i'm sticking to the an old reference. Even though they keep. Trying to. make new movies, are the same. As the same franchise fairly regularly. anyway. So. let's say 1980 but let's say 2025. I would you say five years to develop a human computer symbiosis and 15 years to use it. At 16 maybe 10 or 500 but those years could be intellectually, the most creative and exciting and history of humankind. So, to me, this is what the possibility of computing is that we're not. Taking away from people but augmenting their abilities and. computing is a tool that supports people then.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Being.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Intellectually creative in it. haven't had enough coffee, yet today. Such a thing as too much coffee on a day like today. anyway. So I just. sorry about the. terminator reference there in this quote but. Anyway, so you can see that there's possibility, I think. For augmentation of human activities. People are in charge, but. Not being manipulated by computers. Or the systems we program for them. anyway. Now i'm not sure how it's gonna affect this is funny. But. The slide from. This is a commencement speech he gave this fellow. David foster wallace who's a famous author in the States who's no longer with us. Anyway, he said in his commencement speech, these are. There are these two young fish swimming along and they have to meet an older fish, and then the other way not to them says warning boys how's the water, the two young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at the other end goes what the hell is water. So. To me this class is. What we're doing here is sort of understanding what. The water is in our environment, what, what are the things that are. So present that we don't even think to. notice them. And then. And then. see what happens when we change. So there's a short quote from Steve Jobs for this as well. here's an interview back in 1995 so when you grow up, you can tend to get told the world is the way it is and your your life is just to live your life inside. That world try not to bash into the last too much try to have a nice family have fun save a little money that's a very limited life life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. Everything that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that people can use once you learn that you'll never be the same again. So I think that's written for a particular perspective but. The idea that we don't have to. Accept the way things. are just because somebody else created that structure.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;I mean.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Facebook has this. This motto. move fast and break things. So maybe that's a little bit too extreme. version of this sentiment. Because it's maybe it's important to also understand. why things are the way they are. And if you move fast and break things and maybe it's a good to take some time to slow down and fix things as well. anyway. A little bit of my perspective on. What we're doing in this class. So that's. This philosophical grounding. more practical things over writing blog posts and. Discussing and thinking about these ideas. Related to topics. That are outlined in the. body of knowledge. Now I clicked on the wrong. realized that my link wasn't quite working. For this, for the list of knowledge units and so forth. and go to the page, but it wouldn't open. It wouldn't show the contents of the. Of the. So, here it is right here. So the knowledge areas. Are the two or three letters in front. So social and professional practice. So there are lots of these SP. analytical tools professional ethics. Intellectual Property privacy and civil liberties professional communication. and sustainability, and then there are also a couple from hca human computer interaction foundations and designing interaction. Okay, so, then there are some topics, so you might. So we talked to lots of comments with accessibility in from. In the responses to last days meeting so. Accessibility issues and creating legal requirements. That could be a topic for a blog post. Because it's. Certainly topical. mean. In the current discussion, I think. give you a bit more perspective on. What we're doing in this class and what topics, do we have to write about, for the first blog. That makes sense any questions or comments about that. my microphone on.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, I wrote it in the chat so but yeah that that helps for me thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks. choose the blog topic specifically from the list. So I would say. The themes, can you can think of a theme related to the topic on the list. So it doesn't so the accessibility legal issues one doesn't have to be you don't have to say exactly for that exactly. But you can indicate. That it's. Coming from relate to that theme. Inspired by that that topic. I mean the idea is. To pick something. which you can have a personal connection. My helping you there. Okay. David.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, I don't think that's me someone else must have their MIC unmuted.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well yeah your your rectangle is highlighted that's why I thought, maybe.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Oh gotcha.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so. More questions will take it up as they come along. More. clarity. meet everybody. So you saw permission to unmute yourselves. To contribute to the discussion, but just because there is a. microphone on. Okay, so I think I specified how long how many words. And all the details in the blog post entry. If there's a question that arises for their let me know. I don't wanna. written down. Remember i'm gonna. hear the pass code for the. record your attendance. Okay, so. your attendance is handled as far as i'm concerned. Back to. Okay, let me just quickly address some of these points here. So, we talk a lot about intuition and how do we dissolve intuition about something. So, if something is not intuitive To start with, but we developed some intuition. over time. And then maybe it's well designed, because we can understand how to, or we can. We can figure out how to use it. And maybe we have to. start from a difficult position of unfamiliarity with something that's new. that's. The idea of. The idea of having an intuitive interface means that it's connected to something else with with which you're familiar so that was the basis for the metaphors that we talked about. last day. Finding a metaphor that say well as new activities like this old one. And so we can transfer some of the the old or the familiar activities. Familiar ways of thinking about things to. The new context and then i'll help us to go. to proceed more easily. So a metaphor helps us to develop a mental model of an interface. And the mental model is. useful for us to. We want to make. A model out of if something's work in a certain way, then we say oh okay well, that means that. If this function works like this, then functional probably work like that. So we make some models based on our experience and then, as we get. More experience with system, the model becomes more complete. So the designers might have a very elegant model of the system, but users only discover the model based on their interaction with the system, and so the users model is ad hoc. So if we choose a an appropriate metaphor, we can help the users. To create models that are. more elegant and more complete. So we can't. ever. can't ever dictate them a mental model to a user but week. encourage them. So there's in there's an idiom in English, can lead a horse to water, but you can make a drink. So unfamiliar with that one.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;One before.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So i'm not the only one all right, thank you. So some years ago, I was. New to Twitter and now i'm not on Twitter anymore, but I had a. So, based on my experience with other communication applications like email. I decided. or I developed a mental model of Twitter that. That I should send the same message to different users. And this promptly got me kicked off of Twitter. And there was, I was trying to promote an event. One day, so I begged and pleaded with Twitter to let me back on and and they did, and then I. So that was a problem that was an issue of mental model I think my mental model of Twitter was a little bit too much like email. Yes, the blog is due on the 22nd the Monday. So just under two weeks. So I should have surgery looking for the dates for assignments. You should be able to find them in the calendar. And then, if you click on the description. For the assignment it'll go to page on my website that has due dates also listed in one place. Okay, and if there's an issue with that. Please let me know with bug report email and the participation discussion. Okay, so I don't know what about the time duration for the blog the time, but the length so it's a written document. Okay. So. Any questions keep them coming in. Okay, anyway. So my model of Twitter was more too much like email and not enough like. So much like email that I got. I got flagged by their. Inappropriate mental model police. and Then, and still now they don't have. A great metaphor. For Twitter.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Is there any way you think they could improve this.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;well. So anyway, I did get a warning I guess. But then I didn't know how to fix it. And then they locked my account. So fixing it i'm not sure. So, sending a tweet on Twitter is like. broadcasting. So anyway i'm not the best for some asco Twitter, because I gave up on it. I haven't been on Twitter for several years, I tried it out.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;and
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I decided that I I couldn't. deal with it in a. productive way so. i'm sure there's sort of asked me. If my 24 hours or whatever I had. anyway. How many people are, how many of you are on Twitter. Twitter. How would you describe. The. metaphor for using Twitter. To explain to people who don't have it. standing on a street corner talking to yourself. In a loud voice or. Not in a quiet voice. hmm interesting okay. In terms of everyone anyone replying to everything or. Anyone can reply. So notice on the news reported. They might laugh ensure tweets. of people who. aren't. well known, perhaps, but there they've written a few good words about or. The written media friendly tweeted they can. That can be shared. And there's a nice interface to include tweets. In. In web documents and our web pages and blogs, and so forth. used to be. counted as a feature of sort of web two point O is that people could. You know, we don't have the same gatekeepers of knowledge same curators that people can. share their opinions. The same time, maybe that's. The experience of. The benefit experience for the 1010 years or so of having this web two point o where you can read and write on the web. And maybe there is some benefit to having curators and gatekeepers. Because it's not only about. Not only the amount quantity of information. But it's about. The quality of information. So maybe we just. Whereas we had some. People who are trusted to produce quality information. Standards through it was posted and now. That responsibility has been delegated to us a little bit more. And maybe not everybody. carries it out with the same degree of. rigor that's the word i'm looking for. anyway. So, moving on a little bit, I just want to say so. discord is like cooking but look it looks easy but it's not. So that says something about the author of the comment as well. As cooking isn't easy for the person that person. So that's not so much an interface metaphor is. A comment about. complexity. hello, but I think so. discussion going on offline on your courses about the metaphors for discord. So, to me, the thing to address in the metaphor is about. explaining this. The term server. That was discussed in class last day. So as being a console confusing part but, so I think if. we're going to have the discord interface be more intuitive. The metaphor could address the. idea was a server. and make that connection, a little more clear. Before we run out of time today I want to get into we're going to talk about. Today anyone able to access the video here. Okay, so this is a new version. I had seen there was. An episode on May Day, I think that was. The Canadian produced series on discovery or the active incidents leading up to this. This seems to be more. I don't think there's any life as well. Come on every call there's. kind of a restatement of facts here. But the idea was. That they were going in for landing on a on a night when. It was. There is no clear, there is no moon. So it's very dark. And so, when they put the landing gear down. The light on the control panel didn't. In light up. And so they send somebody down into the control area below the cockpit to look to see if there is. If the landing gear is locked as the front landing gear was locked and it's so dark he couldn't he couldn't tell whether it was. locked properly or not. So it was an issue. hmm so that they tried to change the light bulb. But in the process of changing the light bulb. The disk engaged the autopilot. and They had a warning when they were, but I think. I can't remember exactly the. Though the Odyssey there at maybe 1000 feet. and The warning was. The first one, it was not sufficiently trying. To get the monitor task of changing the light bulb, which was stuck in the in the. In the dashboard. And then. When they when they very loud alarm went off at the pilots were there, the crew were. not able to get to themselves into back into the problem. Say well we're still we're still circling at whatever altitude right. and And, by the time they realized the real situation they didn't have enough time to act. So. Jesus that seems like a mean that's not the only example of an interface that causes. As deadly consequences. But it's. it's a good example of the pitfalls of. interfaces and thinking about what our ethical responsibilities are. when designing interface so pagans you have a comment.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah I have to disagree with that a little bit because they had a bunch of redundancies like that alarm you mentioned, they also mentioned that. The comm tower message the plane and asked if everything was Okay, but didn't mention they weren't following the directive of flying at 2000 feet. So it's like I don't think the interface has anything to do with it is they had redundancies to fix these things just nobody. You know, they all miss messed up like there's more than one person I thought i'd say.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah Well, no, I wasn't. Trying to assign blame to anyone in particular, but mean the fact that the message from the control tower was another example of. You know, without interesting okay yeah yeah we're okay. Without. Well, there was the radar there was a radar issue. I think that. Or that there had been radar issues at the. Air Traffic Controller decided was not. The information on the screen was not reliable. So, to me, the issue is. President assigning blame. Just thinking about. The idea of the. flight crew so they're organizing. cells to change the light bulb in the control the dashboard. Or the instrument panel. And they've engaged the autopilot. So they have some expectations about the autopilot. But they didn't realize that by bumping the the stick. That the disengage the autopilot. So I mean it's an issue it's an issue of training graphs. You know server idea about. How much we can rely on an autopilot. Every single day the technology is great. We set it and forget it. and And that can lead to problems. Just like when the self driving cars. If we. If we had the idea that they're going to. continue to work without any kind of supervision. And, by the time we were asked to, or we realized that the revisions needed, we might not be able to get back into the. Take control and we need pre avoid a problem. Does that make sense. gone on too long here and let's see. These three quotes from Jeff raskin so Jeff raskin was one of the designers of the apple MacIntosh. In the early 80s. his son appears in the. Social dilemma documentary. Anyway, if you watched either the Steve Jobs movies, a few years ago Jeff raskin had a small part. As a character on screen. So the first thing is he talks about interfaces humane if it's responsive to human needs and considered a human frailties. So his first law of interaction is he called it. So computer shall do no harm. shall not harm your work North your inaction allow your work to come to our. Which is an homage to as them off and its laws of. androids. And then he said as a good second law might be a computer should not waste your time or requiring you to do more work than a strictly necessary. So we're I think. What I think is an ethical. consideration here is. When we. certain amount of work. To be so low that we disengaged people from. Their oversight role. So, in the case whenever supervising on autopilot. or revising a self driving car. And we should be engaged. engaged in oversight so that's the threshold for strictly necessary work. So required, you know doing. require you to do. More or less work than a strictly necessary. So we don't often think about. Humanity of an interface new faces you mean we don't think about. just trying to you a nice and convene considered of human frailties. Of that much. So Keegan you really did anyone tell Microsoft, the last one.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, that was a joke because Microsoft waste my time all the time. alright.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I. did anyone see Dave plumbers talking December. At the end of the Semester. it's online i'll i'll share the link with you and i'll go and find it, but do you use a Microsoft employee for 10 years, I think. And he created Microsoft task manager and. So on, but he added it. He told a joke about the. helicopter was. And lost its navigation and so they were near an office building where there was somebody in the Office could see them, and so they wrote a sign. Where. You know, to find out where they were. And the guy in the office replies you wrote a message saying you're in a helicopter. you're flying a helicopter. And then the pilot made some adjustments and flew back, who made it to the airport safe and sound. And how how did he know. From that message you knew that because the help was correct, but not useful. That he was at Microsoft, and so we made an essay correction to this course, based on that information. So I had i'd heard variations of that job before but. Never with a helicopter also as a small plane. Anyway, I thought, because a Microsoft employee. Shared it that I would like, I could share it as well. I think I have a poll from the other day that I didn't get to answer, so let me call that. relates to the moral operating system video. We didn't discuss this aspect, so much. So it's about. How do we make decisions or how do we answer why. That make sense. So let me just share that with you. I think I was typing too quickly here to. I could have given more. Or, more detail so Dr D ontology the ontological approach is saying. there's a right way and a wrong way to do things so. there's an objective standard that we need to follow so that's. that's one way to answer the why. utilitarian. says what what's. what's the benefit or the harm. And we want to greatest benefit with the least harm. We have to apply. particular set of rules to make decisions about. How to behave or why we should take on or not take on something like this. Whatever that question is if it's. A new question. hasn't been. decided before then we need to. find a place for in terms of. Well, like doing the metaphors. For interfaces that are our new. So we have to make a connection or an argument. A common discussion now is. Are we.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;You know.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;A common question is. Are we facing new problems. And the problems that we face now new or they just new versions of the same old problems. So let me create that poll. This one. Okay, so most popular was utilitarian. And I have to stop sharing if I want to add another poll, so let me do that quickly. examples. So. Is. Information on the Internet, these days. Is that a new version of the old same old problem. Or is it fundamentally different because of the scale. Where it is the Internet and computers change. The quality, not just the scale of the problem. About. visible to you because i'm sharing and selected zoom windows. When I share the polls that become. visible. So some examples of brand new problems. Surveillance capitalism even heard that buzz words oh. we're getting out of time here, so let me share end the poll. and share it. share the results. So we're out of time for today, so thank you very much and we'll see you on Thursday. Okay, everyone stay warm and stay well. And thanks for today.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you have a good day.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;thanks you too. Take care everyone.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.

    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Right after the break on the Monday, I believe
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;what should be the time duration for the blog
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;900 words
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;ok
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;If you go to Daryl's website everything is there for the assignments. There are clear rubrics and criteria.
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;it seems odd Twitter wouldn’t give you some sort of warning
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;is the length should be 900 words?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;is there some way you think they could improve their delivery to make the mental model more clear?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;my youtube account was similarly banned and they never gave me a reason even after I emailed them like five times

    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;I browse it but don't have an account
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;Trump free
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Standing on a street corner talking to yourself?
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;I have account but dont post anything lol
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;You can communicate with anyone but only by yelling in short sentences, any sort of nuance is pretty much hopeless
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;It's way more informal than email/FB/any other messenger. You just shout out things to the world that are on your thoughts. "Change the world 140 characters at a time"
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Its where everyone replies to everything and can just weight their opinion on any post
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;formal site than facebook, and can give reply and get opinions. have real personalities with wide sources.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Did anyone tell Microsoft the last one
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;hahahhaha
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;omg
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;hahaha
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;yes it was great
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I wish, I was busy that day
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;hhahahahah
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Strictly deontological or utilitarian approaches aren't the best imo
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;what about the attendance
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;you must hav emissed it rhythm, he did it ages ago
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry rhythm we already did it
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Just keep scrolling up if you were here
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;can you specify what you mean by "new" problems?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Is this the first time some types of problems are being considered
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Very mixed results on the poll
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I'm torn on this poll tbh, I think there are some new problems and some that have existed since computing started tbh
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I saw the poll
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;What are some examples of brand new problems?
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Personally I'd say same myself.  People stay the same, its only the medium that's changed.  The scale in which some problems are apparent has changed though definitely
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;surveillance capitalism meaning like, data mining in order to drive purchases?
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;One example with a new problem would be that instead of worrying about criminals in immediate proximity to us, we can potentially be targeted by criminal organizations or nation states from anywhere in the world
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;How about surveillance capitalism?
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you! You too
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl!
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks prof, see y'all next week
