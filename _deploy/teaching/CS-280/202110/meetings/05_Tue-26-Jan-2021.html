      I agree with almost everything about the filter bubble. This being removed from seeing both sides of an argument has caused the divide in the world to become bigger and bigger. This divide is causing most of the issues within north America. So many lies and false hoods being created are easily believed because all people see is the same rhetoric being spewed from the mouths of people whom, in my opinion, are doing it for their own self interest and playing it off as greater good. The one thing I don't agree with is Netflix not having filters. When...

      Hey everyone,For today’s discussion I wanted to bring up the idea of polarization, how it relates to social media, and the ethical questions that developers working on social media platforms should ask themselves. Polarization is basically the division of people into groups that sharply contrast in terms of their beliefs and viewpoints. In the video ‘Beware Online Filter Bubbles ’ it was discussed how online companies such as Facebook and Google filter what you see based on what their algorithms have decided you should see. Over time, these algorithms get an imprint of what you like and only offer you...
    </li><li>
      In our discussion about the purpose and moral impacts of computing, I was struck by how many forms of tool can have positive and negative moral impacts on the world depending on how the tool is used. A hammer can be used both to construct and destroy things. An internet-connected home security system can enable us to monitor the safety of our homes in real time from far away, but also provides a gateway through which a sufficiently skilled and resourced malicious hacker can invade our privacy. A system used by a government to monitor the activities of citizens can...
    </li><li>
      Beware online filter bubblesIn this video I thought he made a very good point about algorithms tailored to peoples personal preferences especially when its done without their knowledge and consent, but I think his concerns are most applicable when it comes to news, educational, and informative content. I don't think it has the same weight when discussing platforms like Netflix that are primarily used for entertainment, in those cases personalized content suggestions absolutely makes sense and its hard to see how there are any significant negative ramifications. If people want content from a genre they don't normally watch they can...
    </li><li>
      Beware online filter bubblesThe filter bubble exists, on all social media apps. Eli Pariser brought fore this topic in front of social media executives is good. They are the one that controls how this sorting algorithm works. I do agree that the filter bubble blocks the user from access all information. However, some people are not comfortable receiving all information. They like what they like. And it is the job to collect cookies and other data to create your bubble in the online work. The main job of social media platform is to get you to stay on it as...
    </li><li>
      In the breakout room today, our group chatted briefly about whether or not computing requires a moral framework to support it. I noted that a lot of professions require a membership to a type of self-regulating body, and yet computing as a profession doesn't have this same requirement. There are indeed societies that you can join, but there is not really a self-regulating body in the same way that there are with other professions. Another student pointed out that in the case of other professions, there is often a barrier to entry that is quite high, whereas with computing, nearly...
    </li><li>
      I think the first video of Eli Pariser is spot on and something I have worried about more and more over the last few years. This is also especially relevant today when you look at countries like America that seem more polarized than ever before. You can have two groups of people cannot even agree on what is reality. I think this is largely due to these “filter bubbles” helping reinforce beliefs people already hold and repel them from beliefs contrary to their current ones. When I was a teenager, I naively and smugly thought my older family members would...

      VyomeshFirst video ‘filter bubbles’: One can understand the concept of connection to world with internet. There are majority of all platforms can see your activity and suggests the outcome to you. It notices the link one clicks or searches on internet. I learned that the filter bubble is the unique online stage that represent you by your searches, history and your data. It limits you to your world only that is one’s relevance. The online platforms do have filter algorithm to hide important, uncomfortable, challenging and other views. It should be transparent enough that one can see else from the personalization....

      Key points that stood out:Filter Bubble- "A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to you interests right now than people dying in Africa" - Mark Zuckerberg, FacebookZuckerberg knows what most people care about I guess... The fact that this was the purpose for making the new feed just shocked me because it sound somewhat true formost people.- Companies like FB &amp; Google algorithm's functions as to remove the links/data that one clicks less on.- Internet is programmed in a way where it is showing us what it thinks we want to see rather than the...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned in this past meeting is the morality of computing. Its important because its not something I originally would think is important but when presented the idea and its implications its easy to see why we need moral computing. When we don't have a code of computing standards and ethics we run the risk of problems like those illustrated in the "beware of online filter bubbles" video. Because Facebook did not have any strong moral guideline to not censor information of individuals without user consent the problem of "filter bubbles" arisen without many people noticing....
    </li><li>
      The most important thing you learned from this past meetingEli Pariser discovered the filter bubble because the online companies like Facebook and Google provide information to the users as per their search history and behaviour, type of computer and location, and things reached to them only as per their interests and search areas. Users have no outside world image means they cannot get information that is irrelevant to them, which can be anything.The concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understandAll of the algorithms make filter bubbles.What you would like to know more aboutWhen...
    </li><li>
      With regards to if we need a moral operating system when coding, I think it vastly depends on what we are looking at doing. If we are just doing small personal projects, like making unit conversions, scripting ASCII characters to make an image, or testing ourselves by coding stuff in an assembly language, the moral implications of that are very minimal. If we are dealing with group projects, or anything that the public would end up interacting with, it becomes a bit more important to take into consideration the implications of what is being made or what it could be...
    </li><li>
      From past meeting, I watched 2 videos “Beware online filter bubbles” and “What obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good?” by Eli Pariser. In the video “Beware online filter bubbles” Eli talked about how internet keep tracks of our information and how internet is using invisible algorithm to personalize how different people get different results on internet. Filter bubble is basically an online algorithm/editing that represents you by your searches and history. It separates what you have been using/searching most and show you those data more often than showing other things. On the other video “What obligation...
    </li><li>
      For the first video about filter bubbles on the web or social media apps, I  think having filters on the internet and social media platform is a really interesting concept and that also shows the endless application of computing. Filter bubble allows personalized contents to be shown on a users timeline or search result and this is widely adopted by the big companies such as Facebook, Instagram, Google and twitter . But the issue I recognized is that having a filter bubble on a web platform that doesn't give freedom to modify/ choose which filters are enabled eventually makes you...
    </li><li>
      Beware of filter bubbles - we should yearn to learn outside our filter bubble, not seeing only what is tailored for us but also make research on information we don't get to see often. Internet is good if we can learn about things and places we don't get to see often. As an African, I experience this quite often, most people only know as much as their internet and televisions show them. They paint their entire image about that place from what they see and they fail to make some research for themselves.Obligations social media have to the greater good...
    </li><li>
      Through this meeting, I learned the purpose of computing. Computers can greatly liberate productivity, and it is much faster and more accurate than humans to solve complicated questions by computers. Computers have become an indispensable part of all fields of society. In the future, I want to know more about the risk of computers.
    </li><li>
      I found it interesting how these online environments have sort of evolved past their intended purpose. By that, I mean how facebook, twitter, and the like are all corporations, and features they implement are profit driven. On the other hand, they have become important tools for communication for users, and the moral operating system would be more for the user's benefit than necessarily the app's or company's benefit.
    </li><li>
      I agree that the filter bubble could be harmful to society. With more globalization, it is important for people to be more open-minded and to be able to see situations in various perspectives. Filter bubble creates personalized worlds where people are surrounded by their own ideologies and with others who share the same views. In a multicultural society like Canada and the US, this can only cause more ignorance, hatred, and division among people with different backgrounds, political beliefs, and religious beliefs. It also hinders people from learning new things. If you are only exposed to familiar things and your...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 4 i learnt about the importance of computing. During the breakout session we discussed the need of computing and most of us thinks same about it: i.e. we use code or compute to create webpages and coding is almost everywhere. it has become the pivotal part of our lives. there is a great future in this field.from the filter bubble video, it can be concluded that the internet is limiting us. we are not able to see the things that we should see, but we are encountering with the information that internet thinks we should know; in short...
    </li><li>
      After watching the bubble filter video i came to understand what exactly happens what kind of thing runs in our back. My views on that is yes for sure we are not getting all the things which we should get like other people to read, to understand and also there is an issue of privacy but if there are certain types of actions taken against it, might it could be a advantage for example if google is using personal information in a encrypted form and we are searching anything what we need the platform knows what exactly the user is...
    </li><li>
      In our last meeting Dr. Hepting was asking the class about, what is our understanding of the purpose of computing. We discussed about this topic in different breakout season with our group partners. There was also two video that he wanted us to watch and talk about that topic based on those two videos.There was two ted talk videos, “beware online filter bubble” and “What obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good?”In the first video the speaker was talking about the social media, entertainment source and web browsers that’s how they keep track about our interests and...
    </li><li>
      The first video "beware of online filter bubbles is related to the online platforms that shows us the things that what they want to show us but not a actual information they show us. usually that information depends upon our previous search history and what we clicked at first. we all get surrounded by a information of junk food.The second video is related to that right know we need a new tool to gather society but instead internet is making us all apart by transferring wrong information. our society need more social gatherings so we have to make products that...
    </li><li>
      The speaker tells about the concern of the "Filter Bubbles" on the online media, which the user can not control what information they want or not, but the information are filtered by the algorithm automatically. What we need in today's society on the internet is the public ethics that we can control what information we want or not, rather than filtered by the algorithm, we need options for the online media, the right to choose.
    </li><li>
      Filter bubble by Eli PariserEli Pariser in his tedtalk talked about the most disturbing and concerning thing about today's generation which is the privacy of an individual and the uniformity of the web. One documentary which relates to this topic is "The Social Dilemma". The internet was this diverse thing that unified us all, it was something that connected us all, but does seem to be the scene. The internet helped us to see everything in the world and it was great for democracy, but these days Facebook and Google have been personalizing the internet for everyone. At first, it...
    </li><li>
      In the second video, a city management is compared to a computer software. The built environment of the city is compared to computer code, the city programming is compared to computer code, and the Mayoralty of the city is compared to computer moderators. Its interesting to make a connection of a computer program running as an entire city does. The fact he raises afterwards about no one taking the responsibility of what people are actually doing on these platforms is very tricky. As it would involve a lot of regulations and monitoring. Ethics and morals does not hold same standards...

      As discussed in the previous forum , the main purpose of Computing in my opinion is for the endless process of development of both software and hardware application and devices.My Question to you Professor Daryl is what is the purpose of computing to you ?
    </li><li>
      "Filter Bubbles"The TED talk speaker raised some interesting points throughout the video. As the title of the peice suggests, the main topic being internet filtering. This filtering comes with a variety of problems, depending on how you look at it. One could argue that the internet is a better experience if algorithms are feeding you what you like, the things you want to see. However, the obvious problem with things like this is that you surround yourself with similar ideologies, likes, or interests; and essentially isolate the differences. You only see "agreeable ideas, not challenging ideas" ("Filter Bubbles"), one never...
    </li><li>
      At the meeting 4, the professor asked us to watch a video by Eli Pariser "Beware online 'filter bubbles''. In this video, Eli Pariser told us a concept called "filter bubbles". So what is "filter bubbles“? It's a state of intellectual isolation that can result from personalized searches when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior, and search history. And let the users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. In...

      Hi all, here's my thoughts on the Social Media video:The problems highlighted in the video are 100% accurate. Social Media is getting out of hand even for the very creators at it's core. It is a really powerful tool which when used correctly can have a huge impact in solving many of our global and even humanitarian crises. That being said, there's also the flipside which is more of what we're seeing in our day to day life; social media disrupting lives all across the globe.The point at which it is right now, it will not be retired anytime soon...

      Eli Pariser in first video explains about "Filter Bubble". He wants people to know that webpage adapts according to user usage.He also gave an example of his own, in which Facebook removed Conservative links posted by his friends, because Eli had been clicking more Liberal linksthan Conservative links. This is all due to invisible algorithmic editing which is used by all webpage creators.Nowadays , Google uses 57 signals to know your search results. Using this signals, they can also know your age, location, PC's information and which browser you are using.He also told about incident that happened with his two...
    </li><li>
      Last meeting we discussed some of the concepts that were in the filter bubble video. I found one thing particularly interesting during this discussion, that being whether or not code is unbiased or not. When I really think about this I can only come up with one conclusion. My thoughts on this are that no code can be made to be unbiased because it is made by a person. People by nature have their own personal views on any given thing and this whether intentional or not directly affects the tasks they do in this case being coding something. That...

      Actually it was nice experience I had a group and we created a word document for writing out our thoughts on the 2 videos which were uploaded. We discussed the positives and how can data be used nicely what are future possibilities in improvement. How can we make decision making useful and so on. So it was nice experience meeting new people and interacting with them
    </li><li>
      For the last meeting, we discussed the student blog description and how the internet society developed. Also, I have watched the video Dr. Hepting provided for us: “Beware online filter bubbles” and “What obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good?” Here are my analysis of videos:For “Beware online filter bubbles'':the most important thing you learned from this past meeting:I’ve learned the internet search web will offer results that their filter algorithm gives you that you don't really need. It is based on gathering information from the first click you made and using one sugar one pain strategy,...
    </li><li>
      we discussed our understanding of the purpose of computing in small groups where we had to share our thoughts and get to know one another. Apart from this, we were asked to watch the video about filter bubbles. Definitely want to learn more about filter bubbles in the next class.
    </li><li>
      Online filter bubbles is a really relevant question in nowadays. It explains how algorithms feed different information to different people. It shows what the internet thinks what we need to see rather than what we should see. It limited people interact with people that have a different idea with them. It is one of the reasons that people's idea becomes more radical because people are being fed with the same information over and over again. This creates misunderstanding and untrust between different people since they can learn different information but does not know people are the other side feel.
    </li><li>
      WOW! That was my reaction after watching the filter bubble video. We really really need to keep an eye out for the invisible news feed, about how the tech companies are showing us what THEY think is relevant to us. The tech giants are literally dominating what we see, how much we see and they are narrowing down our thoughts. Isn't it scary that these companies control our thoughts and emotions by showing us what they want us to see? What I deduce from the Filter bubble video is that we should have control of what enters and exits our...
    </li><li>
      I had added my response to Filter Bubble videos on Meeting 3 forum. So I will just repeat that response here:The most important thing that I learned was that the few big tech players have a lot of control over how people experience the internet. Although it may be unintentional, but the design decisions of these big tech players, as well as their drive to generate increasing profits has put the people’s natural shaping of opinions and attitudes at stake.I would like to know more about how the filter bubbles and other similar phenomenon are impacting our lives. Additionally, how...
    </li><li>
      I think we can do more group discussion in the class, which help us understand the course and others.
    </li><li>
      In these two videos, the first video was about filter bubbles. It is kind of a condition in which a online user only sees the information of their interests instead of all kind of information that we need to see. This situation is caused by invisible algorithms, who are editing the web. It’s like creating a personal unique list of our interest. For example, as eli pariser said, if two persons are searching for same thing in their individual browsers they are more likely to get different search results and that is because these digitals algorithms shows results on the...
    </li><li>
      from the posted two videos, one video was about the filter bubbles. which is algorithms that run and control the provided service. it is more likely to say that these are web editors, which edit the information provided to every specific online user. for example, as discussed in the video, two individuals can have different search results for the same search topic. and i completely agree with eli pariser's concern about the the type of information that we are exposed to , nowadys, beacuse it is not worth using the technology for the thing that only interests us. instead we...
    </li><li>
      well from there are two videos that was about the filter bubbles from which we get that the online user only sees that the information of their interests from that the means of all kind of information that we need to see and we can say that the algorithms who are they editing the web. its like creating a unique list of our interest. and in their individual browsers they are more likely to get different search results and it is because that the these digitals algorithms show results on the basis of our search history , location and all...

      https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/developer-ethics/.With all this talk of ethics and morality within programming I thought I would share an interesting link that links to multiple cases of ethical approaches to coding and cases of unethical behaviour in programming.
    </li><li>
      1. the most important thing you learned from this past meeting- what is potential of computer science, in next few years- important for everyone to learn coding- profit vs ethics2. the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understandhow can we choose between ethics and profit, in a particular situation what we can do, should we hinder someone’s privacy to make profit or not3. what you would like to know more aboutunderstanding moral operating system in detail, and how can we use technology so it does not empower us.4. something you encountered that is...
    </li><li>
      Well from what i learn about in class by discussion with my other classmates is that this that we should have these tools because its better then not having them but we still need the eithics system to make sure nothing bad happen.

      The point is filter bubble is an online climate where individuals are presented to impart their insights and data that adjust to their current convictions. for the most part, it structures when algorithms used to curate the substance data created by clients via online media dependent on their perspectives and viewpoints. Google recommended that personalization improves the experience of clients however an excessive amount of personalization can make filter bubbles. what's more, it is unsafe for people groups and society. what happened when we search something on the web when a site algorithms specifically guesses what data clients might want...
    </li><li>
      In the filter bubble TED talk the guy talks about Facebook and google filtering our search results and news feed based on all kinds of different personal data so they can show us stuff that most relates to the individual user. As mentioned in the video this creates a problem since users don't get to see all of the information, all the information displayed is specially selected for each user but there is so much that users don't see that might be important. This is especially prevalent today with the big social media companies gatekeeping information from users that algorithms...
    </li><li>
      Eli Pariser begins his talk with the variety of the links provided by the Search engines such as google, Yahoo etc. to the users. He begins his talk with the example of his friends that how the variation can be seen by searching the same topic. Later, he focusses on the concept of the ‘Filter Bubble’. He focused on how the search engines detects the activity by sharing his own example with the Facebook.In his second video, he talks about internet and how it makes away from each other. The world of Internet is big, but we need to get...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned from the past meeting is the way in which online platform works and shows different results to same thing searched online. The results which is shown to us are directed by different AI machines and sometimes, this filters removes the important stuffs we should know about.The other thing which is also a topic to be looked at is the way in which online platforms are structured. The software developers should thing of the ethical norms which must guide the way in which the softwares must works. It should create a healthy environment for people...
    </li><li>
      In our fourth meeting we discussed in our own student groups how much power and control (or lack thereof) over people's opinions and personal data and what should be done for it. A big idea in place was to put a moral structure of some kind for all social media company ethos to derive from.
    </li><li>
      In the first video beware of filter bubbles, revolves around the issue with how tech companies gradually personify what each individual sees on their feed according to their interest based on what they watch or click on the internet. Although making people see what they are really interested in isn't really a bad idea it blocks out the other information they could be knowing especially when the information is filtered without these individuals even knowing. the video throws light in this and suggest that tech companies should allow people see not just what interests them but a little bit of...
    </li><li>
      “Beware of online filter bubbles”: This clip shares about how is Internet working in the modern world at the moment. Nowadays, lots of people use Internet everyday and every time. For that reason, Internet becomes the valuable resources for many people who working in this field. Many platforms such as Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Amazon start to collect users’ personal information in order to improve their systems as well as personalize the platform for users. This could be convenience since people can easily enjoy things that related to their interests while they are using Internet. However, users should be aware of...
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the concept of filter bubles highlights some issue regarding searching information .Different people gets different result when they search the same thing. There are some algorithms that act as a gatekeepers that control the flow of information. People only get relevant information but not that information that let them know the other points of view. Filter bubble has created a state of isolation from information that diagrees with their viewpoints.It has created a sense of not knowing the good piece of information. The algorithms must embedded some ethics that could have a sense of the public...
    </li><li>
      In the video filter bubble, the speaker inclines more towards personalization of the web. He focusses on how the internet takes our input as the information and show the feed what they think is right for us. I feel, the approach they take is more psychological rather than technological.He also reflects on a filter bubble which is covered with various web application including facebook, google, netflix, etc.. and how it works to attract our attention and gain more engagement. Additionally, he also we are covered with filter bubble. They consider us as their products rather than customers. He also compares...

      Filter BubbleIn this Ted talk Eli Pariser describe how internet is changing not in a good but in a bad way. All big companies uses our search history and saw us the thing which they like. In other way we are just watching what we like but internet is social platform where everyone goes to watch something new, we don't just want to see what we like, users what to see everything flouting around them. If the new search is showing the thing based on old search or if we browse something on any social media and getting the result...
    </li><li>
      My understanding of the video filter bubble and what obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good.Filter Bubbles: The video talks about how as individuals, if multiple users use google to search for the same piece of information they tend to get different results and this algorithm is called a filter bubble. This occurs due to the fact that the internet shows us what it thinks we want to see and not necessarily what we want to see. In conclusion, users should be able to control on what gets taken out and what's included in the result of...
    </li><li>
      After watching the video "Beware online filter bubbles", I am very surprised that the information returned to me is not the same as the results that other people seeing, even we are searching for the exact same topic, just because we are in different cities and we are using different computers. It is so unbelievable that the information has been personailzed by algorithms based on our daily behaviours. What's worse, those results may not be what we need to know. Instead, this is the information that machines and algorithms want us to see. And the filter bubbles are controlling people...
    </li><li>
      From the video we learned about how the search results depends on many various features and how different it can be from one another. We also learned about filter bubble which let us be in our own world and shows the results depending on your history or what browser you use and many other things. And the main point here is we don’t make the choice of what we want to see, they make the decision for us. So as a society we need to tell people to look at this point and show the results irrelevant to what place...

      In this meeting, we were split off into groups and told to discuss about the various things. The group I was in, ended up talking about how there is a bias in the way the current systems are set up and how this bias will propagate into any system or any 'moral' system that we design if we let it go unchecked. There is need to talk about this and put more effort into creating new sets of data which overcome this bias and have a fair representation for everything.
    </li><li>
      My observation for the Beware online filter bubbles video is social media has to be motorized and sized by the arithmetic filters which can be dangerous because it depends at certain orders or like a first click to collect our data.For the second part, the summary can be the obligations do social media platforms the organized structure of our cyberspace. Social media become the new way we spend our time with. Thus, Taking design cues from scientists, technologist shows how the problems we are encountering on digital platforms are not all that new, and how, the model of thriving towns...

      When we using the social media apps, whether facebook or twitter or Google etc. All of these companies recommend something to us, sometimes even the advertisements. In fact, there are based on the algorithms so we might see different pages depends on our location or searching history. It is not always a good thing because since we are see different things, it could have something like media bias, and people cannot judge things properly. So that instead of stuck in the information that these companies provide to us, we should have seen more than it.
    </li><li>
      I never imagined how social spaces have such great effects on the society. In the video it sure seems like some websites are messing with the web results or preferences but I can only think that it is a debatable topic. Who wouldn’t want to have their options based on their preferences? But at the same time people do thrive for knowledge beyond their preferences. In contrast to Daniel’s and Scott’s search results, what if Daniel had a family in Egypt but the google results didn’t show any news article but only tourism results. He would have missed out on...
    </li><li>
      In "Beware online filter bubbles" i learnt about personalization, the speaker said personalization is the internet showing what we want to see not what we need to see, different people get different things, he said a lot of companies are doing this now, I also learnt about filter bubbles , this is your own unique information that you live online, depends on who you are and what you do, you don't decide what gets in or out of your filter bubble. we need companies to allow our filter bubble to have a sense of public live so we can have...
    </li><li>
      So for meeting 4 we discussed a bit about what the class will be with assignments projects and final exam, then we started to discuss the videos for meeting four on filter bubbles and how social media platforms have an obligation to the greater good.  while discussing these videos we split off into groups and in are group we discussed how with filterer bubbles that when it comes to important discussions like politics there shouldn't be a filter that only shows what the person likes it should show all sides of the topic and then let the user make there...
    </li><li>
      After watching the filter bubble video, it brought to my attention to what I believe is a crucial problem. Limited access to information based on our filter bubble can greatly hinder the information we have that influences our opinions. I've noticed this with people in my family forming opinions on the virus, politics, etc. A lot of people are influenced very easily by what they see on the internet and they rarely go out of their way to research beyond what first pops up for them in a google search. Another factor of this information problem is that most people...

      filter bubblesIn the video filter bubble, the host Eli Pariser talks about how the so-called free internet is being manipulated by filter bubbles. All the information we see, depending on various criteria and user data, can be very different from person to person. Now, as he said in the video, according to Google CEO, learning about a backyard squirrel can be more relevant to us than seeing people dying. Now, that is true in a sense. We do get numb by repeating news no matter how horrifying it is. So what we are getting is a balanced diet, a bit...
    </li><li>
      The videos are same as last week mainly describing the effect of internet algorithm in our future lives and how filter bubbles stops us from growing.
    </li><li>
      In social media, messages are disarray. As the talker said, the facebook now is make him start think of 1917s NewYork.;Messages are everywhere, netizen will focus on hot event rather than focus on their interest. Politics, democracy, emotion, gender all exposure under the internet. The obligation that social media platforms have to do first is filter the messages, a peace world need a peace environment to support. Because in 21 center, internet can be entertainment, it also can be weapon. Some fake report might effect serious consequence, and netizen are not able to determine weather the report is real or...
    </li><li>
      These news sources on the internet are all we have and get, it may be false and it may be the correct only way to know is to do more research than the news article has given. Politically most news sources favour one side and will try and filter out any bad that comes for example fox news. These news sources stay relevant because they have a fanbase that fuels them to continue putting out the same things. We are given a choice when we first log in and after that everything is filtered to what we like reading, these...
    </li><li>
      The fourth meeting presented a great opportunity to learn from one another about the videos from last lecture. Eli Parsier’s filter bubbles and on the accountability of internet organizations were the main topics discussed. The critical hidden gem in the meeting were when we presented our ideas in a group based session. My team composed of four people, all of which coordinated effectively and efficiently to pop into a Google Docs room, and began jotting down discussion points. Each of which we discussed and debated for a few moments. The key takeaways from that breakout room discussion would be how...
    </li><li>
      Internet is a network that connects the world but the information flowing needs to be noticed. There are 57 signals google looks on further yahoo is a biggest news cite. Everyone form their an unique world of information. Social media is putting humans against each other by viral misinformation flowing over. As spaces shape behavior, we need digital environment that makes us comfortable and respects diversity.
    </li><li>
      In first video he made a point about algorithms that tailored to peoples personal preferences especially when its done without their consent but i think raised concerned are raged from past few years after USA election which proves how dangerous it could be the filter bubble.In second video speaker comparing the online space with physical space.A platform with strict policies and and platform the less strict policies all have their own pros and cons.Platform like facebook which led to have some bad result is also a powerful tool to raise your voice on controversial stuff.
    </li><li>
      can you explain more details about the assignments and the blogs.
    </li><li>
      During my group's breakout rooms, one of the other students described what sort of things the "Filter Bubbles" videos talked about, and really I thought it was mostly just about targeted advertisements and such. These are already a sort of scary thing, researching something on your computer and seeing advertisements for those products on your phone later that day just scrolling through social media. After watching the videos though, I saw that it was really about a much bigger issue, not just changing the sorts of advertisements you get but actually manipulating the information you're able to find on search...

      The Internet meant a connection to the filter bubble is our own unique universe of information that we live in online. Our filter bubble depends on who we are and what we do.The problem of filter bubble was discovered by some researchers and Netflix.We need the Internet to be that thing that we always want to be, we need it to connect us together, we need it to introduce us to new ideas, new people and different perspectives; we cannot achieve that if we live in isolation.The Internet is showing us what things we should see but not necessarily what...
    </li><li>
      The video provided me with deeper understanding of filter bubble. I agree with the video. I have personally experienced that social media platform presents information which they think I would want to look at. I see a divide between people. Many people on social media especially Facebook and Twitter believe in the propaganda, false claims, false news, hate speech etc that is shown to them. They are fed the information that strengths their believes and creates a filter bubble.In the last few years, it has become clearer to me that people are more divided than we think and this has...

      Now is the era of big data. Because of the vast amount of basic data and more advanced algorithms, computers can easily distinguish a person's information preferences and then accurately push the content he is interested in. For example, most website's home pages are no longer random and cluttered but tailor-made for people, which has the advantage of making it easy to find the content you like to read. But at the same time, it also brings many problems; the first one is that people's privacy or personal data may be leaked. For example, some companies may profit from users'...
    </li><li>
      Discussion with one another as to what computing really means is one way of getting to know better what possible perspectives could be, in my group everyone was keen on discussing the topic put forth during the lecture i.e. What is computing and what is the need. Everyone in the group were more than happy to explain themselves and make their point on the basic computing that goes around the word on a day to day basis. It was a pretty healthy conversation overall.
    </li><li>
      The first video talks about how the internet is being censored by the big companies to make it more personalized for us. In the 1950 we had the newspapers and editors as a gate keeper who censored what we could read and now we have the same kind of gate keeper who control what information we see and what information we don't and this is concerning because they're deciding what we should read, watch and listen instead of us doing it. The problem is that in 1950 the editors knew what was important they had some ethic but this is...
    </li><li>
      In this class, we've been thinking about the computer age, and the TED video that we've been watching is about thinking about privacy.As the Internet tries to adapt to individual preferences, it will leave us in a filter bubble: our information will be limited to what we like, a phenomenon that is bad for us and for democracy.

      In this video of Filter bubble Eli Pariser talked about the most worried thing about the current era which is Privacy of an individual Person. As we can see internet is a great thing to explore the world however, it has some disadvantages as well.Nowadays Some applications such as Facebook are personalizing Internet for Individual but it has more disadvantage with compare to their Benefit. All the result behind that is we cannot get a truth though we have searched for that.
    </li><li>
      There are lot of things that I learned from this meeting. I will describe in the upcoming paragraphs. The video (Beware online filter bubbles) describes that how the information is flowing online. If we search anything from the internet at the same time, our results may be different. This is because the google look at different 57 signals, it depends on what kind of computer or browser person is using and what is the location of a person. There is some kind of personalization is done by the host companies. As Eric Schmidt said, "It will be very hard for...
    </li><li>
      There might be some issues on computer end but i think it can be minimized if there is proper education on how to use the computers security wisely such as not provide any information on websites which are not trusted i think most of the times its on users unawareness how information can be seen by third party users. I think if that part is resolved somehow the privacy concern would be much less
    </li><li>
      This meeting revolves around the topic of computing. Every individual has their own answer for the purpose of computing. But the most common answer to this question was that we can create websites or web pages using code and computers. Coding is everywhere, in every field. it has become an important part in every person's life.
    </li><li>
      If two person searches same thing at a time chances are they get different result by invisible algorithmic editing. That's a crazy thing to think that their is no original google anymore as each person has their tailored version of it. Hence we are witnessing the era where internet shows us what we want to see. You are in a 'filter bubble' where you don't decide what's in there, neither do you know what's left out. The editor's who initially controlled the flow of broadcast and now replaced by algorithmic ones in the internet which of course do not have...
    </li><li>
      Throughout this meeting, I was happy to be introduced to Eli Pariser's term "filter bubbles." This is a phrase that I had not yet encountered and a concept that I had yet to ponder on my own. After watching Pariser's TED Talks, I was prompted to think about the obligation social media platforms have to the greater good. Such platforms, which were once started to connect people worldwide, have now seemed to transform into online spaces for the consumption of entertainment and thus the production of profit. With this shift from education to consumption and entertainment, it is important to...
    </li><li>
      There were 2 videos for today's lecture the first one was the 'Beware online filter bubble' and the second one was 'What obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good?'In the filter bubble, it is shown how online search tabs work. How the online world collects our data such as our search history and based on our search history it shortlists what to be shown and what not to be shown. It is also mentioned in the video that the search result which we get are actually shorted by the algorithm. The algorithm is compared to a gatekeeper...
    </li><li>
      The idea of a moral framework in computing can create an interesting debate, but it can quickly become boring when opinions follow a straight line. The idea of right and wrong tends to be generalized in most circles when we are graded, and consistently regurgitated to avoid scrutiny. At the end of the day, we do we really care? The right opportunity or salary could easily sway someone’s opinion, and we all want something for free. How many people still have a Facebook account and would be willing to pay a monthly subscription to remove ads and alleviate their privacy...
    </li><li>
      This meeting was really productive and informative.See you in the next meeting.
    </li><li>
      The things I learned from this videos are herefilter bubbles :- I learned about the filter bubble is that there is invisible algorithmic editing in most of the sites like he said in the google example that google use the location, type of computer and which type of browser you using. In most of sites there are planned things like what they showing to us like in Netflix, they have already planned what they gonna show us on the screen and what next we have to see. And we didn't see any editing on it.And there are many obligations on...
    </li><li>
      the internet that we are using has clearly lots of pros ad cons and the list can keep going forever the first video the very important point i learned and its not debatle was the personalization filter, which is just a tiny part of the bubble filter and i think this is more dangereous because the knowledge regarding the web, internet, inforation is very less and itcreate chaos everytime something surafces.the second video of ted talk had some very good points and also which make sense about the structurely everything was build the more restrictions the more people tends to...
    </li><li>
      I am almost agreed with all about the filter bubble. We find ourselves in a filter bubble any time we're only surrounded by views and opinions we agree with, while being sheltered from opposing perspectives. Filter bubbles distort our understanding of the world and hamper our ability to make balanced decisions.
    </li><li>
      I learned about two things in this meeting:(1) There is a thing called filter bubbles that decides, what I see or don't see based on the data social platforms collect from my daily usage.(2) We need better online spaces to interact because in future they may become our home to socialise. In order to achieve that we need better infrastructure.How exactly does filter bubbles decide what we don't want to see?I would like to know more about the algorithm behind the information barrier.
    </li><li>
      This was about the filter bubbles. The user is only able to see the videos of their interest. All user have various searches in the search bar, which represents the field of their interests. Eli Pariser’s concern regarding the info that we see nowadays. However the second video was regarding the ted platform, where people can colab in order share data or talking with friends in other nation. Platforms like facebook, instagram and snapchat is the great example of ted platforms.
    </li><li>
      In today’s lecture, we learned about how Internet make us feel like we are in a filter bubble. They harness our input and show us the material which they think is suitable for us from the data they have from our previous records. On one side, it is remarkable how the internet shapes our life and on the other side, it could be a danger for us.We are still in stage where the technology is still evolving. I am quite scared about how AI would evolve in coming years. It is still skeptical how it would turn out in coming...
    </li><li>
      The question, Eli says, is that while the Internet reveals what we want to see, we don't really need to see what we need to see. The filter bubble is what he calls it. It's a bubble of exclusive knowledge of your own, so you can't see what isn't going into it. It was seen as a liberation from the power of people who owned and edited the content you saw when the Internet was created. 
    </li><li>
      The TED talk was very informative and a lot to know about. It is interesting to understand how the moral ethics are being violated in different part of the world using Web. The term "Filter Bubble" is affecting our world immensely and how one see stuff according to their own relevance.
    </li><li>
      In this class we learned about filter bubbles and how social media algorithms hide us from reality and news and promote products instead of giving us valuable information that might be useful to us for their own benefit. This was an individual gets habituated to this fake world and gets stuck inside this bubble created by these greedy companies for their own benefits. Which filters out the individual from the real world.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. here's a chance to test your microphone good morning. Good morning.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning morning.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;morning, sir.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning does anyone ever see the movie wanted pythons meaning of life. And it just occurred to me that. The fish in the tank and then we're going to say well look harold's being after around for good mornings and. Anyway, if you like, Monty Python naked that's the opening better than movies. was your weekend. Good morning. Okay, so I. tried to do things and yes there's a new password for attendance, which I will share with you shortly. Okay, so somebody sent me a direct message so. As I said before. I. turned it off, but I guess not. So please try to avoid sending the direct messages. feeling to communicate with me directly, outside of class, you can do, though, female. So that's the general rule just reiterate. Okay. going to be. engage the moment the password comes out and. can find it in your chat room chat archive then. Then you can put it in and do the attendance it tenses it's supposed to be a big thing. So. don't worry about. Past ones. Because this past this past. Okay. So just the comment of I appreciate everyone's engagement with the meetings. And I realized that I probably gave you the wrong impression start with. I said that I was like. On the day that was cut short because of my emergency, then I had to. I said well just summarize things. Really, I would rather have to. Not summarizing some matches. Tell me about what you. thought was the most important thing, or what you learned, or what was. hard to understand or well as exciting. You know you don't have to provide it along summary. Of what we discussed or what the movie what the videos showed. And so on so i'm just. cringing either say, less is more but make it with a bit more of a. Personal connection. So let me go to your courses. I can. change things up a little. bit here in the description. response. To the most recent meeting. And you can tell me i'm trying to get to the point where it to save so. So today's meeting five so you have until tomorrow night at one minute to midnight, in order to get ready response to. This meeting today. So your response can include one or more of the following most important thing you learned from the past meeting. concept from this past meeting that was most difficult for you to understand what would you what you would like to know more about something you encountered thats related to the meeting. My use of past meeting. over the top. More. Anyone suggestion more clear wording if the wording is not clear.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;make sense to me.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I read some of them and i'm. I made some. Some notes. All but I didn't well anyway. So I find it very interesting what you've written, so we just say that. Okay. I realize i'm not sharing my screen. put it into one form here the engagement meetings form. Originally, because I was advised that this is this would let me do what I want to do. But it's not letting me do exactly what I want to do so. So for meaning five here's the form.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;And click.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So i'm not asking detailed question here. i'm just asking for a response or responses, the discussion. And then response question mark is the question. Okay, so we'll have one of these forums for every meeting from now on. And they'll be set up, so that there. They become read only at the same time, the due date. i'm going so I know there's some discussion about breakout rooms. And so on there so i'm going to create a. Separate form under meetings. where you can. discuss a topic from. well. want to talk about what you discussed in the breakout room. Then there's this form here. Okay. So I said, the first assignment is going to be due on. Thursday February. And I thought that might be. You can still submit it then. Acceptable until February 25 22nd the first day back. So Monday is the first day back after the break. Okay. So this is to pick a topic from once you discover we're discussing are covering in class this Matthew one that we've already talked about. is currently or was recently in the news. find a personal connection to the topic. identify two to four reputable online sources to reference and supportive your topic. References or could be included as hyperlinks at the post close to the texts that makes reference. And then i've included some. Some principles for good writing for the web. And there's a sample blog that I wrote a little while ago. So what i'd like you to do is. To create to mark up the file html. And you can submit it as a file or is online text so you can paste it is online text or create a file. and upload that. So i've created individual student blogs. See space where you can. Work on formatting. So. Then. So there's a submission, you can use this. This your courses submission to either upload the file or paste is online text. And then you can optionally. copy or blog from your individual student blog and put it into your put into the class blog. And i'll be kind of evidence of participation. Okay, so. engagement of meetings is really just about making those responses and everything else is about participation. Okay. So, and just. just another comment about the engagement within the meetings. So there's 26 meetings, all together, and we started doing this meeting to. That. you'll have a few free free ones, so if you started meeting. And do the rest of them, then you'll still be able to get 10 marks. So. i'm so started, we started meeting to. i'm going to. So that means we get 25 different marks for these meeting comments responses. And i'm going to take the top 20. That make sense. So you don't have to. respond to every meeting to get full marks. respond to 19 meetings, then. You won't get full marks. I mean. Okay, so there's that. So I wanted to get make sure that was open clear for everybody for for progressed any further. window and it shows the people who are in class was on top of the window that showed what. Or it gives me updates or notification to what's going on and to. So. it's not. The best way to not the best place to put notifications, for me, anyway. Because, by the time I see that this one there and then cover it then Scott. Maybe that's a feature, not a bug. Okay. Okay, so I haven't. Completely gotten the plan and the summary sorted out yet so I started making notes about what was. I did do the plan. For today, which includes the videos. Alright, so then here's. I mentioned, please know the summary, the meeting is not what i'm after for an engagement, please read the description thanks for your engagement. So everything's appreciate it. it's just. Since there's like 150 students here. Almost it's low. Everybody writes the page then it's a little harder to get through them. And the message of oh what. What was the most important thing today. Anyway, okay. Second thing first, so this is what I got. On my computer last night. So for the client is vpn. client, so if i'm going to access. grade. input grades and do other kinds of things from home I better have a vpn running, otherwise I can't access can't login to the university systems. So already this permission is required for for for protection. So MAC os reading for the client from accessing some folders please enable full disk access permission for for decline processes oh. Another actually reading it out yeah I see that it's mentioned in the name. So. Oh. That kind of takes the wind out of my sails. But it's not very clear. It took me seeing this more than once, to see this actually mentioned. So anyway so pretending that I didn't see that. I can go by and. click on open security and privacy settings. On the left, here we can see full disk access. Which when it first came up I changed the see could see that it was highlighted I scroll a little bit to highlight this full disk access it wasn't even. Showing to begin with. And so I see for the client. And it's got a check mark. Listen here's one that this. And then here's the, the process is asking for. So now, I know that I can do that. So, my comment was. My feeling was that this is likely for the client. But. it's not quite clear that should be. The the association, I mean like I can just call it so for the client. So, again back to this one. Name clear enough. about putting it up here in the heading or something like that. name this name appears in the dialog box. I have a good amount of. Trust to do it. Making too much. So here, I was listening to ideas last night and CBC is driving around getting some cat food. And I thought it was a very interesting discussion about. Trust and scientific expertise. So there's a link here to CBC. invite you to read that. headline is interesting, is it the philosopher science. who's speaking, who gave a talk, I think it was a world vaccine conference recently. it's concerned that voice assistant encourages delegation of judgment to algorithms. So do we put too much trust in algorithms and is it only because of. alexa and other. Other cool gadgets. example of. Asking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. So if we ask the voice assistant for the chocolate chip cookie recipe replies immediately, but it doesn't say. You know this is highly rated or this was recommended by your mom or. This case came from a from the site that you, you seem you visit a lot or anything I just gives a recipe, and then. And then it's a concern to see. You know, are we concerned about these details or do we just accept the results given to us by alexa. Because it's got a fancy algorithm that must be Morse. more accurate than. People. Like like our mom or and or. friend who's a chef pastry chef. So I was thinking about. Creating a filter bubble experiment. So I think we can. We can try. The breakout room. Okay. So let me. write this out as i'm doing it. Okay, does that seem clear for a question.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;yep that's clear.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Are you wanting to skip over the ads or use the top add as a result.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I that.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;advertisement.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;advertisement results. URL here okay. Can I turn that off right. Okay, so take a man to do that now. Results are. sally's baking addiction all recipes so he's baking addiction or recipes. I got two contenders here.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;that's crazy how much they've converged like there's no there's no variety.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;mm hmm.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;There is some really good certain organization on sally's making predictions part.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Am I be. Here is one joy for sunshine.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So there's a third one.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I think sally's baking is shown to almost everyone, because it has the highest rating. And after that comes all recipes rating so maybe that's why people are getting only those two.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah it is. A question about. Which one comes first.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;relevancy if I saw a video and Google, it was mostly come from YouTube.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;So I think we get different results if we all looked it up on YouTube like.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;got an ad for Dell instead. Normal.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Know what's normal.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;wonder if logging into it and accounts might have affected your search results as well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah well, so you can try it in different cases.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I like the cold audit that we did, though, where it was just no extra factors just do it right now and see what you get.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so it's not we're not quite so much a filter bubble, and then I realized, too, that these disease recipe displays a little bit tougher to organize them. So did.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;And recipes recipes might also be less subject to a filter bubbles, and something more political.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so let's try another one what's a good. A good one that one inflamed tensions in the classroom. About. governor general of Canada. Since she recently resigned. or or how about. Something related to covert vaccines. We try could just do a covert 19. search. let's test here.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;19 is going to be location based if the location services are on its it's gonna show the local, provincial governments website at first.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I go to hulu international. I mean, who wanted organizations website.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;International and then coven 19 Ontario.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;yeah same here.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;something about looking up coven. Is that it's likely it's likely a curated topic, whereas the governor general they probably don't have staff curating that front page.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;hmm. All right, okay.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I believe that Google generally goes according to its running Google ranking algorithm which is said, and whenever someone searches. Like something like you search Google 19 vaccine right so for us it searches for the keyboard Secondly, uses your location. So just to show something related to you shortly your history and, for me, like the most recent ones or most visited websites. In this, where the Google ranks everything in in his website, like the multiple times us like most of the people, visited let's suppose know who website, then it will show that of force, so I feel that it's according to that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah well so google's algorithms trade secret for some, for the most part right. I mean, I mean search engine optimization can be done. In reasonable ways, but the precise details. Of what's going on aren't aren't known.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe related by one, so a TV series they I mean it was about searches and stuff and they showed that even the good guys change. domain CERT the preferences of a search engine by their own world so.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I started getting the forum replies for chocolate chip cookies in my email.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. There is a comment about how to. Set preferences to. For notifications, but let me just change the. requirements. OK, so now that i've got. That into properly. So let's look at some of these responses for covert 19 vaccine. writers from the UK. Canada public health. Some surprises, the number of arguments on this URL. html. wasn't a criticism is just a comment about. URLs with tons of arguments and I don't know if i'm copying that that might don't. pass on the arguments, so that things can be tracked. anymore than. They need to be. org.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;perhaps.org is the regulatory affairs professional society. And it tracks. The vaccine type and to the developers are and the authorization approval, where they're from etc. I thought it was a bizarre first option to get actually.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Does it government or private, who is.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Just clicking the who we are, it.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;looks private.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;As it's the largest global organization of and for those involved with regulation of healthcare related products. blah blah blah headquartered in suburban Washington DC with chapters and affiliates world worldwide.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It almost sounds like some kind of weird anti vax front doesn't.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think so. i'd be concerned if it was.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Was it's not doing a very good job at it, because it's showing where it's all approved.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;homepage from the website. pretty well. i'll put together website to be a. disease to call astroturf. Or the fake grassroots organizations. The Canadian association of professionals and regulatory affairs. hoping to find a Wikipedia page about wraps or something like that. blog post about. So. You may have something related to covert there. raps is a very. very popular alternative. Health Canada again CBC. saskatchewan. So Google ad services, I think this isn't click on an ad. i'm not sure. CDC. and Canada. anyway. Interesting so we have a winner in terms of. Consensus, but not. So now we've learned about wraps now it's, the question is. Since. How many people have heard of it has heard of wraps for for today.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;First time for me.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So that leads to a question. Do we decide whether that's reputable source. Just one website. How do we decide.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Basically, that really puts the onus on the searcher to do their due diligence to actually check the source.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah well as always right, whether you're looking for chocolate chip cookie recipes or. Something more crucial like. covert vaccine information.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Just gonna say something i'm in the government general of Canada, so I searched one from Korean IP and different from German and they don't match either and they're not very important to know.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Where where our the two searches done.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;For the gentleman one.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I mean vpn.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I didn't even get the link on the first page of Google, which I got in the Canadian ap.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, but what was your first. result from. Okay, let me go to that. i'm surprised that there isn't you. know in Germany, you get the Wikipedia page.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;No digital at all.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well here's one news related. Article the conversation. or not new news. opinion or or topical story. Okay, so this this thing URL looks like a search instead of the search results. Try. interesting. Jennifer. we're almost out. it's kind of unexpected well. An interesting exercise, I think. So i'm going to post a couple videos. So, based on. eli pariser second video about the social the. Role of. social media platforms, the responsibility towards a greater good and. design and so forth. And I would, I have a couple of videos in mind one by David Kelly, and the other by don Norman. About design, because he talked about designing spaces so. there's other videos that will be about designing. software. And then, how that relates to. behavior they can engender the software and genders. Whether it's like Twitter it's all over the place, or whether it's more like linkedin. Something else. So i'm gonna leave that with you. And then.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;What about the attendance password.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yes, thank you. So much fun with this.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think it'll, let us do the attendance because it closes at 1245.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. well.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yeah it's not letting me add here.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;When someone sends me a direct message, then I it takes me a while to get it back set back to everyone. same password it should be good for five minutes.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;it's working.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;sorry about that. Okay. Thanks for today. And will. Thank you, on Thursday. Okay. Take care. stay well bye.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you take care.

    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;sorry I joined late sorry again
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;I think it's clear personally
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I think youre good lol
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Can we get some feedback on our engagements to see if they are good enough?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;this is the same video that we had in meeting 4
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Not to the common user
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;it seems like FortiClient server control
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;My pet peeve about this stuff is that it's often not accessible for the average user. I know my grandma panics anytime these popups come up whenever she's doing anything gon her computer.
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;agreed!^
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;I trust a tesla car more than myself
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;to some degree...
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;So, reading this, we have to post in meeting 5, right?
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;I think its available on his website
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;^You just have to write a short paragraph about what you found interesting in todays meeting, it can be this, or any of the videos on the website under today's date
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;I mean I think that we should accept it with a grain of salt
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;I like to believe it is more peer reviewed than a few family members
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;I don’t see this content about Alexa in meeting 5.. am I missing something?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;^same
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;I don't see it in meeting 5 yet either but here's a link to the article:
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;thx
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;I think top ad is the first result
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;for me it is
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;God damn, I got rice krisplies recipe as my first result XD
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I'd be curious to see which search engines we're all using to get these results too
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;sally pulled a amazon on everyone...
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Could it depend on the search engine used?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah I think it does
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;I used duckduck go
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;On duckduckgo I got allrecipes
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I used duckduckgo and google both, got different results
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;someone use Tor...
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;I think maybe if we used a more controversial topic, something politics related, we would see more varying in the results
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Where is the link for us to post our ad url?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry just can't find it on his page atm.

    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;i don't know why but I am more afraid of losing my sense of taste and smell than death...
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Those long-haul symptoms are pretty severe
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;if im dead, im dead but is life worth living if you can't taste food anymore...
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;walking dead
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;i will be pretty much
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;or like Captain Barbossa from Pirates of the carribean
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;he has a whole movie speech kabout this...
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;about
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Well, one good thing is you wont smell death creeping up on you
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;that sounds fun

    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fzXmJyolfY
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;sry ill stop
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;why cant I hear anyone?
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think anyones talking don't worry
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;I am receiving a lot of email notifications
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;me too
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Someone in class did share a way to fix that the second class. They also put it in discord
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;can we get attendance password now?
    </li><li><strong>S47:</strong>&nbsp;why we have 2 COVID-19 forums?
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;by mistake I posted a new discussion form in meeting activities instead of replying
    </li><li><strong>S47:</strong>&nbsp;ok
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;I don't know how to delete it can anyone help
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I think that's fine
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;sure?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;ya
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;yeah is should be fine
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;ok:)
    </li><li><strong>S49:</strong>&nbsp;what is the password for attendance? anyone know?
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;didn't give the password yet
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;noopes
    </li><li><strong>S51:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Not me
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;nope
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;if I spend half an hour buy a few things from Amazon, I spend 25min looking at the reviews
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;buying
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;lmao me too
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Amazon reviews can be dicey though cause a bunch always seem like bots if its a "4000+" review product
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;even reviews can be biased though - many reviews are paid or bots
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;yup, 25min at least
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;smart consumers are not really the problem it the dumb one that buy/believe the first thing they read
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Gotta love the "1/5, FedEx lost my package"
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;X.d
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;1/5 "ok"
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;is there attendance today at all?
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;we still haven’t gotten the attendance password so are we all going to loose marks for today?
    </li><li><strong>S56:</strong>&nbsp;Where we will get it
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;we probably wouldn't lose marks, he would just scratch t or something
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;So what are we actually doing in meeting 5 response?
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;responding to the new videos I think
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;those are not new
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;There's literally a prompt:
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;It's the same as all the other responses
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Anything you like, just make sure it's related to today's discussion or the videos
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;ywyh7n
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;yeah
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;it is locked
    </li><li><strong>S47:</strong>&nbsp;its is locked
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;its locked
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;it doesn't say anything showing me a question mark
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;locked
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;same
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;if I already submitted am I fine?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;He is just extending the deadline so we can too
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;ywyh7n
