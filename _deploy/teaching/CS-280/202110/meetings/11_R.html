<ul><li>
      I think we didn’t get a clear question for the breakout group meeting so we had no idea what the topic is, just something that is related to Facebook. Then again, these giant tech entities have the power to do whatever they want, bend the laws. They do employ a big team of lawyers that help defend their case.Following the discussion about the hardest CS subject. In my opinion, it is 310. It’s basically a math class with a final that worth way too much.I think the project proposal is fine, a variety of topics that you can pick, a...
    </li><li>
      In our 11th meeting we discussed Facebook deleting almost everything on their website in Australia and what to do with our group project. Facebook in protest for having to pay to upload news articles deleted almost all their content. I personally approve of Facebook finally deleting itself off Australia due to how much fake news and violent opinions were spread across their platform. For our group project I was thinking or redesigning the user interface of a website to have all their links and pages on a condensed circle or pie chart.
    </li><li>
      I feel like Facebook has been in hot water for years now and nothing is going to change their objective of making the most money possible. If they have to remove news or sell data to reach their objective then they will not even think about the morale and ethical problems their actions may cause. It is the only reason why Facebook and other companies like it continue to find themselves in hot water amid continued backlash.
    </li><li>
      Todays discussion was on facebook banning news in Australia. In my opinion facebook was quick to ban news as only 4% of people look fornews in thier feeds. The publishers seem greedy as facebook is giving them a platform and billions of referrals worth 100's of millions.And also some discussion on the final project.
    </li><li>
      The Australia-Facebook situation (which recently concluded with Facebook reaching an agreement with Australia) reminded me of the very similar Australia-Google situation (Google required to pay Australian news sites I believe) and the whole debacle got me wondering what happens if the company does not back down to the country's government demands. It is unknown really how both parties will react in a drawn out situation, however, I'm fearful that if both sides are unable to reach an agreement then the end result will greatly inconvenience or even harm a large portion of the user base. What would be the best...
    </li><li>
      Meeting started with the discussion of an event related to NASA. We had couple of poles in order to decide when is it happening. Professor then also talked about upcoming assignment about project proposal which gave me an idea of what needs to be done. Overall this meeting was pretty helpful in terms of future assignments.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 11 we talked about the issue with Facebook and the Australian government surrounding Media. The Australian government believes that Facebook should pay the media for having the news on there site. This issue skyrocketed when Facebook banned all Australian news, this caused problems since it cut access to certain information on the pandemic. I believe that if the media industry is in fact losing money because of the internet then something needs to be done about it.
    </li><li>
      When people use social software, they should learn to analyze and judge. In the Internet age, everything we're exposed to isn't necessarily positive or right. There's so much bad information on the web that it's usually easy to spot, but for something else, for example, like Twitter trends. I think people should learn to look at these dialectically, the topics being discussed on the Internet may not be correct, it might cause a bad influence. To deal with anything, I think we need to learn to analyze and judge. Before, the professor shared a lot of Ted Talk videos with...
    </li><li>
      I haven't been paying attention to the Facebook/Australia thing and I don't know much about the news media industry so I'm probably out of my depth here. I'm having trouble understanding the following things: why is money involved in news? Is it not the right of the general population to get the news? Is Facebook scraping the news, or are media companies wanting Facebook to pay for them to host their news? Is Facebook taking the news off their platform unethical, since many people need access to the news, or simply business, since people can get that news elsewhere?
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we learned about many things such as the discussion of Mars Perseverance Rover which makes me know some hidden facts of it. As well we talk about many things in chat window about the power and climate issues in Texas. Then we learned about the proposal of the project.
    </li><li>
      I am interested in learning more about why Australia decided it was time to start forcing Facebook to pay for news. This greater good issue of facebook being able to bully entire countries to get there way is a very pressing issue.
    </li><li>
      We talked about, how Facebook is relevant in this society currently! Facebook is a social site which let people indulge in engagements so that they could sell their Ads. I assume, they could do anything to grow their revenue, it they fail to do so, investors would find the company lame. I guess, Facebook will sustain in future as they might establish a new business model. Who knows!
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about the blog entry 2 and project proposal.
    </li><li>
      Today’s world is so attached with the services of these tech giants that even the developed countries like Australia had to obey the demands of them and amend their laws.As we saw Facebook discontinued the news pages service in Australia even without thinking for once about the population and its welfare. By these act I think people will start generating hatred for these private companies and their services. According to me this is simply misusing people’s trust for your own benefits.
    </li><li>
      When I was writing blog post 1, I found one of the articles I used through MSN. When linking the article, I found that I was not actually on the website that published the article (CNN in this case) but instead MSN's website which basically copied the article without a link to the actual source website. I had to search for the article on CNN so that I could link it. I would not have found the article without MSN's promotion of it, but my click would not have went to the actual publisher's of the article.
    </li><li>
      Last class we discussed if news sources should be offered for free, with no money involved. Personally, I don't think this is a sustainable model. With no money involved, there is no incentive to make quality news stories. As a result, the quality of news sources drops. I would like to know more about what other people's opinions are about this.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed about the blog 2 instructions and also about project . Some of facebook updates were discussed in BRooms.
    </li><li>
      The highlight of the lecture was the, Facebook vs Australian Government face off regarding a proper remuneration for all the profits earned by the tech-platform by using content from other content providers, especially the news industry. I believe that Facebook was in the wrong when they took down all kinds of news from their website in retaliation to this. They took down the news pages for hospitals, emergency care, COVID-19 protocols and lock-down restrictions, which could cause havoc in these trying times. Instead, they should have tried to come to a decision with the government before taking such a drastic...
    </li><li>
      We discussed about project, Facebook vs Australia news
    </li><li>
      Well today what i was learn was basically on how the big tech companies dont really have mush of a countability in which they should have. They can do some awful things and all they get is a slap on the hand. That we need to make some accountablity as a more of a better way to hold these companies to the evil or damage that they do.
    </li><li>
      I think that the level of politics that is played within a company determines if they are bad guys or good guys. When we speak of Facebook, it constantly keeps changing policies of itself and its corresponding apps to gain the maximum user data, and so I think they definitely come under the category of bad guys.
    </li><li>
      "Four Core Influences" has used by the author Steve McConnell from his forthcoming documentary, Software Engineering Essentials, to analyse various reports mostly on outcomes of the software development project. It illustrates that audio systems engineering assessment could be used to vastly enhance understanding of the mechanisms of software development projects, that also,  leads to the a treatment plan of inability, more effectual corrective measures for tasks already nearing completion, and a dramatically improved likelihood of succeeding in each task.
    </li><li>
      Attention in the Information AgeThis is a follow-up to that really well thought-out TED Talk presented by Tristan Harris. He summarized how our attention as individuals of different backgrounds, as consumers in the information age and as people above all is extremely valuable by these large tech organizations. So much so because attention is directly related to profits. If one simply analysis the MAU or Monthly Active Users on websites often tell advertisement agencies a platforms commercial value, this would correlate directly with the amount of business expenditure on such a platform. All the giants like YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and...
    </li><li>
      the main point from this meeting that I was confused about is why everyone is angry about facebook removing news stories from its platform. in my eyes facebook is a media company that I would only look at for celebrity gossip not real news stories. in my eyes the banning of news sites should be a good thing to keep down the number of unreputable "news" sources.
    </li><li>
      It was interesting to learn about how other classmates think about the new legislation in Australia requiring tech companies to pay for news contents. Canada should also create a similar legislation because of the filter bubble problem. It would be detrimental for society to be only surrounded by news that they find agreeable. Providing the public with unfiltered news is very valuable in our fight against the negative effects of the filter bubble. I’d like to know more about how social media platforms changed in Australia and the opinions of the Australian users on this change.
    </li><li>
      In class today we talked about the use of banning certain speech on social platforms. I believe that this is a horrible thing because we are supposed to have a freedom of speech but i also see where this is necessary for things like hate speech. The one question I have to ask is where does one draw the line on necessary vs unnecessary speech.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 11 I liked our healthy discussion about facebook's want of domination and means to exploit everyone else using its monopoly advantage. Also, the professor taking our opinions was really a good gesture.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we talked about Facebook in Australia issue on how Facebook banned the news content to show on Facebook. We also talked about blog entry 2 and project proposal and it's requirements.I would also like to know more about the project proposal and project. Like, what are the requirements regarding proposal word length and if there are more than 2 people in group are they all need to submit same thing individually? or only one person needs to submit it?
    </li><li>
      Projects always need to be organized and coordinated for the sake of the safety of people because safety has priority in the success of any project. The conclusion of this meeting was watching a video explaining the issued reports on the consequences of the software project. It determines how to use sound judgment in software engineering to significantly progress the understanding of software project dynamics, which in turn leads to correct failure judgement, more effective corrective actions for projects already underway, and greatly improved chances of success in each project.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting we talked about an upcoming science public lecture about mars rover mission. It will be very interesting to know about the whole experiment and the experience. Recently from social media I watched the 360 view of mars and it was amazing. We also talked about the recent Facebook incident with Australia. We also had a breakout session to talk about if Facebook is a good or bad guy. personally I don't use it that much. Mostly I search through the news feed and that's how few interesting news catch my attention. If I was in Australia,...
    </li><li>
      In the lecture, we discuss what Facebook banned and what is updated, and what is the new policy of Whatsapp and also discuss about project proposal that on which topic we can write and all.
    </li><li>
      In last meeting, we have discussed the analysis and judgement, I would like to talk about he analysis of a website is safe and security to use, and the judgement of to use it or not, a clean website should and the content closely relate to the authors thought, and there's no ads and virus warnings. before you make decision to view a website, you should always think carefully by click each links.
    </li><li>
      Analysis and judgement are fundamentally different. Bloom’s taxonomy is an evaluation method about the level of knowledge. Among them, analysis and creation are the most important. In computer learning, students must at least reach the level of analysis, can connect the knowledge they have learned, and draw an analogy. In the future enterprise, judgement is a very important link, the strength of this ability can even directly affect the destiny of the enterprise.
    </li><li>
      Found the first segment of the videos by David Plummer to be very inspiring because he talked about how task manager came to be. How he did not give up and he kept on trying his best to do more things. Also, it made me realize the importance of having connections.
    </li><li>
      Great lecture, I Think it Facebook should not be charged or have to pay because of fake new because individual who come into social media should be held responsible for not going to more reliable sources to confirm or check for information necessary, hence, why Facebook shouldn't be charged. And can you give a brief summary of the software Engineering video in your words because the quality of sound of the video wasn't the best.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we talked about blog post-2.
    </li><li>
      In group discussion we talked about the future of whatsapp seeing its ongoing privacy debate like professor told what Australian government took measures against the facebook due to data concerns of people so like the same way what government can do against the whatsapp and afterwards what policies can whatsapp change to remain in the market and if they did not change the policies of their user data which apps would take its position and what ethics would they keep in mind to built the new app which cares for the data policy of the user and I would like...
    </li><li>
      The previous class was really interesting because of the subjects that were explored. The video links from the past lecture helped me a lot to understand and then examine new stuff from a different angle. Also, we had great conversation, so it was wonderful.  Infact, discussion in the breakout room was also exciting as I was able to know everyone's perspective as well.

      Facebook, given the website as a whole has very poor moderation, feels like if anything it is a net positive that they are banning news articles from their website. It would be like getting your news from Instagram or Snapchat, a social media site should not be your primary source of news on current events. Also, at least personally, the bombardment of misleading news headlines is a large part of the reason why I stopped using it to begin with.Additionally, it is a little concerning to see that a company like Facebook has the “Power” to bully around the government...

      Thank you! It was helpful.

      Talking about facebook, I stopped using it because id see too many posts that were very uncensored, things would slip in a lot, but it's kinda crazy that facebook been under fire for the past few years but yet because they have such a big base of people it just won't affect them that much at all. We might see the facebook trend die eventually but in my eyes its gonna be a long time from now. They also buy off other things like Instagram which i still use

      In the last meeting, The professors asked the students about a workshop then finalized that the seminar will be on Wednesday, March 24 at 1900. Moreover, we also discussed Blog 2 and the project proposal. The professor also asked the students which CS most challenging subject and then some glance on Facebook.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discussed about how Facebook is socially important and on going talks about Facebook business in Australia, I would like to learn more about that issue. we also discussed about project proposal
    </li><li>
      in this forum, I had learned about the three-way which makes the people happy with the design like he said about the juicer. they just design it for the fun and also the pinball table designed with the fish and table. they are just designed for fun.
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we discussed about the mars rover missions it will be great experience and experiment to know more about it. We also discussed about the recent incident of facebook in Australia. We also had a group discussion in which we had discuss about the future of whatsapp which is also own by Facebook as well. So, what will government do to take care about the privacy leak. and over all the whole lecture was so helpful.
    </li><li>
      We spoke about our upcoming assignments in the previous lecture: blog entry 2 and project proposal. We also discussed the Facebook vs. Australia problem. But in our following lecture, I would like to know more about this conflict, if possible.
    </li><li>
      We discussed today in class about if it is good or bad for the society. I think if we use it carefully it can be very helpful but if we just spend most of our time on it is a waste of that time and if can affect you in so many ways so I think Facebook is good for the society but only if you are aware of the bad side and try to ignore that side.
    </li><li>
      One of the main concept to keep in mind while designing stuff is that we have to keep in mind how "fun" it is to use. Even if its not the best design, a pleasant experience can lead us far. As he said, when brain is happy, we get work done quicker and easier. Maybe that is true. But he also said that we won't get any work done this way. It feels to me that to make something something better, we need a mix between "pressure" and pleasant. Both have its good side and bad sides. All we have...

      From this past class it was quite informative to learn a bit more about the Facebook news ban in Australia. I had heard about it before, but never really understood the purpose of the legislation. While looking into it more, it appears however that Facebook has won some compromises with the Australian government and news content will return to Australian Facebook users in the coming days. https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/23/facebook-reverses-australia-news-ban-after-government-makes-media-code-amendmentsIt is rather concerning just how much power big tech has over our governments -- and I could very well see if such piece of legislation were to arise here in Canada the government would...

      In the past meeting, the main topic of discussion was the importance or our privacy. Today, we are not able to know where our personal data has been used for some other purpose and profit of companies. It is very important for us to ask questions and as a future computer professional try to build alogrithms which will eliminate this thing.
    </li><li>
      According to me, the past meeting was all about how we are trapped by the big technology firms and the way in which they are using our personal data for profit. The way it is affecting us cannot be measured. We should try to make alogrithms which keeps everything transparent and our privacy is not used for someone's personal profit.
    </li><li>
      Last meeting was we were put into the breakout rooms to discuss about the Facebook news. Australia asked for money in order to give their content on Facebook because of this Australian context is banned in Facebook. Facebook restricted publishers and petiole in Australia on Facebook . Some people are using Facebook to get the daily news and updates Facebook is not doing justice with the user as well as with Australia
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned from the last meeting is that Social Medias have become what people rely on for news. Whether or not they want it, I believe Social Medias take on some responsibility for the news they host if that is a main draw/feature. It was hard for me to totally understand the ethical implications of Facebook removing important health related news for Australians. In my breakout room discussion we talked about how that removing all news from Australians on Facebook might have been the smartest move business-wise as the governmental regulations were still getting figured out,...
    </li><li>
      class today was about the discuss about the group project topic
    </li><li>
      We talked about blog 2. E.g whatsapp facebook
    </li><li>
      In the previous lecture we had discussed about upcoming assignments and also about the expectations.
    </li><li>
      I think the coordination of accessibility and usability is very important for computer programming, the accessibility of a computer program is the Precondition for its usability. The design of computer programs should be human-centered designed which the users can use the program appropriate.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we had a great discussion about upcoming blogs. Also we had a discussion about the Project and it's proposals. I am excited about my new group for Project and its Topic. Moreover, Breakout Rooms in last meeting were helpful too. As we are going to do project in Group so that communication will be easy too among our classmates!!

      Facebook's prime business model was to bring people together. That's what Mark Zuckerberg promised when he created Facebook. He wanted to create something to bring everyone close to his University at Harvard. He initially provided the service for free and got a bunch of funding, but with time to survive, he started posting ads. As he moved forward all the ads became more and more personalized. For ads to be personalized he stole our data. This created a filter bubble and all the other features to get people addicted to the platform. This is very harmful for humanity.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed the importance of user privacy and also discussed about the rover on Mars.We also discussed about the upcoming assignments that are to be done. We also discussed the latest news on Facebook how the company is not affected even if the users are leaving it.Discussed about the upcoming blogs also.I am really very excited about the projects that are to be done in the group which will lead us to different idea on the same topic.
    </li><li>
      In the last zoom meeting, we discussed about the problem with Facebook and the Australian government surrounding Media. Also, it was really helpful as we discussed about the future assignments and about project as well.
    </li><li>
      In last class we talked about Analysis and Judgement. We also discussed bout Facebook and it's policy. There are multiple ways in which facebook makes money from user's own data. One way is by advertisements and it is mostly used by business people and entrepreneurs for spreading their reach and getting maximum usage from it
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting discussion, we had a discussion on Facebook updates that how we all are trapped by the big technology and they used personal data for profit which is not fair at all which we discussed in class and as well with classmates in BRooms apart from that we all also discussed the instructions of blog # 2.
    </li><li>
      Facebook was designed to connect people from all around the world but lately we came to know that they are using our data, moreover they are now using Facebook as a business platform, people can sell and buy thing just like eBay, how all the videos have ads just like YouTube and they are all personalized by out data on what we search and what things we like. I think Facebook is relevant to society but the new features they have added are not relevant.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting class focus was on social media.We talk about the ban of facebook news in Australia.We learnt how nowadays people are mostly rely on social media for news.Some student criticised the facebook for this step because of the source of information or news for some people.In some countries even social media is the only trustworthy news source.However,Australian banned also show us that how powerful these tech giants are against our government.
    </li><li>
      I think in my personal opinion Facebook is in some percentage it is beneficial to the society as it is used to spread the news or people are making a career out of it, so it is obviously good for their life but also it has a downside as the facebook has been in lot of controversy about the privacy about the user and everything I guess if there is certain restriction towards it, it can turn down the risk by great percentage.
    </li><li>
      The most important and the surprising thing that I learned in the class was about the lawsuit between the country of australia and facebook. Well I think that Australia was correct in this case as the only reason the facebook is able to give users the news is through the publications and moreover facebook is earning a huge amount of money through these publications only and I think publications should get the money they deserve.
    </li><li>
      There was a discussion on Facebook. Personally, I think Facebook is really helpful for spreading news or sharing some of the experiences that we had. But it is also bad because people will then rely on social media for everyday news on the media not on the actual news.
    </li><li>
      I think the most important thing I've learned/realized from last meeting was that not alot of people are priveleged enough to analayze how social medias like facebook is actually invading privacy in a level.Being a bio minor, I found it interesting how there is biological explaination for design of what attracts us and stuff. I enjoy the psychological explanation to design as well. I think it's important to understand the psychology and biology of people to implement an effective design.Bendura's guided mastery is important with helping people to discover their creative confidence. I like this thought. I would like to...
    </li><li>
      It was a Interesting Class. We analyzed on the TED talk video and discussed the thought process behind it. There was a breakroom in which we discussed how Facebook has managed to make a filter bubble around us. We also discussed on the ethical side of programming. I really enjoyed the learnings.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting speaker talks about the "hidden goal" that is a competition of "attention". The primary requirement of any website design or any of the social media it requires is public attention which is not a simple task. The race for getting peoples attention is increasing in today's generation. Speaker also shows how today generation's communication is increased through platform of social media and not through the way communication took place in 90's. The solution is through 3 changes given by the speaker is, acknowledge that we are able to maintain the old way communication and change surroundings similar...
