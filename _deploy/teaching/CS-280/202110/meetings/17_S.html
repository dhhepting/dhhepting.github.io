<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. today. yeah so far, so good. My second cup of coffee here. yeah So the question about feedback for the. Chris blog. He ran into a few. difficulties, but I should be able to. As the marks posted today. I remember. So I spent some time working in New York state at IBM research. and My boss, a fellow then we'll mental growth. Because I was also going to be too. I had I had moved or I was going to move to Vancouver. To do my PhD at Simon fraser university. And he was commenting on the. On the need for caffeine on the west coast. Can to match the level of intensity on the east coast. Without the caffeine. So. I kind of. Remember that so here in Scotland we're kind of in the middle of so he's a little bit less caffeine attacker. More than. in Toronto or New York. anyway. So last day we talked about privacy, actually, first let me do this. Okay, so we talked last week about privacy. And I was talking to a friend. Over the weekend see today's Tuesday right yes. Talking about his. wife taking a job with a big company as mad as a manager in charge of sustainability. And the comment was that his boss her boss didn't understand what sustainability is. And I thought it'd be interesting to explore sustainability from our. Computers in society perspective, a little bit here. So how do you understand sustainability. will do, maybe one or two one maybe two breakout sessions. today. sustainability. We start off with one. Sure, so. How do you understand, sustainability, if someone says, sustainability is important. What is it really. Being able to. use. Your own mug for coffee again. You go to TIM hortons or something like that. David doesn't give you enough said enough elaboration. Let me get that setup. make sense. Can opener. i'll do five minutes and we'll keep. will keep the same room circle back to them later on. Okay, so you came back the last five people are so. sure when when that. Was that was going to are coming back from the rooms anyway. So did anyone have some ideas about sustainability they'd like to share. Okay. So, can you please stop saying me direct messages. Just messes up mother chat. So talk about questions about the blog in a second or two. Sustainability in terms of. maintain. A healthy company or project, they want to think about healthy planet. making decisions for the future in mind all right. doing something now, without compromising the ability to do that for future generations yeah. Okay, so there's some comments about data. So this. I see this as a connection to our discussion last table privacy. and discussion about smart meters smart electric meters. So if everyone has a smart meter. That means it's good in essence we're getting data back to the utility. So they can understand peak usage and. there's. no better way than that. Okay, so I said I would talk about the blog in a minute. So let's stop. discussion and talk about right now. So would anyone be offended if we allow the due date for the blog to be pushed to Tuesday next week. Okay, so. The idea. blog is. Just to clarify it's not necessarily. about looking at Defense distributed, although you can use that as your case. You can use that as. The example. Your focus. But the idea was more generally could be more general to say. There are different groups claim to be in the act in the public interest. So Defense distributors, one of them. So you may think I claim is somewhat dubious. or not. But i'd like you to critically examine somebody claim to be acting in the public interest. And that is that's the focus of your blog post. Clear. Okay, so I already talked about the blog one i'm gonna release marks. Such as they are today later today okay. public interest, I think we could make a case for that. Okay, so let's. let's. make that change here, let me. make a change right away and. Your courses. Dealing with zoom windows here. Coming up. The settings end to change for the assignment. The empathy map. i'm inclined to well. We can talk about that next week, see where people are at okay. or. not opposed to. being flexible on the date. Okay. So I just said i'm not opposed to being flexible a dates, but we'll have that discussion. Tomorrow next meeting our next week. Well, I suppose you could have it now. Since we're having this discussion. So I can move to move at the same amount to from the Thursday to the next Tuesday, so the 30th. Anything else. questions that you can send to everybody. And not direct messaged me about. Things not related to our discussion today. Seeing none will continue with our discussion, then. So. Last year we talked about privacy and. collection of data and the risks of being identified, even when data is de identified. So this to me relates to the smart meter idea as an example. Smart power meter does anyone. Remember the well. There were some effort to get smart meters in China in saskatchewan. The then the meters that were selected caught on fire. And i'm not sure the overall status of the. So those meters are replaced and i'm not sure the extent. To which the smart meters have been. implemented here, I need to check that. But what I found interesting is. When I was looking at that. problem originally so there's the idea that. you're going to have aggregate data, so people can. Compare their consumption and make. decisions based on data. So we don't want to be too. To clear about whose data is. which belongs to whom. Because that could. Put somebody else put a target on somebody. Somebody else is using a lot of electricity. Then they might be singled out if we could understand. Those would be. So the other thing is. So it's sharing enough data. To make comparisons interest that useful. Say that we're above. Their utility customers above the average or below the average at the average. And then doing some analysis to say here are some ways to save power. So there's also. An issue about. Making a data available to. The household. So even if we're not sharing. With the with the Community with back to the utility and they're not. The identifying data. it's still be nice for the household to see what is going on a throne you, with your own utility. So I know is water meters. And I think this is a drive by and collect them. there's a transmitter. connected to the water. So that the city can. Read read the information once a month for billing for the billing cycle. But the issue is there's no way for me to see that. Information exactly. So I can't make use of that data it's going to utility. And it's going. to know that i'm not sure where else it's going it's not being made accessible to me. So I can do my own analysis on the data. which might be interesting and useful say you know so for you the water. And for the. power. goes up to good sources so when I was talking to. Someone earlier about. Some one of the suppliers, that those meters, they said. Well, we can give you a console you can install on your home. And they were they were able to sell me, and I think there's a subscription involved as well. Some. access to the data. For my house and then I could. I could do some maybe do some analysis and. gain some understanding of what the sources of the power consumption, where are in my house. So we talked about data and sustainability. About singing. The planet. i'll do me, is there a way for information technology and computer scientists to make a contribution to. Sustainability on the planet. Considering that. data is an important part of understanding. how things are sustainable and things might not be so sustainable. I put I just posted this before the meeting but. I just give you an overview of some of these things. The first video that I posted was. What cradle to cradle design, this shows an architect. So he worked with Elsa does to work with a chemist. And talked about triple top line. So cradle to cradle design is the idea that. You design things so that they can be reused and their components can be. reintegrated so they're easy to. When something's at the end of the end of its life cycle, it can be components can be repurposed to create something new. Without much waste at all. And so corresponding ideas, a triple top line. that's the idea of having information about. alternatives. Measuring. measuring the impact collecting data about the impact of. processes and products and. and materials. And then. I was choosing. The one that is the most. Effective. So the one that has the most. benefit for. Or is most easily. return. To the cradle after. After its. What it's been used for has come to an end. And so the one that is. most easily returned. To the credo without to a new product without. severe impact. Those are the best choices, and so we need. A triple top line ideas that we can. make choices, you can cut cut gather information and. make choices about the impact two different choices and then. And then, as the last effective solutions are placed by more effective solutions and no less effective ones. fall out of use. So you can see that's an information problem. And then i've included. taught by TIM burners Lee both the next Web. And this is interesting because he talks about raw data, making it data, making data available through the link. Through web standards. And it's also interesting because it's from 2009. So you can see the. The maybe there's still some work to do in that. So, in terms of how it can be used and. made more useful or usable. And the third link is to the Wikipedia page for spine. So Bruce sterling who's a science fiction author. I don't know him as a science fiction author, but maybe some of you do. Anyway, so he gave a talk at siggraph, which is the computer graphics Conference, and I think he gave the talk a similar talk at some other meetings as well. We talked about how. We need to leave this. things better. than we found them current and future generations. And what he talked about was the idea of a spine, which is. Where it gets coined by combining space and time. So that we can. track. objects, so when they reach the end of life, and we know that. there's this much of materials X, Y and zed available. When. The original. Product. lifecycle. Is. Now, I think this is often used as a. Internet Internet Internet of Things kind of. example. opportunity with. The different sensors like are fed or. or other technologies. The question is. In those cases, when do you. When do you want. example of her boots and some videos. So, when does a pair of boots they're finished and when they entered the landfill. And when can we activate. The scanner to say reuse me. Some issues. In our in our homes. That have. This technology in them to. be activated once there. Once they're no longer. serving their purpose. For us. We don't want to accidentally turn on the identification, while we're still using them in our homes. Or to still. or two well there's the risk to certainly some privacy concerns if we. Understand who's got which pair of boots. and which other. items in their homes. technologies and sufficiently secure. Then might be a big problem as well. So I think there's an opportunity. For not just Internet of Things kinds of. Technological. implementations of this idea spines. And I think that there's. Opportunities using link data and so forth on the web. Help us keep track of. Which. pair of boots or. Which office chair, or whatever the case is. which ones are the best or the most effective choices. For the environment. So the question. Is a little bit of sense. In terms of thinking about. Sustainability and data. So the second question for the breakout rooms is. What is the computer science angle on sustainability. Okay, so i'm going to open the breakout rooms again and then we'll take 10 minutes for this. So it's not just a guess it's so there's two angles two parts to that So what can we do as individual professionals. And then, what kinds of. software and systems can we create. That contribute that contribute to sustainability. Okay. So here we go for the breakout room. same rooms. How is that discussion was just. Productive the questions come up and he. Okay, again, please don't send me direct messages. So I know that groups aren't always balanced. Okay, so CS professional should release more data to the public. yeah I can see that. So this is seems to be also related to our. Ongoing theme of filter bubbles and polarization and. not accepting. or resistance towards having a. shared understanding of what the truth is. So it's about transparency and then it's also about. Agreeing. Yes, means yes and no means no and so forth. So who is the CIO Sri or they could just do what Volkswagen did in live but.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;There is a really interesting discussion in the chat just about how transparency tales and what these companies, and I think one of the hardest concepts is. corporations that are still operating for financial gain it's kind of hard to tie them down and get them to display data that that doesn't necessarily look good on them all the time.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So Okay, but VW.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;i'm not sure if you heard it oh. yeah a lot of decent while ago um Volkswagen had emission ratings and on some of their cars and they. underestimated significantly on those emission ratings and then I think when a third party company, later on, like a couple of years down the line investigated them, then it came out that those admission ratings were far above the minimum limit Rom enforced by the EU.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so the. The falsified their. Data from the test, so they could. Essentially, tell the car that they were in the special in the laboratory so they should. not admit as much, so the settings were. tuned to make the test look good. In practice, the cars never delivered and so Volkswagen paid a hefty hefty price for. That. problem, and so there. was a another angle on in terms of computer professionals. Because. It was a software. solution, they used to enable the the testing settings. So it's a question of. that's computer impression on you are asked to falsify data or educated. create a setting so that we could fool the. regulator. Something. that you would like to do. So. Now I didn't mean to. put a damper on discussion there it's gone quiet now. So we have to agree as a set of rules, we play by. and Have. Penalties that discourage cheating. that's one thing. and David go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I just want to talk about something I think is pre closely related to this, an ECON 130 this concept that we talked about. And it's the idea of a social cost versus a private costs, and I think when it comes to anything to do with corporations, they never look at the social cost of what they do. They only look at how it will affect them, so we need to find a way to make the companies pay for the social costs so that they're interested in actually you know, protecting the environment and being sustainable, for example.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you. He can.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Do yeah what you're talking about is basically the carbon tax rate since market equilibrium didn't consider the pollution to the air like that's exactly what the carbon tax is trying to. six.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning!
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;good morning all
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Morning!
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning!
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;all right!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Good! How are you?
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Everything's okay so far
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I forgot to have coffee so I am barely alive
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;^^^^^^^^
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Will we get feedback for the first blog before the second one is due?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I had coffee and breakfast already which is better than usual hahaha
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Ayyy NYC, the city that never sleeps :)
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Awesome, thank you
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Care to elaborate a little first? I'm not sure what to talk about
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room: what is sustainability?
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yes I think so! Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Our group seemed to think sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or project. Wise use of resources and time.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;In a general sense, it means doing something now that can continue indefinitely, without impeding the ability of future generations to do so.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Mostly as a neither way we can look at sustainability is that its also a way of stagnation since there is no need to bring in new ideas since they have a steady source of income
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah! In our room we floated around the concept of sustainability in terms of data. To what extent companies can continue to harvest/collect data on us before it comes to a turning point where that data is too critical to be collected.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;in our group we discussed sustainability is the tern used to describe the management and disposal of it in a way that it reduce the harm to environment
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Our group did
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;In a very broad sense, sustainability is when the resources you can consume is less than the maximum that the planet can regenerate is what I wrote in our group discussion
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I think true sustainability would be that the resources you consume should be less than the MINIMUM the planet can regenerate, to ensure no deficit
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Is it possible to extend due date for blog 2 please
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I saw sustainability in context with this course to be more so about developing in a sustainable way, as abusing the things we are able to now may lead to increased restrictions online for future generations
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;No
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;That’s fine
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;that would be good
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;more time works for me lol
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;That would be nice
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I'd much prefer that, gives me time to reflect with what I needed to improve on with the first blog
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;that's good
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;that would be good
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;That would be awesome
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;yes it will be good
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;great
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I'm done but feedback would be great before I submit #2
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;That would be great
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Yes would be nice to see how the first one was to see if we need to improve things
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;yeah feed back for blog 1 would be great
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Would the Empathy Map still be due on same day then?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Would "social good" also fall under public interest?
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;so the due date of blog2 is March 23?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;cool cool thanks Daryl!
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;The blog2 2will be due on 23rd march and the empathy map on 25th?
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;what about blog 3
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;What blog 3?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;That’s fair
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I meant the empath map!
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;so it's not due on 25 then
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Hmmm, I hadn't thought of that
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;there was this Canadian show where they built a home 90% with reusable landfill material
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;He's new to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Bruce Sterling?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room 2: how can computer professionals contribute to sustainability ?
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Yup
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It was good
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;I said that CS professionals should release more data to the public
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Ours came to it usually comes to insentives to be sustainable. For example the deposit on aluminum cans
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;let the public have a better chance at making more informed sustainable decisions
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Solid discussion on how hard it is to nail down the sustainability concept to companies.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I think being transparent about those things would increase accountability - people can make more thoughtful choices. I like that.
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Make it law to let their data be more available and transparent
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Back to transparency hahaha
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Or they could just do what VW did and lie about it. :)
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Privacy for the individual, transparency for the corporations seems to be the idea
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;The VW jetta I think
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;other than corporate manufacturing secrets (not slave labour obviously), true
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, they used the sensors to trick the tests for emission ratings
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It was more than just the jetta it was like all their parent companies diesels wasn't it?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15339250/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-vw-diesel-emissions-scandal/
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, I found out recently that my car was upgraded to a Turbo engine during development to meet emissions standards because otherwise it didn't meet them lol
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;But turbos are more fun so like theres some utility
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;But most of those penalties are an extremely small fraction of the companies profit
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. That's the argument for it, I agree
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I don't know how youd make a law for that in computer science though
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;That's the big question
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl! Good discussion today!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for the interesting discussion! See you Thursday
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for class Professor Hepting, Take care :)
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you! Great discussion today! Have a nice day!
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;thank you,teacher.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I have a question sir
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;office hours for today?
    </li></ul>
