<ul><li>
      In our 14th meeting we discussed a diagram showing a user what they are thinking, sayings, doing and feeling. There was an example of a user and each of the quadrants had different sticky notes. The notes described what the person was currently or possibly saying, feeling, thinking and doing with the program. The example person had notes saying she was cynical, anxious, researching pros and cons of a product and/or service, and so on.
    </li><li>
      I'm currently reading Clive Thompson's, Coders in preparation for the project and I find it interesting how Thompson represents coders and those in programming throughout his novel. So far I'm finding that he describes those in the industry almost as cold, unapproachable work-a-holics that have no care for anyone's feelings. Not only do I find it hard to believe this, I can't imagine those people having any regard for ethics or empathy in their work. If this is in fact true, where do the ethics come into play?
    </li><li>
      It seems to me that an empathy map could be weighted differently between the 4 quadrants. For example, during the proctortrack experience, people are not likely to say much because they don't want it to be recorded and there is not much of a reason to say anything during a test.
    </li><li>
      In terms of empathy, something I would like to learn more about is real-world examples of empathic design vs sympathetic design in computing. The reading that compares sympathy and empathy suggests that empathy is more valuable than sympathy as it achieves a greater understanding of parties in distress. However, we are not really given too many concrete examples of sympathetic design vs empathetic design that we can see right now. I think to compare and contrast sympathy and empathy it would be valuable to analyze and critique sympathetic design and how it could be improved with more empathic design. Then...
    </li><li>
      The use of proctor track for examination is nowadays a hot subject for discussion among students as well as teachers. I assume, therefore, that our next project, an empathy map of this topic, is the best way to know the thoughts and opinions of students. I just liked the format too! It’s like a chart containing nice, and tiny notes, so I am pretty excited to do that.
    </li><li>
      I like the empathy map assignment. I never had one before so this is brand new for me. Although I am not really enjoying Protortrack too much. It’s put the designer into a user experience. It helps identify any flaws that were being shadowed by the confirmation bias of the designer.Thank you for going over the project proposal again. I know this is a huge portion of the grade. So I am appreciated that you went over it just to make sure everybody is on task.
    </li><li>
      In the previous lecture, the discussion on empathy was quite interesting. I like to more about it because I did not get it completely. We also discussed how the objectives of empathy map has changed from past years. There was also some discussion on submitting project proposal.
    </li><li>
      The most important concept I learned from last class was the concept of an empathy map. The idea of an empathy map is to help develop empathy for the user by categorizing what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. In this way, a software designer can better understand the issues that users may have with their software, and be better informed on how to improve them. As well, I think empathy in general is a very important skill to have, both in and out of work. It allows us to understand and get along with others.
    </li><li>
      We discussed about project proposal in meeting 14.
    </li><li>
      It is important to keep in mind how others encounter what we develop, and understand what may be required to use our software as painlessly as possible. It is also ideal to have a wide variety of considerations, especially when designing, as what may be appealing to someone younger, such as a more minimalistic or icon-based design, could be incredibly confusing for those who are older. This is similar to our conversation previously about discord, as while it is a very simple and minimal interface, it can be overwhelming to many who are not familiar with its predecessors.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learnt after reading the article on sympathy vs empathy is that these two words have different perspectives. Sympathy means that I feel for you and empathy means I feel with you. In user experience empathy is an essential. As, empathy is the way so we could see into the user's thought, so that we could have more clarity of ideas to design something.
    </li><li>
      Well for this session we mostly talk about what we have to do with the assigmnt which is very helpful and it made things so much clearful on what is need to be done for the project posperal
    </li><li>
      User experience is very important in today's society. Sympathy is not the same as empathy. Most social software offers sympathy, such as helping users read content. This is better than nothing. However, not all software is capable of empathy, which is a complex ability. A deeper level of design needs to be explored. I think this is especially important in product design, and it's a skill that people in this industry need to learn.
    </li><li>
      I think the most important thing I learned from the Sympathy vs. Empathy idea in UX design was the need for a diverse userbase. In particular, what works for some users may not work for others (obvious point, but anyways), and the design goals should be to satisfy the userbase as a whole to the highest degree possible (a wide array of diverse users all cannot be 100% satisfied as people are simply too different, but a design should try to satisfy the needs of the collective to the highest degree possible and there are design decisions that are generally...
    </li><li>
      We have our classes and exam online due to COVID-19. Professors use the proctor track in most subjects to prevent cheating. This is why it has become a common topic of discussion among professors and students. I believe that using an empathy map to share our perspectives on the subject will be the most effective way to do so.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we discuss something about the topics and group work for the project how we can submit it in a group or individual and learn about the empathy maps.
    </li><li>
      I was first introduced to the concept of empathic computing in this course. I have realized how necessary empathy is, especially when designing systems that other people will use. It is crucial to consider needs, abilities and disabilities, and cultural backgrounds and experiences of one’s audience with an open mind in order to better construct technology to serve them. In order to do this, we need to first practice empathy. This is why I am eager to work on my own empathy map. I hope this will enable me to reflect on my own experiences with software and then use...
    </li><li>
      I fully agree that sympathy and empathy are important for good UX design. This relates back to one of the earlier meetings with the video about the doors that are unclear in which way they open. I think it is pretty easy to get caught in the trap of making a system that conforms to your own experience. This makes the system seem accessible to you, but it may not be for others. It's difficult for me to conceptualize how to fix this in practice, but I guess we will see with the later “empathy map” assignment.
    </li><li>
      “Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX” article and video by Sarah Gibbons taught be the difference between Sympathy and Empathy. I have used these two words interchangeably many times. I found this article very useful. In a few of my university group project experiences, I have come across decisions where team members don’t agree on a user experience design and usually just have an argument over what is the right way to do things. I feel this article will be very helpful in these situations and I will definitely use this in my future projects. I would also like to see...
    </li><li>
      I would like to look more at executing Sympathy and empathy in code. While I do not think anyone would disagree with these principles it is also very difficult to implement. When under budget constraints it is extremely difficult to implement extra code to make it accessible to a few. So I would like to see some examples of how people made these changes while looking at budget constraints.
    </li><li>
      How do you approach an engineering project is a very important task. Most of the time we would make products or applications for the benefit of other people and not us in general. Having an empathic approach to the product and application is very important. When you feel pity or sympathy you just feel sorry for them you don’t feel what they feel and hence when we are designing an app we should put it in the user’s shoes to be more empathic and compassionate. It can be done by having diverse user testing and research or making an empathy...
    </li><li>
      The link you asked us to read really resonated with me and made me think of the ted talk we watched a few meetings ago where we were introduced to how much manipulation our minds are put through. It made me wonder if this (showing empathy or compassion for the user) was one of the ways in which we are manipulated in our day-to-day life.
    </li><li>
      I believe that technology can be helpful if use wisely even in democratic society, yes there might be some cons but that can be eliminated through proper education and aware about consequences if used badly "Technology can improve or undermine democracy depending on how it is used and who controls it. Right now, it is controlled by too few."
    </li><li>
      We discussed many things in this meeting, first we talked about the ACM code of ethics and then the important thing we discussed was the empathy mapping. How this empathy mapping contributes to understand the topic thoroughly. We learned this small mapping can make complicated things to short and makes simple to formulate. As well as it narrates all facts through that group of blocks. 
    </li><li>
      In last meeting professor started the class by providing the details about project proposal and how it should be submitted if it’s a group project proposal. Then talked a bit about the Empathize and the final exam choices. He also explained what is empathy map and how we can use it. At the end he asked everyone to read the article about Sympathy vs Empathy in UX.In UX, sympathy is trying to understand the complication of the users. Such as; when designing a website if the font is too small then it will be harder for an user with optical...
    </li><li>
      In UX, sympathy is constrained to just the recognition that people should be having a tough situation, mission, as well as voyage. If we were really compassionate with clients, it doesn't indicate that we brought ourselves in their boots and understand their feelings. In UX, empathy helps us to identify not just the instant dissatisfaction of our users, but also ones wish, talents, constraints, logic and objectives. It enables everyone to deepen one's intuitive user experience and generate ideas which will not only fix necessity and will enhance the welfare of our users effectively by eliminating needless suffering.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing in the meeting is:Democracy of the internet technology and Sympathy vs Empathy video discussion are the most important things discussed in the classthe concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:The dangers of fallacies is most difficult to understand and also about the algorithm workswhat you would like to know more aboutI would like to know more about how democracy of internet is related to the development of software fieldssomething you encountered that is related to the past meetingThe dangers of fallacies is related to the last meeting
    </li><li>
      In last class we mostly talked about the empathy map and other assignments in detail. As for the class topic itself, we discussed about algorithm design of software that attracts wide customer, the privacy issue and such. But mostly it was about the upcoming assignment.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we discussed about the project proposal and also talked about the empathy assignment. I think empathy assignment is a really good way to talk about the most popular topic for students during pandemic “proctortrack” as a lot of classes are using this application and almost 90% of kids are against of using this application. This assignment will allow us to talk about the 4 major parts of the empathy maps. We will be able to SAY about our experience, what we THINK about it, how we FEEL, and what this application DOES to get it working...
    </li><li>
      On meeting 14, we discussed Sympathy vs Empathy in UX. sympathy is an action that affects the feelings of what happened on others. Empathy is feeling the same as others feel. As UX professionals, Empathy is an upper level of sympathy, and it leads us to design our product more clearly and intentionally to make users have a better experience with our product, and we need to make the empathy map when we actually prepare considering empathy for users.
    </li><li>
      In this we discussed about our next assignment empathy maps, how emapthy is different than sympathy, and how UX professionals practice sympathy over empathy. I think that the best way of practicing empathy is to think fron user's point of view and interact with users on what they feel about a software and what changes they think could help them to ease their difficulty in using so that they can enjoy the software.
    </li><li>
      Looking at the article that was linked (Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX) the importance of us as computer professionals having a good user experience is paramount and something we should strive to deliver. When we are designing our program, website, etc., it is important that we are able to emphasize, not just merely sympathize with our end users. As the article notes towards the end, I personally feel that the best way to ensure empathy in our UX is to have a diverse group of people working on our teams from a wide variety of backgrounds and lived experiences.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting professor told us about the empahty map assignment, how we are supposed to do it, what points we should include. he also discussed about the group project propsal delivery. He also gave us the idea of final exam (about the design and topics ) and told us that the final exam will be a take home essay.
    </li><li>
      Proctor track, which is used by most professors to prevent cheating by students during these online classes that have been going on all over the world for the past six months, has become a hot topic among professors and students alike. Empathy maps will be the perfect forum and most powerful way to express our perspectives.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed about the project proposal and briefly talked about the empathy map. Empathy is important in tech because it allows us to better understand our users and think deeply about the problems that the users experience while using our technology such as website, software, etc. An empathy map presents a visualization of the user experience. I am interested in learning more about the design process in UX.
    </li><li>
      After reading the article on Sympathy vs. Empathy I learned that I too like many others had been using the term empathy incorrectly. This clarification gives me a new perspective on things and will definitely help me with the empathy map assignment. I also agree that as people who will eventually be designing things that will have many users we should be somewhat focused on having empathy for the users so they can have the best user experience possible.
    </li><li>
      Empathy means that at the beginning of product design, we should constantly examine our products from users' perspectives and constantly adjust our products' direction and style through research and analysis of target user groups.Moreover, empathy doesn't just mean we need to take the user's perspective; we need to help users understand themselves deeper. Because sometimes, users know they want the feature without thinking about why they want it. Therefore, Empathy in UX is essential.
    </li><li>
      In today’s class we learned that having an emphatic approach to the product and application is very important. As we know that if someone is going through some pain mentally or physically. We can only try to help them with what we can but we cannot feel their pain. In the same we if we make an app we should make it as user can feel it as his own to be more emphatic which can be done by empathy map or by having diverse user testing or research.
    </li><li>
      The most interesting thing I learned about last lecture was while reading the article on Sympathy vs Empathy in UX. I found the part about the spectrum of empathy and the different ways of practicing empathy in user experience to be very informative. It made me realize that without practicing empathy in UX we will not be able to understand how people feel and how we can acknowledge them.
    </li><li>
      The Post-Hoc FallacyIn the most recent lecture we had a lengthy discussion on logical fallacies. These are essentially arguments and presentations that appear illogical and dismantle one’s own statement. It is an error in the reasoning and deduction abilities of the evaluator. One specific type of fallacy is the Post-Hoc Fallacy, officially labeled as the Post Hoc Ergo propter hoc fallacy. This is a logical fallacy that occurs when one unknowingly attributes the causation of an event based on a previous event simply due to the timing of both. For example, the streetlight turned red after the car passed. Therefore,...
    </li><li>
      In the 14th meeting, we discussed a diagram which was giving us a brief idea of what people think, say, do and feel. There was a basic example of a user and each of the quadrants has a different sticky note. The notes were describing how a person says, feels, thinks, and does with the program. Democracy of the internet technology and Sympathy v/s Empathy video discussion was the prominent topics.
    </li><li>
      In the recent class, we talked about different fallacies including logical fallacy, which implies when one sounds insensible to a factual argument. For example, if someone corrects you, but you give a vague reason assuming that you are right. This fallacies analysis incorporate in the technological world. For instance, technology business is not computer science.Lastly, professor discussed the project details and stated what he would expect in the proposal.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about empathy in Ux and from this, I have realized how important having diverse users test out the user experience of your software so as to consider different users and allow for a better experience and with we show empathy to the users
    </li><li>
      I read the article and I learnt about showing empathy to the user so as to allow better experience for different users
    </li><li>
      From my understanding here I learnt that Sympathy is the acknowledgement of the suffering of others.Sympathy is often the reaction (in the form of sorrow or pity) to the hardship or plight of another person.I also learnt that sympathy is limited to acknowledging that users are going through a difficult scenario, task, or journey.Empathy is a step beyond sympathy, and more complex in nature.Empathy is the ability to fully understand, mirror, then share another person’s expressions, needs, and motivations.
    </li><li>
      We discuss about the Sympathy vs Empathy in UX.Sympathy is the acknowledgement of the suffering of others.Empathy is the ability to fully understand, mirror, then share another person’s expressions, needs, and motivations.
    </li><li>
      Even though, we know what sympathy and empathy mean, we never think about what it actually means and how deep it can go. From this, we can say that everything can have a deep meaning in itself, it is only up to us on how we look at the phrase or a situation in real life.
    </li><li>
      I found the article “Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX” to be a bit exhausting. As some someone who empathizes, I find it to be a burden. I would rather sympathize some days, or even feel nothing at all. Does one really require empathy to gain a good understanding of people’s needs, conditions and challenges? It seems most flaws or any necessary changes can be realized in the collection of good data.
    </li><li>
      First of all, thank you very much for updating and explaining in brief project proposal page. In the class we discussed that and also few points on Sympathy vs Empathy in UX.
    </li><li>
      The most vital and mandatory work is to take a note of the approach for an engineering project. One should have a systematic and sympathetic approach for manufacturing or inventing technologies and design for the applications and devices. These days the products are invented for the betterment and use of other human beings rather than the one who's creating. For the User experience or UX, the two mandatory aspects required are a proper understanding or a fellow feeling and empathy. The app or software should go under innumerous tests and should be well developed before releasing and constructing the empathy...
    </li><li>
      Empathy within designing is complex. I would personally want to cater to the intended audience of my project while still trying to keep the product as accessible as possible. It is important to research what could be done to improve the final product for demographics that you may not have thought of initially. For example, people that are visually impaired may require exaggerated visuals or a form of voiceover service. People that are colorblind may struggle with navigating your app if prompts are colour-based, so emphasis could be put on the important UI. These could be added in as options...
    </li><li>
      First of all thank you professor that you went through and explained how to write project proposal.I was having idea but was not sure about the format and stuff so really thank you for that and apart from that I read our plan for meeting the sympathy and empathy description.I would like to know more about empathy because I find it is a little bit more difficult to understand
    </li><li>
      The article about Sympathy vs Empathy was intriguing and shines a light on things to avoid as a professional where you mistake sympathy for empathy and design your products in such a way that it ends up not helping the targeted audience but mocking them. The slight difference between the two is that when you Empathize with someone, you don't just feel sad or pitiful for them, you also feel their pain and hardships. This helps us to design the products in such a way that if we were in those shoes, we would not face the same hardships.
    </li><li>
      we discussed about sympathy vs empathy in UX
    </li><li>
      In this class we have discussed about empathy and sympathy and it’s usage in UC designing.We talked about the difference between both sympathy and empathy as well.We learnt how we can implicate empathy while designing the UX to empower the user.We talked about empathy map as well which consist four major parts.UX designer use it to get the knowledge about potential user to make share understanding need of users which aid in making a good interface.
    </li><li>
      I learned that Empathy empowers UX experts to comprehend the buyer's prompt dissatisfactions.Empathy takes into account a more profound comprehension of the buyer and which in turn result in more better solutions.Being sympathetic for a customer will not help in giving them a better experience because the professional will not feel the difficulty of the other at the moment.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed a topic that was "empathy and sympathy". The diagram was quite interesting and doing it as an assignment will be so interesting for me to do. I am really excited for that assignment.
    </li><li>
      In the article Sympathy vs emapthy in ux design I guess it is important in every website as there are wide spectrum of people and need to think about all of them and there was a really good example of the blind people who might be accessing the website which the designers has to keep in mind and show the gratitude as well provide them service without make them feel dysfunctional and I think it is an important step for the UX designer to correct the mistakes carefully and needs surveys real life opinions, the ones we call the test...
    </li><li>
      Sympathy maps and empathy maps are very important elements. These charts can let the software developer know clearly how the user's experience is. This clarifies the direction of future software updates and improvements.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture we discussed Empathy and Sympathy and how to use them in UX design. It showed that we should avoid using sympathy in the place of Empathy as it would create wrong impression to the audience. Furthermore, we discussed Empathy map and the four main parts of UX design that it consists. Hence, it's important to test the software by diverse users to understand it properly.
    </li><li>
      Its cool to know more about sympathy and empathy as it becomes the driving force in many people, people developed motivation, sometimes go in the slumps and being able to share helps some rise up again.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the way in which computer professionals practice sympathy over empathy was made clear. It is a topic of concern that the professional should be following empathy or sympathy and the best thing is proved to be sympathy. Sympathy can be a good thing as it is the way in which the website developers will understand the difficulties which can be faced by the user while using their product. It can be handled easily. But empathy will make things more complex and may or may not hurt the user's emotions.
    </li><li>
      The difference between empathy and sympathy is considered an inportant thing to be understood between the computer professionals. Sympathy means to feel for someone and empthapy is a thing beyond sympathy. Empathy is a more complex thing and which is like feeling for the other person and getting the same experience as they does get. Sympathy is used in majority to develop websites and computer programs which make things more clear and appropriat. This is the best rule to be followed for a good website development so that no one is hurt.
    </li><li>
      When we try to make any application or any website we need to design it thinking of user perspective not what we want. Designing website or application should be done what world need, I mean what user that will help us to make website more appealing.
    </li><li>
      I am going to address Sympathy and Empathy in UX. Sympathy is a reaction to another person in the form of sorrow or pity, but in UX, Sympathy is limited to users who are facing difficulties. However, empathy is to understand others' feelings and share them, but in UX, empathy means understanding the users' frustration and creating solutions for them. The empathy map includes four things that we say, think, feel, and do about the matter. Empathy in UX is useful to design with clarity and challenge to targets.
    </li><li>
      In the last thrusday class we talked about The difference between empathy and sympathy is considered an inportant thing to be understood between the computer professionals. Sympathy means here to feel for someone and empthapy is a thing beyond sympathy. Empathy is a more complex thing it means that and which is like feeling for the other person and getting the same experience as they does get.
    </li><li>
      The point of view for approaching an engineering project is a very important task. Most of the time the developer focuses on the overall look of the product and the benefit of the people. He does not focus on the benefits in the general. It is very important to have an empathic approach to the product. When a developer is developing any product he has to see the product from the user's point of view. The product should be empathic and compassionate.It was a very interesting lecture.I would like to know more about things related to this.
    </li><li>
      This class is more about thinking about information security. In fact, it is difficult to reach a consensus on information convenience and information processing. We hope that there will be more supervision on the Internet equivalent to the real society, including legal and privacy factors
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed about the difference between empathy and sympathy in the profession of computer science. It is considered as an important thing while designing websites. As empthy is something that is beyond sympathy, while sympathy is widely considered in designing and developing websites and computer languages, so that to not hurt anyone’s thoughts and feelings.
    </li><li>
      So In last discussion we had a talk about empathy map. &amp; also i learned from last lecture is if we are making a website we should take the view from User's side, like what are they expecting on that! How to make easy website to use for User! We shouldn't focus how website will easy to build and all. Will learn something more in next lecture.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting , we mainly discuss about the difference between sympathy and empathy as how these concepts are kept in consideration while designing and developing different languages and sites. I think empathy is something as deeply feeling others’ situation, he or she going through, without experiences it on your own, whereas sympathy is just to share these feelings with other. Sympathy logic is also used by computer professionals during any technical development like site or any language
    </li><li>
      I learned the difference between sympathy and empathy in the context of UX design. Sympathy is simply acknowledging that some people may have difficulty using a program or website without actually putting yourself in their shoes and coming up with a solution. Empathy involves seeing a problem from the affected user's perspective and providing tools that will empower them to get through that problem. Researching how a diverse group of users feel while using a program or website can help to understand users at a deeper, more personal level which can make it easier to design in an empathetic way....
    </li><li>
      Social media may be a threat to democracy, the information that people get from social media like Facebook, twitter, can be release or edit by anyone, and those information are unproven, but it will mislead the people who have no side, and it will be affect the fairness of democracy
    </li><li>
      I think that every program should be created keeping user in mind. Diverse user testing and research should be done. Also empthy and compassion are very important aspect.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, basically we discussed about the sympathy vs empathy. It was quite interesting for me and i am also more interested to learn more about it. Also, we discuss about the submission of project proposal.
    </li><li>
      professor told us that the topic for today's class is sympathy and empathy UX and discussed about the group projects.
    </li><li>
      The meeting 14 began with a small discussion on the meeting response and the professor elaborated briefly about the project proposal and also gave instruction about the upcoming individual assignments. I would like to say that this class was very useful from the point of view of project because  we got the clear idea about what to do in the assignment.Dr. Hepting told us that the topic for today meeting was Sympathy and Empathy in UX. Sympathy is a reaction to another person in the form of sorrow or pity but on the other hand Empathy is to understand about...
    </li><li>
      We mainly talked about topics and different topics for the project as well as postponed the dates for assignment 2 and project proposal.
    </li><li>
      In class we discussed about the project proposal and empathy map. And professor has answered to our all concerns. I am really excited to work on project.
    </li><li>
      This meeting we have discussed about the topic of the privacy. The conclusion were in our breakout room that we can't manage controlling the smart artificial intelligence. They can hear us and analysis our data and show us results that serve their benefit. The one of ways to protect ourselves is by deleting our cookies from the history search in our browsers.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So back in a bit of white today after. Taking it was maybe spring was coming too early. seem to be proven right. how's your weekend.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Good.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It was okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good. So the first thing I want to talk about is. Details of the. presentation on the 24th from. The alumnus from NASA jpl. I don't like. So many times and everything. Facebook event. 15 or 20 people register on. The zoom link so far so. You want to go ahead and do that. No pressure, of course. To promote this. Let me just show you the rest of the description. So, Dr Larry Matthews, to the dispatcher science here in 79. or completed his bachelor of science in 79. Is. NASA jpl. Where his job allows into personally participate and putting robots and other planets like perseverance on Mars. The public lecture series by alumni and friends of the product computer science, please be sure to register in advance. So this actually is a link, even though there's a few cards in it. So the perseverance Mars Rover line is in general creator or you can see from orbit that it river floated to the crater which hilda lake and adult is formed at the mouth of the river. mission of perseverance, is to explore the around the delta to improve our understanding of these ancient climate and to examine the possibility of life or precursor molecules evolve their. Rover also acquire set of samples and lead information that the US and Europe plan to send back. Send send later this decade to bring back the samples to earth. sequence admissions is called a small sample return campaign. perseverance also carries a small helicopter called ingenuity, which is intended as a technology demonstration of the first heavier than air aircraft ever to attempt played on another planet. Electrical give a brief introduction of Mars exploration and these mission. So the both him and then. So. If you see less if you choose to see less than you get nothing. fits into the. First. Page. long enough to trigger the see less. You can look at. Some of the details of his work, if you like. mars.nasa.gov. So the title is a bit longer. Good Facebook forced me to use hundred characters including. His name, so all included, so we came up with it, this ever shorter title, which probably is a better thing anyway, but. So if I wanted to spread the word about this, what other social platforms. places, would you suggest, I put it. Facebook account is unnecessary here, let me just. Okay. So i'm curious about Okay, so I understand discord and instagram. Wherever we're on stack overflow. Ensure. That being. A destination for. event postings or information. Okay well fair enough. So. What kind of. go under, China. So what i'd like to. target is a little bit for. A local audience, so people who are around region in the university. yeah so we're gonna put on the your guns counter so. that's true, we can put it on your courses. Well, I think I can. So I was thinking of sending. an email today to see students at. Everyone on the. account. i'm a little nervous. Because I may not. nervous, since my experiences Twitter. I love it wouldn't want to. yeah okay. So there's a vote for me not worry about reddit so i'm happy to take that advice. Okay. I guess I would. Okay tick tock. that's another one that i'm not going to touch, I think. snapchat. support. chatters diverge from. discussion here. linkedin. who's on linkedin. Okay. And the news this weekend i'm not sure exactly when it happened, but I saw it on the weekend. It was about. Anyone heard of a weave the social project social fabric project from the Aspen Institute. Is the website. yeah. So, the reason I made the news was because. there's a columnist for the New York Times, who was being paid as a columnist for the New York Times. But did not make clear that he was also being paid by the Aspen Institute. and The Aspen Institute is funded by Facebook so nonprofit. So here's the description, as we, the social server project, you have a crisis of connection in this country, people are isolated. and seen and in Warren camps social distressed in isolation underlie our most pressing problems from continuing to racial and economic justice to political gridlock and epidemic of loneliness rising deaths from suicides and directs. The stress keeps us from tackling issues like poverty homelessness hunger and climate change we've supports the many Americans in every community are working to create social trust and we've neighbors together to strengthen our communities. nonprofit organization, so I guess it's all normal. well. In a sense that. there's some philanthropy going on. Sometimes grab the MIC on. i'm just gonna. mute everybody you're free to unmute yourself. As required. Okay, so it's not about encouraging philanthropy but maybe it's encouraging. it's a question of. whitewashing, so to speak. The activities of. These groups are these companies. Facebook and Amazon can both give. money to worthy causes but. Is that distract from their own. Core. yeah better than bad behavior is odd. To be here without anything else to go with it. yeah. i'm. watching the documentary on Lincoln so he's not quite as. he's a bit more pragmatic then. idealistic, I suppose, it seems. yeah okay so. let's see incentive well. it's the question of is there a right or. wrong way to do things. Perhaps. And maybe it's just a. call for more regulation, more. legislation. Okay, so I appreciate the conversation going on in the chat and I don't want to. diminish it, but I also don't want to just. couldn't. Read the chat with all of you. So thinking about the theme that I proclaimed for today rights and responsibilities. So we have. We don't want to diminish. The company's rights to right to make. A profit. To get a return for their shareholders. Then the other question is. Do they have responsibilities at the same time, and what are those. Talk about rights and responsibilities in a different way. here. So i'm looking at the Wikipedia page for claim rights and liberty rights. celebrity claim. is one where we have to where we require. behavior and support from. Other others to enforce it. So claim right is a rate that and which entails responsibilities duties or obligations and other parties regarding the right holder. So if I have a claim right, I could say that I have a claim right. For. Other people to not kill me. And that's compared to liberty rights, which is. isn't about what other people do what I can do. The freedom. that I have. The freedom that doesn't impinge on anybody else I have the freedom to. To. drink coffee her my favorite mug. The freedom to choose which month. Are you. So claim right. Really relates, the responsibility of others. So if I have, if I have a liberty to speak. speak about my feelings. about a subject. I speak freely on a subject, and I also. If I, if I have raised as a liberty right. Then. there's a claim rate that says. Other people need to respect. My right to speak freely. Miranda rights. In the States. I believe. Yes, Sir, I remain silent and so forth. So that would be. The elements of both because you know, the right to not say anything but then. you're also. Putting on to the. Law legal authorities that. The requirements that they. Not. do anything untoward. The face of your. you're free. To not say anything. seems to me that. there's. Elements of both. kinds of rights and lots of things that we encounter. Not a straightforward thing. Somebody. Wanting to speak or turn the microphone on by.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;mistake.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So let's think about. rights and responsibilities in terms of Wikipedia. So we might have a right to. Encourage to. write articles about. What else what are. The topics we. know which were passionate. So we have the freedom to choose a topic. If we're going to participate in the Wikipedia community, then we need. Also to. uphold the standards so. This is a. This is a header that can be put in by editors I believe. see this article needs additional citations for verification, please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. And so I satirical may be challenged and removed. So that's been here for a while it looks like 2011. lens of claim rights and liberty rights. How do we view. Do we have online. How about let's make a question for breakout room. yeah so there's. Stories I don't know what that one in particular, but there are stories with people who have become. fairly high ranking members of the. editor so 40 pedia. And they were found out that they were not. found out to them, not be who they claim to be and so. That brings into question. enterprises are not vetting. candidates and vetting information properly. On what r. return. Wikipedia is a good place to start and not a good place to finish. So okay great good room question, what are your rights responsibilities online and upon what do they depend is that. sufficiently. Concrete to. Have a discussion. Okay, so i'm going to make up for. groups now. And then we'll take 10 minutes and then we'll. Come back at 1230 to discuss. time for good discussion. Okay, so anyone want to tell me what they talked about. or share with the group what was discussed in your breakout room. Okay, can you tell me more about the right to protect yourself online. So is it what's. The question discuss does anyone actually have responsibilities online.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;People or users have responsibility to share the correct information and do their due diligence protect facts and not just share. misinformation and lies. Sometimes they're hard protect what people should have our expect that responsible behavior from other users. Who. That information against.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Being truthful. So, in terms of. see what what. So if. greater responsibilities as individual depends on. The developers. So what are the. Well, what are reasonable rates, the responsibilities of. developers as a platform providers to. engage with the population yeah go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I would just kind of ask why i'm we would have specific responsibilities or rights defined at all because, like these are basically based off morals and each individual's morals are different it's different globally cross culturally. So how do we define like what's right and wrong for everybody versus. As an individual.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;that's.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Certainly, a question, but we have a. Declaration of Human Rights from the UN. mean, so there are examples where we come to agreements beyond. The scope of our individual. or individual. model campuses, so to speak. So if. If online were. Dealing with people from different cultures and different groups. Then needs to wait for us to. communicate respectfully. And if we don't have a way to communicate respectfully then we get. The polarization. which seems endemic on social media platforms. So, in answer your question, how do we, how can we define something. I think that the, the answer is what happens if we don't define something. some common ground. with which we can work. And we're. And we're going to. be in a much more difficult place. So i'd encourage everyone to. See the social dilemma, if you can, if you have access to. The documentary. And people have seen it already. So I just encourage you, because it's interesting and thought provoking. presentation. it's called the social dilemma so netflix. So. It features people from the Center for humane technology and that's the link tonight right, the other day. anyway. Simple as. You know. printing. Always. Having the responsibility. to publish things that are well cited. Alright, that. can be supported by reliable sources. and taking care of. not spread false hits. It is a big issue and when social media platforms are interested in. Adding things go viral and encouraging activity on their platforms. and call Center lot more lucrative in terms of monetization on the platforms. So what about privacy or we consider privacy is a right. And the responses are the elements of responsibility to that as well. So one thing about privacy is. That allows us to do is have some agency over our. lives and the. And the way that our. story that we share our own story with others and with the world. So, if everything that we do. Well, both good and bad is. Online then we can't. Make it we don't we don't lose the ability to make decisions about. What things to. sharing with whom to share them. I think that's an important. aspect as well. Okay, so now, you can say that. There are privacy settings that can be applied. or they meaningful, in the sense that. in the sense that. clear what to do to achieve a certain level of privacy.

    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;at least everyone from this class!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;you're own personal reddit account and link the event on there
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;the UofR website would probably be the best place to advertise locally and more officially
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Can also see if they'd let you utilize the announcments email through UR Webmail to let other students know about it
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;That would be perfect

    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Please receive this politely and respectfully, but I am really tired of discussing this and would like to receive instruction in this class time.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;me
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;No, I haven't heard of that.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Outside of looking at it before this class no
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;That's new to me.
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;Facebook funding a project about building trust, great!
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;well amazon supports non profit organizations, so I guess its all normal
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Good step, plenty more to go...
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Better then bad behavior with no beneficial distraction
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;attempting to balance the scales. "but look, we did the thing!"
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;true
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Humans have been doing that for centuries
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Hitler was the first to promote a non-smoking movement
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;He also gave his troops meth
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;war on drugs as you do
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Plus as bad as those companies can be, what is the incentive for them to do anything about it if we give them crap about it anytime they try to make a positive change
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;tax exemption, somehow
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;I mean first of all amazon could just not treat there employees like crap to start? Instead of just throwing money to calm the fire maybe put it out
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;i am but a drop in the ocean but I will take my droplet elsewhere if I don't like that particular ocean
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think the criticism is that if your business model is exploitative by nature, doing superficial things to change things is more of a bandaid or a PR move than an actual good thing.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Right or wrong is impossible on a large scale like that though. Theirs always bad apples.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;A lot of companies do this sort of 'bandaid' cover-up. Bell with Bell let's talk is a good example. Its a little slimy IMO
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry but could some tell me the attendance password think I might have missed it
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;The thing is, that exploitive model has worked for them and now they will not be changing it because it is earning them profits, they are doing all they can to steer away from that and have this fake front where they are doing everything good
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I'd say they certainly have responsibilities, giving employees a safe work environment, living wage, etc. But, if there is nothing to "enforce" it, realistically they don't have any incentive to do so other then "being good". Which, if a company is there to make money, generally will come second
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;what is the miranda rights?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;claim or liberty?
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;none, but slightly liberty
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;I would think that's a claim right on the state for expected behavior when they arrest you.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;"This genocide is incomplete...you can help by expanding it" muhahaha!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;*genocide list
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I would say Wikipedia is a right or a responsibility. Having users who don't know about the subject working on it wouldn't be great for the integrity of the article, and while open access to information is something I think should be a right, practically it isn't.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;there was a story of a 14 year old boy falsely writing up a scottish dialect until he was caought
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I would choose Wikipedia source links over a decade old book
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;as credible as possible ofcourse
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;well in some topics Wikipedia info is manipulated so many times by so many people its hard to trust
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Its a good place to get a base line, but same as everywhere, don't take only one source as the entirety of your knowledge on something
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room; What are your rights and responsibilities online and upon what do they depend?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;you can't just use Wikipedia as a source just like you can't use "the library" as a citation
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;true
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;sure
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;is there no attendance code again?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;there was
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Attendance was posted about 5 minutes into class
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;th26oc
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;yup
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I think so
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think so, we had a decent chat
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Yes!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;you have the right to protect yourself online
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Does anyone actually have responsibilities online?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;don't just sue websites left right and centre for your unsecure behaivor
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think the difficulty with this is that claim rights and liberty rights interact with each other in really unclear ways and it is difficult to regulate them.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;In terms of online anyway.
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Since the internet gives us an access to information it should be our right to make clear informed decisions based on information gathered.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;not to threat anybody else's privacy or security.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;do proper citation? mayhaps
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;We discussed about how the rights and responsibilities of an individual online depends on how the developers implements the system.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;cite from credible sources unlike the Onion
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Onion is a weird example considering they are intentionally satiricle
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;The developers must punish racist ideologies
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Just because there is no jurisdiction doesn't mean we should not have responsibilities
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I love the Onion, they make me practise my online trust of news
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;You could ask the same question for in-person rights, why do we have them if the moral compass of everyone is different?
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;We've also discussed that these rights and responsibilities online should depend and mirror the offline life.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I don't go running around saying my address and my SIN
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yessss that's a great point.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I like that, Daryl
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;We discussed the relationship and precedence between claim rights and liberty rights. Although we have liberty, there is a responsibility that supercedes this. So we have freedom of expression and speech online, but to what extent? We also need to have responsibility and regulation of hate speech, cyberbullying, and so on. So then we need to ask where this regulation comes from/how it will be enforced. Will online speech be regulated by governments, committees of people, or bots, for example? Also, can this regulation even be implemented in the current systems in place, or do we have to redefine and restructure the systems altogether?
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;your sin number is the amount of money you have, how rich are you, xD
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I have, its interesting
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Which documentary, sorry? I missed it.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;The social dilemma on netflix
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Its a great documentary
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I really liked that video on "Remaking the Internet" for that reason, how he talked about how negative stimuli are cheaper.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Honestly that set of videos made me want to throw my phone in the garbage lol
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;what was that quote..."what I want to see is what I will see" something like that...
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;privacy is a right
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Privacy is a civil right
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;We mainly discussed privacy rights in our group.  Given the current state of the internet, I personally think it's safe to assume that you really don't have any privacy rights at all when posting online, or at least theyre being violated.  Basically everything can be tracked or recorded without your knowledge. However, there should be protections to protect privacy rights. Using something like a VPN can be used to help protect yourself, however
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;you can however choose how much privacy you want
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;....one day...
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;I think the user is still accountable to whether how much of their privacy rights they want to give up online
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;+1 Maria
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah, i'm not sure that there is transparency on how those settings protect your information
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;true...
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;do your best to protect yourself regardless
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;often times things are set up with full permissions and you have to go in and change them on your own
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;and if it's hidden in a deep submenu it's difficult for you to find or even know of its existence
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl! Great class.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good, thank you for class Professor :)
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for an engaging discussion today! Have a nice day (:
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Thank!
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl.
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks :)
