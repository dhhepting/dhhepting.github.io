<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;morning everybody. In a. meeting with. tech and. tech and innovation saskatchewan vote. And well round table for discussion technology. And how. To. Hello. Please again. No direct messages. In the chat. So what happened at the round table and. interesting discussions. We had we had somebody. From Mike another. Microsoft employee from scratch and give it participate in. giving us. an overview of the situation and cheerleading for scratch one. So i'm going to talk about the project, and so on. So to just as a nod to some of the things going on the chat. So we talked about a little talked a little bit of data, science and machine learning and Ai and empathy. Is a soft skills that people need to have. And we talked about democratizing technology. Which is interesting juxtaposition now that your talk about technology being incompatible is democracy. Any thoughts about that. So that. So that's RON he say. So. Referring to the articles about. Facebook being incompatible Walker see. We discussed the other day. So I used to talk about it, I used to think that democratization of blank is a good thing. But it's also not necessarily. it's not just about providing access to something it's about. Providing the tools for meaningful engagement. That are. that's important. So. it's not just providing the availability of the tools and so forth, but it's. Providing meaningful access to these things that's the key. So as i'm concerned. it's not you're not democratizing things by. letting people fill out things. themselves or take responsibility for filling out things themselves. And they don't necessarily have the background or the. knowledge or the details to. To. To understand what they're doing and. democratization of technology can sometimes be a euphemism for. offloading work to somebody else. Say hey I can do all the stuff myself online. Then that's just another job that you have to do for yourself online. So. that's a potential pitfall, not to say that. everything's bad everything's. Just like i'm not trying to say everything's good. We have to think critically about these things that's my point. Okay, so. Let me first do the attendance. Share screen. passwords repeating character. password. places won't. allow you to have repeated characters like that. Even though well repeated characters have some value. that's a beat us to death because they know you're just talking about the difference between. pipe and an L and one. And so, this is how. You can make. Your you look. Look legitimate that there's some differences. Different different URLs that look the same for phishing attacks. Okay, anyway. attendance is handled. So I just wanted to talk about. The blog entries and the project proposal and due dates. I feel like maybe. Okay, so. You first look at due dates. So. We had some confusion with submitting. Yes, and i'll talk about the project proposal okay. So i'm just wondering if. So we don't run into the due date for the second blog entry. And so you get the feedback from the first blog entry before submitting the second one. We push back the. Second blog entry. Okay. So I know we make second blog entry the 18th. And the project proposals you on the 11th. That be okay. Let me make a poll for that. Okay, so give another minute for people to reply. Okay. Any. Anyone like to share. Anyone who said no, would like to share a comment about why. I don't want to put anyone on the spot, but. Around but i'm. Welcome to be. just trying to give a bit more flexibility. I will be i'm i'm okay with keeping them in the same. The same as well. Okay, so. You have a good more time if you need it. The empathy map stuff is not connected to the blog post. Okay, so i've seen some. Some shortcomings in my description of the project proposal. Because I mentioned things in the rubric that I don't mention in the description. So the idea is that you're going to pick another topic a different topics and you. notice in your blog post. or a different angle on the topic. and you're going to have the option to do a research paper, if you like. might be tired of doing research papers and just writing. Not just writing writing isn't your thing my life to do some other things. Maybe you'd like to do a book review. contributes to knowledge to Wikipedia. Creative and promotes an online content and video or blog. That you yourself as a continuing professional. This idea they're being as. to identify some professional competing professionals with whom you identify or aspire, who are role models for you. You can contribute to an open source project and discuss your contributions. write some code to test, an idea. So when I said, making a video. And doesn't have to be a live action camera. Video it could be a recording of a. slide presentation. And I encourage you to put that onto YouTube or something like that. I don't have to do YouTube. And there's a way to do it to our local video gallery. And the media space we have set up at the University of Regina. possibility. Okay, so if you change your put your project idea after you've written the proposal. I guess that's. that's possible. But I would encourage you to think about. The table here, I said three marks. change it to. I didn't change the three marks, but I did to five marks here. Okay, so what you should cover in your. new proposals you describe the coffee you're going to deal with. You don't have to present a lot of details that. indicate how the topic is you raise the class. And then the deliverable and the rationale. So. Which what form, are you. Trying to. Are you choosing one of these in the list or are you keeping. Are you identifying some other. deliverable. For your project and then why have you chosen that deliverable. And then you make a plan. What you're going to do. And if you're doing this with a group, then you should have your plan broken down. Amongst your group members. So. Your project can change. Maybe account for that little bit. Okay, so I said, one or two pages, maybe it's one page. But it should have these two pieces, so you should talk about why you've chosen. The topic you've chosen and indication of how it relates to class. What you're doing. yeah so you can do this by yourself. Or you can do it in groups of up to five people. So. i'll add these notes to the description of the project. Later today. So, what are you going to choose to do, and why have you chosen. And then, how are you planning to do it. i'm just reading the comments here. So. And the group gets a mark. So you can give feedback about your group members. That can. differentiate. can differentiate the greats. And i'm. Considering the group. Feedback as a way to indicate. Whether the groups are. functioning properly so i'd rather that you talk to me forehand about a group. issue. then wait till the end of the Semester and give me feedback on the project. That makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Professor I was just thinking so if it's a group project like suppose I have two or three people in my group are we all supposed to submit a project proposal, one of the person going to do it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So the way you can do it is just to. submit one and that one submission indicate the other people in your group.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So just write your. name and user ID on top of it, and I should do.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah see can you. see an example here. Because i've already i've made everyone into their own project groups of one person. So there's 146 of these groups. And everybody has one member in them. So. If you indicate there are going to be three people in your group. and You can see from your group. A group number like a group designation like that, so you can see projects. And it'll be one or two letters and calling the project work project. So it sorry for looking at one person in particular. So if you want to indicate the group. The group that you're in to begin with. That might be more helpful than putting the ID. and make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;i'm just looking verse that group option in New York curses, though.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So, if you look at your profile. At the bottom, the profile. You don't need to. list the group members, the Members in your project you don't have a new project group. Knowing. The group of people, I need to submit one proposal and then we'll we'll change the project groups to reflect the submissions of the project proposal.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so that's making sure oh sorry go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So if you have people. In groups A, B and C. And Kirsten and Kobe submissive proposal. Then we'll do is just move the people from groups B and C into green Bay, so a green Bay will have three people in it. make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So just making sure I understand here would it be acceptable if what we did is we just on the proposal itself, we put each group members name and student number one person submits it and then. You will change the groups to match with the proposal says.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. So get rid of the extra. group, so in that my example a group A, B and C. So people are in there's one person in a in groups each group of a B and C. Then, based on the year proposal submitted. Then there'll be three people in group a and group B and group see would be removed. So all three of those few people in your group in that initial. Proposal group would be project or put the in group a. And they're all in one group and group B nor. Nor group see would remain. Neither grew up in our group see would remain. After the proposal submitted. Am I making a better.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah that seems clear now, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay you're welcome. I will add those notes to the proposal. description today. and change the due date to. 11. Not that you have to use all the time until the 11th. Okay. Any other questions about the proposal. Okay, so see no further questions. Leave that topic for. yeah yes so topics that are related to the class. So you need to pick the topic thats related to the class in some way. So we've talked about. Now. let's say that there are lots of topics and have connections to the class. To those knowledge units. To go into bit more detail, if you like, to look at those. topics on the. On the course page. learning outcomes. Okay, so you can actually come and talk to me. that's that's true. just looking at it i'm paraphrasing a comment in the chat. So for sales, you can talk to me I don't play, especially over zoom. So we ended last day with a list of fallacies. No i'm not suggesting that I bite in person. You know. who's that guy as far as. from Ecuador, the World Cup last time around. is known as a bite us know which bite. I might have those details around. But that's not me i'm not known for my bite. Nor have I bitten anybody. Okay i'm gonna call. Call into this line of discussion. So back to the fallacies. So. there's an argument. So I thought, maybe we'd have a breakout discussion about. Which ones you think are most. which ones are most popular. which ones are most dangerous. That seemed like a good discussion question. Okay, so. The fallacies which are the most popular which ones come. Which one come to mind was quickly. which ones are the most dangerous. Okay. breakout rooms for that. See you in 10 minutes. Okay, so everyone's back. Any comments on the discussion topic. The one is most popular or most dangerous.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So i'll go um I think. raise my hand. The worst is probably bandwagon, because the reason why is like most things in this world. If enough people agree on fan, it becomes quote unquote fact it whatever decisions are made, even if they're wrong they happen. there's no these people you just kidding break laws, because people go well you're wrong you're wrong like nothing, as far as well as the fallacy in some shape or form. If you have enough people, you can overcome it or the facts event to get through these more and more people can then information oh bandwagon. It kind of is basically a lot of people jumping on the same thing, and if that populations greater than the population that's right. Hopefully, they lose But until then they basically have power.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay again first. Then, David later.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;um I would say the most common ones that I see especially nowadays mainly are like ad hominem or to quote Gray ones where it's basically just like oh you as a person or bad or or Oh, because you participate in this thing, that means that your argument is is wrong. And I think in general, those ones concern me a lot because they're not. good faith interpretations of other people it's really, really hard to have a conversation or a good discussion with someone if their intent on not looking at you in good faith, which means that that renders your arguments something they're not even going to listen to. So that that's always something that really worries me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Good.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Just a really quick one I think a popular one is the sunk cost fallacy, especially with technology. Because. Even if technology or software is unsuccessful because so much money is invested into it already oftentimes it'll just keep going and more money will be poured into it, so I think that's a really common one tech.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;mm hmm.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Your status much so we can't just abandon it.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.

    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Morning
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning  :)
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;good morning
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;The sun is shing through...
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;*shining
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Morning
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;good morning
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;morning~
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning!
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Morning!
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;what happened?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;SIr, about the project if I want to choose write 1000-1500 word research paper. What is the topic for this paper?  Is topic same as before blog1?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;that's wrong...
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Why are democracy and tech incompatable?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;What is the support for the argument?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;technology is like any other tool...
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Increased availability to tech is increased access to information, I'd say its the inverse of what an authoritarian regime would wan't.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;used for good of all, good, used for the benefit of some, bad
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Given, people are incredibly stupid, so it depends how it is used
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Technology is a tool that can be used, or abused, just like any other IMO
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Im curious to know what the points about that in the talk were
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;If we're specifically talking about facebook, I'd agree with the statement that their current way of doing business is incompatible with democracy. I don't think that technology in general - or Facebook with a different set of priorities and restrictions - is inherently incompatible with democracy.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I would technology 100% supports democracy; case in point being Wallstreet frenzy happening. Now finally retail investors are able to stand up against hedge funds thanks to technology
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I think maybe the rise of social media in general is such a relatively new thing in society that we're just now getting the hang of how to regulate it, and what kinds of threats (and benefits) can come along with it potentially.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;is that an i or L?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;L
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;l
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;L
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;thx XD
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;gonna make my new password as lIIIII or something like that
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;throw in a | (absolute sign) as well for added fun
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;well some are I and some are L
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;and some are |
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Internet and social media were quite democratic in the way they empowered people. Problem is they empowered good as well as bad people equally. Case in point being how easy it has been to spread fake news by barrage of posts using army of fake accounts and gullible users. Censorship through noise as it is called
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;l is larger than capital I
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;https://xkcd.com/1105/ &lt;-- relevant comic heheh
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;lol nice
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I just encountered Vimeo.org recently
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;The good old "You cant report me cause you can't find out how to spell my name" defence
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Keeps you safe drom the death note
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;laughs in berutorudo
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;or berthold, or boruto
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;what's the topic for project, it's open topic or better to choose another topic in student blog topics?
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Can you please provide some more information about project proposal and how to write it? Should I just include what I am supposed to in project in project proposal?
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;Can you please give a bit more information regarding project proposal like format,etc ?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;that would be great
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I would LOVE at least an extra week on the second blog
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, same
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;That would be great!
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;^ March 18th sounds great
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Even better! I needed some more time to research a good proposal
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;yes please
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;That sounds great, Thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Especially during midterm season a week means everything
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks a bunch Dr.Hepting
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I'm still unsure about the topics for the project?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;If we make a project proposal, and upon working on it realize it isn't that practical, can we change our deliverable from the original proposal?
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;then blog 3 is on 25 th
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I had uploaded my blog 1 submission and left it. I was under the impression it will be submitted automatically when it reaches due date.. but it did not I just noticed this morning so I clicked on submit.. Am I going to lose marks for this?
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;so project proposal is on 11th?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Sir, I still don't know  what the project topics..
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;omg relax y'all he'll get to it
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;😂
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;what is the topic of the project?
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;you just pick something that relates to course material
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Dr. Hepting said he’d talk about the project topics after discussing the due dates
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Project topic info now.. now now now..  :D
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;he'll get to it
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;okayokay thanks
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;can I just pick a topics from knowledge unit from his website?
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;He said he will get to it
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;@Maria azam but people only know that if they listen
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;like blog
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;word limit for project
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;hey he will let you know
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;okay
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;That's a pretty high majority
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;whos the 3% who said no lol ?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I just dont like constantly moving deadlines already planned around them so I dont see a point in changing them
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;maybe they have supergift
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;You can still write it as if it is due tomorrow though
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Then hand it in early. There is literally ZERO reason not to move deadlines back.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Fair. When that happens I just pretend like the original deadline is there
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Thats just me Ill probably hand it in on original date and leave it
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I'm still going to binge write the whole thing til 3am Wednesday night as originally planned.
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;blog 3 empathy map's due is on 25 th march, so it might be closer from 18th.
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;need to prepare for my midterm on 4th, glad if the project proposal is a bit delayed
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I have a midterm on 4th too
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I personally have a bunch of stuff due at once so pushing things a bit helps me out.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;lol, i'm already finished 2 midterm  last 2days
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;same I have a midterm on the 4th as well
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;i had 2 midterm on 4 march
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;this week have too many midterm to do
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;cs330?
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;ok
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;That extra time is awesome, thank you professor
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;210
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;it will help us with a little more time
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for extending he deadline.
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;i had 4 midterms
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;the research paper  is for proposal or project?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;It's an option for the project. The proposal is only supposed to be 1-2 pages to describe what you want to do.
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Research paper is one of the things you can do. It’s all on his webiste
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;okay, I got it
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;thx
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Can our project proposal differ from our actual project if we find it not feasible to accomplish?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry if I'm repeating but does the proposal need to be 1-2 pages? Because if the research paper only has to be 1000-1500 words, wouldn't that be excessive?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;does it have to be team work or solo is fine?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Solo is fine, Rhythm. Group is optional.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for the clarification professor!
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;sounds like it is another essay
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;How are we graded in a group? are we graded as a group or as individuals in a group?
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;if we write research paper than in exams beginning of that we have to submit in proposal,right?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;can you please also add the topics as a note
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;so individual has to write 1000 words or group of 5 can write 1000 words together
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Makes sense
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;So should we have to email you the group members names first?
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Has he done attendance please
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, he has.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yep
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yes he did attendance about 10 minutes into class
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;What’s it please
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;scroll up
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;t7cdfl
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;should've made it an I
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;thanks
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think that's something we have access to
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;If anyone is willing to do a group project, please ping me :)
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;if you go on to the submission page you can see it
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;can you give some example on URcourse except research paper?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah but where to change it more so. I see what group I'm in under submission
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;For the research paper is that an upper bound of 1500 words? Like what if we go over that? Will it be viewed negatively?
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Got it, makes sense. Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;18
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;any example for topic name??
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;if we write research paper than in exams beginning of that we have to submit in proposal,right?
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;can we write about artificial intelligence or cyber security something??
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Worse comes to worst you can always go to his office hours and talk about the topic you're considering. I've done that a couple times.
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;ok
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;So are you suggesting you do bite in person?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yep that's him
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;A fellow biter
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;He must have a great dentist
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;There was odds on betting if he would bite someone during the world cup
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;hahahhahaha 1:100000000000
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;sure!
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;dangerous about?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Can you repeat the question again?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;what was the question
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;fallacies: most popular, most dangerous?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;I decided to leave because my group wasn't talking lol
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Strawman seems like an interesting logical fallacy
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;here's one: Post-hoc fallacy - Because A proceeded B, it is falsely assumed that A caused B
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;We talked about different types of fallacies but we were unsure on what scenario we were supposed to discuss.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;The Fallacy Fallacy sounds like something we all could be doing right now when talking about fallcies
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;It's when we assume that an argument is fallacious and hence the conclusion is false
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Boom. Very good, Dayne.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;America kicked a president out for having sexual relations with a woman...
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I mean Not 100% correct
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;it was for lying to congress
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;current fallacies on COVID19
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;oooooh yes we had a conversation about this in my PHIL 277 class
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;embrace uncertainty!
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;return to monke?
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it does
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;It does! I missed the name of it though/ What was the name of that again?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, makes sense
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;fallacy of misplaced concreteness
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;aka reification
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;"In a world where lunch is free..."
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;hasty generalization is the input of fallacies
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl! Very cool topics
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for the interesting lecture! Have a nice week (:
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you very much! See y'all Thursday. Good luck with midterms
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you, have a nice day!

    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks again for the deadline extension and clarification
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;was there an attendance code
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you Dr. Hepting! Have a great day.
