<ul><li>
      in today's class, we discussed firstly the due dates such as the extension of the discussion forum so that this is a really good thing that professor decided for us because all we are going with our midterms so it really had to do everything within a time limit so prof gave us a pool in which about 97% vote for an extension so that's really a good thing now that we have a good time for our project and blog submission. apart from that, we had a good discussion about project description and a short discussion about the internet...
    </li><li>
      First, I would like to say thank you to Dr. Hepting for being considerate of all the students’ schedules by giving them the extension. I don’t need it however I know that lots of them do, considering the overwhelming majority voted yes to the deadline change.I would say two of the most noticeable logical fallacies are bandwagon and ad hominem. Bandwagon can be highlight by social media platforms such as the like/dislike ratio or the number of retweets, etc. Just because a large number of people believe in it doesn’t mean it is correct. Ad hominem fallacy is fairly used...
    </li><li>
      In my mind, the one of the more dangerous fallacies we can come across is the False Dilemma Fallacy. This is a logical fallacy that presents only two options, an “either or” situation. However, there is often a very large grey area that has to be taken into account.As an example, with privacy, we cannot view it as either a “We value your privacy” or a “we should know everything possible about you”, there are many things that can be beneficial to know to improve a user’s experience. So, there are intermediate phases between the two that we need to...
    </li><li>
      We had a discussion about fallacies and what kind of fallacy is the worst and which one is the most widely known. For me the worst kind of fallacy could be the Ad Hominem. This happens when one side runs out of arguments and instead attacks the opposite person instead of trying to hold their ground or conceding defeat. Even in day to day conversations, this fallacy creeps in when one person cannot agree to the other persons views and they start attacking them. It is a sleazy fallacy but it can ruin your relationships with people if your only...
    </li><li>
      I really enjoyed today's discussion on the danger of fallacies and how they interact with technology. My experience with them is moreso from a philosophical and discussion/rational persuasion point of view and I'd like to see how they play into technology, especially from the development side of things.I liked Daryl's point about the fallacy of misplaced correctness -- we discussed something similar in my PHIL 277 class, where often times important innovation or change can be disallowed due to fears of uncertainty or risk, but I think it's worth noting that we cannot predict anything. Just as there are unhappy...
    </li><li>
      Democracy is certainly harmed by technology, at least in some capacity. I'm sure it can be improved, but I think an obvious example of this is the 2020 US election. There is a sizable portion of Americans that believe the election was rigged, largely due to Youtube, Twitter, and Facebook posts. Now two groups of Americans believe completely different realities. Even though technology is what provides us information, I would argue disinformation is likely more harmful than no information at all. However, I don't think the solution is as simple as rejecting the ad model, like Jaron Lanier suggests.
    </li><li>
      At the beginning of class, it was mentioned that democracy and technology might be incompatible. I find that a very interesting idea I would like to know more about. What are the points for and against this statement? Is democracy actually incompatible with modern technology, or is it just that technology moves so fast that democracy and regulation have trouble keeping up? I think this would be a great breakout room discussion to have sometime in class.
    </li><li>
      In the meeting, I learned about fallacies, and these are in every sector and field. Technology is one of them. Common misconceptions in it that are like mobiles and their app like calculators are not good for humans. The dangerous misrepresentation about Information Technology that is Coding is more challenging, and sometimes, people neglect it.
    </li><li>
      The part that I enjoyed the most about the meeting today is to postpone the due dates. Of course, this in my mind is very positive because we will think more and eventually get more thoughts if we have more time. But everyone can have different preferences, so we did with a majority. I did not, however, obtain any specific ideas on the subjects of the proposal and the project proposal structure. So I look forward to coming to grips with that.
    </li><li>
      In today's meeting we discussed about fallacies and also about the deadline of the project proposal. We also discussed about what topics we can choose for the project and what's their word limit should be.
    </li><li>
      in this meeting, we discussed the logical fallacies, in the breakout room our topic of discussion was the straw man: mainly on the existence of God. there is no evidence that God exists so due to lack of evidence this is a fallacy also, on the other hand, some people tried to prove that God doesn't exist, but lack of evidence makes it a fallacy. The discussion was very interesting but there was very little to discuss.
    </li><li>
      Due dates were discussed today and I appreciate Dr. Daryl Hepting for providing us this extension. There was a discussion on fallacies and also there was a little bit discussion on "democracy is incompatible with technology". I would like to know more about this, what makes it incompatible with technology.
    </li><li>
      Ad hominem and appeal to emotion of the red herring fallacies are popular and dangerous fallacies. There are many groups of people today who attack the arguers and appeal to the emotions of the situation instead of focusing on the problem on hand. I won't mention any examples because they are too controversial but these methods are proving to be ineffective as they led to no progress. Appeal to novelty and appeal to tradition are some of the fallacies we face in the tech industry.
    </li><li>
      From meeting 13 I learned the scale of danger that we are in due to tech giants peeking into our lives. What I realized is right now as future computer professionals if we can not compete with these companies and their super powerful A.I we should at least spread awareness, educate others about the best way to tackle this and help them to keep their private life private. Also, the part where the professor took into consideration the due dates, I am thankful and appreciate that.
    </li><li>
      Since social software is part of our daily lives, it seems to be all the more important. Behind the software, however, there are a number of people who are working on algorithms and trying to attract people's attention. In addition, our privacy is often at risk of being exposed, and online fraud is not uncommon. So some people have come up with the idea of reconstructing the online world. I think that's good, but how to get there is a topic worth discussing, and at least for now, reconstruction seems unlikely. However, there is no doubt that people should start...
    </li><li>
      I would be interested in learning more about this surveillance capitalism. I think before anything can be done about big tech companies taking peoples personal data you would have to remove big corporations donating to political campaigns. People are too easily influenced these days and this vast amount of money keeps politicians in power. By accepting this money to stay in power they are essentially saying that, for them, taking the money is worth the cost. So for anything to be done about this I think you would need to stop big money from entering politics, since with that money...
    </li><li>
      On surveillance capitalismSurveillance capitalism is a unique concept best outlined the book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at Harvard Business School. She discusses the modern impact of how corporations actively perform data collection on our activities and interests in a variety of ways. Methods as complex as monitoring streams of metadata from photos to which push notifications attract us the most. Once these corporations have obtained the data, they run it through their internal algorithms, often embedded into the existing applications that recommend us similar activities of interest. The most widely used format is YouTube,...
    </li><li>
      Well the discusision was very interesting talking about fallacy. That on how the different one even when i think one is more dangrous a niether person makes a point on a niether fallacy which makes it much more dangrous like for example the fallacy where you based it on the people belief that we are judging people based on now that is scary. Makes me want to re look at the fallacy and reevaluate them
    </li><li>
      I think there should be an initiative to inform people about social media and their uses of user data so they can decide for themselves rather than expect sites such as facebook to change methods that will likely be to their detriment.
    </li><li>
      First of all thank you very much for extending the deadlines for assignments. It is helpful because we are having midterms this week for after exams now we can focus on assignments.
    </li><li>
      The most interesting thing I learned in yesterday's lecture was about the effect of technology on democracy and I would say that technology 100% supports democracy; case in point being Wallstreet frenzy happening. Now finally retail investors are able to stand up against hedge funds thanks to technology.
    </li><li>
      ResponseIn the last meeting, the professor provide a presentation video named “how we need to remake the internet” by Jaron Lanier . To be honest, this speech impressed me and i very agree with his opinion.In his speech, he mention an earliest computer scientist named Norbert Wiener. This scientist describe a very amazing suppose in his book (from my perspective,it can be said to be a prophecy): “a global computer system where everybody has devices on them all the time, and the devices are giving them feedback based on that they did,and the whole population is subject to a degree...
    </li><li>
      On meeting 13, we discussed details about a project that was coming soon, and some fallacies. I would like to talk about fallacies: there are numerous fallacies in philosophy and society forms. some are formal some are informal. We say the formal fallacy is the fallacy that has logic errors, informal fallacies do not have logic errors. However, they have factors that cannot support the statement. So, for instance, a formal fallacy with ‘Affirming the consequent’: something causes something is true then both of them are true. An informal fallacy with ’Equivocation’: to mix up the same word with different...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed the project proposal and later discussed fallacies, and if fallacies are good or bad. I think that fallacies are bad and we should avoid them because they try to create misconceptions about truth.
    </li><li>
      The thing that fascinated me was a large bundle size comes hand-in-hand with a rich app experiences. App developers are increasingly concerned with ensuring their app bundles remain as small as possible. So they choose lightweight SDKs or download content just-in-time where possible.
    </li><li>
      I disagree with the idea that technology is not compatible with democracy. I would argue that it is because social media, in spite of its flaws, provides a platform for an individual to express their own thoughts and ideas. It is a tool to enhance communication and it can, as a result, optimize democracy. The problem is just that these apps decide who hears who via filter bubbles, so the reception is heavily manipulated by these 'echo chambers'.
    </li><li>
      The discussions about fallacies (and how they can be detrimental to computing) reminded me about something equally dangerous -- bias. Both bias and fallacies impact our reasoning and thus we should be aware of both and how they impact computing (wiki link for more detail about bias - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias). For example, we might be favorably biased about a certain software because we like using them (say google, Facebook, or Door-dash), and thus might be more dismissive about some of the poor business practices they do (say high fees in the case of Door-dash). After all, its reasonable to say that...
    </li><li>
      First we talked about the deadlines of project and blog, then discussed about project proposal and in breakout room we had talk about most dangerous thing.
    </li><li>
      I have a growing interest in surveillance capitalism and I look forward to any kind of conversation that arises from the topic, and the video posted if we get a chance to return to it. I am curious to know where up-and-coming computer professionals stand. Data is useful, but the methods in which it is obtained raises an interesting debate.
    </li><li>
      Thanks for explaining the groups better. i added a link from the zoom like to urcources useful links. The link is for an example of a research template.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we studied many things about the thoughts about the fallacies are dangerous or not in reference to IT. So, as per my opinion there are many facts which focuses on the type of situation. And in general, it is dangerous if it has risk of privacy. One important thing that we learned which was the fallacy of misplaced concreteness and of humane interface.
    </li><li>
      Last day we were discussing logical fallacies -- of which there are plenty that we can find ourselves trapped in. In our modern digital age wherein we have the entirety of humanity's knowledge at the click of a button, we need to be sensitive to this quantity of data and how we go about using it. Are we committing to good faith interpretations of the data and representing it as-is? Or are we perhaps using it for nefarious reasons (i.e. correlation != causation)? Perhaps relying to heavily on anecdotes or appeals to authority? When we are engaging we need to...
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we had a long discussion and argument over extending the due date and also did a poll, in which majority of the participants voted for extending it, including me. To be honest this is really helpful for everyone as these weeks are loaded with so much work and exams, thanks to Dr. Hepting. Apart from this, the most interesting part of last meeting was discussion about fallacies . For me, It was a new thing to learn and i would love to discuss it more briefly.Thanks:)
    </li><li>
      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting:the most important thing in the meeting was about discussion of technology and the due date extension of the project.the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:there is nothing that i felt difficult concept from the past meeting.what you would like to know more about:i would like to know more about that facebook being incompatible and about the dangers of fallaciessomething you encountered that is related to the past meetingdiscussion about fallacies was from past meeting
    </li><li>
      Last meeting was actually quite fun and interesting to participate as firstly we discuss about the extension of due date in which almost all students plea for extension and that was the end decision. Along with that we also had a discussion about fallacies, which was really interesting to discuss . In the breakout rooms, we discuss about the fallacy of straw man. Though, it is a vast topic but also unclear and do not have enough evidences to go on any end decision.
    </li><li>
      in meeting 13, I had an idea of how technology and democracy works. I had an understanding of how technology influences democracy. To me, I feel technology has its positive and negative impacts on democracy. like the wall street frenzy that happened that's a good impact of technology on democracy.but there are other big technology companies that have underlying costs and this explains the negative impact of technology on democracy.
    </li><li>
      We discussed Logical Fallacies in class. Logical fallacies are errors in argument which can be irrelevant points or illegitimate arguments because they lack evidence.Circular argument, ad homimem, and ad populam are some different kinds of logical fallacies.
    </li><li>
      I am interested in the “fallacy of misplaced concreteness,” where one treats an abstraction of real life as a real entity. This is common in Computer Science, where we make models of real phenomena, often forgetting that these are just models and not the real phenomena itself. This relates to the way we view data: a series of numbers devoid of meaning. Viewing data this way, and stripping it of its context, is dangerous. We miss all of the nuances that make data unique, that make it human. The topic of data humanism is further explored in Giorgia Lupi’s TED...
    </li><li>
      I learnt about different types of fallacies - reasoning that is logically incorrect. I also learnt about sunk cost fallacy which was mentioned by a student
    </li><li>
      I learned about fallacies in class and also did my own research to understand different kinds of fallacies. I will definitely pay more attention to my own arguments as well as other’s arguments to find the use of these fallacies so that they can be avoided.Both videos “How we need to remake the internet” by Jaron Lanier and “How Surveillance capitalism is undermining democracy” by Shoshana Zuboff were full of knowledge. I learned about Norbert Wiener and his predictions, which have come true. The behavior modification of masses by corporations need to be stopped. Also, I joined the Movement for...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting professsor explained about the project proposal and shifted the due dates for upcomming assignments to next week which was great. After that we continued our discussion on the fallacies. in the break out room we discussed about which are the most popular and most dangerous fallacies in our room we agreed that the gambler's fallacies is the most popular one as it appeals to everyone and appeal to tradition is the most dangerous one as in this people think everything in the traditions are true, even if it doesnot appeal in todays world this can creates...
    </li><li>
      I preferred the discourse, and it surely came to me when we are generally pondering about the social issues encompassing stages like Facebook, Google Adsense, and Twitter.In any case, I don't think I concur that the answer for the promoters who rule our lives is to cover the data behind paywalls. Online media doesn't need to be business by any means.
    </li><li>
      In regards to last meeting's topic of fallacies, I agree the the bandwagon fallacy imposes the most danger. It can be dangerous when truth is defined based on popularity. Especially, when it comes to designing and implementing systems. I think in a level it can potentially hurt creativity. For instance, as software developers, when it comes to implementing an application there can be a tendency to implement a design similar to an already existing popular application killing the developers creativity. The disadvantage is that the problems concerning ethics, lack of protection etc in these popular applications just gets replicated and...
    </li><li>
      The fallacy my mind is revolving around right now is people thinking after getting governments stimulus checks they will be able to live happily after. reality is those checks proof of invitation to global inflation in coming years.
    </li><li>
      In the "How We Need to Remake the Internet",If people can get beyond the appearance, he's actually making some valid points. The interesting thing is that we wouldn't be here today if the open source community didn't exist. These large companies have their entire infrastructure running on open source code.When you try to profit from content, it gets tricky because people will try to game each other and act in dirty ways to get you more hooked on their product. I don't think a subscription-based service is the solution either, although it's a step in the right direction. We can't...
    </li><li>
      In the recent lecture, professor accepted our request to extend the submission date for project proposal. Professor also gave some context regarding the content he requires in the proposal. This gave us a reference to make an apt proposal. We also talked about humane technology, and how that we are at the risk to be vulnerable by our own conscience.
    </li><li>
      Observation free enterprise is a one of a kind idea best illustrated the book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff, an educator at Harvard Business School. She examines the cutting edge effect of how enterprises effectively perform information assortment on our exercises and interests in an assortment of ways. Strategies as perplexing as checking floods of metadata from photographs to which message pop-ups draw in us the most. When these companies have gotten the information, they run it through their inner calculations, frequently inserted into the current applications that suggest us comparable exercises of interest. The most generally...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 13, I had a thought of how innovation and majority rules system functions. I had a comprehension of what innovation means for popular government. As far as I might be concerned, I feel innovation adversely affects majority rules system. like the divider road craze that happened that is a decent effect of innovation on majority rule government.yet, there are other huge innovation organizations that have basic expenses and this clarifies the negative effect of innovation on vote based system.
    </li><li>
      In class we talked about fallacies and it got me thinking on what the greatest fallacy of computer science was. In my opinion the most common fallacy is that it is super complex. Yes it's hard to do but once a person gets to doing it, it makes sense, just like everything else. People make it out to seem like programming is the most complex thing in the world when in reality most people with basic knowledge and drive could learn it.
    </li><li>
      1. The most important thing you learned from this past meeting?We discussed the extension of the due date for the project proposal2. The concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand?There was no such difficult thing I experience from past meeting with this meeting3. what you would like to know more about?The danger related to the fallacies and would like to know more about the incompatibility of using FaceBook.4. Something you encountered that is related to the past meeting?Nothing

      I don't think technology will bring democracy, but it could lead to a more efficient autocracy. In fact, the continuous development of science and technology will lead to industry monopoly. The resources will be more and more concentrated, and the gap between rich and poor will become bigger, which could eventually lead to a monopolistic dictatorship. In the world, the government is the highest monopoly group, monopolizing media resources, import and export resources, high-tech talent resources, and so on through legal and violent groups, controlling taxes, and other measures. At the same time, the government undertakes part of the responsibility...
    </li><li>
      We discussed fallacies in today's class. I think fallacies are bad because they create misconceptions and most times they are far from the truth.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about extension on our project and blog entry-2.
    </li><li>
      Surveillance Capitalism is a very interesting concept. The speaker is absolutely right, they are stealing from us without any repercussions. It is manipulative and affecting our choices and decisions without us even really realizing it. The brain is very complex and it feels like big tech has figured out a way to hack our brains. When she talked about the trump campaign targeting black voters, that absolutely disgusted me. This undermines democracy and it is crazy the amount of uses this behavioural information has.
    </li><li>
      Professor provided an outline of how to write a project proposal at the last meeting. How to submit them, if you are working in groups. The best part of the last lecture was the creation of polls for the Project Proposal and Blog Entry 2 extensions.
    </li><li>
      In lecture we discuss the project proposal and the topics for it and also the due date is extended for it. and then we discuss technology, democracy, and all. the relation between technology, the internet, democracy is in a Past investigation has offered an assortment of clarifications on the connection between the majority democracy and the web. The discoveries propose that web entrance and online control both adversely affect majority rule democracy and the web's impact on vote-based system scores is molded by online restriction. also we discuss about some other stuff. that's all.
    </li><li>
      In our last class we talked about why democracy and tech are incompatible. A lot of people now believe that because technology is becoming a deeper part of our lives, the environment, and, ultimately, what we perceive as reality. Democracy is increasingly tasked with the necessity of looking ahead into an uncertain future as people will not be able to govern themselves.
    </li><li>
      Capitalism does undermine democratization to some extent. Financial oligarchs can control all aspects of society. Social media has now become a new type of financial oligarchs who can control the direction of public opinion. To some extent, people cannot freely express their opinions on the Internet. Social media can control information, promote what they like, and eliminate what they don’t like
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we studied about the fallacies are dangerous or not to the IT. there are so many facts that in general it has risk of privacy. and, the important thing which we learn is fallacy of misplace concreteness where people treats the abstraction of real life with entity and this is common in computer science and IT.
    </li><li>
      In this class we discussed about the project proposal and blog post 2 and the due dates. At the end of the class we had group discussion on fallacies and what it meant to us. I would like to learn more about the fallacy on IT fields and programmer jobs.
    </li><li>
      In the meeting 13 we talked about Surveillance Capitalism which is undermining democracy and also an assaults' to human autonomy that cause problem to people. The Artificial intelligence the process from them is they just collect our all data and through that they also predict about us. This behavioral prediction that is "Market" is sold and modified.The A.I backbone produce data that is in Trillion. The concentration of knowledge which is considered as power that is used to come back to people through the data gathered. This power shape, tune and modifies at scale which is digital born of power...
    </li><li>
      In group discussion we discussed about fallacies but not much and I was not able to relate with our course so I would like to know more about it how it relates to our course
    </li><li>
      n the past meeting, we learn about the way in which our alograthims work. It has more control over the privacy of the users and it control what we in the searched options. The data collect by the applications we use is also used for the personal benefit of the computer applications. This should be stopped and users must be made aware of the things.
    </li><li>
      The way in which the computer professionals are developing the applications for the use of general public and using their private data for personal benefit can be understood. The software work on the basis of behaviour of user and shows the output accordingly. The problem of fallacies is also a thing to be looked at. The spread of wrong information on the internet can result to miscommunication which can harm the society. Trusted sites should be believed and used for future use.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed about Project Proposal. Adding to that, professor also extended due dates for submissions.
    </li><li>
      the
    </li><li>
      In last lecture, we just discussed about the project proposal and what we have to do in that .
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about the project proposal. 
    </li><li>
      In the last class i enjoyed how considerate you were as to give us an extension for the project proposal as well as the second blog 
    </li><li>
      in the last meeting was based on the topic of the video about surveillance capitalism basically it all adds uptogether and makes a cycle in which we are in, the algorithm was shocking in the video and how their chronology the cycle works for example the "A.I backbone" of the facebook and how they secretly collect the data in terms of behavioural recognition and this is such a big threat and so little knowledge about it. In the lacture we also talked about project proposal
    </li><li>
      In our 13th meeting we discussed how our project proposal will be marked, what to do with our 2nd blog essay, what kind of oath should every programmer have and finally what were fallacies people used in the media and in daily life. With our 2nd blog essay we have to discuss and argue a topic discussed in class. An example of a fallacy is the Post-hoc fallacy which describes if an event or object A proceeded event or object B, then “A causes or caused B” would be a false assumption and a type of fallacy.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we discussed about the project proposal and blog entry 2. We also had a breakout meeting room where we discussed about fallacies (good and bad). In our group we discussed about the false dilemma fallacy.
    </li><li>
      I think the most important thing that we learned from this meeting is that how technologies are threating our democracy. Like how much data these companies collect and how much that they know about us that they can easily use it to impact people's decisions and using these data they can predict our future behavior and decision. In worst case for example these companies can use that against us like impacts who we vote and chose to vote for in an election or sell it to somebody else and that's very scary and a threat to our democracy.
    </li><li>
      I like that we pushed project proposals back a bit, I had a very hectic week and still going about it so it helps a lot and lifts the stress. Id like to mention that again Facebook is being the center of attention along with these other major things, it feels like those movies where a demon comes and you pay them to make your life easier but at the cost of your soul and identity, in this case, Facebook, and Google are the demons who just can't get enough of sucking us drying, but people still use it because...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 13 was talk about how is internet if use internet technology in wrong way (war is one of it). behavior modification empire is shown in some movie, people are living in a perfect world with no crime no war build by data, and because of the manager of internet won't let it happen. Then the main character found out conspiracy behind the world then they will try to escape that world. It about benefit, if using internet company use technology earn benefit with no baseline. It also disturb the society not less than war. So everything in internet...
    </li><li>
      In the previous lecture we saw a video on TED2018 about How we need to remake the internet. Jaron Lanier is basically trying to explain how the technology that we ourselves created is doing nothing but eventually destroying mankind. He further talks about the creativity and ideology of people in the past for enhancements in technology. SO basically the invention in technology and all this social media platforms and in general the whole internet is a curse to humans and a big mistake. Hence, in-order to survive, someone should undo this creation.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 13, we discussed about the project marking, blog entry 2 and the project proposal. Also went through the extension for both of the upcoming assignments. After that we had a group discussion in breakout room about fallacies.
    </li><li>
      In the beginning of the class i got to know about the extension about the due date of the assignment. The another important concept i learned from the class was fallacies and from the point of view of project its was very important for us to know what we can choose. however, the discussion about the internet was really short but was useful for sure.
    </li><li>
      The topic in today's meeting about whether technology helps democracy or not really intrigued me. I think technology, in a moderated manner, could be the best thing for people. Because of it, now in the time of need more people have come together than ever and can support acts of democracy from even the other side of the world and that in my opinion makes the world a better place to live in.
    </li><li>
      in last meeting, firstly we did a poll to extend the due date of project that is really helpful for us. As in this week we all have hectic schedule as this is the midterm week. i am really thankful to professor. Also, we discussed about fallacies and what kind of fallacy is the worst and which one is mostly known.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a discussion about fallacies and project proposal. Had a breakout room to discuss something more about that!!
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we talked about the fallacies in computer science. There are a lot to discuss about. I think all of them are wrong.
    </li><li>
      With the development of Internet technology, updates of algorithms and hardware generation after generation, the internet is breaking away from the original intention of the developer with many social problems. There is no doubt that internet has change our society dramatically, but also bring some new challenges and problems.
    </li><li>
      The class starts with the discussion about extension to the due date of the project and majority of individuals were in the support. I would like to appreciated professor for providing extension because we all are having hard time in between preparation for the midterms. As per the perspective of project submission many important points were made in the class. Such as word limit and what topic we can choose.From the point view of the study i learnt an important concept about the fallacies an how they are interacting with the technology.in the class it was also discussed that democracy...

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Hello. Well, just as as. I was late because my cat ran to the room here and. I was not trustworthy of his motives, so it has a good amount of the room lock them out. And then. it's a connecting connecting connecting connecting and I knew it wasn't going to connect. And then I had some problems rebooting. So it's been quite a good morning already. Thanks for sticking around. So did anyone see my post to the forum about technical difficulties.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I had some technical difficulties, putting that out as well, anyway. Never a dull moment. So how is everyone today.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Good good.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;cannot complain at all.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Not at all wow i'm really happy to hear that. do some more coffee, yes, I agree with that. Coffee is never a bad idea, I think. So let me. Do our attendance here well. So a connection. To login again. Or do I. One place told me I had an invalid session key. And then I went to a different screen or I want us. to access the attendance that's letting me work so. not sure about that. i'm happy I didn't have to login again but i'm not happy that I didn't have to log in again because i'm likely. On borrowed credentials here. Let me share the screen, so you can. see if you can beat me and copying it. From here to the chat. so slow there by having to select. A direct message and send it back to everyone. That was slow because and i'm 55 couldn't be 56 so. knock on wood. All goes to plan i'll be 56 by the end of the Semester. So my birthday is on April 17 so that's. that's a Saturday. This year. yeah like being married my wife and I are both areas and sometimes that's. that's not a good combination, but. again. anyway. I was born in Chinese calendar, I did at one point.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;I have to look into it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Anyway, okay glad we could have some quality time there. Alright, so attendances handled. Okay, so let me show you the changes I made to the project proposal see if they meet your. approval. Okay, so can be done, individually or in a small group of up to five. If you choose to work in a group list all the. So if you choose to work in a group list all the members of the group, on the proposal so that. Project group can be created for you. well. As I discuss late, the other day it's see i'll be put into the same project group, because at this moment you're all in your own project groups. anyway. So there's five of you only one copy needs to be submitted. trust that the system will work. So, if your project changes after proposal submitted, please keep me informed. and keep in mind that the goal that proposes for you to do some planning, so the changes will be necessary. me choose what you will do with for the project, it almost feels class themes in some way, and I am open to your ideas about how to how you will do it your options include but are not limited to. So I moved the list so I should have made that line as well. Let me fix that right away. So, on the first first page. You say project proposal. group or if it's an individual put your name and if it's more than one person in your group. and put all the names of the people in your group. Okay, so just so it's clearly identified at the top. So. i'm editing the website with Adam. And when I release when I reboot my computer which i've had to do a few times lately. Adam doesn't start properly. I wonder why that is. Anyway, so i'm just starting it again now. So i've heard people say nice things about vs code. Well, that i've looked at a little bit, and I was having problems. Getting some things set up but we're gonna take another look at it. Now I like Adam. As much as I use it. But like I said i'm open to new things. We still not still capable of learning new tricks. me see if that's. checking to see whether. jacqueline's running in the background. Okay, so here i've changed at the same so you can put into the project together, only one cognitive repurposing needs to be submitted. me choose what you will do for the project, unless you have class things in some way and i'm open charities or how to do it. contents and foreign either proposal to match the River colonias appalling headings topic describe your topic and how it relates to class, so I have a link to the list of topics and learning outcomes. For the Semester, which may be of help to choose a topic that's new to you, but you haven't done your blog entry. The general topic is similar please indicate how you're treated differently, such as from a different perspective. So you might. tackle the same general heading general topic knowledge unit sort of speak sorry. we're going to try to talk to you quickly now to make up for time. Anyway, it's interesting to see what comes out in the transcript on him. I have to look at some of these words and think what was I trying to say and some of them are. Are guessable but others are. rude require trip back to the audio recording to see it listen to it again, I think. Anyway, so the general topic is similar please indicate how you'll treat it differently, such as it from a different perspective or. I hope that's clear enough. So, then, the deliverable and the rationale choose the form in which you deliver your project your options include but are not limited to. So you can do a research paper a book review Wikipedia article committed create and promote some online content. Video. and video doesn't have to be a live action shot, it could be a recording or presentation with narration can be a podcast or blog. picture yourself as a computing professional identify and discuss role models for your life as a competing professional. discuss contributions you've made to an open source project such as on github, for example. write some code to test, an idea. And also explain why you are choosing it. I can probably make that a little more clear, let me try that quickly. lost focus on my text editor. Okay, so I said also explain why you're choosing that particular deliverable. it's not a big improvement but small and perhaps. And then tentative plan provide a clan of some milestones realizing your chosen deliverable. This plan may look like an outline of what you plan to. include you're doing this with a group make clear how each Member will participate in the final deliverable. So it doesn't have to be two pages long. I didn't give a word count. So if you have a group, then you might use extra space to. you're doing it individually, you might be able to fit onto one page and if you're doing a group, you might need two pages to describe how you envision everyone working together. To complete the deliverable. So that makes sense. Okay. right then. So I wanted to touch on embassy today. And I wanted to also show you the empathy map assignment. So you can let me know what you think what needs to be clarified, and so on. So I suppose the describe the steps. should be under the list of what you're asked to do. So let me change that quickly. let's see if we can do it quickly. So in hindsight, I realized. That my zoom was having problems yesterday, or it may have been my zoom and problems yesterday, if someone tried to connect to me during my office hour, and it would just it just tongue there connecting to audio for several minutes and I tried. I tried to. connect communicate with the students in other ways, but I didn't. Use I had not sufficient. So, if it was you. say it was Jason. Here and trying to get Ahold of me in office hours yesterday. And I apologize, it was my assume that was acting up, I can think.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;and
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I hope I can. answer your question. Perhaps today at 330 is another office hour. And if not by email or. message for. discussions. Okay, so it seems like forever ago but the beginning of the semester we talked about proctor track. And lots of. unkind things are said about proctor track. So we're not going to this is not indication that we're going to use proctor track. For the final exam. Because we're not. However. i'd like you to. go through the process of onboarding. And then. Think about the activity. So describe the steps you take to underperform the proctor track onboarding examine onboarding and practice rock onboarding and practice exam. Well, I don't know what i'm going to ask for the final exam. So, still a bit early. I have to. I have to. go over some good topics. yeah Okay, so we could have some fun with talking about. What could be on the final does anyone know what could be on the final well I probably have a better idea than most people. So the i'll say that it won't be something that it's that's. outside the context of our discussions. In the topics we've considered in class in our meetings. It looks like too many zeros on that se. So it'd be something. i'm leaning towards a take home exam kind of structure. Where there'll be a choice of. you'll you'll be given a choice have. You heard me you won't be given a choice you'll be given. A topic from a set of topics, so not everybody will see the same topic or topics. And then you'll be given some time to write. An article or an NSA about that topic. Okay, so I didn't see what Dane said, to begin with. yeah so the exam is. 20th 20. Thinking it's a 20th I could be wrong. Anyway, yes that's off topic. So what I. What I want. This idea to this assignment to focus on is. Looking at. developing our skill for empathy. Which is a coin to that Roundtable I can't quite a lot is in terms of a soft skill that's important for computer professionals to have. So an empathy map looks like this, I think this is the right link to it. Okay. Just an article called empathy mapping, but it has a. there's an illustration here, so an empathy map, according to this. Article, that is the definition it's a collaborative visualization us to articulate what we know about a particular type of user. It externalize is knowledge about users in order to create a shared understanding of user needs and to aid and decision making. Okay, so you're going to be doing an empathy map for yourself. So here's what an empathy map looks like. So it doesn't have to be a square with four squares. can be rectangle there's four quadrants and we think about what the user. says thanks does and feels. Well, completing the task. Or the activity. So. We can, maybe say think about these these four categories Category four types of or the four quadrants in terms of. do the same and different. So if we ask the person. To speak to talk about their experience as you're doing it. So we can we can get. Information, we can quote the user. By asking them questions and ask them to think aloud when they're working through the activity. So they might say this is. This is clear, this is not very clear. This is. frustrating, what do I do now. Those kinds of things might be said. By the user. And then, what the user does, we can observe what the user does. So that's somewhat straightforward. move that's the most straightforward. However. Well, so if we're talking about a user other than ourselves. asking them to speak aloud during an activity. or ask them questions is maybe not very natural for them so they will. They might say some things that are different. Then what they would. Be might come up with. A different explanation. And the does because they're under observation. They may be. Somewhat self conscious about. performing an activity with someone else there. or. Whether they're being recorded well performing the activity. But it's still. These are still some. This is still reasonably better sources of information than for us to guess what the user wants. or think about the poor user has to do these things. If we can get some things that are. or. Even coming directly from the user, however filtered they might be it's a benefit. And then thanks and feels. Those are a little bit more. difficult to find it. So the fields. it's more about user. Experience or the emotional. So here i'm going to switch to the text. So the thinks quadrant captures of what the users thinking through the experience ask yourself from the qualitative research gathered what occupies users thoughts. What matters to the users, a possible to have so it's possible how the same content and says, and thanks, however. A special attention to what the users think that may not be willing to vocalize try to understand why they're reluctant to share they unsure self conscious polite or afraid to tell others something. The fields quadrant is the emotional state often represented as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself what where is the user, what does the user get excited about how does user feel about the experience. impatient pages low to slowly confused too many contradictory prices worried, they are doing something wrong. So here's a sample empathy map. If we're going through the activity of buying a TV. The the person may say where should I start. What size best I want sending reliable. I was expecting something different. Thanks and we're wasting too much time what else, am I missing. I want something awesome too many acronyms. Why is this so hard. And under what they do check the web, a web site. make small decisions postpone big decisions observes and store asks friends. Listen list pros and cons compares products. and feel overwhelmed excited unsure who to trust anxious inadequate fear. Okay, does that make sense. I would say we don't need to include the goals at the bottom. Is in this example.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;So is this assignment like imagine if you were in their shoes sort of anger.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;well. I want you to do it for yourself, but this is just i'm just sort of outlining the process.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;gotcha you can. If you, you can construct empathy maps for other people doing an activity. In that case, you would. You would have to rely on other data that you've collected. You wouldn't be able to. get exactly what they feel or think. I mean you can observe it, you can record what they say and what they do. But you'd have to. do some work to in empathizing with them. You know, putting walking a mile in their shoes, so to speak. From all the other information you've collected to you, you would. Get you make. guesses about informed guesses about what they think and feel while completing an activity. make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;And then the third part of. This is when you've. gone through the process. Some of you may have already gone through the process of onboarding and doing the practice exam. When you've gone through the process, you can look at what you've observed about yourself. And then think about. areas or opportunities to redesign our improvement of the process. In the interface and. You know, to say. If there's a particular thing that made you nervous about. If the concern is about privacy is there a particular thing that makes you nervous. And could that be improved, for example, could that be restated. can be made more clear that the data is not store is stored in Canada. And that nothing is. nothing, nothing is capped. for purposes other than verifying your exam participation. And so on right So how could we. How could we improve the onboarding process. that's the last part about the opportunity to redesign. seem okay. And as far as i'm concerned that you know if we can. If there are questions or concerns about this. Over the next while we can. We can clarify things. as well. not opposed to doing that either. So there's a related article sympathy versus empathy and user experience. So rather than. know I feel like we've talked about this a little bit. That we have sympathy for the poor user. And we're going to do the user favor because they're so hard done by. So that's using simple that's using having sympathy for the user versus empathy is. Understanding their position and what. And how they perceive. Things so it's not looking trying to look at the problem from the perspective of the user and not just. look at it from the outside. So I invite you to look at that article as well. For today. I apologize for my. system problems. Then again, if you try to get me with an office hours. Let me know i'm trying to keep keep track of all the different. ways to keep in touch. But my my intention is to is to be available for questions and so on, so i'm not trying to hide out. Okay, so have a great weekend. and enjoy the sun. Take care and stay well. And i'll see you on Tuesday okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
