      In the last class, we talked about how technology can help make our lives more sustainable. We have seen the use of technology for the betterment of human civilization. All the satellites that we use for providing internet and to provide a prediction for floods and droughts have helped framers across the world. The use of eclectic cars has reduced carbon emissions across the globe. Technology in the current pandemic has helped a lot to connect people all across the world and teachers, parents, governments, and health officials could connect with their counterparts without fearing any data breach and they...

      On meeting 17 we discussed the sustainability for internet for this century, and I have watched the two Ted talk videos for William Mcdough and Tim-Berners Lee, they give us the idea of nowadays industry influence for public and why we build an open web, Ideas for Cradle to cradle design, we have known that Industry is damaging to the environment, Reducing, reusing and recycling are good ideas but they’re not enough to make a difference. For The New Web, we’ve learnt building a web for open, linked data that could do for numbers what the Web did for words,...
    </li><li>
      Sustainability is very important. For example, nowadays human activities are constantly consuming resources. If resources are used up, then human beings will be in danger, which is also the importance of sustainability. However, sustainability is still important in the online world, and we need to build a sustainable online environment to cope with the growing number of users in the future.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learnt about is spime. Spime is an object that could be track through space and time throughout its lifetime. Its all information is stored in a cloud.It is a mechanism that could track any thing on Earth.

      I do like breakout meetings if the people are willing to participate in them. If they don’t, then it just honestly sad.Thanks for the blog post 2 due date extension. Lots of people need it.With all these tech gadgets available. How can you maintain privacy once you have them inside your home?Sustainability from the computer professional side. Create gadgets that don’t get outdated right away and produce more e-waste. Some parts of e-waste are recyclable while the other part is not. Create more efficient apps that require fewer resources to run, so it doesn’t make a lot of energy to...
    </li><li>
      We had a breakout room discussion about what responsibility do Computer Science Professionals have in order to embrace sustainability in their work. We agreed that the best that they can do is devise methods, create products which will help in solving sustainability of humans in the long run. Wikipedia defines that the field of Computational Sustainability, attempts to optimize the social, economic and environmental resources, using the power of computers to process large quantities of data and provide an efficient, sustainable decision to allocate resources in real-time. For example, the Intelligent Transportation System(ITS) attempts to improve travel safety and reduce...
    </li><li>
      In our 17th meeting we discussed about sustainability, our 2nd blog, SaskPower, and computer professionals’ goals towards sustainability. In class we were asked to describe what is sustainability. When we were placed in groups to discuss, we said that doing small things like not using single use non-biodegradable plastic bags, straws and cutlery although businesses should also do their part with sustainable responsibility and not simply leave it to the consumer. An example of possible sustainability with the expense of security and privacy was SaskPower’s smart meters to control electricity consumption. One example of sustainability that computer professionals should be...
    </li><li>
      I am interested in the concept of sustainability for software engineers. It is important for software engineers to create software that can still run on old hardware, so that there is not an unnecessary amount of waste created with an update in hardware.
    </li><li>
      Our talk about sustainability reminded me about these videos on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnJ8mK3Q3g &amp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvzvM9tf5s0). One video talks about why recycling is basically a scam due to many reasons (economics, lower concern for plastic use, etc.) and the other compares plastic bags vs more "sustainable bags" respectively, and it's pretty shocking information. It's pretty eye-opening to learn about things that you once thought were sustainable but actually are not. This just shows as important sustainability is we need to have better information of what is truly sustainable before making decisions on sustainability.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a discussion about technology. That how it is useful in our day to day life. Even in this cureent pandemic, it became more useful in every field.
    </li><li>
      Something I encountered that is related to the past meeting was at a past workplace. I used to work at a computer repair shop, and the amount of technical waste we accumulated daily was extremely high. In class, we discussed the value that data can have on sustainability and environmental impact. Due to my past experience working with old and broken technology, when considering sustainability and how IT professionals can be more sustainable, I think it is also important to consider technical products and how those pieces of equipment can be more sustainable.
    </li><li>
      In class, an explanation of Bruce Sterling's “spines” was given, and how it relates to possible harms from IoT lifecycles that have finished serving their purpose. I think this is comparable to online spaces, as younger generations spend their entire lives connected to the internet. Anything online that they have done in the past could be accessible, stolen, or used against them, despite that corner of the internet being at “the end of its lifecycle”. I think there's a potential danger there for people being exploited for things they have done when they are young and immature.
    </li><li>
      I feel like today's discussion about Sustainability needs to be done on a much larger scale than an Undergraduate class. I really love the fact that big tech giants like Apple, Microsoft and Samsung are shifting to recycled materials as come to think of it, it will mean that millions of people will indirectly be a part of the green initiative. Also, in my opinion, bigger corporations need to step up and start doing their part for the world otherwise we're headed towards Armageddon
    </li><li>
      It was great discussing sustainability and privacy in a group, also thank you for extending the submission for blog2. Under the submission of blog1 it says grades ready to release but nothing yet seen so if you can do that would be great. Thank you.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed how technology can help make our life more sustainable. We saw how technology is used for the betterment of humans beings. The satellites that we use to provide information about any upcoming disasters before time have helped people globally in many ways. Nowadays we are using electric cars which reduces the level of CO2 from the atmosphere and not only helping humans but also mother earth to heal. Most of all in a hard time of pandemic we can connect to people across the world on the tip of our finger. It made things...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this class was on the topic of sustainability. Sustainability is important because resources are scarce. Since most companies in various sectors use computers and software to do work, computer professionals can contribute to sustainability by developing better programs and algorithms for many areas such as manufacturing, distribution of energy, etc. Computer professionals have a great potential to contribute because they have already transformed the world for the better with the development of the internet, computers, and mobile devices.
    </li><li>
      The most interesting thing was how data is analyzed and used to boom the market for businesses but its also shocking how it is not breach in people's privacy, from google tracking to proctor track, data is being spelled by major organization for their benefits. Data plays most crucial rule role in todays world but there are rising concern for the same that needs to be resolved
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting we had 2 breakout seasons. The first one about “What is sustainability” and 2nd one is about “what’s the computer science view on sustainability”. After both seasons, we had a discussion about what was our thoughts about it. In my opinion nothing really has sustainability, there will be always some new ideas to replace the old idea. On the matter of computer science, I think sustainability is a growing field. There will be more and more new methods and tools to upgrade the applications.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we attended a breakout season to discuss about What is sustainability. Then professor was asking about what’s each groups opinion about the topic. Then we talked about the blog 2. Professor discussed what should be main focus for the blog 2. He also changed the date for blog 2 submission. He also talked a bit about the 2 ted talk (cradle to cradle design) &amp; (The next web). In the cradle to cradle design, the speaker talk about triple top line. It’s the idea that any design can be used under component, and it can be...
    </li><li>
      It seems to me that sustainability as it relates to CS means systems that only collect data that is necessary and is known to the users, which is used solely to improve the users' experience.
    </li><li>
      After listening to Tim Berners-Lee, it only continues to pique my interest in the topic of data. Linked data is something I often desire, both in professional fields, and my own personal interests or hobbies. I hope we explore the idea of “linked data” more.
    </li><li>
      Thoughts on the Next WebThe Next Web is the title of a TED talk given by the creator of the world-wide-web and head of the W3C organizations that oversees the development of the web. He delivers an inspiring speech on the nature of the web, the dilemmas it solved and the atmosphere generated in rooms by people at the first few instances experiencing the web. He continues to talk about the next generation of the web, how data will flow freely though-out society. Much of this has already either happened or is in progress in 2021. With the rise of...
    </li><li>
      When we are talking about sustainability I think the pressure is on consumer and producer, but more so on the consumer. When we were talking about cradle to cradle designs this would only be effective if the end consumer recycles it. If there is no incentive for the consumer to recycle these products then a lot of people wont. Look at can recycling, a deposit is paid and then gotten back when you return it. So I think when computer professionals are looking at sustainability I think we would have to focus on why people will be recycling it.
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about the idea, or term I suppose, "spime(s)". The wikipedia entry was very brief, I suppose due to this being an unconventional term, and I wished to see a few more examples of what could be considered "spimes", besides the "six facets of spimes" which were described rather broadly. However, from the wiki it is clear what Spimes are (or could be), I suppose I would have appreciated a bit more detail.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we talked about sustainability which is taking decision while keeping the future impacts of the decision in mind. We had discussion about these and it was pretty fascinating to hear new ideas. Another interesting thing about meeting was discussion about the smart meters that were installed in homes for watching the consumption of an household and we came to know about many new things
    </li><li>
      Meeting was pretty interesting due to the fact that sustainability was being discussed and fellow student have pretty good ideas when we discussed it in a breakout room. Other than that we had another breakout room discussion about how computer professional contribute towards sustainability. Discussion about Volkswagen's emission controversy was really surprising for me. Smart meters were also discussed which were installed in Regina as well. Deadline for blog 2 was extended which was really good.
    </li><li>
      While it certainly is important to make sure that we are developing in an environmentally conscious way, such as avoiding making an application with a hardware component that we quickly abandon, I think that sustainability in this context has another meaning. A big part of sustainability is ensuring that the way we are developing now does not abuse the rights of users in such a way that would cause increased restrictions to be imposed on future generations. While realistically it can be anticipated that some privacy is lost when dealing with anything online, if we are intentionally taking that multiple...
    </li><li>
      William McDonough, a green-minded architect and builder, asks in the first video how our buildings and products look if planners take all kids, all animals, into account. The principal objective of McDonough is to build a safer society which is a true intention for the present and the future. In addition, it is always really effective how he believes using instances. I believe that having a clear goal is critical in guiding us to our destination.
    </li><li>
      With this last meeting focusing on sustainability, we had a great discussion on how computing professionals can contribute to sustainability practices. I really enjoyed the thoughtful conversation, but I really struggle when people ask, "But what's the motive or incentive for companies to implement these practices?" Of course, it's an important question to ask! Obviously it is important to find reasons to convince the companies we work for to change their policies or their products; however, I really struggle to understand why this question needs to be asked all the time when the motive/incentive is just to be ethical.Why isn't...
    </li><li>
      We learned many things in this class. I learned one of the most important things that is the scientist Tim Berners-Lee has expressed his thoughts to a new web, since he was the one to discover the world wide web and URL. He expresses that the collection of data has the relationships called ‘linked data’. He talks more about the Raw data of everyone, and every community is important, but some raw data should be revealed from the communities like government for transparency and to acknowledge their works. And there are many data that are not connected to those that...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed about 2nd blog and the professor changed its due date. Later we were divided into groups to have group discussions in the breakout rooms.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 17, we talked about the sustainability. The country should have the plan of repair the damage of nature that caused by human development. The environment of the earth getting worse if we compare it to 20 century. Because of building needs land, a lot of trees are cut down, because of the exhaust emissions, the fresh air is polluted.
    </li><li>
      In previous class, we saw two TED talk videos which said nothing but different aspects regarding technology and the way it assists life of billions of humans in an appropriate manner. Almost Everyone makes proper use of technology in some or the other form. Scientists are able to forecast or foresee many things for the calamities or any other natural phenomena upcoming in the near future after the invention of communication satellites. Such kind of Devices helps in forecasting weather or any kind of natural calamity, supports live video streaming, live telecast of sports such as basketball, football, etc can...

      The last meeting was interesting where we discussed a little bit about privacy and then shift our topic to sustainability.
    </li><li>
      My contributions as a future computer professional in sustainability are as follows:-pay more attention on public’s privacy by adding code of conduct that ensures safety of public’s data ,as privacy is a very fragile topic these days.-updates on my interface would be more public friendly keeping public’s necessities and recommendations in mind.-rather than filling my bank accounts it would be more of public supporting and public welfare work .

      The most important thing discussed in the meeting was about the spime i.e neologism futuristic thing to the internet technology and the videos about the "the next web" and about the cradle design.topic that is related to the previous class isabout the insecurities of the internet technologytopic that is difficult to understand was about Spime and its affectstopic i would like to learn more is about the cradle design as it is more interesting and gives us much knowledge about the thing running in present world

      Everything we do is done for one purpose, but sometimes these purposes seem to be self-contradictory. For example, printing the slogan "Protect Trees" on paper is obviously self-contradictory. Therefore, when designing a product, people must think comprehensively and put an end to such self-contradictory behaviour. In the future development of computer software, data interconnection is very important. This not only allows a substantial increase in user experience but also reduces the work of developers and allows the Internet to truly connect data.
    </li><li>
      In the video of ted talk william mcdonough talks about preventing environmental disaster and improving economic growth by cradle to cradle design.
    </li><li>
      In the class we talked about sustainability and how as a computer programmer we can make a software sustainable. In our group discussion we all suggested that we as an individual should make privacy options for the users so that they know what will happen with their data.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we discussed about sustainability and how using information tecnology we can help us to use our resources sustainabilly. In the Break ot room we discussed that tecnology such as electric vehicles can bring pollution caused by carbon dioxide to low levels and helps earth's atmosphere to remain sustainable.
    </li><li>
      It is worth remembering, recent the web is: in January 1992, there were 50 web browsers in universe, generated as a result of the web in 1990. To represent, linked data must be free, so the old styles of file transfers must give way to heritage of data sharing: a commons of material which can be mentioned in various ways. Rather than hoarding files and records as people currently do, Berners-Lee advocates for 'raw data now' to allow a future of exchanging and increased collaboration.
    </li><li>
      I learnt from the video "The next web" the differences between days before the web and days after web was createdand the speaker also said that we have not reached the full potential
    </li><li>
      As for "Cradle to cradle design", it allows us to understand the environmental issues and impacts of manufacturing and industrial systems.As for "The next web", there are three sources of dysfunction affecting today’s web: deliberate, malicious intent, system design that creates perverse incentives, and unintended negative consequences
    </li><li>
      Sustainability is extremely important in the world of technology and business. If you are going to create something either a product or a business you have to think about the future and what might come and plan accordingly so that your product or business will survive. The longest running companies or products that have been around for a long time are here because they are sustainable
    </li><li>
      When a product meets the basic requirements of appearance, creativity, and function, it also considers the enterprise's social responsibility. It still doesn't qualify as "good design." A good design should eliminate the idea of waste，so all that is leftover can be used to make a new generation of products at the end of the product's life cycle. Therefore，good design needs to consider sustainability—for example, the "cradle to cradle" green loop design. Coca-Cola creates a system where plastics and other recyclables are used. As this system's scale begins to expand, we will see all kinds of old plastics recycled as if...

      The way in which our society is designed plays an important role in the society. The goal is to achieve sustainable development. It can be achieved by efforts and inovation. People should try to build a society which does not harm anyone and the basic rights of people should be protected. Inovation plays an important part in achieving this goal and people should be given opportunities so that they can achieve the goal they want.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we learnt about sustainability. People have different point of view on sustainability.There was an opinion that sustainability would be resources you consume should be less than the minimum amount that a planet can regenerate to ensure no deficit.If computer professionals make their data more available and transparent to the public, it will increase accountability and people will be able to make more thoughtful choices. It will give the public a chance to make more informed and sustainable decisions.
    </li><li>
      For me, sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or project. Sustainability is when we wisely use the resources and utilize our time and make decisions that have the future in mind. In a general sense, it means doing something now that can continue indefinitely, without impeding the ability of future generations to do so. Mostly as a neither way we can look at sustainability is that its also a way of stagnation since there is no need to bring in new ideas since they have a steady source of income. In a very broad sense, sustainability is...
    </li><li>
      The past meeting was about the stuff related to design and the way in which designs impact the development of human. Every action taken by the humans should be in under rules of sustainablitiy. Inovation is a great step to get success in planning a bright future. Government should promote this things and motivate its people to be inovative so that the effort is in right direction.

      With the concept of cradle to cradle architecture, William McDonough suggests a solution to our unsustainable methods of production. Many companies and countries (including Nike, Gap, and China) have enlisted McDonough's support to build sustainable structures.
    </li><li>
      We talked about cradle architecture and how it can help us create more sustainable structures.
    </li><li>
      We discussed about sustainability and how computers affect the sustainability.
    </li><li>
      We had group discussion regarding the ways to increase the sustainability and as an outcome we came to conclusion that sustainability is directly proportional to privacy. If we increase the privacy measure in simple way find solutions to the problem that user data does not get leaked then we can attain sustainability and I would like to see more ways through which we can attain it and I also watched the videos on website they are really good
    </li><li>
      One thing I'm really curious and want to know more about is that if they actually made/built that city with farm on the top of the roof. Also on the second video was talked about how we should put more data on the web and how helpful it would be to our society. But it's also very important to know that putting our data blindly online without a good plan could become dangerous. For example there are companies that does free DNA test for you to know where your ancestor come from, however it is important to know that with...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing i learned from the last class was how techonlogy makes our lives more susatainable. Also, I found the ted talk about the next web to be very interesting because it talks about raw data, web in next generations and making data availaible through links.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I talked about last meeting had to be sustainability. Our breakout group mentioned how sustainability is making decisions with the future in mind. The hardest thing for me to understand was cradle to cradle design. The "intention of our species" is a very broad topic that was hard for me to correlate to the design philosophies and examples in question. Sustainability is something I have been thinking about for a long time in every day life. I have thought about the sustainability of my work, student, and life balance. Not only that but the discussion of...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, I learnt that Sustainability means meeting our own needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.It is also the ability for something to be consistent.I also learnt on the concept of Spime which is a neologism for a futuristic object, characteristic to the Internet of Things that can be tracked through space and time throughout its lifetime.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we talked about how sustainability is crucial in this world and particularly in the technological context! I think, one of the major driving factors to tackle climate change in the future would be AI. Moreover, All of the recent tech trends, such as AI, ML, the Internet of Things, Big Data, edge computing, robotic process automation, and others, are designed to make our lives easier. That is why both ordinary consumers and large-scale companies are interested in these technologies and improvements. For example, artificial intelligence has been instrumental in complex data analysis and management aimed at...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we learnt about sustainability and how it is related to computer Science. We also had discussion about the good software design. The TED talk was very much related to the discussion in class and William Mcdonough very well explained sustainability by "cradle to cradle design". In the other TED talk by "The next web" explained about the development in the every sector of life and also gave idea that it is not yet at its full potential.
    </li><li>
      From the meeting i got to know that the due date of the vlog 2 has been extended and also for the empathy map and i would like to appreciate professor for cooperating with the students. The important topic which was discussed in the class was sustainability. From the medium of group discussion the discussion became more brief. Frankly before the class i had no factual information about this topic. but the meeting was very useful.
    </li><li>
      When it comes to sustainability in computer programming, the first thing that comes to mind is the ability for a project to be maintained with a reasonably low amount of resources being spent on it. A project that is continually causing issues and draining time and resources is not very sustainable. The term sustainability is also often referred to in conversations about the environment and taking care of the planet. Using recycled resources and items is a sustainable practice and can help reduce the waste made in the industry.
    </li><li>
      In the ted talk it was intresting topic of design, and how in everything it was used and how is the cycle like according to me for example to success in anything you have to work for it for years learn all the stuff than you became masters in it and that is exactly happens with the technology and design like phone apple how the first one was made and how the iphone12 is capable of doing things, so it basically takes time to get the best out of design to make it efficient as in the video he talked...
    </li><li>
      It is important for designers to create a sustainable platform for their consumers ,to help when the number of users grow in the future
    </li><li>
      After watching "the next web", I have learned that the data comes in many forms and there are many connections between data. The web is full of linked data that has three rows. The first one is http name used for people, places, and events. The second one is the data representing useful information. The last one is the relationships between data. The purpose of using data is to improve people's lives and delivering information to public. Even though all kinds of information are available on the web, much of the data remains hidden from the public such as government...
    </li><li>
      In our 17th meeting we discuss about sustainability and it’s very intresting topic. Sustainability does not have any particular definition but it is helpful at multiple place.Sustainability is one the newest degree subjects that attempts to bridge social science with civic engineering and environmental science with the technology of the future. When we hear the word “sustainability” we tend to think of renewable fuel sources, reducing carbon emissions, protecting environments and a way of keeping the delicate ecosystems of our planet in balance. In short, sustainability looks to protect our natural environment, human and ecological health, while driving innovation and...
    </li><li>
      In last lecture, we discuss about the blog entry 1 numbers and also about the due dates of blog entry2 and empathy map
    </li><li>
      In the class, the due dates were postponed, and discussed the following topics.In the TED talk by Tim Berners Lee, he talked about the linked data and how it very important to have the data linked on the web which would be useful in every aspect of life.Spime is referred to as the "Internet of Things". An object is considered to be a spine when all of its information can be found on the cloud.
    </li><li>
      In the beginning of meeting 17 the professor made an announcement on the request of student of changing due date of the second blog. Which was an act of kindness and cooperation toward his students. The main topic for the today class was sustainability. Sustainability is the term which describe the management and disposal of information technology un such a productive way that it reduces the harm to the environment in other words sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or project with the use of resources and time making decision that have the future in the mind....
    </li><li>
      The most important thing discussed in the meeting was about the spime i.e neologism futuristic thing to the internet technology and the videos about the "the next web" and about the cradle design. Topic which we can count as related to the previous class is about the insecurities of the internet technology so how privacy breach can happen and how can we tackle. Topic which I find difficult to understand was about Spime and its affects. Topic I’d like to learn more is about the cradle design as it is more interesting and gives us much knowledge about the thing...

      We had a good meeting, and in the discussion, I learned about privacy and sustainability. So, privacy is a collection of data to protect it from unauthorized access, whereas; sustainability is a way to secure the future for the young generations.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discussed about how sustainability in technological innovation can help in future. Many of our problems can have an simple solution due to sustainability in technology. AI - artificial intelligence is one of the foremost example of it.
    </li><li>
      I wondering if you could discuss the content of the final exam. I believe An object can be considered a spime when all of its essential information is stored in the cloud
    </li><li>
      Tuesday it was very interesting to hear my groups (1 other person) talk about sustainability and how meaningful it is for the future. we are certainly moving forward towards that type of future but there is always a cost, Its very cool to be growing in this time but at the same time thinking about climate change is scary, i hope to see the planet become healthy throughout my lifetime.
