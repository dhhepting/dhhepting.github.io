      Yes we can reconcile freedom 0 with public interest just by obeying the pledge of computer professional, as dependency has been changed drastically since last decade and I think it’s going to increase more on daily basis so it’s very important for me and rest of computer aspirants and professional to do our jobs in an ethical way as a the future and present of the human civilization rests in our hands .
    </li><li>
      In meeting 19, we discussed Professional Responsibilities especially for computing professionals, and after study of two websites: “4 Essential Freedoms of Free Software” and “Computing Professional Oath”. I have more thoughts about the benefits of free software and what oath that computing professionals need to remember. By “4 Essential Freedoms of Free Software”, we have learned 4 freedom of open source software:The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).The freedom to redistribute copies so...
    </li><li>
      In our 19th meeting we discussed software having four types of freedoms and what is a computer scientist professional oath. The first freedom was the freedom to run a program as an individual wishes to and for any purpose. We were put in discussion groups and a few of my group members agreed that there will always regulations, limitations and liabilities with any tool let alone an open-source software. A possible computer science oath discussed in class talked about coding for the great good and not doing unethical activities just like doctors with their Hippocratic oath.
    </li><li>
      I think designers should encourage free software design. Free software makes the user feel in charge and if consumers can feel in charge of the services offered by a computer professional, they will continue to use the service.
    </li><li>
      I think there are good things about open source. First, it makes code available to the general public in a positive and open way, helping some people understand and learn programming. The downside is that opening up the source code online can lead to plagiarism, or it can lock people in, for example, by allowing beginners to follow the open-source route.
    </li><li>
      As I mentioned in my previous comment, the breakout room with five people doesn’t seem to attract people to participate in the conversation. Or maybe they could have turned on the zoom meeting and go somewhere. Having a larger group would help with more people talking.The idea of free software is tempting from my cheap perspective. However, there are different ways to motivate people. Some are motivated by money or they need money to live. As much as I hate to sound like a capitalist, innovation comes from a drive to make things better, usually to be more time-efficient. As...
    </li><li>
      The question was posed in the lecture, and I thought it was interesting: Is GNU's philosophy about free software too ambitious or extreme? My impression is that they are against anyone taking ownership of the software they create. I think that the decision of a developer to make their software open-source or not should be entirely up to them and not GNU. They come off like they are entitled to free software.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned in class yesterday was how GNU.org defines free software. Not only does it mean the software doesn't cost money to get, it also means it also must follow four essential freedoms. These four freedoms include things like offering access to source code so you can study and modify the code for your own purposes. Given I use free software, like LibreOffice, in my everyday life, knowing this changes my viewpoint of the computing world a little.
    </li><li>
      What I took away from this is that we should not be held to the responsibility of how our software is used, unless its intended purpose is what is causing the harm. You can make a messaging app, and if someone uses it for Cyberbullying, possibly to the point of causing another user to commit suicide, that is not the fault of the developer unless the app was intentionally designed in a way to encourage that use case. We should put in safety nets, like the ability to block or report users, but unless we are actively encouraging the harm...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was the four essential freedoms regarding software. The breakout room discussion was about whether or not we can reconcile freedom 0 with the public interest. We cannot reconcile freedom 0 with the public interest because if you have the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose, you have the freedom to cause harm to society using that program. Freedom 0 is not realistic because allowing people to do anything they want is not in the public's interest. There are rules and laws that prevent us from...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed about the topic of freedom of a user to use a software tools as they wish. well, that was quite interesting topic for me . my ideology about the concept was that developers should be paid for their work as they do hard work in making the stuff available to learners, so there should be some credit for them. Also, if it will be on users to utilize any software as they wish then a sense of responsibility will be created for all users to organize that platform and it can be mess ;...
    </li><li>
      On last tuesday we saw two articles in which one was a GNU project on free software operated by Free Software Foundation and the other article was "The pledge of the Computational Professional". In the first article we learned about what is Free Software? SO Free Software is basically a software that is manufactured in a way that it provides all users freedom and community. It actually is meant to be made as a user friendly tool so all users are able to perform functions such as copying, running the software, analyzing it and recreate it. Bascially means its open...
    </li><li>
      Honestly the most important thing I learned from last meeting was about GNU's campaign to make software free. I had no idea that this was the driving ideology behind GNU and it was interesting to learn about. I'd be a bit interested to learn more about their philosophy, especially since it seems from an ethical point of view they promote their 4 freedoms. I'm curious how they expect accountabililty/responsibility to be taken for misuse of a free product.
    </li><li>
      In last meeting professor was asking a question into the poll about if we like Zoom or WebEx for meeting. Then he was discussing about 4 essential freedoms of free software. He explained what is means by free software. Then we had to go for a breakout season to discuss about “can we reconcile freedom 0 with the public interest. The main concept of this topic is; how we have the freedom to run any program for different purpose without any hesitation. Then he posted another poll about how was the breakout room experience for us. Then we had a...
    </li><li>
      firstly in class, we discuss that we have to stick with zoom or Webex application and then we discuss the topic in a breakout room and the topic is can we reconcile freedom with the public interest? so software is a tool or a source that people can use and it depends on them that use in a good way or in a bad way after a topic discussion everyone had some talk about breakout room participation.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we learned many important facts about the freedom. The class taught me many things especially the freedom 0, “The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose”. If the above statement satisfies then it is a free source. As this freedom 0 concept out of 4, hampers a lot because the developer or company can produce any material which could harm the society badly. So, there has to be a strict rule for free sources, those that harms individual in anyway.
    </li><li>
      Open-source software can use knowledge more efficiently. Because it is open-source software, the user can use it for free: they are free to use and learn the software's internal architecture, and they can modify and redistribute it. Moreover, programmers are more likely to write better code based on their interests because open-source software is free. On the one hand, over time and with the collaboration of different people on the web, they will become more relevant to more people's needs. On the other hand, people with different needs can open another project to make a derivative version based on the...
    </li><li>
      As we discussed in class in zoom poll, which platform should we used i think personally the best for now would be zoom because majority of the stuff for university is going on with that! Also i have one more suggestion about the breakout rooms i feel the duration should be around 5 to 10 minutes not more than that because majority of the things would be easily discussed in that period of time.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we had a pool about using WebEx or Zoom. I prefer using Zoom because Zoom is more user-friendly and easier to use as compared to WebEx. Zoom also allows users to instantly join a meetings, with common features across all the devices. So basically, no matter what device you are using, you will be able to join the meeting from anywhere. On the other hand, WebEx has very lengthy registration and checking process compared to Zoom. Moreover, as we are already using Zoom for class and the semester is almost about to end, there is no...
    </li><li>
      Freedom in the software world is a different depending on the industry. If you look at video games, movies or other formed of entertainment, most of it is not free. This is due to the nature of people taking time and energy to make a viable product. I think this is the correct way of approaching freedom, however in terms of software some exceptions should be made. For example, in the case of students, Microsoft offers free Office 365 (cloud based) and if we look at a step further at Jet-Brains, they offer their entire development studio apps free for...
    </li><li>
      I don't think that when looking at the first of the four essential freedoms of free software you can ever blame the creator for anything that happens with their software. Since you could modify the software under those rules how can someone be held responsible for what someone else did. I would say the intent of the person making the free software is the most important ethical thing. Whatever they make the program to help people if someone uses it to hurt people not their fault they attempted to help.
    </li><li>
      Free software for an idea and studying it for any purpose without restrictions, as well as copying and circulating it against restrictions. Or you believe that you are registered with your same rights. Free, comprehensive, easy-to-use software. Free Software License Licensing it to the recipient, or creating it in the public domain, issuing the source software.
    </li><li>
      Meeting responseIn the last meeting, the professor talked about free software. So what is free software? Free software means software that respects users' freedom and community. And there are four essential freedoms rules to help us identify whether the software is free. First, The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose. Secondly, The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish Access to the source code is a precondition for this. Third, the freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others . Last, The freedom...
    </li><li>
      From meeting 19, one thing I found interesting in this class was the pledge of the computing professional. I really love this part because it helps and provides most computing professionals with a blueprint on how to do their job effectively while bearing moral and ethical responsibilities to society. If the oath is followed I believe most computing professionals would conform to the ACM code of ethics and thereby have projects and products that are provided based on the idea that the public interest is the primary consideration.
    </li><li>
      We had discussion on free software and then a breakout room discussion on reconciliation of freedom 0 with public interest. In the group discussion we decided that the users who are taking advantage of the free version of any software are to be blamed more than the programmers who have built it. Since its free that means the programmers don't have the authority to control it. Moreover, we discussed about the banning of killing robots, which I completely agree to because we never know when it can become harmful.I am looking forward to the public lecture on mars exploration tomorrow....
    </li><li>
      I feel the user should be hold responsible for misusing a particular website because developer just creates a software so it will have positive and negative effects but in what way to use is completely on user so I feel developer should not be responsible as he has not created something and is always for betterment but its on user how he receives it in negative way or positive way
    </li><li>
      I found the article “Free Software Is Even More Important Now” a fun read. I honestly didn’t realize there was this kind of passion over proprietary software and I will be looking into it more. I couldn’t help but find similarities outside software. For example, I would say University offers a proprietary education. I have never felt in control, and often find the system archaic in favour of practices that do not benefit every user.
    </li><li>
      I learn from the 4 Essential Freedoms of Free Software,- to run the program for the purpose- to study how the program works- to redistribute copies that can help others- to distribute the modified version
    </li><li>
      something different and interesting in this meeting we did is the talk about engagement meetings either it should be of more students or for more time.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about the topic free software. Free software means that the users have the freedom to run, copy and improve the software. But according to me free software are not ethically good. because a computer professional puts a lot of efforts to make a good software but if it is accessible to public then anyone could cheat or do any step in the code which would be a great mess. So there should be no free software We also had a short discussion about ban of killer robots. We also did a poll on the...
    </li><li>
      The oath brings up the need for a governing body for ethics in the programming field. Like engineering we need some organization that gives out licenses and investigates ethical problems within the profession. It is important for ethical thinking with all this new technology being developed.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we pondered upon the fact that whether we can reconcile freedom with zero public interest. In my opinion, there should be some amount of restriction when there is a certain freedom. Too much power is dangerous. Anything in excess is a drug is a very well-known saying which works perfectly. The law of nature is to keep everything balanced. Too much freedom can cause damage to the public itself. That’s why we need justification in the IT world as well.
    </li><li>
      The last class was quite interesting to me, especailly as the concept of AI deciding our fate and the topic of killer robot came up. It kind of sounds like terminator plot but can be implemented soon enough. However, even though a lot of people are very anxious about it, I do not think that it would be a significant issue soon enough. We won't see robot soldiers for at least a hundred years by now. As for drones, AI controlled ones could end up better, could end up worse. As for other philosophical factor, like for a self driving...

      The Pledge of the Computing Professional promote the belief of computing as a recognized career at the time of graduation for college students in Computing Science and related packages. ... The reason of the symbol is to remind the inductee to usually honor their profession via their moves.Futher about the free software is that we are allowed to run , upgrade and distribute freely.We can access the source code of the software for free.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned from the last class was learning about the four essential freedoms, which were:1.) The freedom to run the program whenever.2.) The freedom to study how the program works.3.) The freedom to share copies so you can help others.4.) The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others ..
    </li><li>
      A system is free software if its users have the four fundamental liberties discussed below.The freedom to run the programme as you see fit for any intent.The freedom to analyse how the programme works and modify it so that it performs your computing as you desire. Access to the code is required for this.The ability to reallocate copies in order to assist others.The freedom to share duplicates of your various versions with others. By doing so, you can ensure that your improvements benefit the entire society. Access to the source code is required for this.
    </li><li>
      The important thing is that you have a right to privacy as long as that right is used within the bounds of the law. Seeking privacy should not make you feel guilty. Privacy should be expected, and demanded.
    </li><li>
      We discussed the freedom 0 from FSF (free software foundation) in this class and how we can reconcile freedom 0 with doing public good. I believe the wording in freedom 0 i.e., "The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose" makes it hard to reconcile it with public good. As people can use the free program for any purpose and some of those purposes may lead to public harm instead of public good. For example, some freely available hacking tools such as for penetration testing can be used to cause harm to others.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 19, we talked about the free software. For me, free software provided convenience to users. But the free software in the market recent most of them are bundled with other software, force users to download them with the software they want together. this violate the "The four essential freedoms". It increased the burden on the computer.
    </li><li>
      In last class, we had a poll about using zoom or Webex and another poll about are break out using useful or not, in which I feel that sometimes I have good discussion in the rooms, but sometimes discussions are one-sided. Later in the class, we discussed about how program is free software and the four freedom essential to make them free software.
    </li><li>
      "4 Essential Freedoms of Free Software" is an interesting read. Our discussion during class was engaging. I learned about different types of freedoms."Computing Professional Oath" is a must for every computer professional.
    </li><li>
      The one thing I would like to learn more about is how the "ban on killer robots" can be enforced. We have bans on similar weaponry such as chemical weapons however they are still used sometimes today. Even if we enact a global ban how can we ensure that the ban is obeyed by all nations of the world? Afterall, when it comes to war there is no limitation to destruction, and killer robots will not be an exception.

      The cap on the delivery fees for the restaurant can be a good move, but of course the restaurant is not entirely dependent on that so, the time will tell if you asked me that how it is going to work for the local restaurants, but until the pandemic is at our doorstep, the struggling will continue.
    </li><li>
      Thinking more on the concept of 'free software' as we discussed in class I find the idea quite interesting. Looking at the four "essential freedoms" of free software, I believe that the ideas expressed could lead to a more inclusive and diverse computing environment. By allowing people access to the source code and allowing users to modify and redistribute their edited version of the program we can guarantee that people all across the world can access a global repository of code that we all can use and adapt to the needs of our programs, or contribute to ourselves.
    </li><li>
      Free software! It's a great concept that gives the user a lot of freedom. Switching from one free software to another is faster and less expensive than switching from one proprietary software to another. You are not bound by any company if you use free software. Free software isn't just for the benefit of the individual user. Through sharing and collaboration, it facilitates social solidarity and represents society as a whole. Free software is becoming an even more important part of our society and daily life as our activities become more computerized.

      In this meeting we had a discussion discussion about whether or not breakout rooms are good for discussion or not. I personally think that they ae quite beneficial because this way students can express their thought freely. we also discussed freedom (0) in the breakout room which states that any one can run any program according to their wish and for what ever purpose they like. there are 3 more types of freedom in open source program.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about four essential freedoms and that was quite interesting to learn about. We discussed about freedom(0) in the breakout rooms but unfortunately no one discussed anything. As, we discussed using breakout rooms for discussion is a good idea but when most of the people do not participate then how a single person can discuss. That was a bad experience for me.
    </li><li>
      Well it was interesting talking in the group with what we discussed, about really how we could have public interests and honestly I frogeet the other one. But I do know that it was an interesting topic that wich I had more time to discussed with the other person since the talk was getting good
    </li><li>
      In this meeting that “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.A program is a free software if it gives users adequately all of these freedoms. Otherwise, it is nonfree. While we can distinguish various nonfree distribution schemes in terms of how far they fall short of being free, we consider them all equally unethical.So my question i that to what extent can a developer make software free?Another question...
    </li><li>
      The interesting topic that we discussed in last meeting was freedom 0, which was about the concept that developers are free to use any software according to their wish. But I personally think that if this is the case than there should be a sense of responsibility to maintain the platform. So idea of making it a public good did not seem appropriate to me.By putting some restrictions we can better organize the software.Moreover developers should be paid good wages for their work as they made content available for us.In the meeting there was some discussion on breakout rooms ,...
    </li><li>
      I have an excellent topic to write that software and its free use for the user; users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study and change, and improve the software as their wish that is freedom 0.
    </li><li>
      Question from last meeting: Can we reconcile freedom 0 with the public interest?I don't think freedom 0 can be reconciled with the public interest. The dangers of this is when it gets used for harming the public rather than being beneficial. Having lack of laws or rules for running programs can result of misuse and greater damage to people. Although, some freedom can result to creative applications and efficient systems. I believe having some rules to avoid harming the public should be kept in mind.
    </li><li>
      The last class was all about the concept about free softwares and the way in which it differentiaites from open source software. There are four freedom in the free software which is the freedom to run the code, make changes to the code, save the work done by modification and freedom to distribute the copies of it. As a computing professional, the skills of the coder must not be used for unethical work so an oath is take by the professionals that they will work for the benefit of society.
    </li><li>
      The functioning of free software and the way in which it differentiates from the non free software was the topic of discussion in the class. The freedom to use the code, make changes to it, have a copy of the work done and redistribute the modified version of it is the advantages we get in the free softwares. To prevent computing professional to use their talent for the work that affects the society in a bad way, an oath is designed which every professional takes to be true to the society.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we had a discussion on a topic that is related to ideology its a new one for me and quite interesting that the thing that is made by the developers by hardworking then they should be pay for that thing no doubt there should be some restrictions but but still they get their credit. Apart from that we had a little discussion on a topic that is related to ban on killer robots. And also we voted in zoom meeting.
    </li><li>
      In the last week, we talked about freedom in the information society. In my opinion balance in society is very important. Too much freedom to anything can cause vandalism and inhumane activities. To protect human rights there should be a number of regulations and hence there cannot be any freedom without certain restrictions for the safety of people.
    </li><li>
      We discussed the upcoming zoom meeting for the Robotic Mars Exploration which is gonna held on 25th March' 21. Discussed on what are the 4 essential freedom of free software
    </li><li>
      It's cool to know there's an oath to a lot of things. I certainly can't wait for the day in which I can take "The Pledge of The Computing Professional" as it seems like a big deal to me who wants to work in these computing fields. I took an oath when i became a Canadian citizen it was a big day I was 14, I had to take the citizenship test and I passed on my first try with a score of 18/20 and it was a big deal because i had earned my Citizenship test on my own...
    </li><li>
      The way in which free software and nonfree software have a difference in reality was made clear in the last class. The free software is always for the benefit of the user. Free software is those in which anyone can make use of the code, go through the code, edit it and have a copy of their work without any problem. Also, the oath which a computing professional takes after graduating was introduced in the class.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned in this meeting which was also interesting for me was the actual definition of free software. I have heard the term before a lot but I did not know the actual meaning of it; I thought it means a software that is free to use however in this lecture I learned that meaning behind free is not a matter of price but liberty like freedom or free speech. Therefore free software does not mean that the software is free of cost but instead it means that we as a user have the freedom...
    </li><li>
      In past meeting, we discussed the concept of softwar and softwares as public good. Though everyone had different views about this plan, but i think that it would not be a good idea to make such important thing a public good, because there will be more cons to it than pros. Second thing was user friendliness of zoom or web ex . I voted for Zoom because in this year i used it regularly and got comfortable to use it. There was also a little discussion about robots and AI and how they can be dangerous.
    </li><li>
      Today’s topic is about responsibility in technology and which is very interesting topic. Information Technology has the responsibility to offer service in the most efficient, reliable, and secure manner while considering the needs of the total user community. At certain times, the process of carrying out these responsibilities may require special actions or intervention by Information Technology staff. In such circumstances, Information Technology staff is bound by specific policies governing their actions. At all other times, a staff member has no special rights above and beyond those of other users; they are required to follow the same policies and conditions...
    </li><li>
      I was interested to learn about the four essential freedoms of free software. I think freedom 1, "The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish" is very important because it allows others to learn from open source code and contribute to it. This leads to many people working and learning together. I also think freedom 0, "The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose" is important but also a bit troublesome because of people who may use programs for harm.
    </li><li>
      Strictly speaking, open source software and free software are different concepts, and any software that matches the definition of open source software can be called open source software. Free software is a more restrictive concept than open source software, so all free software is open source, but not all open source software can be called "free." But in reality, the vast majority of open source software also matches the definition of free software. For example, software licensed under the GPL and BSD is open and free.More intuitively, open source is a method; freedom is a spirit.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discussed about the special lecture which is going to held on Thursday and overall lecture was really helpful.
    </li><li>
      I learnt about free software: study how the program works, and change and also the ability to share copies so you can help others
    </li><li>
      basically we discussed about four essential freedoms of free software in this zoom meeting. especially how to run the program for the purpose. how to study about the working of program. Also, how to redistribute the copies that help others and how to distribute the modified version.it seems to be very interesting for me because its my first time to get knowledge about this topic.
    </li><li>
      Last lecture was really good and helpful and we also talked about the meeting of NASA which is going to held on this thursday.
    </li><li>
      From the article on free software I understood what it actually meant for a software to be free with the 4 conditions listed. Previously I would have concluded that a free software was a software you could download and use for free
    </li><li>
      From the last lecture i can give my opinion that it should have some restriction with some freedom. Also we had some discussion regarding zoom is better or webex. We had created some polls to discuss those things. Moreover, had a breakout room to discuss those points.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting there was a good discussion about the free or open source software. We discussed how Open source Software can be considered as the perfect example for today’s public goods. The government for the development and maintenance gives upmost priority to this public good. It is every individual’s responsibility to use the public goods in the ethical way and contribute to its development in every possible way. We also had  a brief discussion about the responsibilities of a computer professional.
    </li><li>
      The meeting was about the freedoms of software and its essential elements. It is also discussed about the mars exploration meeting and also about the computing professional oath. The topic related to last class was about the computing professionals
    </li><li>
      We talked about freedom in information society with society‘s safety in mind. Freedom should be there with some restrictions or else it can be dangerous to the human race.
    </li><li>
      In class we talked about maintaining public interest and freedom simultaneously. My thought after this class is what would contradict freedom with interest. What I mean by this is what level of freedom would have to be violated in order to reduce the public interest.
