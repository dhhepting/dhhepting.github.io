<ul><li>
      Today we discussed multiple news stories related to the ethics ofcomputer science, or lack thereof. I felt that listening to andreading all these different news stories really helped get through tome the point that ethics are really important in computer science,just like in any field.  The consequences of working in this fieldwithout ethical action could result in very negative consequences,even if they are unintentional, as well as personal regrets.
    </li><li>
      In our 22ndmeeting we discussed about a computer science ethics video and articles aboutethics concerns in a medical field case study. The ethics were from gianttechnology businesses called IEEE (Institute for Electronical ElectronicsEngineers) and ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and how they are becomingan industry standard for other technology companies like Oracle and Alphabet(the parent company and creators of Google). On the ACM ethics website therewas a case study of how someone’s medical implant can be easily hacked with thelack of hardware security.
    </li><li>
      We were looking at the AMC Ethics Malware Disruption. Looklike Rogue was completely at fault. One of the analogies that we found wasRogue is a house. There are rules that the guests need to follow to stay in thehouse. If Rogue hosts criminal activities then the law will come knocking themdown.The worm attack was a last resort because they won’t updatetheir hosting policies. They lost all of their business instead some of theirbusiness.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned in today's lecture is how useful ethical case studies are in examining ethical codes of conduct. External codes can be applied to these case studies and their conclusions can be analyzed to determine the codes' relevancy and effectiveness. These case studies can also be used to challenge and examine one's own internal code of conduct and develop it further.
    </li><li>
      I see the importance of a code of ethics in the sense that despite being not legally enforceable, they provide a guideline for developers to follow that keeps them from making decisions that bring major consequences for society and have negative legal implications.
    </li><li>
      Ended up in a bit of a rabbit hole after class looking into dark patterns in UX design. It seems there's actually more literature on it than I expected. It's kind of like the internet's version of sleight-of-hand, really. Misdirect over here, a big flashy thing over there, and whoops, you've subscribed to something you didn't want.This website explains the various different types of techniques to misdirect and confuse users. This just links to this inititative's twitter feed but there were some pretty interesting callouts on there. I'm curious about how users can protect themselves from this without just slowing...
    </li><li>
      I think that having a code of ethics is important in programming and IT because ethics are one of the principles that make civilization worthwhile. Obviously there is a lot of manipulative technology out there that seeks to exploit users in one way or another. Without some sort of ethical principle a society will consist of only the exploiters and the exploited. Even if these ethics aren't enshrined in law, the existence of a code of ethics that people follow starts a precedent that can potentially become law.
    </li><li>
      Title: Asking an EthicistThe ACM website on professional ethics’ website contains&nbsp; informationthat was interesting to note. Particularly the one that resonates with me the mostis acting consistently with public interest. Similar to that previous blogpost, we must always, as creators, innovators and idea manifesters, hold the publicin the highest regard when it comes to creating software. This concept not onlyworks in terms of ethics, but in actual business sense. If you understand that youruserbase is competent then your software can avoid being drabble. A good example is Apple’s current lineup of products.Each of which is built around simplicity, but attains...
    </li><li>
      His idea of an ethical code of conduct in the video is admirable, the problem with it is that that's all it is, is an idea. I would like to believe there is this code of ethics that people follow but that's not the world we live in. Bringing the ACM's code of ethics up in a court battle is a pathetic excuse&nbsp; that it's gaining traction, that a professor should know. Oracles lawyers are obviously just trying to see what the judge will allow. Any kind of normative statements aren't legally valid. I would be more interested in how...
    </li><li>
      The video by ACM Ethics: Integrity Project was funny and informative at the same time. I learned about the ACM ethics and their importance. I also learned about the court case between Google and Oracle in which Oracle presented ACM ethics in the court. We also had a good discussion in the breakout room about medical devices such as pacemakers that have Bluetooth technology and that can be hacked. I would like to know more about such devices and their risks.
    </li><li>
      We learnedmany things in this meeting, we started our lecture by the discussion aboutprofessional conducts and professional organization. One of the examples ofanalysis of malware disruption states that Rogue’s actions violateseveral principles of the Code. Since they allowed them for hosting ofmalicious software, Rogue facilitated the harm caused by their clients,violating all Principles. So, I learned how the malware disruption happens andwhat are those ways to be protected from that.
    </li><li>
      One thing I would like to learn more about is the different codes of ethics of computing from different organizations around the world. It is important to note that the formulated codes of ethics are not completely objective, they might have some integrated cultural biases for example, and thus it is important to analyze more than one. What is acceptable in one society, might not be acceptable in another, and thus they have might have conflicting codes of ethics. In this case, which one do we accept and follow? Or are they both correct somehow? 
    </li><li>
      I brought this topic up previously in one of my course work assignments, I believe it was my project paper actually, but I am referring to the "why everyone in tech should care about codes of ethics" video at approximately 14-18 seconds, Dr. Brinkman (If I heard him correctly) says that negligence or lack of care in regards to the codes of ethics in tech "can have serious legal and financial consequences". Seeing to as what businesses are essentially created to do, this is likely the most significant issue with ethics in the tech industry.
    </li><li>
      Wehave creative goods and services every day, which confirm their presence on themarket. It is this technology and creativity which lead to ethical problems,given that the competition for innovation is enormous. Critical and generalissues are data extraction, privacy invasions and data manipulation. To fixthis I guess adaptation and transition are the best approach. In order to trackrecent developments and technical improvements and to guarantee fair practice, constantsupervision is required.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 22, we talked about the IEEE and ACM code of ethics. I have no objection for this rules. Every industry has regulations that they need to comply with. Break the rules might bring loss for the company. Same as technology field, even though the law in this area not perfect yet. But obey the code of ethics will bring less trouble.
    </li><li>
      We saw the video why everyone should care about code of ethics is was knowledgeable and also i wanted to ask you can discuss briefly what exactly the final exam will likely be that would be great!Thank you&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      The code of ethics is a very sacred text for IT professionals. Programmers don’t realize how the code is unethical until they see later when people are getting affected by their website or platform. Bill Sourour talks about his experience of how an informative website about a disease and the drug-related to it would end up showing the drug of the pharmaceutical company he was working for, no matter which symptoms the user selected. He was alarmed of this unethical code was shown when he read a news article where a girl committed suicide after taking that drug as it...
    </li><li>
      All computer professionals should care about the code of Ethics because it helps to regulate the environment and also serves as a voice for professionals in the work environment.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      For this meeting honestly i will say i would like if the meeting respondes could be worked on the day of the meeting since this far away i do forget. I will say that i did learn that we might need to work on buillding the qustions since it took my group some time to really figure out what the qustion meant .
    </li><li>
      There is no doubt that computer practitioners should adhere to a code of ethics that can help us to create a good environment together. There's a documentary on Netflix called The Social Dilemma. In interviews with people who have worked for large companies, we found that much of what they did not follow ethical guidelines. This is definitely wrong and has a negative impact on the public.
    </li><li>
      With our group, wediscussed the Case Study: Medical Implant Risk Analysis, and how potentiallydangerous these devices could be if not properly implemented. The article inquestion discussed using an implant with wireless connectivity, and howimportant it is to ensure that both hardware and safety mechanisms are inplace. Examples they gave had to do with it having a very short range, so apotential malicious device would have to be in close proximity, and using ahardware approach for encryption, which they had mentioned would be harder tofix should any issues arise.
    </li><li>
      Every day, we experience revolutionary products and services that affirm their market position.&nbsp;Constant monitoring is required to keep track of recent innovations and technological progress, as well as to ensure fair practice.
    </li><li>
      I did find the discussion more difficult this time. We had decided to look at the Dark UX example. It's an issue for sure but I wasn't so sure what the solution for it is. Really in the example given though I feel like it shouldn't be up to the individual developer to refuse the work. The way I understood it, the developer's manager had already accepted the job/contract or whatever, and I feel like that's where it really should be stopped. If someone is accepting this sort of contract work, they should be in charge of filtering out bad...
    </li><li>
      In the previous meeting we discussed about CIPS again and there was a new way for breakout rooms was used which was great. It was also interesting to discuss about certification and professionalism in my group. We did a debate on that and that was quite interesting.
    </li><li>
      In the lecture we all see the video based on the code of ethics and discuss it in the class and then for breakout room discussion prof provide a link and we have to pick the point for discussion so, basically, in the last lecture, the topic for discussion is code of ethics.&nbsp;The ACM Code of Ethics communicates the heart of the computing calling, and it avows a commitment of registering experts both independently and on the whole to utilize their abilities to serve society. A code of ethics sets out an association's moral rules and best practices to follow...
    </li><li>
      I believe the Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals. The Code serves as a basis for remediation when violations occur.&nbsp;A&nbsp;code of ethics&nbsp;is&nbsp;important&nbsp;because it clearly lays out the rules for behavior and provides the groundwork for a preemptive warning.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we have discussed about the code of Ethics and why do techs have to care about them, about April fools day. Also about ACM integrity project, professionalism and asking questions to ethicist. in the last also we have talked about professional jobs. I t was hard to think what question to ask the ethicist and think of the professionalism. 
    </li><li>
      In the meeting 22, we watch the video "Why everyone in tech should care about codes of ethics" about the work is likely covered by one or more code of ethics. and there are two main professional organizations that cover the tech industry: ACM and IEEE.
    </li><li>
      I believe,&nbsp;the Code of ethics is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students, influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way. the video was really helpfully and I was wondering if you could explain the ask an&nbsp;ethicis blog and discuss the final exam.
    </li><li>
      in meeting 22, I really loved the discussion about the importance of the code of ethics and why tech personnel should care about the code of ethics. I believe the code of ethics if followed is one that will allow companies and their personnel to have the public interest at heart.
    </li><li>
      I find it interesting that these codes of ethics cannot be necessarily enforced against you if you are not a part of the organization. It does bring up a point of why be in the organization then. In the video he talks about how these codes and standards are seen to adhere to the profession as a whole even if you're not a member but there is a lot of grey area that seems to create some issues. There needs to be more blanketted regulations that professionals are forced by law to abide to.
    </li><li>
      I didn't enjoy the last meeting. It was not that engaging and especially breakout rooms were lame because we didn't have any specific topics. I didn't like the idea of going and choosing our own topic because obviously everyone would choose different topics and many are lazy to even open the link choose an article go through it and discuss. When we had a specific topic it was interesting and more engaging in breakout rooms.
    </li><li>
      Why are the codes of ethics is important in tech industry? I have asked my father a similar problem a few years ago, and he said:" When you being an&nbsp;employer, you have to provide values to your customers and your employee and for the society, and when you&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;the three goals, you already&nbsp;provide values for yourself. I think this is why we should care about the codes of ethics, when we working as an&nbsp;computer engineer or electrician, and we act with the public interest, we will get pay back when we are in the public situation.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned from last meeting is that, in the tech industry, lack of familiarity with the code of ethics can lead to financial and legal consequences. The hardest thing for me to understand is how these codes are policed. There was a fairly major discussion about the oracle vs google case and how much weight the code of ethics actually had in that battle.&nbsp; I would like to learn more about these rules and how they apply to me.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talk about what is the code of ethics, which is a very important part of the computer science field.&nbsp;This involves the stability and development of society.&nbsp;Computer science today is an emerging technology.&nbsp;There are many laws and regulations that are not sound. Biology is a counterexample. Biological laws and regulations are relatively complete, and relevant departments are responsible for supervising whether their experiments violate ethics.&nbsp;But computer science does not currently have such relevant regulations, so in the future, we need to pay more attention to the development of ethics. Ensure that there are no violations of...

      The video was created for the ACM's Committee on Professional Ethics' Integrity Task by Dr. Bo Brinkman .The Code is designed for both aspiring and practising machine learning experts, and it describes the profession's morals.&nbsp;Ethics is important for all sizes of businesses and professionals to take into account because the public in general, workers, and other decision makers now expect technology companies to have a lot of responsibility to the social interest.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      Why everyone should care about the code of ethics and how they apply to the tech industry? Suppose, in a business, if there is a lack of preciseness and ethnicity in the code, it could ruin the whole business on an economic platform. Developers often don't see this before and they realize it after everyone starts getting bugs, issues, errors, or various different problems with their platform. So, hence a software developer or a computing professional should always follow the ACM code of ethics or there is one more firm named IEEEE for this. General ethical principles are the best...
    </li><li>
      It was a very informative lecture. The most important learning part for me was  the ACM code of ethics.  "Why everyone in tech should care about codes of ethics" taught me my right towards the employers in professional organizations. It makes one stand out and be fearless at the workplace. It is very well describe in the YouTube video in he overview of the lecture.
    </li><li>
      In the pastmeeting we watched a video about “Why everyone in tech should care about codesof ethics”. The video was about importance of code of ethics for business. Itexplains how lack of knowledge about codes can create serious consequence for abusiness. Currently the ethics is really undervalued in tech business that’s whygaining knowledge is very important on that. ACM and IEEE codes of ethics can havea great impact on tech business as it can help the business to avoid breakingthe laws. After discussing about the ethics, we had a breakout room about somecase study. There were many case studies to...
    </li><li>
      In the pastmeetings, we watched the video about code of ethics that applies to techindustries “why everyone in tech should care about code of ethics” after that wehad a discussion about the video a bit then we had a breakout room in which wediscussed about the case studies from a &nbsp;ACM website. In my group we went through thetopics malware disruption and discussed about that topic. 
    </li><li>
      In the "Why everyone in tech should care about codes of ethics" video, I found it particularly interesting that the main concern throughout the entire video was money. In my opinion, that says something about the culture in the tech industry. Even in a conversation about something such as ethics and morals, most of the main conversation still revolves around money and avoiding lawsuits - not doing the right thing for the public.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      From the lecture video "Why everyone should care about ethics "&nbsp; .The speaker spoke about ACM and IEEEE , The video expanded my knowledge on why ethics is important as seen when google was sued by oracle because google copied some api
    </li><li>
      In our last engagement we talked a bit about professionalism, code of ethics, car-dillema and ACM ethics in breakout room. As we discussed that code of ethics is something more of a suggestion than a law. I will consider it as morality of a job. One can act immoral in many scenarios but lawfully they are innocent but one should never act like that. We also talked about how self driving car can have ethical dilema. We also talked about the worm that destroyed a site that spread malicious software and never took any stand before that. That is why...
    </li><li>
      According to the videos everyone care about ethics in digital world because it ensure about the newest tech and innovations. Ethics helps us with decision making. It sets rules for ideas that are profitable.
    </li><li>
      While we are required and good to follow the codes of ethic, i want to just how many people succeed with and without following them. If they don't, what do they do instead, or for people who are ethical in the computing world, does it contribute to their success or is it an obligation their filling or both ofcourse. Its very interesting to me to see different perspectives of successful people in this scenario.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      Reflecting on the video we watched about why we should care about a code of ethics: In general we, as computer professionals, should have either a company code of ethics or a personal code of ethics that we abide by. While this code may not be legally binding (and there certainly are arguments that could be made that companies should have a legal obligation to meet their ethics) it should be something that we are mindful of -- we do not want to be programming or problem solving in ways that are stray from our ethics; everything should be legal...
    </li><li>
      In regards to our last class talking about the ACM video, first&nbsp; off I did not know of the ACM's existence.Secondly I agree that everyone in the tech industry should care about their respective code of ethics, like the video said not following the code of ethics can get you into legal trouble which is not desirable. Although the ACM is a company from the States their video makes some good points that people should consider if they are in the tech industry regardless if they work in the States or not.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In the last class we watched a video about why we should care about the code of ethics. The most important thing I learned was that we should care about it because if we don’t there can be financial and legal consequences.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In the previous meeting we had a discussion on CIPS. We discussed about the role of certification in becoming a professional. Breakout rooms with 10 to 8 people was a nice idea.
    </li><li>
      In the video Why everyone in tech should care about ethics codes, I know that caring about work ethic can help us do the right thing. In fact, professional ethics is useful not only for individuals but also for groups. Many companies ignore the role of ethics at first, so they got the corresponding consequences. Such as the massive negative impact of Facebook's disclosure of personal privacy on the company; however, the online market needs now are their privacy, security, and data, and increasingly express their needs, rather than accepting the latest technology.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we discussed about our assignment due on empathy map. How to create an empathy map and what to write in it.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, I learnt about ACM (Association for Computing Machinery), which was founded in 1947 and is the largest and oldest international scientific and industrial computer society.The ACM code of ethics is a collection of principles and guidelines designed to help computing professionals make ethically responsible decisions in professional practice.My question here is that, is these code of ethics different from the code made by IEEE?I really want to understand the differences between ACM and IEEE
    </li><li>
      During the last class we discussed about professionalism. In the field of Information technology it is very important to work with integrity and honesty. Professionalism is something which helps IT professionals in their personal growth as well as personality &nbsp;development&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In class we discussed about the importance of ethics in computer professionals life and how they can be accountable for anything incorrect or unfair. We studied on an article on breakout room and discussed about it. I think an actual law is better than any ethics made by any community or organization.
    </li><li>
      I personally believe ethics play a huge role in field of computer science or especially building something which will be used by a large number of group and these is the same thing we discussed in the group and apart from these can you please provide some information about finals in next lecture example what should we expect,etc.
    </li><li>
      We had to discuss acase-study about the ACM code of ethics and Professional Practice inthe breakout room. We picked the 1st case study aboutSecurity vendors and government organizations using Denial of Serviceattacks to disrupt an ISP which was hosting malware. The generalconsensus was that the security vendors took the right steps tocounter it and that they dealt with it ethically. The ISP wasdefinitely in the wrong since they complied with the customers whowere spreading malware. They should, instead, have stopped it themoment they found out what was going on. The moment they decided notto do anything, that’s when the ISP...
    </li><li>
      As someone who has already walked away from a job of 15 years,I found the article “Have a Code (of ethics) before you Code” a bit triggering.Perhaps I am a bit jaded, but I do not believe ethics exists in business, howcan it if the ultimate goal is profits? There is a threshold of what each andevery user/solider can endure, eventually our tours of duty come to an end andthe code is meaningless. The biggest take away for me is the “F*ck-You” Fund,” definitelysomething everyone needs these days.
    </li><li>
      One important thing we learned in this meeting was that although code of ethic is not a law it is very important to follow it because it can be used for or against us if we were in a situation that we had to go to court for a dispute or legal action. During the break out room we had a very fun discussion about our case studies and hopefully we will have a few more of these case studies before the semester ends.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we talked about the case studies in which the ACM Code of Ethics were not followed.There are many cases in which Codes of Ethics were not followed and Malware Disruption, Medical Implant Risk Analysis, Autonomous Active Response Weapons etc&nbsp;are some of the disadvantages of this.There are many more areas where Codes of Ethics are not followed and which are resulting in many dangerous activities and also affects the users.Malware Disruption is one of the sectors in which the codes were not properly implemented and which caused a huge problem that affected many users and sectors.It was...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was the case studies on ACM's website. They do a great job of demonstrating how their code of ethics applies to the workplace. Examples of the ethics violation in industry situations were an effective method of explaining how their ethics code applies to the tech industry. I found Dark UX Patterns and Medical Implant Risk Analysis to be the most interesting. I want to learn more about how the code ethics is enforced and if there is a process to examine a website or a software before it is made...
    </li><li>
      It seems that a lot of software these days have "rogue-like" behavior despite not being malware itself: Such as the anti-cheat software known as "vanguard" by RIOT games within one of their flagship tactical shooters: Valorant. This software once installed on a machine takes control of the operating system at a kernel level - which is the highest level access one can have on a windows operating system. Why a software to prevent cheating needs this kind of access has sparked controversy amongst people, yet it does not seem to be a harmful software as of late.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we discussed about why people in tech should care about the code of ethics and mostly concerning the legal aspects to it. For example how it could be used in a court case. One thing that stood out to me was whether the code of ethics being used in court case really meant it was considered a standard. Personally I feel that if there are laws that make the code of ethics standard or implemented in the law then it can be better used in a court case having to do with violations of the code...
    </li><li>
      According to last meeting, what I have found to be important from those case studies is the one that involved medicine. Case study was called the medical implant risk analysis. It was most important because technology dealt very closely with humans. Which mean that the technology must be robust and correct. Following the code of ethics would be very crucial being in the medical field. In this particular case study, it has been mentioned that an area of concern that involved using hard-coded values in the implant.&nbsp; Though there isn't much evidence towards risk in this design, I still think...
    </li><li>
      In the class, we talked about case studies where people have broken the code of ethics and have felt bad about it. Just like one of them was Bill. He made a website that gave information about the disease but the bug was any option the user selects it would give the same drug which was advertised by the pharmaceutical company and the bug was there on purpose. The programmer felt the pain when a girl who took the drug committed sucide as a side effect. The programmer felt very bad and couldn’t enjoy the success of the website as...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we watch a video about importance of code of ethics in tech industry and we discussed about the case between oracle and google about the APIS that google copied from oracle. In the breakout room we discussed about on a case about a company named&nbsp;Corazón and the heart rate monitoring device they made and which trasmitted data to phone using an app, but later found out that a device in close proximity can also hinder the data.
    </li><li>
      At the last meeting, We’ve discussed ACM ethics. In the video “Why everyone in tech should care about codes of ethics?”, Dr. Bo Brinkman has an excellent speech for the reason why tech industry ethics are so important to us when we enter the tach industry as a worker or manager. knowing tech ethics can help us avoid lots of ethical problems. There are two organizations: ACM(Association of Computing Machinery) and IEEE(Institution of Electrical and Electronics Engineering) made the code of conduct for people who worked in the technology industry, And there are many examples of ethical problems on google....
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we talked about code of ethics. Particularly, Dr Brinkman says via his video code of ethics is really crucial at one's workplace. Every one or two work of an individual is covered by code of ethics and non-compliance would make them face severe repercussions. Association of computer machinery are the one that make the policies for the code of conduct and many others. It&nbsp;is really important for a programmer to know how code of ethics works and applies. Therefore, programmers are supposed to make a platform keeping code of ethics in mind.
    </li><li>
      We learned in class today that how code of ethics can affect people in a bad way and programmers don’t even know it until someone is affected so being careful while making a program is very important.
    </li><li>
      We started with a video of “ why everyone in tech should care about code of ethics”, we got to know about oracle vs google and their fundamental law of ethics. After that we discussed about case studies in breakout room. Malware disruption, in which government and organisation came together to disrupt the operation of an ISP that host a malware. By the end of class we discussed case studies with professor.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In last class we have discussed about role of professionalism in IT industry.In Information Technology, working with integrity and honesty is very important.Professionalism help IT professionals in their personal growth as well as personality development.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the importance of ACM code of ethic and IEEE was made clear to the students. People working in the field of technology must know the set of rules. They must follow all the rules so that no charges of voilations can be put against them. This ethics states that the code must be in public interest and copying of codes is prohibited.
    </li><li>
      First thing that we discussed in the last meeting was the video that why everyone should care about the code of ethics in technological field. Oracle vs. google And their fundamental law of ethics was interesting topic to discuss. &nbsp;At the end there was a discussion about case study which we discussed in breakout sessions and with professor also.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      The ACM and IEEE code of ethics which governs the computing industry was introduced in the last lecture. When an individual starts working as an computing professional, they must know the code of ethics to avoid any kind of loss for the company or for themselves. They must try to work according to the ethics which means working for public interest. This ensure the benefit of society and the individual or the company.

      In "The ethical dilemma of self-driving cars"&nbsp;he gives an example of a truck going on a highway infront ofyou and the left lane has bike with helmet and right lane has a bike andsomething heavy falls from the truck in front of you. Would you hit the bikewith the helmet on the left or the bike on the right? The safest option seemsto be the bike with the helmet. He argues that why does the person in thehelmet get punished for following the safety protocols. It argues that noteverything should be predetermined just like our lives have become some thingsshould...
    </li><li>
      in the breakout room we discussed malware disruption ; how the&nbsp;worm was designed access Rogue’s systems in an unethical way, destroying data in the process just to target malicious software, taught to work for public good regardless creating a software , worm ,virus unless it benefits public.further we came across the story of web developer, how is website (drug marketing)ended some ones life. it wasnt his fault he was just doing his job showcasing his skills . it was drug that showed sideeffects but in a way that was a wrong decision to take that job and promote the drug....
    </li><li>
      in the last class we discussed professionalism well in this field of information technology there is very urgent to work with honesty. and also we discussed the fundamental law of ethics and after that, we discussed the case studies in the BR ooms and also discussed this case study with prof as well.
    </li><li>
      After watching the video,&nbsp;I am impressed that working in the tech industry is involved with ethics. In my past cognitive, programming was limited to developing software, maintaining applications, and studying algorithms. However, the first principle in terms of the code of ethics is to act consistently with the public interest as a software engineer. The principles mentioned in the video make me realize that computer science is a discipline based on morality and ethics. Moreover, any program or software needs to be ethical first and foremost.
    </li><li>
      We watched a video about work ethics and how it plays very important role in IT sector.We discussed few case studies with professor. Moreover, malware disruption was also discussed in which we came to know how govt and organisation dirupted an ISP hosting a malware
    </li><li>
      In this class, ourdiscussion is mainly about the professional ethics of computers. We watched thekeynote speech "Why everyone in tech should care about codes ofethics", and everyone discussed about this matter. Then we discussed aboutthe topic of CIPS. Many students compared the moral responsibility of code withthe problems in real life, which made me think more dialectically andaccurately about why we need the constraints of moral code. Social responsibilityis maintained by every programmer.Name: Yiming Zhang&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StuID: 200404814
    </li><li>
      We&nbsp;discussed&nbsp;the&nbsp;Code&nbsp;of&nbsp;Ethics&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;previous&nbsp;lecture,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Brinkman&nbsp;said in his video that&nbsp;knowing&nbsp;how&nbsp;a&nbsp;code&nbsp;of&nbsp;ethics&nbsp;functions&nbsp;and&nbsp;applies&nbsp;is&nbsp;critical&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;programmer.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a&nbsp;consequence,&nbsp;programmers&nbsp;must&nbsp;build&nbsp;a&nbsp;structure&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;connected&nbsp;to&nbsp;an&nbsp;ethical&nbsp;code.&nbsp;We&nbsp;have&nbsp;firsthand&nbsp;experience&nbsp;of&nbsp;innovative&nbsp;goods&nbsp;and&nbsp;services&nbsp;that&nbsp;place&nbsp;them&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;market&nbsp;position;&nbsp;we&nbsp;must&nbsp;keep&nbsp;track&nbsp;of&nbsp;these&nbsp;market&nbsp;positions in the world of IT.
    </li><li>
      How can we make regulations that enforce ethical programming practice? This was the main concern of our group’s discussion today. We observed that ethical guidelines will not often be fulfilled unless they are legally binding. Even in the case that such regulations are legally binding, how can we prove, or even define, ill-intention? Such is the case with the “Dark UX Patterns” case study, where the clients had a clear intention to confuse the user into choosing more expensive purchases. In such cases, is it possible to prove ill intentions even if our code of ethics is legally binding?
    </li><li>
      I think that codes of ethics should be made with the intention of being stricter rules as right now many just see them as weak guidelines which are not actually followed. Ethics need to be taken into consideration at all times in the modern age of technology as many technologies can be used for very negative purposes, and there needs to be more of a focus on thinking about long-term negative effects and how to mitigate them.
    </li><li>
      Last class we have talked about the ethics in computer science as well as technology. Ethic is a necessary need for every fields in the world, including technology and computer. In my opinion,&nbsp;I&nbsp; don't think we need to be particularly familiar with tech to know about fair use and the ethics of behind some of those "rules". For instance, Facebook is making a mistake in "ethic" because it sales users' personal information to others party.&nbsp;Does this mean Facebook is violating the very first CIPS code of ethics and standard of conduct? Yes, I think Facebook does that.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      in the last zoom meeting, we discussed about the importance of ACM code of ethic and IEEE. Especially they made it clear to all the students about the rules and how it works in the field of&nbsp; technology. Also, if they not follow the rules they will get the violations charges on them.
    </li><li>
      After reading case studies we can say that&nbsp;there are lots of cases where code of ethics&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;followed, such as Malware disruption, Medical risk implant&nbsp;analysis and&nbsp;etc..&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      Our last class started with a video discussing the code of ethics in tech companies and why everyone, including the consumers/users, should care about it. The video also discussed what happened between oracle and google and how oracle used fundamental rules/laws of ethics to sue google for supposedly stealing their codes. After this, we discussed we were assigned to different breakout rooms, where we were to pick one of the provided case studies by professor and discuss it. We decided to read&nbsp; and discuss first case study, "Malware Disruption". How and why these online companies use spam and fraudulent services...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, the aim was that the law was aimed at the aspiration and practice of computing professionals and expresses the conscience of the profession. Ethics is important to all businesses and practitioners by size - the general public, employees, and other stakeholders now expect technology companies to assume greater responsibility for the public good. People developing AI technologies, in particular, have a greater responsibility, as uncertainty about machine learning methods and applications can lead to public distrust of these technologies, especially when they are integrated into the infrastructure. Applying a blog to your daily work doesn't just mean...
