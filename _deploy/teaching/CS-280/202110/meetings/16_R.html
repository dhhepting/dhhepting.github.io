      I asked a question during the meeting: what does someone with agency on the internet look like?Many people viewed them as a specialist - either someone knowledgeable in virtual machines, cookie blocking, security, or a lawyer who can read and understand the TOS. If this is true, then that means that most people on the internet today do not actually have agency.Some people felt that it depended on the definition of agency - and that's true, the OED has like 15 definitions for "agency," which makes it difficult to figure out what that means, and it is difficult to determine...

      Privacy and WhatsAppThe TED Talk on Digital Communication and Privacy, published in June of 2020, sees interviewer Chris Anderson debate with Will Cathcart, Head of WhatsApp at Facebook. Will gives an insightful view on how the end-to-end encryption allows users to communicate matters of importance, especially during times of Covid where members are unable to meet online. End to End encryption is a form of cryptography where the sender scrambles their message using some sort of hashing algorithm (for example SHA-256) and only the receiver knows of the private key to decrypt the data. This encryption applied by Facebook is...

      I would like to understand U of R's reasoning for using proctor track better. With a lot of other universities opting not to have this and to do open book exams instead why did U of R decide to use this program that invades privacy more than necessary. With its clear faults is it worth invading students privacy, even after the servers were hacked? Could these resources that the university spent be better spend somewhere else?
    </li><li>
      I think privacy is very important. It's our private stuff. In today's online environment, because our devices record and store a lot of information, like credit cards, or home addresses. It is very important to protect our privacy because the Internet is full of traps and our privacy will be exposed by the slightest mistake. It's not hard to steal information from our devices, and sometimes a piece of software we download can do it. So I think when using the Internet, we should pay attention to download links, otherwise, our privacy will be threatened.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing, in my opinion, I learned from the past meeting was from the discussion we had regarding online privacy. During discussion, I researched a couple different ways to protect my privacy online. From this information, I think the easiest way to protect yourself online is through software. For example, VPN's can make you less traceable online. There's software out there that will read Terms of Service for you. If you're really into tech, you could try something like onion routing. The only problem is that software can often cost money, so the trade-off is money for privacy....
    </li><li>
      In our 16th meeting we discussed what are online terms of service (TOS). The TOS are used in every online service with very few exceptions, It is a contract between a user and the online business. Since time is considered as money most TOS are made to be as expansive and as unreadable as possible. With time and attention restraints the TOS can force users to immediately use the service and to just accept any privacy concerns that can arise.
    </li><li>
      With our talk about privacy and our personal agency to maintain our privacy, I would like to learn more about the tools we can use to maintain our privacy, such that I will have more agency in the future. I know about the popular tools like VPNs and some more obscure tools like websites that review private policy/TOS for us (such as TOSDR.org) but is that really all we have at our disposal? It appears that the demand for privacy is ever-increasing and thus I would find it probable that there are many tools I have not heard of.
    </li><li>
      Protortrack or get Covid-19? I honestly don’t believe even the data is stored in Canada is even safe. This could mean anything as there could be some Canadian privacy laws that are not updated with the current world. I would say corporation have team of lawyers that can help with them bending around the law.Second, we can talk about privacy for the entire course of the semester. As there are always some kinds of news about privacy breach or laws. I think privacy laws need to be revamped or update every 3 years or so.
    </li><li>
      The way in which privacy matters to a person and affects their life could be understood. The pandemic has led a great number of people to shift their work to online method and this is the reason that the privacy of the user should be protected at any cost. Even if the person say that privacy does not matter, there are times when an individual has some sensitive information that should be protected. So, privacy matters.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we had an early discussion about what privacy rights online and why the organizations need to consider the privacy issues which can arise with the use of their applications.
    </li><li>
      I found the quote "people that say privacy isn't really important – they don't actually believe it" from the 'Why Privacy Matters" TED Talk a significant point to highlight because, at least in my own opinion, I find this an entirely accurate statement. Take VPN's for instance, why are they so popular right now? Is it because their users have something to hide? Or is it protect identities, protect sensitive data? Or because privacy matters...
    </li><li>
      In the video Why privacy matters, I heard that only people doing something wrong have things to hide; I think that is very naive. When your privacy is monitored, whether you are a good person or a bad person may be between others' thoughts. Moreover, Privacy has been increasingly capitalized, and many companies can use your privacy to make money. on the one hand，Our personal information and privacy often are obtained, used, and even exchanged and profited without our knowledge or authorization now. On the other hand, we do not get any benefits or even have to pay the price....
    </li><li>
      Can you please discuss the content of the final exam. I feel like privacy is important because, it gives us the power to choose our thoughts and feelings and who we share them with. Privacy protects our information we do not want shared publicly (such as health or personal finances).
    </li><li>
      In the digital world, the concept "social life" is changing rapidly. To emerge social media, users should publish articles which are generally supported, and those materials should be communicated in public areas. Location-tracking, surveillance systems, facial-recognition innovations, and technologies for recording messages and calls have all advanced in sophistication. Will Cathcart, on the other hand, believes that "to our enhanced reliance on online communication methods during the COVID-19 pandemic, our basic right to privacy is much more essential than ever."
    </li><li>
      In meeting 16, we discussed about the privacy. After discuss, I got few conclusion about it. First, privacy is important for everyone because it is a human being things. second, we can not totally get rid of the environment that being monitor, it already become a normality in the internet. Third, people want to have privacy not meaning they done bad things that don't want others know, Sometime the embarrass things they done also don't want others know.
    </li><li>
      We learned many things in this meeting, the video ‘why privacy matters?’. In this video, I learned many things like mass surveillance is an important thing that people are unaware of. ‘If you are doing something that other people does not know those things should not be done’ an interesting comment by Eric Schmidt. The privacy is something that people does not wants others to know the activity and there are few people those deliver themselves to be transparent, but their social activities negate that. So, privacy does matters from everyone’s perspective.
    </li><li>
      We discussed why privacy matters. What are the issues one can face due to lack of privacy in a medium. Also wanted to know more about what are the ways programmers and developers are using now a days to improve for better results.
    </li><li>
      Ted talk "Why does privacy matter?" was one of the best talks I've ever encountered. I like it, maybe, because of the subject that was really fascinating and attractive. I believe that although we don't do anything wrong, we have things to hide from others. Everyone wants to keep their private life a secret, but when it comes to famous celebrities, people want to know everything about them, including every single aspect about their personal life that I think is unfair. In my opinion even they want some privacy, so we should respect it and should not interfere in their...
    </li><li>
      in response to the question in our previous meeting: how to exercise some agency about your online privacy?I think the only way to exercise some agency about online privacy is by using VPN or by also reading the terms and conditions before joining a social network platform. Online there companies that would usually state what data would be collected, so I think taking the time to read about it before signing up can be a way to excercise some agency online. Otherwise, I think the best advise for those who really worry about their whole privacy online is for them...
    </li><li>
      Rights online is an interesting subject matter to discuss, as with what we discussed in class, many of the rights we have online are claim, not liberty. Realistically, we don’t have any control over our data online unless we choose to simply not use the services that we know are abusing our privacy, but even then, take Facebook for example, can still have a online profile on you from using websites that have integrated like/share buttons, analytics, or advertising from them. It isn’t a liberty right, generally speaking we aren’t giving them direct access to our information, it just comes...
    </li><li>
      ResponseIn the last meeting, we watched a TED speech named why privacy matter by Glenn Greenwald. To be honest, i think his opinion is right and i want to talk about my understanding of privacy. First, i want to say those people who say that privacy isn't really important and don’t believe it are double standard. Cause when they are saying these words, they are taking all kinds of steps to safeguard their privacy like put passwords on their email and their social media accounts or  locks on their bedroom and bathroom doors. In my opinion, People’s awareness of privacy...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I leaned from last meeting was that not many people actually read the policies and agreements for the services they are using. The concept from the last meeting that was the hardest for me to understand was how much the user can do to be private. Whether its just being careful of what they put out on the internet to using a virtual machine and a VPN, there is so much variance in the levels of privacy. I would like to learn more about how private I need to be online, and how much companies are...
    </li><li>
      Last Thursday, we saw two TED talk videos. One was "The future of digital communication and privacy" by Will Cathcart(head of Whatsapp)which was regarding how social media chatting platforms like Whatsapp messenger has the feature of end-to-end encryption and they say billions of text messages on the daily are protected from government firms, some institutions and the company of Whatsapp themselves. The other video "Why privacy matters" presented by Glenn Greenwald at TEDGlobal 2014 brings a whole different point of how and why do people need to know and take proper care about their privacy even though there's nothing you...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we discussed about the threat to our privacy from the social sites like Facebook. How these applications are using our personal information for their own profit even without us knowing about it.
    </li><li>
      The Internet is developing very fast now. Personal privacy will be leaked out inadvertently. Privacy is one of the serious problems at present. Every year, there are countless property losses caused by privacy leaks. Therefore, you must protect your personal privacy when surfing the Internet, and do not disclose it at will.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we talked about privacy and its importance in our life, especially about the digital world and the privacy concern. In the breakout room we had a short discussion about it too. We also talked about how violation of said right can be violated and are we willing to allow limited violation in return of free stuff. We also talked about using proctortrack and how some students felt unsafe about it.In the ted talk Glenn Greenwald discussed why privacy is important and mass surveilence is problematic for individual freedom and liberty. When we surrender our privacy its...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 16 we discussed about online privacy policies of the online websites in terms of terms and conditions. We discussed how can we have an agency for our privacy online. We were divided into groups to discuss further on the given topic. The terms and conditions posted by the websites are hardly read by anyone. People generally skip reading and go straight for agreeing to all the teams and conditions written on those online contracts. There are obvious reasons for skipping those long agreements, the most common one being that they are really time-consuming and boring. Most of the...
    </li><li>
      Thinking about the Ted Talk that was linked about privacy, when it comes to the internet there really is no such thing as "privacy" -- you may have anonymity, but you are still vulnerable to hackers, large technology companies (like Google and Facebook) and the government. One of the things the talk mentions near the beginning is touching on the idea of 'if you’ve got nothing to hide, you’ve got nothing to fear'. This reminded me of the blog I wrote earlier this term, Amnesty International did a good article on why this line of thinking is fundamentally flawed: https://www.amnesty.ca/blog/7-reasons-why-%E2%80%98i%E2%80%99ve-got-nothing-to-hide%E2%80%99-is-the-wrong-response-to-mass-surveillance
    </li><li>
      I think privacy is power and power is something that needs to be contained. In the video 'why privacy matters', Glenn brought the point where he said that people who say privacy doesn't matter still put password on their social media, emails, etc. and keep it private. It shows that actually they do care about their privacy they are just not aware of how deep far it goes.
    </li><li>
      Privacy is something that we should hold close to ourselves, especially in this digital age that we live in. Companies like Facebook and Google have access to so much of our personal information, it is kind of scary when you think about how much these companies actually know about us. I also think these companies are hypocrites since they want to know anything and everything about our personal lives but when the public wants to know about them they don't like it because it is an invasion of their privacy.

      The video that the professor shared on his website about “The future of digital communication and privacy”. The use of WhatsApp has increased drastically due to covid and it is because people believe in Whatsapp. The end-to-end encryption that WhatsApp uses to secure the conversations is that they scramble the message once it is sent and then only the person on the other side can see it. Not even WhatsApp can see it. This was the biggest reason people trust WhatsApp and it should be this way. There are so many benefits to have the technology. Governments can talk to...

      The most important thing in the meeting is about the privacy matters and future of digital communicationthe topic related to previous class is about privacy concernsthe difficult part was to understand how future digital communications have privacy concernsi want to learn more about this privacy concerns
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about the privacy policy of the companies. We talked about how to make the privacy policy easily accessible i.e, to make it more readable to the common public. The more people who are aware of all the platforms they are using, they would have less chance of getting scammed by the big tech companies. We also proposed some ideas of how companies can try to make their privacy policy more readable to the common public but it is also the duty of the people who use the app is to try to understand what...

      On meeting 16, we’ve talked about privacy, And we have read the two source site which has deeply study of public communication and privacy, The two websites with Ted talk :The future of digital communication and privacy, Why privacy matters gives us the how the privacy influence public, individual and our culture. On The future of digital communication and privacy, there is a conversation of a reporter with head of WhatsApp talk about how to design the model for the software to protect privacy for users and One the why privacy matters which Greenwald makes the case for why you...

      In the last class, we talked about how encryption one of the best inventions in computer science has helped so much in the current covid times. Due to lockdown, people were forced to stay at home and have conversations virtually but due to end-to-end encryption provided by companies like WhatsApp people can trust that their information stays private. Even governments and doctors have used WhatsApp in order to send out the word about prevention and the information that government sends needs to be secret. It’s good to see technology for the greater good of humanity, It proves that we can...

      I find the issues of privacy to always to be an interesting debate. I have noticed there is a growing concern, or at least an acknowledgement of privacy issues by most people I encounter, but in the end we are powerless. Surveillance is ingrained into our daily lives. From the voluntary participation in social media platforms such as Facebook, to the compulsory use of Proctortrack in Universities, there is no escape.
    </li><li>
      When discussing online activity, an important question arises: do we, as users, truly have agency over our online privacy? Although we have the ability to grant or deny applications access to our personal information, I do not believe that this ability involves full liberty. While it is our choice to accept conditions or policies, this process does not always seem transparent. Few users, including myself, take the time to read such lengthy documents, simply pressing accept instead. Applications often require users to accept location sharing and grant apps access to our devices in order for the applications to function properly....
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we discussed regarding how we can exercise some agency about our online privacy. That means how how an individual can protect their privacy online. Nowadays our privacy online is very fragile, for instance we all know our mobile phone keep track of our conversations and search history or almost all of our activities and finds out the information that they send online. That's how we get those daily advertisements of the products on certain websites and social media that we have never mentioned on that platform. Sounds scary but it's true. Moreover whenever we agree to the...

      In the last meeting we talk about the privacy and the ways in which we can protect ourself to get our data protected. In the break out room we discussed about that their are much better plaforms where our data gets protected instead of this big social networking sites such as facebook.
    </li><li>
      From the videos about privacy I saw how important privacy is as people usually do not do things as they usually do when their monitored as well as how WhatsApp tries to put in effort in order to safeguard the users privacy by encrypting the messages being sent and I believe other platforms should imitate their efforts  In protecting the privacy of users 
    </li><li>
      In this class we talk about privacy in digital world. The companies guarantee the privacy of the people information from being miss used but who knows what might happen because in digital society anything can happen. People are always worried about thier privacy and raising flag against some companies.
    </li><li>
      The discussion about maintaining privacy through WhatsApp's encrypted messaging service is intriguing. It seems as though we have reached a point where we can't have both privacy and crime-prevention on the same platform. I enjoyed Will Cathcart's comment saying that we _could _cameras in the living room of every household to catch criminals, but all of the law-abiding citizens would suddenly lose so much privacy for nothing. 
    </li><li>
      From the video " Why privacy matters " I learnt about the importance of privacy and how privacy is important in the society we live in now.
    </li><li>
      After watching the video “The future of digital communication and privacy” by Will Cathcart, I learned how WhatsApp encrypting the messages that the health care and government are using this app for sharing data during COVID. I think having privacy in apps where we can share data without worrying about it being lost is important.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the importance of privacy on the social media platform can be understood. It is the most important thing that the privacy of the user should be protected so that it does not go in the wrong hand which can lead to misuse of that information. The amount people joining the social media and interacting with each other has grown during this pandemic, so it becomes a critical thing to be looked after.
    </li><li>
      When it comes to ethics surrounding the collection of data particularly on social media platforms, these big companies are taking advantage of misinformed consumers. While the legality of it all is valid (they disclose everything they are collected/doing with your data) in the fine print agreement, they take advantage of the fact that consumers don't take the time to read and analyze this contract. So from a legal standpoint it is technically fine, but from a morality perspective they are taking advantage of their consumers.
    </li><li>
      “Why privacy matter” by Glenn Greenwald talk about the privacy and how there is someone who are always watching us. Even though, if we want to do something in private but it is hard to say that the work is actually getting done in private because there is always someone watching. He also said that long-time google CEO Eric Schmidt said “If you're doing something that you don't want other people to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.” I think this is not correct if I want to keep my data private I should have...

      In the past class meeting, we discussed about the importance of privacy on the social media platform can be understood. Well we know that It is the most important thing that the privacy of the user should be protected so that it does not go in the wrong hand which can lead to misuse of that information which is not good at all so The amount people joining the social media and interacting with each other has grown during this pandemic, so then it becomes a critical thing to be looked after. We discussed in BRooms also about this discussion...

      In this lecture most important thing that I have learnt is about privacy in online space.I learnt how can we protect our privacy online through various softwares.I also learnt about terms of services,I learnt the important of TOS as a contract between user and company.I learnt about TOSDR.org a site who review the policies of different information technology companies.Overall in this lecture I learnt about privacy,it’s importance and ways to protect it in online space.
    </li><li>
      Its cool to know that there are technologies like end-end that provide privacy to us. I recently learned about this in another class. The positives are certainly massive of this technology and obviously, this is used to conduct business that can be good or bad but id like to think or hope that the good is better than the bad or evil that happens.
    </li><li>
      I myself have thought, "I have nothing to hide, I don't care if the government knows what I'm doing", but after watching this Ted Talk, it is so true, privacy is very important and I wouldn't want people to parooz my emails and social media accounts. It's easy to say, when you don't believe that anything of yours will ever become public but in actuality if my information was published it would be a traumatic experience. Privacy is so critical, it allows us to have a part of us all to ourselves, I think this is a necessity.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discuss about the business strategy and how online agency companies represent their business online.we also discuss that are we doing something wrong by agreeing to the term and service privacy policy of every website. sometimes because of it they can see some of our personal information also. May be This topic take a long discussion in class also.
    </li><li>
      I learned in the meeting that what do companies to make privacy?Companies have IT experts, and they guide them in many ways.
    </li><li>
      Although the world is becoming more public with the advancement in technology and social media, privacy is one of the most important rights that we should protect. In a democratic society, I believe there should be no surveillance of its citizens. It is mistaken to think that privacy doesn't matter unless you have something to hide. It is one of the government's responsibilities to prevent crimes without the full surveillance of every citizen.
    </li><li>
      It's alarming to see how we are forced to do more things online but unfortunately the thing that the head of the WhatsApp talks about it and focused most on is how their app is encrypted end to end but the thing they didn't talk about is how they collect users data even when its unnecessary. For example Signal the same app for text messaging does not collect any data on it's users but on the other hand WhatsApp collects over 50+ different types of data on it's users which tells you all the talks they put about privacy and...
    </li><li>
      I learned from the video that end to end encryption lets you send a message directly to the receiver and no one else can see that message, not even WhatsApp. It is also very helpful for doing business online where you can do it privately without any doubt.Due to COVID-19 we are force to do everything online so will it remain same after COVID-19 or it will change is a question which will have an answer after the pandemic ends completely.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we talked about the privacy policies of the companies. We talked about how to create a privacy policy so that it is easily available to the common public. The more people are aware of the privacy policies the less is the chance of them being scammed by the so-called big tech companies.. We also proposed some idea of how the companies can try to make their privacy policy more readable to the common public but also the duty of the people who use the technology to understand what does the company has to offer and what...

      Meeting 16:In this meeting, we discussed the different aspects of privacy and various avenues that we have available or lack thereof to protect our privacy online. There were mixed opinions as some people thought that we have to give up our online privacy in exchange of free and better(optimized) services while others thought that we need better and stringent regulation from government to protect our privacy.Meeting 15 response (I was unable to do it in previous forum):In this meeting, we discussed our rights and responsibilities on the Internet. I feel that any rights that we have offline should automatically extend...
    </li><li>
      In class we talked about the basis of privacy and how to keep privacy well still using the internet. A question that I have that stems from this topic is how can you keep privacy if we’re loving more and more technologically because we’re beginning to store almost our entire lives online. Some company has to have that information so there isn’t true privacy.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing in the meeting what I learned was about the privacy matters and how it is interrelated with each and every individual and future of digital communication using AI.the topic related to previous class is about privacy concerns.The difficult part for me to understand was how future digital communications have privacy concerns.
    </li><li>
      I think it is important to understand the different types of "rights" one has in a certain place. On the internet it becomes obscure what ones rights and responsibilities are but in my opinion we should try to accommodate the rights which we can at least prehensile, such as freedom of speech and right to express an opinion.
    </li><li>
      In the zoom meeting we discussed about privacy rights and also about the need consideration of privacy issues in organizations which can increase their usage of applications or number of users. according to my perspective privacy is very important in every field.
    </li><li>
      In the recent lecture, we talked about privacy on internet platforms. The Ted speaker has coded the scenario very correctly as he implies the shift from freedom to mass surveillance from the company services we use such as Facebook, google and many others. We also have had a breakout session regarding the topic and interesting points were raised to tackle the privacy such as legal obligation from the government, conventional way to making a platform in the context of ethics, and many others.
    </li><li>
      “The future of digital communication and privacy” by Will Cathcart taught me a lot about WhatsApp and the technology it uses. I already knew that WhatsApp uses end to end encryption but I was unaware of the business model and the scale of the application.“Why privacy matters” by Glen Greenwald is a brilliant video. Very powerful speech. His arguments are very strong. I will definitely be recommending this video to people who think that if someone is being secretive that they are hiding something. I would love to see more video from Glen Greenwald.
    </li><li>
      I think that privacy is very important in the age of technology because companies and governments have the ability to get so much information about a person; keeping that information private is vital. Surveillance can be used for important reasons such as stopping criminals and terrorists, but more often it is used to invade the privacy of normal people who are doing nothing wrong, which I think is a problem. I think the freedom and privacy of the majority of people should be valued more highly than fear of a small group of wrongdoers.
    </li><li>
      Nowadays, with the development of Internet, online privacy becomes a common concern of many users. Recently, it appears many businesses operating and working by collecting online users' data, personal information and selling them. It is definitely harmful to our privacy on the Internet because we do not know whose are bought our information, as well as what would they do with our information. However, that is basically how many businesses make money in this modern world. Everyone makes money by somehow doing something ethically wrong to other person. In general, when everything we do is highly dependent on the use...
    </li><li>
      In this lecture discussing about the privacy why it is important? So if for example the transaction detail of your account is leaked and the confidential detail is shared every where it will have a great concern regarding it. So the privacy play an important role in persons advantages and disadvantages. Talking about future communication so it really has a great preferences regarding the future digital communication. In todays world we see a great change in our communication which is going fully digital. The future communication will be still more that will have a great preferences. Privacy is a thing...
    </li><li>
      From meeting 16, I understand why privacy matters. I believe that having privacy as human beings helps us to understand a sense of who we are and gives us the freedom to live without fear of our information being compromised. After watching the TED talk video on why privacy matters, I understand how privacy helps us define our self-relationship.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I leaned from last meeting was that not many people actually read the policies and agreements for the services they are using.
    </li><li>
      In this we mainly discussed about the privacy polices of the websites and how these privacy works. Every website has different policies which requires to be accepted by the user. But all these policies are protected for the user safety. However these policies are too long to be read and sometimes user misses the important information and accept the policy. Which sometimes may lead to trouble, but these issues can be sorted by shorting the lengths of the policy and only mentioning the importance information.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about how privacy matters in all social media apps that we use day to day.
    </li><li>
      In class we discussed about the proctor tracking and how it can breach our privacy. This will be helpful for next assignment of empathy map.
    </li><li>
      We talked about the privacy issues regarding the procter track software and it is really nice of the professor he understood the major concern.We debated on the topic how the information stays in Canada only and do not go anywhere else when we enter in Proctertrack software but still it goes through our network layers without seeking permission from us
