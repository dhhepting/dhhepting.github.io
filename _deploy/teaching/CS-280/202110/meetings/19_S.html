<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. So i'm happy to see the snow stop coming down. And it's a little bit discouraged with seeing the white stuff this morning. blog entry do. A couple of seminars coming up tomorrow. If you're interested in that. already moved the other assignment. Okay. So. Then a little hectic you're interviewing for. Parents to term instructor positions. And we have the guests. From. The JET propulsion lab at caltech. Very massey's computer science alumnus tomorrow. And we have a guest from kips. The Canadian information processing society. this coming Thursday. So, can you see me typing in the question here or not I can't remember. If i'm showing zoom windows to you or not.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;yeah, we can see.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So you can see a different background today. Is. The main floor here because. My wife has an appointment that later on, so. I have. So, having Elgar coronas CRATE i'm gonna supervise him from. This location. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;i've given three choices so gonna stick with zoom use webex I am familiar with it. were useful access try something new. So. If you're familiar with webex and you want to use webex and tech the. second option. Is your like to try using webex and the third option. Okay. I have to find the button to save it. Here we go. give it a few more seconds. Now. Okay, so. I wanted to stick with zoom. In here is my here and I echo that sentiment. To the yes and. Because. I thought. This software to download for webex. And I thought that having to download software is going to be more of an issue. than. Just using zoom. So I think will will be here in our regular space, and if you have. friends who are free, at this time they'd like to hear about kips the Canadian information processing society. and The pathway to certification as a it professional information services professional in Canada. Then that. Part of the presentation is open to the public and i'll put in a note out. your son on Facebook. i'm not sure exactly send an email but. If you have people who are interested if you know anybody who's interested in. becoming a certified. Information Services professional. Please let them know to come to the class. On Thursday. Okay. So one thing I noticed installing the webex. Three dialog boxes, I can get rid of. verifying Cisco webex meetings. And then, when I try and test. This out software just I get a warning that says the meeting hasn't started yet. So I don't know what it's like with zoom. I have a feeling that they're a little better with that. That you could actually see that you're making a connection. Testing a connection. So I was thinking about the empathy map. And empathizing with people. Maybe. So could be further developed with Cisco webex platform. anyway. Okay, so the other thing. Coming up tomorrow is the robotic Mars exploration. clock at 7pm. that's open to the public, so if you want to share that information, please go ahead. yeah just looking at the chat here. Not a question over switching. It was just a question of our going to if we're going to have this. keeps meeting done in webex or zoom. And I suggested that we might have some substantial attrition if we have. People to download and. get their. Could a new APP working. For the meeting starts it's just. going to limit our potential audience. So there are a couple of things that came up last day. and So one is about. new philosophy. canoes recursive acronym for canoes not unix. Hello. yeah. we'll see if we can just. need everybody to be on the safe side. You can you can unmute yourself that's fine. Okay, so let me read it. out loud here. So free software mean software that respect to users freedoms and Community roughly means that users have the freedom to run copy and distribute heard me run copy distribute study change and improve the software. that's free software is, and that is liberty not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free, as in free speech, not as in free beer. sometimes called libra software or in the from the French or Spanish word for free, as in freedom. To show we do not mean software is gratis. You can paint for these students, because everyone deserves them. With the scene with these freedoms users, both individually and collectively control the program and what it does to them. When users don't control the program we call it a non treat or proprietary Program. And non free program controls the users and the developer controls the Program. This makes the program and instrument of unjust power. To the forest central freedoms. So program is free software, yet the program's users of the forest central freedoms. And these are labeled freedom zero to three. So the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose that's freedom zero. Freedom to study how the program works and to change it, so does your computing as you wish. Freedom one. So access to the source code is is. Is a. is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute copies, so you can help others freedom to. The freedom to distribute copies of the modified versions to others to freedom, three by doing this, you can give the whole Community, a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this. So those are the four essential freedoms. The program is free software if it gives users adequately all these freedoms. Otherwise it is non free while we can distinguish various non free distribution schemes in terms of how far they fall short of being pre you consider them all equally unethical. keep going here. One more paragraph.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;or.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;two. In any given scenario these freedoms must apply to whatever coded plan to make use of. or lead others to make use of, for instance, consider a program a which automatically launches and program be to handle some cases. Who plan to distribute as a stance that applies users, only be given, so we need to judge whether both A and B are free, however, we plan to modify a so that doesn't use be on the needs to be free be is not pertinent. he's calling me. must be available for commercial use commercial development and commercial distribution. Policy is a fundamental importance, without this free software could not achieve the same. Okay, so that's far enough, I think, for for this about the. essential freedoms. I can see that. 1212 and three. Are. Different than freedom zero because. Joe talks about to run the program as you wish for any purpose. Can we reconcile freedom zero with. public interest and. Making sure that we're serving the public interest. here. Clear as a question breakout room, can we reconcile freedom zero public interest. Can I clarify what this means. I want to explore. So I guess to clarify what I was. So that's the freedom is freedom zero is freedom to run the programs you wish for any purpose. So that's a freedom zero that's right. it's asserted. Now is their responsibility to consider the public interest in this. And or the incompatible or disease for together. helped clarify. Okay, so let's start a breakout room for 10 minutes. And we'll get back together and. and discuss.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;know.well.yeah.bye.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;comments about breakout rooms, not being very. Active. Part of the issue here, I think, is. OK, let me. And the poll here and shared. Issues. Being able to. Find groups. Because if people don't register with email. This is my understanding, anyway, if people don't register. and tell us. If we. have some stability in the group, then we could serve treated as. So the accountability, with the groups, because they're.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li></ul>

    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Morning!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning!
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Yes we can see it
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;While I definetely prefer WebEx when I've had to use it for work, I think its another situation of "use what everyone else is using".
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;True but It is a good thing to learn how to use other software eventually
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;oh yeah, come on and slam...welcome to the Space jam!
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Seems like it was an accident.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room: can we reconcile freedom 0 with the public interest?
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Can you clarify what this means?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;"The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose"
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;If you make something and someone uses it for not its inttdended purpose who is at fault fo any harm
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;yes, thank you
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;tired of sitting in rooms where nobody talks, I left my room.
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Same for me
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;promised from last meeting: https://www.google.com/search?q=ban+on+killer+robots
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I say it was good, its just some people are not active
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;^ I agree
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I've only had 2 breakout rooms this semester where anyone other than myself has posted something
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes, they have been awesome (shoutout to Maria), and other times, no response from the other members
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;^ to those two
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah it's a toss up
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;same
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;honestly it us how are not using the opportunity to the fullest but calling them bad will be so mean because they are somehow this is among possible way we can interact in a group
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;It’s good if everyone participates. Last 2-3 times, my breakout rooms have had virtually no participation
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Agree
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I'm leaning towards having a breakout discussion once a week rather than every class. Just because there will be more to discuss about.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Will say whenever in David galgan group the awesome points are made its always cool to interact with him
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks dude! :)
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;My business prof jumps around and joins random breakout rooms, which encourages people to participate. If you’re the only one active, when he joins your group he’ll find you with your camera on and mic and whoever else silent.
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I usually need a couple extra minutes to think about the prompt before talking in the breakout room, which I know slows things down a bit
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Had a good discussion with John.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I've tried my best to accommodate people who prefer to type vs talking but I find about 70% of the time nobody will answer me at all, or it will be just me and maybe one other member of the group having a discussion.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;^
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;^ same Dayne. Sometimes offering chat works, but not always
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I think they're a good idea. They create class discussion after the groups are done at the very least. The issue is a lot of people don't want to participate. It's an online issue, I don't think this would happen in in-person classes
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I find when you ask a question and we answer it in the chat as a large group, while it can be hectic, is a lot more beneficial then hoping you get good group members in breakout rooms.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I agree, I just am not sure how to improve the situation when a small portion of class is dedicated to participating in discussion.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;We could just do less breakout rooms so theres moer people
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah bigger breakout rooms sounds great
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I think it must be an online issue. In person, a group of 4 people, 3 of them would never completely ignore the 4th
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I must say they are a great way for us to get in our thoughts on a subject since there is only one spotlight in a big group, so opinions can get buried easily
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;perhaps marking should be present somehow
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;The problem with me is sometimes there is a lot of noise going on in my background and I don't want to have that interrupt the discussion, so at times I prefer the chat but then people don't read the chats
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with Keegan, Bigger breakout rooms are better
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;What if we make shorter breakout rooms to start the conversation, then continue together as a class? Just an idea
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;^ I think that's a good idea
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;10 minutes is short... when there is actually discussion
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;10 minutes would normally be decent if its a large group, but if your group isn't doing anything its just 10 minutes of silence
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Useful for a bathroom break but not much else.
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;If there is discussion 10 minutes is barely enough. but gettting discussion can be like pulling teeth
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Larger group will be better.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I think if we make group sizes to like 8-10 at least 2-3 others will be active
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, bigger groups means higher likelihood of active participants
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;^^^ Tim
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah 8-10 seems reasonable, even if 50% don't participate, there can be a good discussion
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;As long as there are 2 people, it’s great.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;^
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;It may also help to discuss the topic a bit or get some more lecture before going into the breakout rooms. That way, people will have more background before discussing
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;funny that we are discussing how to discuss
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah this last one threw people for a loop I think. GNU makes some pretty serious judgement / moral claims that I dispute, but I think the complexity of it further discouraged my breakout teammates from responding
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;It is not worthwhile for all types of situation if the organization is planning or making anything that is harmful for public then it could be dangerous.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;For me, "as you wish, for any purpose" is not universalizable with regards to the public interest, as "any purpose" can include misuse.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;for me it was the opposite. I just focused on one particular topic/news story
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;However that doesn't mean they can't coexist.
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;^if there are restrictions on the usage, it cant be called freedom 0
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;My thoughts are that software is a multi-purpose tool, so the same software can be used for or against the public good. Therefore, with that caveat, it can coexist with the idea of the public good
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;My group found that this related back to the responsibility topic. Ultimately, whose responsibility is it to uphold the public interest? The producer, consumer, or both?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;It seems to me that with the freedom of a user to use a software tool as they wish, there comes a responsibility to use it properly and constructively
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;If you read the context on the GNU page, what I take more serious issue with is that they claim all software out to be FREE, and that if it isn’t it must not be shared (without being immoral). Their claim is that to share software without transferring FREE ownership is to wield unholy power over another person. I strongly disagree with their assessment
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;ought… not out
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;public good is means that someone can't use a software to steal their money. This means there are some restrictions with using said program, this means less freedom but better for the greater good

    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Here are some of the secondary articles the professor’s article linked to
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-call-it-the-swindle.html
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/saying-no-even-once.html
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;“Our ultimate goal is digital freedom for all, a world without nonfree software.”
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;That's a wiiild statement lol
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;No shit haha
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;gnu taking it to the extreme
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;People still have to make money, not everyone wants to make stuff just as a hobby
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;“[Software] with DRM ought to be illegal.” So much for creatives…
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;there is already cyberbullying with just text chat...forget virus making
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;freedom should be restricted enough
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I really struggle with the concept of intellectual property. I agree that open source increases transparency, collaboration, and makes the work more accessible and diverse, however people still need to be paid for their work and their accomplishments. We can't expect people to do labour for free.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;@Kurtis their (weak) response to your concern is that developers should ALL be paid exclusively by providing support to FREE software
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;GNU is a lot more ideological than I ever would have guessed
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Non-threaded chats are bad for the human side of digital communication
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Could anyone share the attendance code? I have missed it from the beginning of the class
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;isn't robot in battlefield impractical enough in the first place?
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;pickkz
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;nope, not really. they are already using predator drones
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;self flying robots
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;drones are human contolled
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah target acquisition is the dicier thing. As whose decision is it
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I would say target acquisition is fine. The problem is is the robot or human pulling the trigger
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;welp, missiles has been able to acquire target on their own since the 60's
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Can even look at Winter Soldier/Minority Report as an example.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;You can use thermal to find targets easy enough
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Targets as in deciding who to kill, not how to guide the ordinance
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I love those movies
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Eventually it all comes down to whose calling the shots? Humans or the machine?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I don't agree with the "nerfed police bad" however
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;in Minority Report but I digress
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;machines don't call the shots. but in insurgency maybe machines would be more accurate than human
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Currently, with a drone strike there is a pilot and command responsible for their actions. One of the (many concerns by the site https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/ is that there will no longer be a direct link to a PERSON who can be held responsible for serious actions/inactions of deadly technology
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;… (many)
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. The concern is more so a "develop a robot that has the goal of stopping harm", and what the conditions are for that,  and how it isn't really something we should leave up to a machine, which could essentially be developed to follow a specific mindset, and not take into consideration other factors.

    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;drones operate based on ground intelligence. they don't hover in the sky, scan people and bomb them
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;...yet
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;For now at least
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;As of right now. The concern is them getting to the point not needing human input.
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;a good book to read :"robopocalypse".
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Something very interesting is that regardless of the degree to which they are right, https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/ has a ton of logical fallacies all throughout their argumentation
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;more concerning will be the huge availability and cheap prices of drone
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;check the recent Armenian-ajerbaizan war
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;^ Kurtis’ points
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;do lawyers have a oath like that?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;jk
