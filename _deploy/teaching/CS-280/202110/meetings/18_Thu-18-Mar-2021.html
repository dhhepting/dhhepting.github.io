      In the last class, we talked about how technology can help make our lives more sustainable. We have seen the use of technology for the betterment of human civilization. All the satellites that we use for providing internet and to provide a prediction for floods and droughts have helped framers across the world. The use of eclectic cars has reduced carbon emissions across the globe. Technology in the current pandemic has helped a lot to connect people all across the world and teachers, parents, governments, and health officials could connect with their counterparts without fearing any data breach and they...
    </li><li>
      On meeting 17 we discussed the sustainability for internet for this century, and I have watched the two Ted talk videos for William Mcdough and Tim-Berners Lee, they give us the idea of nowadays industry influence for public and why we build an open web, Ideas for Cradle to cradle design, we have known that Industry is damaging to the environment, Reducing, reusing and recycling are good ideas but they’re not enough to make a difference. For The New Web, we’ve learnt building a web for open, linked data that could do for numbers what the Web did for words,...
    </li><li>
      Sustainability is very important. For example, nowadays human activities are constantly consuming resources. If resources are used up, then human beings will be in danger, which is also the importance of sustainability. However, sustainability is still important in the online world, and we need to build a sustainable online environment to cope with the growing number of users in the future.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learnt about is spime. Spime is an object that could be track through space and time throughout its lifetime. Its all information is stored in a cloud.It is a mechanism that could track any thing on Earth.
    </li><li>
      I do like breakout meetings if the people are willing to participate in them. If they don’t, then it just honestly sad.Thanks for the blog post 2 due date extension. Lots of people need it.With all these tech gadgets available. How can you maintain privacy once you have them inside your home?Sustainability from the computer professional side. Create gadgets that don’t get outdated right away and produce more e-waste. Some parts of e-waste are recyclable while the other part is not. Create more efficient apps that require fewer resources to run, so it doesn’t make a lot of energy to...
    </li><li>
      We had a breakout room discussion about what responsibility do Computer Science Professionals have in order to embrace sustainability in their work. We agreed that the best that they can do is devise methods, create products which will help in solving sustainability of humans in the long run. Wikipedia defines that the field of Computational Sustainability, attempts to optimize the social, economic and environmental resources, using the power of computers to process large quantities of data and provide an efficient, sustainable decision to allocate resources in real-time. For example, the Intelligent Transportation System(ITS) attempts to improve travel safety and reduce...
    </li><li>
      In our 17th meeting we discussed about sustainability, our 2nd blog, SaskPower, and computer professionals’ goals towards sustainability. In class we were asked to describe what is sustainability. When we were placed in groups to discuss, we said that doing small things like not using single use non-biodegradable plastic bags, straws and cutlery although businesses should also do their part with sustainable responsibility and not simply leave it to the consumer. An example of possible sustainability with the expense of security and privacy was SaskPower’s smart meters to control electricity consumption. One example of sustainability that computer professionals should be...
    </li><li>
      I am interested in the concept of sustainability for software engineers. It is important for software engineers to create software that can still run on old hardware, so that there is not an unnecessary amount of waste created with an update in hardware.
    </li><li>
      Our talk about sustainability reminded me about these videos on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnJ8mK3Q3g &amp; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvzvM9tf5s0). One video talks about why recycling is basically a scam due to many reasons (economics, lower concern for plastic use, etc.) and the other compares plastic bags vs more "sustainable bags" respectively, and it's pretty shocking information. It's pretty eye-opening to learn about things that you once thought were sustainable but actually are not. This just shows as important sustainability is we need to have better information of what is truly sustainable before making decisions on sustainability.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a discussion about technology. That how it is useful in our day to day life. Even in this cureent pandemic, it became more useful in every field.
    </li><li>
      Something I encountered that is related to the past meeting was at a past workplace. I used to work at a computer repair shop, and the amount of technical waste we accumulated daily was extremely high. In class, we discussed the value that data can have on sustainability and environmental impact. Due to my past experience working with old and broken technology, when considering sustainability and how IT professionals can be more sustainable, I think it is also important to consider technical products and how those pieces of equipment can be more sustainable.
    </li><li>
      In class, an explanation of Bruce Sterling's “spines” was given, and how it relates to possible harms from IoT lifecycles that have finished serving their purpose. I think this is comparable to online spaces, as younger generations spend their entire lives connected to the internet. Anything online that they have done in the past could be accessible, stolen, or used against them, despite that corner of the internet being at “the end of its lifecycle”. I think there's a potential danger there for people being exploited for things they have done when they are young and immature.
    </li><li>
      I feel like today's discussion about Sustainability needs to be done on a much larger scale than an Undergraduate class. I really love the fact that big tech giants like Apple, Microsoft and Samsung are shifting to recycled materials as come to think of it, it will mean that millions of people will indirectly be a part of the green initiative. Also, in my opinion, bigger corporations need to step up and start doing their part for the world otherwise we're headed towards Armageddon
    </li><li>
      It was great discussing sustainability and privacy in a group, also thank you for extending the submission for blog2. Under the submission of blog1 it says grades ready to release but nothing yet seen so if you can do that would be great. Thank you.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed how technology can help make our life more sustainable. We saw how technology is used for the betterment of humans beings. The satellites that we use to provide information about any upcoming disasters before time have helped people globally in many ways. Nowadays we are using electric cars which reduces the level of CO2 from the atmosphere and not only helping humans but also mother earth to heal. Most of all in a hard time of pandemic we can connect to people across the world on the tip of our finger. It made things...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this class was on the topic of sustainability. Sustainability is important because resources are scarce. Since most companies in various sectors use computers and software to do work, computer professionals can contribute to sustainability by developing better programs and algorithms for many areas such as manufacturing, distribution of energy, etc. Computer professionals have a great potential to contribute because they have already transformed the world for the better with the development of the internet, computers, and mobile devices.
    </li><li>
      The most interesting thing was how data is analyzed and used to boom the market for businesses but its also shocking how it is not breach in people's privacy, from google tracking to proctor track, data is being spelled by major organization for their benefits. Data plays most crucial rule role in todays world but there are rising concern for the same that needs to be resolved
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting we had 2 breakout seasons. The first one about “What is sustainability” and 2nd one is about “what’s the computer science view on sustainability”. After both seasons, we had a discussion about what was our thoughts about it. In my opinion nothing really has sustainability, there will be always some new ideas to replace the old idea. On the matter of computer science, I think sustainability is a growing field. There will be more and more new methods and tools to upgrade the applications.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we attended a breakout season to discuss about What is sustainability. Then professor was asking about what’s each groups opinion about the topic. Then we talked about the blog 2. Professor discussed what should be main focus for the blog 2. He also changed the date for blog 2 submission. He also talked a bit about the 2 ted talk (cradle to cradle design) &amp; (The next web). In the cradle to cradle design, the speaker talk about triple top line. It’s the idea that any design can be used under component, and it can be...
    </li><li>
      It seems to me that sustainability as it relates to CS means systems that only collect data that is necessary and is known to the users, which is used solely to improve the users' experience.
    </li><li>
      After listening to Tim Berners-Lee, it only continues to pique my interest in the topic of data. Linked data is something I often desire, both in professional fields, and my own personal interests or hobbies. I hope we explore the idea of “linked data” more.
    </li><li>
      Thoughts on the Next WebThe Next Web is the title of a TED talk given by the creator of the world-wide-web and head of the W3C organizations that oversees the development of the web. He delivers an inspiring speech on the nature of the web, the dilemmas it solved and the atmosphere generated in rooms by people at the first few instances experiencing the web. He continues to talk about the next generation of the web, how data will flow freely though-out society. Much of this has already either happened or is in progress in 2021. With the rise of...
    </li><li>
      When we are talking about sustainability I think the pressure is on consumer and producer, but more so on the consumer. When we were talking about cradle to cradle designs this would only be effective if the end consumer recycles it. If there is no incentive for the consumer to recycle these products then a lot of people wont. Look at can recycling, a deposit is paid and then gotten back when you return it. So I think when computer professionals are looking at sustainability I think we would have to focus on why people will be recycling it.
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about the idea, or term I suppose, "spime(s)". The wikipedia entry was very brief, I suppose due to this being an unconventional term, and I wished to see a few more examples of what could be considered "spimes", besides the "six facets of spimes" which were described rather broadly. However, from the wiki it is clear what Spimes are (or could be), I suppose I would have appreciated a bit more detail.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we talked about sustainability which is taking decision while keeping the future impacts of the decision in mind. We had discussion about these and it was pretty fascinating to hear new ideas. Another interesting thing about meeting was discussion about the smart meters that were installed in homes for watching the consumption of an household and we came to know about many new things
    </li><li>
      Meeting was pretty interesting due to the fact that sustainability was being discussed and fellow student have pretty good ideas when we discussed it in a breakout room. Other than that we had another breakout room discussion about how computer professional contribute towards sustainability. Discussion about Volkswagen's emission controversy was really surprising for me. Smart meters were also discussed which were installed in Regina as well. Deadline for blog 2 was extended which was really good.
    </li><li>
      While it certainly is important to make sure that we are developing in an environmentally conscious way, such as avoiding making an application with a hardware component that we quickly abandon, I think that sustainability in this context has another meaning. A big part of sustainability is ensuring that the way we are developing now does not abuse the rights of users in such a way that would cause increased restrictions to be imposed on future generations. While realistically it can be anticipated that some privacy is lost when dealing with anything online, if we are intentionally taking that multiple...
    </li><li>
      William McDonough, a green-minded architect and builder, asks in the first video how our buildings and products look if planners take all kids, all animals, into account. The principal objective of McDonough is to build a safer society which is a true intention for the present and the future. In addition, it is always really effective how he believes using instances. I believe that having a clear goal is critical in guiding us to our destination.
    </li><li>
      With this last meeting focusing on sustainability, we had a great discussion on how computing professionals can contribute to sustainability practices. I really enjoyed the thoughtful conversation, but I really struggle when people ask, "But what's the motive or incentive for companies to implement these practices?" Of course, it's an important question to ask! Obviously it is important to find reasons to convince the companies we work for to change their policies or their products; however, I really struggle to understand why this question needs to be asked all the time when the motive/incentive is just to be ethical.Why isn't...
    </li><li>
      We learned many things in this class. I learned one of the most important things that is the scientist Tim Berners-Lee has expressed his thoughts to a new web, since he was the one to discover the world wide web and URL. He expresses that the collection of data has the relationships called ‘linked data’. He talks more about the Raw data of everyone, and every community is important, but some raw data should be revealed from the communities like government for transparency and to acknowledge their works. And there are many data that are not connected to those that...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed about 2nd blog and the professor changed its due date. Later we were divided into groups to have group discussions in the breakout rooms.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 17, we talked about the sustainability. The country should have the plan of repair the damage of nature that caused by human development. The environment of the earth getting worse if we compare it to 20 century. Because of building needs land, a lot of trees are cut down, because of the exhaust emissions, the fresh air is polluted.
    </li><li>
      In previous class, we saw two TED talk videos which said nothing but different aspects regarding technology and the way it assists life of billions of humans in an appropriate manner. Almost Everyone makes proper use of technology in some or the other form. Scientists are able to forecast or foresee many things for the calamities or any other natural phenomena upcoming in the near future after the invention of communication satellites. Such kind of Devices helps in forecasting weather or any kind of natural calamity, supports live video streaming, live telecast of sports such as basketball, football, etc can...
    </li><li>
      The last meeting was interesting where we discussed a little bit about privacy and then shift our topic to sustainability.
    </li><li>
      My contributions as a future computer professional in sustainability are as follows:-pay more attention on public’s privacy by adding code of conduct that ensures safety of public’s data ,as privacy is a very fragile topic these days.-updates on my interface would be more public friendly keeping public’s necessities and recommendations in mind.-rather than filling my bank accounts it would be more of public supporting and public welfare work . 
    </li><li>
      The most important thing discussed in the meeting was about the spime i.e neologism futuristic thing to the internet technology and the videos about the "the next web" and about the cradle design.topic that is related to the previous class isabout the insecurities of the internet technologytopic that is difficult to understand was about Spime and its affectstopic i would like to learn more is about the cradle design as it is more interesting and gives us much knowledge about the thing running in present world
    </li><li>
      Everything we do is done for one purpose, but sometimes these purposes seem to be self-contradictory. For example, printing the slogan "Protect Trees" on paper is obviously self-contradictory. Therefore, when designing a product, people must think comprehensively and put an end to such self-contradictory behaviour. In the future development of computer software, data interconnection is very important. This not only allows a substantial increase in user experience but also reduces the work of developers and allows the Internet to truly connect data.
    </li><li>
      In the video of ted talk william mcdonough talks about preventing environmental disaster and improving economic growth by cradle to cradle design.
    </li><li>
      In the class we talked about sustainability and how as a computer programmer we can make a software sustainable. In our group discussion we all suggested that we as an individual should make privacy options for the users so that they know what will happen with their data.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we discussed about sustainability and how using information tecnology we can help us to use our resources sustainabilly. In the Break ot room we discussed that tecnology such as electric vehicles can bring pollution caused by carbon dioxide to low levels and helps earth's atmosphere to remain sustainable.
    </li><li>
      It is worth remembering, recent the web is: in January 1992, there were 50 web browsers in universe, generated as a result of the web in 1990. To represent, linked data must be free, so the old styles of file transfers must give way to heritage of data sharing: a commons of material which can be mentioned in various ways. Rather than hoarding files and records as people currently do, Berners-Lee advocates for 'raw data now' to allow a future of exchanging and increased collaboration.
    </li><li>
      I learnt from the video "The next web" the differences between days before the web and days after web was createdand the speaker also said that we have not reached the full potential
    </li><li>
      As for "Cradle to cradle design", it allows us to understand the environmental issues and impacts of manufacturing and industrial systems.As for "The next web", there are three sources of dysfunction affecting today’s web: deliberate, malicious intent, system design that creates perverse incentives, and unintended negative consequences
    </li><li>
      Sustainability is extremely important in the world of technology and business. If you are going to create something either a product or a business you have to think about the future and what might come and plan accordingly so that your product or business will survive. The longest running companies or products that have been around for a long time are here because they are sustainable
    </li><li>
      When a product meets the basic requirements of appearance, creativity, and function, it also considers the enterprise's social responsibility. It still doesn't qualify as "good design." A good design should eliminate the idea of waste，so all that is leftover can be used to make a new generation of products at the end of the product's life cycle. Therefore，good design needs to consider sustainability—for example, the "cradle to cradle" green loop design. Coca-Cola creates a system where plastics and other recyclables are used. As this system's scale begins to expand, we will see all kinds of old plastics recycled as if...
    </li><li>
      The way in which our society is designed plays an important role in the society. The goal is to achieve sustainable development. It can be achieved by efforts and inovation. People should try to build a society which does not harm anyone and the basic rights of people should be protected. Inovation plays an important part in achieving this goal and people should be given opportunities so that they can achieve the goal they want.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we learnt about sustainability. People have different point of view on sustainability.There was an opinion that sustainability would be resources you consume should be less than the minimum amount that a planet can regenerate to ensure no deficit.If computer professionals make their data more available and transparent to the public, it will increase accountability and people will be able to make more thoughtful choices. It will give the public a chance to make more informed and sustainable decisions.
    </li><li>
      For me, sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or project. Sustainability is when we wisely use the resources and utilize our time and make decisions that have the future in mind. In a general sense, it means doing something now that can continue indefinitely, without impeding the ability of future generations to do so. Mostly as a neither way we can look at sustainability is that its also a way of stagnation since there is no need to bring in new ideas since they have a steady source of income. In a very broad sense, sustainability is...
    </li><li>
      The past meeting was about the stuff related to design and the way in which designs impact the development of human. Every action taken by the humans should be in under rules of sustainablitiy. Inovation is a great step to get success in planning a bright future. Government should promote this things and motivate its people to be inovative so that the effort is in right direction.
    </li><li>
      With the concept of cradle to cradle architecture, William McDonough suggests a solution to our unsustainable methods of production. Many companies and countries (including Nike, Gap, and China) have enlisted McDonough's support to build sustainable structures.
    </li><li>
      We talked about cradle architecture and how it can help us create more sustainable structures.
    </li><li>
      We discussed about sustainability and how computers affect the sustainability.
    </li><li>
      We had group discussion regarding the ways to increase the sustainability and as an outcome we came to conclusion that sustainability is directly proportional to privacy. If we increase the privacy measure in simple way find solutions to the problem that user data does not get leaked then we can attain sustainability and I would like to see more ways through which we can attain it and I also watched the videos on website they are really good
    </li><li>
      One thing I'm really curious and want to know more about is that if they actually made/built that city with farm on the top of the roof. Also on the second video was talked about how we should put more data on the web and how helpful it would be to our society. But it's also very important to know that putting our data blindly online without a good plan could become dangerous. For example there are companies that does free DNA test for you to know where your ancestor come from, however it is important to know that with...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing i learned from the last class was how techonlogy makes our lives more susatainable. Also, I found the ted talk about the next web to be very interesting because it talks about raw data, web in next generations and making data availaible through links.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I talked about last meeting had to be sustainability. Our breakout group mentioned how sustainability is making decisions with the future in mind. The hardest thing for me to understand was cradle to cradle design. The "intention of our species" is a very broad topic that was hard for me to correlate to the design philosophies and examples in question. Sustainability is something I have been thinking about for a long time in every day life. I have thought about the sustainability of my work, student, and life balance. Not only that but the discussion of...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, I learnt that Sustainability means meeting our own needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.It is also the ability for something to be consistent.I also learnt on the concept of Spime which is a neologism for a futuristic object, characteristic to the Internet of Things that can be tracked through space and time throughout its lifetime.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we talked about how sustainability is crucial in this world and particularly in the technological context! I think, one of the major driving factors to tackle climate change in the future would be AI. Moreover, All of the recent tech trends, such as AI, ML, the Internet of Things, Big Data, edge computing, robotic process automation, and others, are designed to make our lives easier. That is why both ordinary consumers and large-scale companies are interested in these technologies and improvements. For example, artificial intelligence has been instrumental in complex data analysis and management aimed at...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we learnt about sustainability and how it is related to computer Science. We also had discussion about the good software design. The TED talk was very much related to the discussion in class and William Mcdonough very well explained sustainability by "cradle to cradle design". In the other TED talk by "The next web" explained about the development in the every sector of life and also gave idea that it is not yet at its full potential.
    </li><li>
      From the meeting i got to know that the due date of the vlog 2 has been extended and also for the empathy map and i would like to appreciate professor for cooperating with the students. The important topic which was discussed in the class was sustainability. From the medium of group discussion the discussion became more brief. Frankly before the class i had no factual information about this topic. but the meeting was very useful.
    </li><li>
      When it comes to sustainability in computer programming, the first thing that comes to mind is the ability for a project to be maintained with a reasonably low amount of resources being spent on it. A project that is continually causing issues and draining time and resources is not very sustainable. The term sustainability is also often referred to in conversations about the environment and taking care of the planet. Using recycled resources and items is a sustainable practice and can help reduce the waste made in the industry.
    </li><li>
      In the ted talk it was intresting topic of design, and how in everything it was used and how is the cycle like according to me for example to success in anything you have to work for it for years learn all the stuff than you became masters in it and that is exactly happens with the technology and design like phone apple how the first one was made and how the iphone12 is capable of doing things, so it basically takes time to get the best out of design to make it efficient as in the video he talked...
    </li><li>
      It is important for designers to create a sustainable platform for their consumers ,to help when the number of users grow in the future
    </li><li>
      After watching "the next web", I have learned that the data comes in many forms and there are many connections between data. The web is full of linked data that has three rows. The first one is http name used for people, places, and events. The second one is the data representing useful information. The last one is the relationships between data. The purpose of using data is to improve people's lives and delivering information to public. Even though all kinds of information are available on the web, much of the data remains hidden from the public such as government...
    </li><li>
      In our 17th meeting we discuss about sustainability and it’s very intresting topic. Sustainability does not have any particular definition but it is helpful at multiple place.Sustainability is one the newest degree subjects that attempts to bridge social science with civic engineering and environmental science with the technology of the future. When we hear the word “sustainability” we tend to think of renewable fuel sources, reducing carbon emissions, protecting environments and a way of keeping the delicate ecosystems of our planet in balance. In short, sustainability looks to protect our natural environment, human and ecological health, while driving innovation and...
    </li><li>
      In last lecture, we discuss about the blog entry 1 numbers and also about the due dates of blog entry2 and empathy map
    </li><li>
      In the class, the due dates were postponed, and discussed the following topics.In the TED talk by Tim Berners Lee, he talked about the linked data and how it very important to have the data linked on the web which would be useful in every aspect of life.Spime is referred to as the "Internet of Things". An object is considered to be a spine when all of its information can be found on the cloud.
    </li><li>
      In the beginning of meeting 17 the professor made an announcement on the request of student of changing due date of the second blog. Which was an act of kindness and cooperation toward his students. The main topic for the today class was sustainability. Sustainability is the term which describe the management and disposal of information technology un such a productive way that it reduces the harm to the environment in other words sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or project with the use of resources and time making decision that have the future in the mind....

      The most important thing discussed in the meeting was about the spime i.e neologism futuristic thing to the internet technology and the videos about the "the next web" and about the cradle design. Topic which we can count as related to the previous class is about the insecurities of the internet technology so how privacy breach can happen and how can we tackle. Topic which I find difficult to understand was about Spime and its affects. Topic I’d like to learn more is about the cradle design as it is more interesting and gives us much knowledge about the thing...
    </li><li>
      In the beginning of meeting 17 the professor made an announcement on the request of student of changing due date of the second blog. Which was an act of kindness and cooperation toward his students. The main topic for the today class was sustainability. Sustainability is the term which describe the management and disposal of information technology un such a productive way that it reduces the harm to the environment in other words sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or project with the use of resources and time making decision that have the future in the mind....
    </li><li>
      We had a good meeting, and in the discussion, I learned about privacy and sustainability. So, privacy is a collection of data to protect it from unauthorized access, whereas; sustainability is a way to secure the future for the young generations.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discussed about how sustainability in technological innovation can help in future. Many of our problems can have an simple solution due to sustainability in technology. AI - artificial intelligence is one of the foremost example of it.
    </li><li>
      I wondering if you could discuss the content of the final exam. I believe An object can be considered a spime when all of its essential information is stored in the cloud
    </li><li>
      Tuesday it was very interesting to hear my groups (1 other person) talk about sustainability and how meaningful it is for the future. we are certainly moving forward towards that type of future but there is always a cost, Its very cool to be growing in this time but at the same time thinking about climate change is scary, i hope to see the planet become healthy throughout my lifetime.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. Okay, so. You can see my email. So. Yes, the grades are released. But some of you may not have a grade listed there. Because there's two fields are updated. there's. grade column, and then there's the feedback comments. Everybody should have feedback comments. which includes your grade at the bottom of the description. Which is. output from the. calculator on the assignment page. It seems like some some of the grades didn't get copied over to the great column. That makes sense. So trying i'm trying to get this resolved. So that everything is. sorted out. taken a long time. I didn't want to wait any longer.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;hey Professor. I have a question about the great.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Sure go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;um so I had submitted my head uploaded my blog before the deadline, but I did not hit the submit button, I thought it would submit on on. What I noticed that it did not submit a week later. I also submitted in my class blog section before the deadline so i'm wondering, like, I still was directed at marks for late submission.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I So the issue was that I said that. Draft submission drafts were OK.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;OK so.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;If you have. Something that indicates. The date of your draft submission. See the problem with your course is it doesn't save. This is a draft submitted on such and such a date and then submitted on such and such a date. If you have a draft and you submitted.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;my blog is also in the clots block forum as well and it's. before the deadline. And I did not make yes. I have emailed you about this, but I did not hear back.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah because I talked about it already.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So point out. Please. send a note to the marker. send them a note just explaining that the dates were. mixed up. And here's. The post that was in the class blog here's some. On time submission okay.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome. Okay, so let me just catch up on the comments here in the chat before we go on. yeah so I have an office hour. Today at 330. going to talk about things.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;To blog entries are each out of 12. And then the empathy map is of 11 so makes a total of 35. yeah so I can. I can talk to you, generally, about two comments. Then you can also contact the marker. Yes, responses to meetings engage with those meetings. You 20 that's. that's. The Max you'll get you get full marks for that. Neither great door feedback. That you made a submission. Take a look at that. You can talk to me in office hours or send me a note. Okay. Alright, so I think that's that's basically it. So my apologies for. Getting these comments to you. Okay, so it's not under comments it's under feedback So if you go through the spreadsheet. it's one that's further over. The heading is a C. feedback. Feedback comments. Very. Looking at the screen, the very rate. that the last column in this spreadsheet is final grade, which will show you a market of 12. And then before that is annotate PDF which is not applicable. And then feedback comments. So if you go. To the to the very end to the right most edge of the spreadsheet. Last. you'll be able to see final grade and feedback comments. And if you have issues. for not being able to see. The feedback comments. Please let me know via email and Gore come and see me in my office hour today. Okay. Now. Okay, so I did say anyway. I don't want to get into too much, I did say. You get 10. Penalties until Wednesday. If you have. A question of dates. Okay, so I see lots of comments in the chat now that are rehashing the email that I sent. And then other comments have been made about. again. In the feedback comments worldwide marks were detected. Now. i'm going to stop looking at the chat now. Because probably people. Okay, no I don't want to say that. In case in case people continue on this thread i'm not gonna look at the chat anymore. Okay, so Sharif comment here about. lab instructor so there's no lab instructor here. And I did give a rubric and the comments. are in fact. indicating which criterion on the rubric was. This is doing the same thing. Anyway, Okay, how can I go back to my original. comment about not making comments about the chat anymore okay. bit of business, I wanted to talk about was. That we're having. A presentation from kips. Anyone. Anyone like to offer with the microphone what kept stands for.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;I guess even.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Any information processing so say, do I get.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah that's right Thank you. So they have an ISP. designation for information systems professional. And so the comments box all is an alumnus from the department is going to come and talk to us. A week from today. So the meeting is going to be open, so if none of that other people know about. Their computer science students know about it. and invite them to come you're welcome to do that and i'll post. a note on. That internationally advertised. Online so. And then, remember, on Thursday, the day before, is. robotic Mars exploration talk. At 7pm on Wednesday evening. prepare for the presentation event on Tuesday next week. So have some. grounding what he's going to talk about. Anyway, Okay, so let me see whether this link works. Fellow who started this year club. In the States. So he's a famous environmentalist. And he says when you're trying to pick out anything by itself, you find a hitch to everything else in the universe. What does that have to do with computer science. So to me this fits in with our discussion of last day where we ended up. So where did we end up lusty talked about. accounting for social cost. accounting for externalities. And maybe a carbon tax is a one way to do that.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Well, and I almost think that that's the thrust of this class right as we're computer science students and we all spend our time staring at a monitor. Making our code work and never worrying about how it's connected to anything we just want it to work and then you're trying to point out to us that there's huge implications to these things that get released into the world.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Thank you. So. that's a nice summary of the class. This is not the same one. Link right hand right. Hand hand this is sufficient for. So in computer science abstraction. Is a simplified version of something technical, such as a function or an object in the Program. goal of abstracting data is to reduce complexity, removing unnecessary information. Value extraction and computer science. Good How does that relate to. The act of abstracting and. Decoupling things. Because when they try and click on anything by itself, you find it attached everything else in the universe. So that when we. When we. abstract things and make these cuts. of connections between other things, simplify into either information. Then. And then we think that the extraction is sufficient. to work with. Anyone have a fallacy that we discussed. misplace concreteness. So when we have. A model. You forget to the model we forget this is simplified model. And then we. work with it as if it's the real thing and then we. don't pay attention to the discrepancies. Not behavior is a model compared to to. hang in the real world. me. So let me start a breakout room so it's Finally, the question for breakout rooms. How do we do. Do we deal with everything being connected and still write code that relies on abstraction. Does that sound for question to discuss. Okay. So i'm gonna start breakout rooms, a little good 10 minutes. And then we'll come back and have a discussion again okay. 20 breakout rooms and opening now. Sorry, I realized, because I was in a breakout room that i've been muted. So is that discussion for everyone. Give me a thumbs up okay Alex go ahead and.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Have the question I think the question is a bit flawed because. we're asking how do we like, how do we connect stuff in a world with connections and still code for abstraction were in my mind. At the other day, a code has to do something like it's used to solve a problem it's it's like kind of saying well what's what's the, how do we keep like what's the meaning of math NASA 10 days, two plus two, you can see, we. can do.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so I accept that my question is fraud. I typed it in, as I was formulating it. And we didn't have a lot of review about it, so I accepted that was not a. There are questions that could have been. Better.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Still good because it didn't take me it took me until I got into the breakout room and actually discuss it with someone when I realized oh I don't understand this question that well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so. I do. If we have all these pieces. parts and pieces. That go into making up our understanding of the world and they're all connected. But then, if we. We want to create a model of something. You want to work with him and code. and simplify things. And what, what are we leaving out. For those intended. You have to pick and choose. things that go into our model. And what are we leaving out and how do we deal with. Those broken connections. Okay first David then Keegan.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Oh sorry i'm just making sure I understand so basically the kind of concept you're trying to get at is that if we want to work with something and say, create a program out of it, we often lose the finer details when we converted from real worlds to sort of a computer concept.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so we use obstruction to hide details, so we have. You ever heard of information, hiding and then depending on where you are in your programs. In your studies. We don't want to have. More information available. at the interface, then. Going into solve the task. So we also have ideas of coupling and cohesion. So you want, like our functions to have. To be a cohesive. We would like to decouple them from one another, so they each have their own. Jobs to do so to speak. And when we're talking about decoupling. pieces, this is. This is idea that we're. Getting one or pulling on. One concept and then. Seeing that they're connected to everything else. So. So when we. write a program we have a model of. The world a simplified model, who are working with. So, even in the little calculator have for grades. You know I make some. make some abstractions due. To love. To be expressed the straightforward way. Man, am I answering your question, David.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I think I got a better idea now thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay Keegan did you still want to. comment to make.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, I basically just said that I don't think this is the responsibility of the developer developers have so much to focus on already. Like, for example, if you're working at a big company like Samsung Google, you could be like specifically just working on one function. And they can use it wherever they want it's more the job of like the higher the higher ups and the project managers and people like that too i'm getting a better understanding they need to educate themselves more in technology. And so that, basically, they have a better understanding is their job to form how this is going to work in relation to the real world like. developers have to focus on too many other things he's basically what i'm saying, and that is not their job to focus on how their code is going to impact. The world it's the job of unless like it's your entirety of your project and, like your soul it's a startup or something like that, but basically. I think there's too many things to focus on as a developer it's not really the job of the developer to worry about how their code affects the world it's the job of the company they're working for. To us, in a manner that is proper.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Somebody else's responsibility.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah yeah cuz if. yeah because if you're. Like if you're writing a code and basically they asked you to do something, you might not even know exactly where this code is going to be implemented in for like. as well, you also might not have the whole picture.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Right. So I appreciate that. Okay, Maria.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;um I think the developers still do have a kind of accountability when it comes to these things, for example. The code that we write should be as we've spoken and discussed about in our group about portability and how i'm having a piece of code portable and reduces costs and and just I guess. saves money as well, in the long run, so I don't know I think this question is really tying into that discussion we've had before of sustainability, so I think there is still accountability in the part of the developers here.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so sustainability of code is. Using best practices and making it. As useful useful and usable as possible in as many circumstances as possible. Is that a way to paraphrase your comments, Maria.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay Keegan you had your hand up again.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah if you have more portable code, though, how do you monitor where it's being used and what it's being used for. Like because if you're making portable code, it should be reusable for any project, it should fulfill a single function if this function is used in something that is considered morally incorrect, are you responsible for that. Just because you develop the the function like I that's why I don't think you have accounted as much accountability. personally.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Great great, so there are these. algorithms that. can be used for good or for bad. Now brings me to. i'd like we can talk about this next day. in more detail but. The free software foundation and. four fundamental freedoms of programmers. 033, of course. Is articulated by Richard stallman. i'll get a link for that and and we'll talk about it next day. For more about. More about today's. topic I was thinking about. Maybe this is more familiar more practical example. KPI. Key Performance indicators. So I. I think very popular and retail For one thing, but not only, that is a way to. To. make things more measurable. The question is, if these are really key performance indicators. Are the controlling the behavior. Are they. Are they easy to compute. Or are they. more meaningful, are they actually driving. Performance they'd like to see in an organization. So let's listen to like code black art on CBC you're talking about health care. And they're talking about you know in saskatchewan, for example, and we had a lean a push towards lean management practices. And the comment was. You know, should we be measuring. So this isn't about to sketch one in particular, but it was about. hospitals. And then they the pointless question is asked. Should we be measuring efficiency or valuing efficiency or. empathy. i'm paraphrasing a bit there but. You know So how do we quantify an empathetic and empathic responses. to people who respect their humanity. That may not be as efficient as we'd like to. Wear as easy as easy to quantify as we'd like to. like to think. we're more comfortable working with numbers. You know. giving you a greater than 12. Instead of. Something more. difficult to quantify. Some comments. About. The question about. Everything being connected and abstracts writing code with instructions. is being complimentary. Naming any names say when I wanna. Take the MIC for that one and. again.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I think it's pretty impossible if you start looking at what things could be used for will you're going to stop any kind of technological growth at any rate, like dead in its tracks anything you make can be used for one thing or another. My car isn't evil, but I could go run somebody over with it my computer isn't evil, but I could start hacking somebody else's information and stealing it. Like there's any anything you make you can use for good or evil like it's so if you're going to start considering all these negative impacts, while Okay, now we can't really do anything.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay well it's certainly a challenge isn't it I. mean I think there's two things are. related. We have to. be mindful of all the technology that we create. and The same time. Not. stuck on. did not create something. Because of thinking, the worst possible outcomes. So if we don't create technology. It doesn't mean that somebody else won't create it. And so we have the choice, then, to think about how we're. making it available and how we're regulating it. If it's being dissolved responsibly or not, and so forth. So there. is an ongoing discussion about. killer robots and now embedding them. Finding that technology so that's kind of the. Management of the technology part. So the. And i'll find the link to. A video that talks about. These machine machine guns in the military zone between North and South Korea. that are capable of targeting. Humans on their own. they're not used that way. But they have that capability. So certainly that's. difficult. And I should say that these that these robots are built by Samsung so it's kind of a library, for example, there that's one of the manufacturers. So. interesting to see. The breadth of endeavors for that company. So it's a question of. If there's really technology that shouldn't be developed, this is a threat to. humankind. Then we have to agree about managing it. And that would be a good conversation to have. But then we also have. You know. are responsible development of it. And if we abide by code of ethics. And we can. Have that guidance. We can. Have a conversation about. What what what is good and what's not so good, and so forth. So I think to not to have that conversation, is a good. it's a positive. We don't need to be paralyzed by it, I guess. Any any questions or concerns. Coming out of that.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;That makes technologies, you making it sound similar to the nuclear bomb like we should be having our own Oppenheimer moments and deciding whether we should be doing what we're doing.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No. That was my reaction to seeing the social dilemma documentary. little bit I mean not I don't want to make it sound too heavy. You know, because, like we say. it's not it's not like it's all dystopia. there's. there's some utopian extend that combination. Anyway, Alex you had your hand up so maybe we'll end with you.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Smoke because notice a lot about these type of things, or people compare things from the past, there are horrible horrible events to vince now. And don't get me wrong there's still horrible events happening now, like there's difference between a nuclear bomb going off in your hometown and Google stealing your personal data. Like a clean day on new blows up and you don't get to write you don't get to do anything your dad you're just a fond memory well kudos to the person who data just means. Good so your personal data, you know boycott them or do something about it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah Okay, I appreciate that comment. Our scale of outrageous. is different, these days.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we're out of time for today. So i'm just gonna. For and I guess just going to wrap things up and say thank you for today and have a great Thursday have a good weekend and i've got. office hours at three an office hours at 330. If you have questions.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.

    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Regarding grades? IF so, yes
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Yes I saw it
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;^ Yeah!
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;The grades were released
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;gradesssss
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I cant see the grades
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I didn't see mine
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;I can confirm, grade is visible in the feedback comments
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Me too
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;what was the average?
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;yeah
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah that's what I see. Grade is in feedback, not grade column
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Glad for the feedback though!
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Thanku for the detail feedback
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;can anyone tell me that how many engagement with meetings forum we have to attend out of 26 ??
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;20, I believe Bhumi
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;ok ty :)
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;is attendance done?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;not yet nupurben
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;So for mine, it says " Instructions not followed" and hence deducted 10%. Can you elaborate a bit into that?
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;yea I also got the instructions not followed on one part feels bad
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe if you have questions you should go to his office hours instead of using class time y'all
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;These may be office hour discussions, just a thought
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;what what the blog 1 grade out of?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;exactly I was going to say same
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;12
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;12
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;thanks
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;i didn't see my grade or comment
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;if they have issues, they should go to office hours!
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I don't see the feedback comments section on the submission page as well
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;If I go directly to the grades page it shows up on the gradesheet for me. Otherwise I can go to the submission page and scroll to the bottom where there is a collapsible section labelled feedback. If you click the + you can read the feedback. Hope that helps folks!
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;For me the feedback is showing fine. but the actual grade (while mentioned in the feedback) isn't copied in the grades column on urcourses.
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;And there is no column called feedback comments on my side! I guess we can take it to office hours later
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;were we penalize for late submission if we hand in on Wednesday 24
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;The deadline was Monday the 22nd so I would imagine so
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;"late (but within 48 hours of the due date and time): deduct 10% of the earned grade"
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;oh I thought he said he won't penalize us on Wednesday
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;my feedback states what I have done but mentions nothing about why grades were deducted
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;"git gud" - the marker
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;i got 2.40 marks deducted but no idea why
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds like actionable feedback to me shareef
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Class time doesn't seem like a good time to discuss deductions. If there isn't feedback I would attend office hours to get clarifications.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;"git push -dobetter"
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I am happy with my mark but yeah, our lab instructor gave a marking rubric and circled the one we got marked
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Office hours are a great time to discuss marking, agreed. I'm good to move on with class :)
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;^ yes please
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;sorry, for my other class I mean
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;sure let's move on
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;connectivity?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Computer science is connected to everything
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;you debug one thing and then another bug pops up? hahahaha
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;everything is connected?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Ah, so you're saying if we remove irrelevancies we might actually miss important subjects?
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes you miss the big picture
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Misplaced concreteness
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout rooms: how do we deal with everything being connected and still write code that relies on abstraction?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;That works for me
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Clear
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;sounds good
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;I mistakenly left the room can u assign me again
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Good discussion! It's a tough question to answer
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;kind of unclear
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Question too hard
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Question is a little hard
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;was it relating to abstraction meaning not relating to reality or abstraction meaning, can code be used in other levels of abstraction...
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;an addition calculator used for a calculator and then a tax filer program, as an example
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;off topic, what the attendance code?
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;ogsuhf
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;if everyone worries about if they should, no one would do it
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Could you explain more about what you mean by everything being connected ? If it has to do with access to the files the codes are written in I believe that is something the companies security team should be dealing with
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;What if my code is used to produce firearms or opiods more efficiently?  : )
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;IBM made a counting machine for Nazis during WWII
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;should we cancel IBM now? XD
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;@warren were you intending to use your code for that?
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds like a conversation about intent vs. impact
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah that’s kind of where I am going.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;if(America){cout &lt;&lt; "why? why again?";}
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;But isn't it your responsibility to understand the impact you will have when you are making something?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;That's fairly impossible to know. How do you know what someone else might come up with
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe your brain just doesn't think the same as theirs
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;That's the difficult question isn't it - is it immoral to develop something that you intended for a particular use but is used for something bad? It still has had a negative impact, so is the developer responsible for that impact? Should they have considered fallout more deeply?
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;you make gunpowder. But you dont if it would be used in fireworks at someone's wedding or in a gun to shoot someone
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Well on top of that when talking about empathy. You can look at empathy vs equity in vaccine distribution
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I know for a fact I will be the last to get the vaccine, no matter what
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;freakin even zoo animals have the vaccine
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;we can be proactive immediately after or before an inventions comes to be
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;we can't have analysis paralysis
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;AI is a whole different monster
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;But I would say all parts that make up a killer robot could be used in beneficial technology
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;hah! hilarious, America already are using Spot the robot dog to report stuff
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Well if you’re developing something for a company and they only tell you so much about what your code is going to be used for who do you then hold responsible when it has negative impacts ?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Couldn't you use a human targeting system to find people trapped in remote places?
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;computers will always eventually be seconds and nanoseconds faster
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Agreed
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;there was this graph showing that cpu power will level off in a few years but that is bull once quantum computing comes to be or something
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Wasn't the Abomb intended to be harmful?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think madam curie knew it would be used for that though
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;marie curie*
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Well its was discussed before for science. Atomic bomb was made to provide infinite energy of some sort but people used it to make atomic bombs. I think with power will come sorts of destruction.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;tesla reading this chat
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you! You as well
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Interesting but challenging topic today. Thanks for class prof!
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;thank you have a nice weekend
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;thanks
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you Daryl!
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Fingers crossed lol
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah - I heard about that too
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;nice
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Have a great day
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;thanks
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks! Have a nice day!
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks! :)
