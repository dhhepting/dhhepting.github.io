      I'd be interested in learning more about what people want done with food delivery apps charging too much. It would be very difficult to regulate this kind of business in my opinion. Since restaurants do not have to use this feature at all, they can get their own delivery drivers or make their own websites. The only real regulations they could impose are things on the ones the apps employ, that being drivers or people coding the app. As the EU did within the supreme court on Uber and their employees. I would be interested in learning more about what...

      These quotes from old, famous tech figures sometimes don’t age well. From my belief, the world of technology had completely outgrown the old views of technology. Like Mark Zuckerberg testify before the Congress show their age. If Lawmakers can’t keep up with the world, then society can’t be equally protected from the age of information technology.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbb5B85sd0I would say most of the restaurant have online website and menu. If you don’t want to order through third-party apps or so. Just order directly from the restaurant, usually, the restaurant has its delivery driver as well. It will save a lot of money...
    </li><li>
      What interested me in our discussion was the use of technology in driving forward a gig economy. It is essential to carefully consider transparency, worker protection rights, and responsibility when deploying software that enables such an economy. Furthermore, it is important for institutions to reconsider their purpose. This will become increasingly necessary in the near future. We can already see people bypassing traditional education to learn online. What is the benefit to this, and how does this affect people who choose to attend and pay for post-secondary education? What becomes the purpose of the programs in place today, and how...
    </li><li>
      In our 12th meeting we discussed about food delivery companies, restaurants, and how to efficiently analyze and judge a decision. Uber Eats and Skip the Dishes take more than 30% of every food order. Restaurants will either overcharge their food or shut down due to the lack of regulation. We also watched a part of a software engineering video about proper analysis and judgement. According to the video to not get stuck in “analysis paralysis” we must analyze just enough details to make the right decision first and then analyze more details that are down the correct decision path.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from last class was the difference between judgement and analysis, and how both of these ideas relate to software development. Judgement is the ability to choose the right path. Analysis is the ability go very far down the decision path chosen. My main takeaway from a much larger class conversation about how these two ideas relate to software development is that just because we CAN make something (analysis), doesn’t mean we SHOULD (judgement).
    </li><li>
      in this meeting we discuss about software engineering. the reason why software projects are falling. we did the poll about the protect property values in this meeting. Even discuss about that the government should support the people who lost their property in situation like natural disaster. They government is collecting the funds from the people but at the end they should help the people when they need. discuss about the fire dispatching system. Moreover discussed about the food delivery app such as skip the dishes. we were send into breakout room to discuss about the house hold properties that they...
    </li><li>
      The situation regarding the delivery service fee cap is best fit for the government to solve and regulate. I also want to point out that these delivery apps are an example of technology changing the way industries function. For example, when the taxi industry is regulated, along comes ride sharing where anyone with a phone and their own car can do the same job cheaper. Apps like Skip the Dishes and Uber are here to stay. All we need are some regulations to make them more compatible with the older systems. I also wouldn't be surprised if restaurants begin putting...
    </li><li>
      I think the most important concept I learned today was the importance of transparency. Transparency is something I initially did not think was too important, however, it is kind of shocking to see how hidden a company can operate, and thus it is difficult to gauge its true nature. Without transparency, it's really difficult to judge whether a company is ethical, moral, etc. Thus, to make decisions on whether to support or not support a company is really difficult, leaving the ability to sometimes hide shady/scummy business practices from the general public (like the 3rd-party food application delivery fees).
    </li><li>
      I wasn't there for the lecture but i came across something pretty interesting while I was working on Blog Entry 1, I'd like to speak about The graphical user interface, which is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve of command-line interfaces which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.Other than computers, GUIs are used in many more gadgets such...
    </li><li>
      In general, the food delivery apps have taken significant position from the restaurant in view of the existing circumstances. As nobody in winter want to dine in restaurants when they have the same food staying warm at home and so do I. I had bought food too many times on the skip, but in the past 2 months, I hadn't been to these restaurants. I did not realize, though, that they are receiving such big charges that many restaurants are being disturbed because of them, which is really a matter of concern.
    </li><li>
      In a last lecture I attend a meeting very late so I have no idea about what discussion is going on at which topic but it something related to employment may be I am not sure.
    </li><li>
      “Stranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software Engineering Judgment” was very interesting. I learned about the Bloom’s Taxonomy. I also learned the difference between Analysis and Judgement. Analysis Paralysis also made sense to me since I have experienced it personally. On a regular basis I also see developers under appreciate and disrespect Synthesis done by the upper management as well. Overall this was a really fascinating video to watch and learn from.
    </li><li>
      In this class we discussed about the video judgement applied to bloom's taxonomy. Analysing a problem going down several paths and making a judgement onwhat is the right path bcz we make that descison at the very begining. Making the most important desicion first and leave the least important to the leaves of the tree.Concerns about vendor propositons. In breakout session we discussed if delivery apps making commission on orders is ethical or not.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we had a discussion about our project then about the software engineering judgment and about the food delivery that about the software processing and how it helps, and discussing various things about this topic such as about its application and the brief description related to it. The last class was a nice one as the interesting class was discussed.
    </li><li>
      Well for this one I honestly thought it was interesting considering that these big companies is that there is no big accountability considering that they dont really get insetive to not do it. There just going to apoligize then come back and do the same time over and over again. I will say that the sad part is that i was put into a break room bymyself so i did not got to disscuse it with the other students
    </li><li>
      The most confusing thing from last meeting is in regards to Steve McConnell's “Stranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software Engineering Judgment” presentation. I understand the distinction he makes between analysis and judgment, but I struggle understanding how we can have good judgment without good analysis. What's confusing is how you can “choose the right branch” (judgment) without first looking at where the branch leads (analysis). I believe what he's getting at is it's more important to think about why something should be made (synthesis/creative thinking), rather than getting bogged down in how it's made.
    </li><li>
      The rise of service style applicationsThe current COVID-19 Pandemic has caused numerous business to shut down and catastrophic damage for all layers of the economy. Due to the pandemic itself, and especially during the initial stages where nation-wide lockdowns were imposed, people still strived to support restaurants. The advent of food delivery startup accelerated with the development of Uber Eats and Door Dash in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Due to their popularity it became quickly viable and provided the convenience to users to not order directly to the food shop. Allowing a sort of Amazon like marketplace complete with food...
    </li><li>
      I think the most important thing I learned from meeting 12 is the importance of variables (or factors) within really, any given subject material. The food delivery apps are a great example of this. I think most people would simply say that they are a blessing (especially during a pandemic) without giving it a second thought. But naturally, analysis of variables (preferably many) usually always reveal that arguments are not so black and white.
    </li><li>
      It was interesting to learn about the high cost of being on the food delivery apps. Obviously, being on a popular app is beneficial for a business but charging the business so much commission that they can't be profitable is not ideal. I agree that there should be a reasonable cap on the commission because restaurants will eventually have to raise their prices which will be detrimental to the consumers. The government should do more to help the restaurants that are struggling during this pandemic.
    </li><li>
      To be sure, in the context of the pandemic, food delivery apps have become a necessity, both for restaurants and consumers. However, the high fees charged by the delivery platform are constantly squeezing the restaurants and delivery workers. In fact, the delivery companies have monopolized the industry, and it is extremely unreasonable to charge 30% commission. Personally, I think the delivery platform should appropriately reduce the commission, otherwise, it will only lead to more restaurant closures, which will affect the deliverymen. At the same time, I think the government should step in and regulate these platforms more strictly.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we started discussing Delivery apps and how they are hurting restaurants. I had no idea that the mark up was so high for these apps and since its such a new development there isn't any restrictions yet put in place which there need to be. I did hear from a friend that the drives do make a lot of money, he was saying that a guy made 600 dollars on a single weekend.
    </li><li>
      The class on Thursday was an overview for the week and was a continuous to what we did in Tuesday class. The class began with the overview what of meeting responses.The only suggestion i would like to suggest is that it would be better to emphasize if the professor can mute chat and open it only at the time when he need to know opinion. Because, in the class the comments were very disruptive for me.
    </li><li>
      On last meeting, we discussed about food application, and I read two reports about how the food application affects restaurants profits and human behavior in society, due to the statistic surprisingly, restaurant did not gain more money as we thought, most of money was taken by food delivery apps, due to the pandemic, food application do get more profit, and people are more likely to use food app than before.
    </li><li>
      Regarding programs like skip the dishes or Uber eats, in a certain sense it is almost a necessary evil for convenience. While it is unfortunate that it does greatly cut into a restaurants earnings, dropping their margins per plate, the significantly increased traffic it can bring, especially during a pandemic, should outweigh the alternative of no orders. I know many people who would otherwise never order at any normal “sit in” restaurants around the city, but do skip the dishes fairly easily because of convenience, compared to going through a fast food drive through or just eating while at home.Similar...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about the how the food delivery app dominates the local resturants and take hefty 25% to 30% commision from there gross sales. we discussed how unethical is to take this much percentage during a pandemic when the resturants are struggling and we also discussed same in the break out room where we got prons about the delivery app that when in lockdown when resturant were getting no revenue, this apps help them to survive.
    </li><li>
      From last day we were discussing food-delivery apps, such as Door Dash and Skip the Dishes which engage in what can most charitably described as 'unethical business practices'. This can be said for much of the 'gig economy' -- they rely heavily on exploiting their workers and shortchanging the communities they purport to be helping. An important ruling happened in the UK which has big ramifications for gig workers, the ruling stated that Uber drivers should be classed as "workers" not self-employed -- which would mean they are owed minimum wage and holidays. https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/britain-rules-uber-drivers-employees-1.5919865Would be interesting to see a similar ruling...

      Being professional is not only a need but an asset, Computing professionals perform a variety of tasks: They write specifications for new computer systems, they design instruction pipelines for superscalar processors, they diag- nose timing anomalies in embedded systems, they test and validate software systems, they restructure the back-end databases of inventory there for security purposes professional rules need to be followed
    </li><li>
      I really enjoyed the discussion on value-based software engineering, especially the poll done where we discussed whether or not we should focus on 20% of fires if they cause 80% of property damage. Numbers are not always representative of harm caused, and breaking things down into statistics and figures isn't always the best way to determine what is morally correct. I remember in one of the STATS classes I took my prof talked about how easy it can be to lie with statistics, and how people analyzing them need to be incredibly careful about what those numbers mean. I think...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed how different food delivery companies charge so much for the delivery and that neither the user nor the driver is benefited from it. I think that they charge so much for the comfort they are providing to the customers and they know that even if they hike the prices people are still going to order for home delivery. 
    </li><li>
      I learnt about different aspect of technology
    </li><li>
      The two articles about the delivery apps really bring home the idea of regulation and laws. I find that big tech is allowed to get away with too much, these 30% commissions remind me of the recent news about Apple taking 30% commission from app store purchases. It is ridiculous, we live in an age of "anything is a tap away" some kind of terms have to be set for restaurants and these apps to coexist. I personally drove for Doordash in Vancouver and I can tell you it was a mess most nights. Things going wrong and parking illegally...

      We discussed many things in this meeting, we talk about the food delivery services which cause the small business to suffer a lot. As small food businesses are not registered into these online applications, they are bypassed from this. And those are registered they have their own earning, but apps are making lots of money with the taxes and delivery fees. We also discussed about the ACM software engineering judgement, that reveals the changes from the previous rule to new one from 1956 to 2001. Since evaluate should be prior step to take then create in pyramid concept of ACM....

      As far as my experience goes all the "free" stuff that is advertised is often not really free and is just a hook to get people to invest/spend their money into something. Even in several software ads they advertise how "cool" and useful that software is and that its "free" but as soon as you download and install it it takes you to a billing page where it says: "Just enter your credit card info - you won't be charged anything and will have a week of fre use" - which is an excellent strategy to take your money because...

      In the video "Stranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software Engineering Judgment with Steve McConnell" indicate 8 levels of being a programmer: Remember, Understand, Apply, Analysis, Create and Evolution. I think there are several required skills skills that being a programmer specifically : Be able to read code, Programming: requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, Release and maintenance, and be able to rebuild codes, optimizing the code without affecting any existing functions.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed about software engineering as why software related project are not working accurately. Moreover, a pole has been also done about the protect property values. Food delivery apps were also discussed a little bit. In breakout rooms, we discussed about the the household properties as why and how it should be made safe in future.
    </li><li>
      Regarding to the last meeting, I think I would like to know more on how applications like Skipthedishes, uber or amazon can become more ethical when it comes to their service. It seems that people/consumers/users are really just focused on the comfort of these services that ethical problems get overlooked. How can software improve to be more ethical along with being comfortable and usable? It seems like there is a lack of awareness when it comes to these things in the tech realm.
    </li><li>
      In these hard times, I appreciate the help provided by these delivery organizations. trying to run both the restaurant businesses and the country's cash flow. its better than nothing. according to me here nobody is wrong nor the business owner nor the delivery modes. this case is more of a lawful conditional than an ethical. both business should sit on the table and discuss about their requirements and allow governments to choose how things should be .
    </li><li>
      Projects always need to be organized and coordinated for the sake of the safety of people because safety has priority in the success of any project. The conclusion of this meeting was watching a video explaining the issued reports on the consequences of the software project. It determines how to use sound judgment in software engineering to significantly progress the understanding of software project dynamics, which in turn leads to correct failure judgement, more effective corrective actions for projects already underway, and greatly improved chances of success in each project.

      The last meeting was really interesting.
    </li><li>
      the main questions that i have from last meeting revolves arounds the idea of analysis paralysis. if it is so prevalent in the field to have it assigned and name there must be a root cause in the instruction of the field itself and if that is the case what is being done to attempt to fix this problem.
    </li><li>
      One thing that I learned in this meeting and it really surprised me was the fact how much commission these delivery apps take from from restaurants just because people use a few swipes and click from their app. I thinks it's very unfair to restaurant owners because they are the ones that shoulders all the cost from goods to electricity and water that are used in preparing the food but however at then end its these apps that gets all the benefits. I think we as a consumer should not let this happen because usually these apps are not from...
    </li><li>
      I enjoyed the discussion about the food delivery apps. I agree that there is not enough transparency in regards to how some of these services operate and collect revenue. I have used Skip the Dishes in the past, and was under the assumption that these types of services helped to promote more profits for local businesses. I enjoy when the classroom finds a rhythm and a discussion unfolds, the break out rooms lose me.
    </li><li>
      I found it interesting that services like skip the dishes, or door dash, were being considered "overpriced" for what they do. I can't understand how this could be a problem, when there is always the option for both consumers, and restaurants to just not participate in their business. The technology allows people to access takeout food from restaurants they may not have been able to get before, and I can only see this as being an increase in sales for restaurants. If the services really charged too much money, from restaurants or from consumers, the negatively affected groups would just...
    </li><li>
      In the previous meeting there was great discussion about the food delivering companies that how they are earning a lot by using their employees and not providing them proper benefits and their fixed salary. We discussed about "skip the dishes" and "Uber Eats" and these days everyone is enjoying this service but their employees are not getting enough pay for doing all this. Only these companies are getting benefited by earning the major share.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned from last meeting is that food delivery apps treat their employees poorly. The most difficult concept for me to understand were the ways we can make a difference in regards to the treatment of food delivery employees. It was also difficult to wrap my head around the idea that most people know it might not be the best to support companies like amazon and food delivery apps, but still do. Although they might treat their employees badly and be putting local businesses or restaurants out of business, the convenience, especially during a pandemic, among...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed about the food delivery companies and how they are ripping customers off. After reading those articles, I was shocked that how much of profits they take from restaurants and customers.
    </li><li>
      From this class i got to know about the software engineering judgment and about the food delivery .The major content was revolving around the food apps. Such as being in popular app is beneficial for a business but if there will be huge amount of commission pf another party than in other words there is no long run benefits for the companies. Before this class i was aware that delivery apps have their commission with the restaurant but was shocked to know that they are hurting restaurants in a big volume. The another thing is when the whole word is going...
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we talked a bit about judgment applied to Boom’s Taxonomy, the video was explaining about different between analysis and judgement. Then also discussed about the food delivery apps and the options. We talked about what was good or bad about delivery app such as skip the dishes, and is it really beneficial for a restaurant.
    </li><li>
      we discussed about the how the food delivery app dominates the local resturants and take commision from there gross sales we discussed how unethical it is to take this much percentage during the current situation when the resturants are struggling and we also discussed same in the break out room where we talked about the positive side of delivery app that helped whith the resturantsrevenue which helped them restaurents to survive.
    </li><li>
      The food delivery apps have undoubtedly greatly reduced the burden on people. After a tiring day, takeaway can save people the time to cook. Especially during the epidemic, food delivery can also effectively reduce the flow of people in restaurants and increase safety. But on the other hand, food delivery apps have become a tool for capital to exploit the people at the bottom. The takeaway company only provides a public platform, but it can get a lot of profits from it, even without paying anything. Food delivery apps companies can also easily obtain the user’s home address and personal...
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we discussed about the food delivery application such as skip doordash earning from the incomes of restaurant by taking commissions from them . It is completely unethical during this pandemic where all restaurants are struggling to manage their own life’s .
    </li><li>
      Food service applications including skip and doordash are taking commission from the restaurant as their earnings . This is not doing justice to the restaurant as they are struggling themselves in the covid situation.
    </li><li>
      Could you explain the Project proposal assignment and do we have to read "Four Core Influences" framework from his upcoming book, Software Engineering Essentials to understand published reports on software project outcomes. i ask cause it was referenced in the Stranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software Engineering Judgment with Steve McConnell we discussed in class.
    </li><li>
      In last thursday lecture, we discussed about an article which showed how restaurants and cafe's are barely surviving cause of heavy use of these delivery apps.
    </li><li>
      As we discussed in group about food delivery same way if we can discuss about software engineering judgement and value-based software engineering that would be great!Thank you.
    </li><li>
      ResponseIn the last meeting the professor show a news about food deliver to us .There exists a common objective for businesses which is profit realization. This is achieved by careful scrutiny of business environment to ensure smooth running. Prices of goods and services are dictated by the cost the service provider incurs in production. Relatively, restaurants have incurred an additional expense through delivery apps. Accreditation of power to extract the value of general customers is a critical challenge, this give the apps authority to control restaurants leading to low profits and losses for restaurant owners. I think I would also...
    </li><li>
      in meeting 12, we talked about some reasons why some software engineering products fail and changes and procedures that can be done/incorporated to avoid this.Also, we discussed how delivery networks such as uber eats, skip the dishes, etc. takes a high commission from the restaurants and this has been a major problem as it reduces their profit. But what if restaurants can have their own delivery networks, would that help?
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a discussion about project proposal which is going to due on 4th March. I am excited for a group project. I have curiosity about its discussion in next lecture.
    </li><li>
      It is intriguing that apps that provide services are killing their means of survival. As shown in the page discussing how delivery apps are damaging restaurants, similar things are happening with companies and their workers. While Amazon strives to be more efficient for their customers and make more money, workers in their factories are put under conditions that nobody should have to face. To me, it appears that our society is putting too much emphasis on the happiness of the consumer and not paying enough attention to the workers. There need to be more discussions about the behind-the-scenes ethics of growing...
    </li><li>
      In our 12th meeting we discussed about food delivery apps and how they charge so high and also about who gets the major share from that profit. There were also a discussion on two charts one was of 90's and the other one was new which tells us how to analyze first and then take right decision.
    </li><li>
      In this lecture, we discussed the group project which is going to be due on the 4th of March which we have to do on anything related to this course.We also discussed the video which was given last class and in the starting.We also discussed the ethics of the code of conduct. I am very interested in the group project.
    </li><li>
      From Steve McConnell's presentation, I learned about four core influencing factors. It helps us apply sound software engineering judgment to greatly enhance our understanding of the dynamics of software projects so that we can properly diagnose faults, take more effective corrective action on projects already in progress, and significantly improve every chance of success for that project.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, professor gave us a great news incorporating that a U of R alumni will be visiting us soon through zoom and he would enlighten about the MARS rover mission. We also talked about how facebook is influencing the democracy by allowing the political ads. Therefore, I suppose, the company is facing several lawsuits for pinching the code of ethics. I assume, they would still politicize the platform to generating staggering income. Several democracies are having a though to initiate some restrictions on facebook such as Australia, US, and many others.
    </li><li>
      Firstly, we have discussed about the difference between judgement and analysis and how engineers and programmers face difficulties while doing judgement and end up doing wrong analysis. Moreover, after further research i got to know how judgement can save time and help to analyze a situation for practical environments rather than just theoretical.Secondly, how the food delivery apps are literally robbing the money of small businesses and restaurants were shown. Now that I think of it I find it quite disturbing. The apps are just trying to take advantage of people's helplessness and charging extra. Furthermore, they are not paying...
    </li><li>
      The advertisements and the free stuff that we see is just to gather people's interest making them invest in it. Many software are shown as useful &amp; interesting and free to use, but it not the reality. When one enters the app only few days are given as free trial and your accounting info os asked before using it so that once trial is finished they can charge you. Also we discussed about govt helping people who lose their property to natural disaster and skip the dishes app was also discussed
    </li><li>
      The meeting had a valuable lesson for the computer professional to learn how to get the work tested beforehand. Professionals develop the code and never try to conduct an analyses to see if it works properly or not. This needs to be understood by the professionals so that they will not have trouble after the work is done. Complete analyses is required at the end for best results.
    </li><li>
      Found these links to be helpful for people confused about how to write the project proposal due on thursday:https://www.discussdesk.com/computer-science-research-proposal-writing-guide.htmhttps://www.csuchico.edu/csci/_assets/documents/thesis-proposal.pdf
    </li><li>
      Food delivery is best example of how can these company's are having a lack of ethics like the most of the food delivery company charge more to us for around $4 or even $5 dollars sometimes and other who do not charge more increases the price of food in menu compared to its actual price like if the food is of $9 then instead they would charge $12 for the same thing and state delivery is completely free which is not ethically right and on the other hand they do not even pay good to their delivery guys. So I...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed the food delivery apps like uber, door dash, skip the dishes, which are so popular among local people that local businesses like restaurants and other food courts are getting less profit. Mainly we talked about uber eats.
    </li><li>
      I think its very scummy for these food delivery services to take so much commission, it does ruin the appetite to think they do. I want to see the government do something about it and hopefully delivery gets improved in the future as its a fun thing todo. There is a lot of nights where my family is busy and we'd need something quick so we all can get back to work and having delivery helps out, although most of the time we go and pick it up ourselves but when there is no vehicle available, its great!
    </li><li>
      We discussed the video regarding software Engineering Judgment, which in my opinion was very interesting. We also learned about Bloom's Taxonomy and the difference between Analysis and Judgment. We also participated in a poll regarding protect property values. Furthermore, we also discussed about, food delivery companies and restaurants. How they use tactics to profit themselves without thinking about their customers.
    </li><li>
      In the food delivery app the numbers was a shock until I saw the articles and I think it is not best for the restaurants though as much but I think the exposure is also one of the factor that helped the restaurant in more sale it can be seen as long term investment for sure it will be properly implicated to the small vendor not for the established restaurents
    </li><li>
      We had a talk about food delivery apps. Since, COVID-19 is going on, people prefer less to dine in restaurants. I also use skip the dishes frequently. During this meeting, I discovered that food delivery apps charges restaurants a high fee, which is a problem.
    </li><li>
      We talked about how food delivery applications have been bringing about changes in our daily lives. One aspect I was concerned about is how little the delivery person gets paid regardless of how far they go to make the deliveries
    </li><li>
      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting:the most important topic learned in this meeting is about fallacies and the wrong way how the food delivery apps are leading to deploy of restaurants.the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:the concept that was hard to learn from last meeting was the sedation codewhat you would like to know more about:I would like to learn more about is how the apps and the technological apps are deploying the physical worldsomething you encountered that is related to the past meeting:something that was similar...
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we talked about food delivery apps which is having changes in our day to day life. I just think about that how much money is getting to the delivery person and how much they rode fir deliveries.
    </li><li>
      We talk in the class about the person who is here from NASA who will give a speech. I think we will learn many things from him and we will be motivated. I am looking forward to that speech. The other thing is about facebook is that same for all. No I don’t thing so, different people get different updates which let them be on facebook to waste their time for a while. We need to be aware of the consequences of using Facebook for a longer period of time.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about how food delivery apps have been affecting the economy. In my opinion skip and uber eats have been changing how the economy works. People don't have to depend ongoing on the restaurants anymore and if we look at the current situation the covid is a great opportunity to get all the restaurants back in business, and Uber and Skips have been giving so much employment to all the people who want to earn an extra buck. A lot of people I know have paid for their car.
    </li><li>
      Food Delivery sites such as Skip The Dishes, Door Dash, and much more are more favourable as compared to dine in the restaurants nowadays. The main reason behind this is the people found it more convenient to have any food on their door instead of going outside. Especially, in cold winter so many people use these apps or websites. There are also many benefits as well as the drawbacks of this. Benefits are that the individuals can have their favourite food in their home on the door step without waiting in the lines on the restaurants and going out of...
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about the project proposal and how skip and uber eats have impacted the economy. Technology has created a great way to create employment and the world would have been a different place without it. We as creators of these platforms to create more employments in times like covid
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed about delivery apps and about the software engineering judgment. Also about our coming project. it was really helpful meeting and also i have no idea before that
