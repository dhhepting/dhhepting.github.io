<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. Apparently it's minus 50 with wind chill today. I remember. When I was. Maybe it as an undergraduate or before going to. High School or public school. hearing on the radio in the morning, that exposed flesh would freeze and less than 30 seconds. I don't hear those kinds of warnings of anymore, although it certainly fit for a day like today. We also used to hear that. there's wind chill. To be minus 100. So now I realized that they changed the wind chill scale, so that they don't get. minus 100 values. And I would tell people that voted at minus 100 which when children that. They just wouldn't accept that minus 50 I guess that's more reasonable I. Sure, maybe first me get attendance kind of the way. My car wouldn't start this morning I started last night. should be good, at least until the morning. And then I had to spend. I spent a few minutes outside trying to get what I thought was the cover of the block heater receptacle. Because I didn't have to plug it in as a fairly new car. And plug it in before. So trying to figure out how to get the car plugged in. And then. Going back to the manual. So I was hoping to find. And an illustration of. How to operate cover or what I think is cover. And it's just some text about plugging it in and. More indication of whether you're skeptical is so. This is maybe like a Microsoft manual as well. So it's good to say that maybe. Maybe it's the Microsoft people who are writing the. The Ford manuals. Owners manuals. It just seems like. When I go to look for things in that book. it's not designed for me to find an answer it's. yeah. yeah the card on a blue screen of death, maybe in the future of the group, but dashboard of death. Considering that. Mercedes one to be to be talked about having me. screen. anyway. Think everything's. frozen here going slower in my computer's too close to the outside wall here. Somebody sent me a direct message you can. Go and select everyone again. there's the password in the chat. Simon ready for the break. I couldn't agree with you. A little bit. share my screen, I guess, I didn't. sorry about that. meeting today so 10 before the break. And then we'll be 16 afterwards so we're not. we're about 40% the way through. To 50. Almost. I didn't publish this. Time. I realized it. didn't get published. in a timely fashion so. I apologize for that. Anyone here, but so a few things I want to go through, and then. We can, some of you have referenced Kristen Harris videos. Has anyone seen him in a social dilemma. Okay. yeah. or. doing a reaction on your window would be fine too. Anyone. How many people have heard about. i'm not a cat. said enough to give you the.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;story.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Apparently, is taken over the Internet, over the past. Two days ago, I think.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Love about that video to is in the top left corner, is the warning saying it's illegal to record it but somebody couldn't miss the opportunity to record.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah risking six months jail time.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;contents like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Anyway, it's a short video so i'm gonna. i'm gonna play it, so this is the link to CBC kids news I thought that was interesting. Some some news is there's a fit for kids to watch.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I just saw this.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Apparently us using the system's 10 year old. laptop. Now it seems to be zoom. i'm not aware of any zoom clients have kitty filters available. Have any have you gotten. A CAP filter. For zoom. Anyway, here is the video. had indicated, maybe the theme, the theme for today could be brand new problems question mark. server and was very happy, this is a light moment to share. Their wisdom Nice that it could be shared so quickly. And there's nothing. it's not anyone's expense. That we get from this. fact that we can. We can share things so quickly. In the modern days. Is that a brand new problem or. well. it's not. A brand new problem in. maliciously but it's a brand new opportunity as well, I guess. that's. that's part of the. CT use the catchphrase for the course that's part of the risk and reward of living in the information society, these days. rewards. To carry it on that theme is that we can. The tool, the tools that we use are very flexible. in the sense that we can decide what what to do and. We can take an active role in designing things. meet our needs and our situations you don't have to. Look, for off the shelf systems. We don't have to do things the way that. The software. The software indicates, it should be done so. So, first of all responses to meetings. engagement with meetings. what's on the screen now is. Is a summary. Of the comments or the. Responses I received from from you in. The engagement of meeting forum for meeting. eight. But there's a great variability in their responses and getting. In terms of length and contents of some. You know i've talked about, not so much a summary as. A key key points. This is what i've written here. that's what I reference for in the last question so response to the most recent meeting that can include one or more, the following. The most important thing you learned from the meeting the concept from the past meeting that was most difficult for you understand what you would like to know more about. something you encountered that is related to the past meeting. Is that. Could this description being more clear. Would it be better to say. pick one of these. because some of the. Lessons responses for the meeting eight went up to about five or 600 words. So I haven't when I included the responses to pass meetings in. The page here. or here I didn't do everything exactly. I didn't quote everything. But with 100 and some people in the class is this list. This helpful, or should it be. summarize further. Having. 100 words for the response. That helps to clarify things.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yeah i'd be fine with that I think the only issue i'm having is there any way, we could get some sort of a feedback for the responses, because i'm not really sure if it's exactly what you want, or not, if that makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so. When i'm grading them. I can only great with a mark I can't leave a comment with him. So I would say what I would like is one of these things.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Well it's most important, like most of the chat agrees with 140 character word count or something like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah okay 140 characters. And it's more more substantially reduced than I would like so it's like reading a tweet about the meeting. 140 words is maybe a bit longer. So here's a bit of trivia do you know how. The link I think tech an. SMS message length is 160 characters. Anyone know how that link was determined. Is that they're.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;paying for the towers, or something like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Was the story, I heard was that the fellow who designed, it was he looked at a collection of postcards and he kind of the letters were in the postcard messages. And he decided that hundred and 60 was. He founded 160 years ago about the average. So I looked at the length of the. Responses to meeting eight and I noticed that they were. The median was about 100. So I thought that might be. A good length.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I feel it was inspired by the. SMS thing the more than 140 characters would split into two different SMS is so they just kept kept it so that it wouldn't split them into two.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I think the SMS is 160 isn't it twitter's 140 or was 140. To begin with. So they can't 20 characters for their own. own housekeeping so on so forth. yeah you can have more than one message put together, but I guess it's the question of. what's a reasonable amount what's the reasonable size for a unit, so that you don't have to. break them into more than one. here. Waiting for me. Okay. To look at the history of. These different standards and just to understand. relates to that quote we looked at from Steve Jobs, you know when you realize that. Everything that around around us was designed by people who were no smarter than us. You know, then we can change things so. pattern 60 characters was. nobody's walking around with their phone. They might be talking to my son and video chat. I get motion sickness to talk to him because he's always moving around. anyway. i'll put a word count limit on the. Okay, so we're counted as one thing we can do. And what about the instructions here. So that's one thing to consider, then we show you what i've. done here with. The transcript that I posted in on to your courses in the vtt file. So here, I have. So what I did was I consolidated I took out the timestamps. And I changed people's. Names I gave them identifiers. So when a student one. Until those names are this is to replace the names to protect the innocent. And, here is my identifier D H h. And what I did was I. took all the messages and into the block. I can can say that all messages from the same speaker. In a row so. So there's a different speaker here. stops and then I start again, this is actually me, but it was identified as me. Better. So when I was thinking of. summarizing the transcript. just going through the vtt file. Was was. very tedious so this way. It makes a little more. reasonable to read. So. Unless the audio I didn't do the the chat transcript, but I could do the chat transcript in the same way. Just provided as a standalone not trying to synchronize it with. The timestamps. So maybe maybe the audio and the chat transcripts are. interesting and useful to have. on their own, and then I can. Take this and make the summary out of it. So what i'm going to suggest is that we have. breakout rooms. To discuss. pretend minutes and then we'll come back together and talk about things. That seem all right is that. Clear. Well we're supposed to discuss. The way things are set up. So we have not, this is from the chat so we haven't. talked about a minimum well minimum would be zero I guess. Your words you wouldn't have to do them. Over time, but having a maximum of 100 words. And we can so. Okay, so TIM. I don't know i'm not sure.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Then.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Because there were have the ability to be flexible in the class in the design of the class. And we have these different things available to us. and want to make sure I want to do my best to make sure that we're. valuing your feedback about. The way things are going the way things are being. Here we're using this technology. And the information that we have and the opportunities. With the web and so forth, and audio transcripts and. so on and so forth, to. make this the best. make the best use them to support our. Efforts to think critically about computing. So that's the reason why taking 10 Minutes it. Has a 40% mark. Of the class meetings. anyway. So i'd like you. In your groups to think about. What could be improved or clarified about what i'm asking you to do for engagement. To reading your responses to the meetings. And then. All the records are all the things are laid out on the meetings page. This is a summary of responses, a good. thing to do, I kind of have an. meeting a. summary of responses. And the summary of what was discussed in the outline. and so on and so forth, I guess. what's there that's not. working for you and what's not there, that would be nice to have. Okay, anyway. Here we go. 10 minutes turn now we'll get the act together.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;hi Professor. I was in breakout room 11 but I had to change my privacy settings to use my microphone so you can can you throw me back in that room.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;sure.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Jennifer Jennifer. Jennifer okay. Coming back. Any. New thoughts to share, about. About. Engagement the responses to the engagement for meetings. engagement with meetings.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So i'm happy with them that seems clear to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I think our group is pretty unanimous and the fact that you've gone above and beyond honestly in making this class accessible, I feel like you've done so much work and. It doesn't you know, like I think it's it's all great.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;One thing make it easier for you um and it might also be more helpful for us is, if you just for instead of summarizing all the different responses. That seems like a lot of effort for you, I think what might be a better idea is just choose a favorites response that you wanted to highlight and us to think about and just posted anonymously and choose that one we can read, one for each class sort of thing.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe I can it's fairly straightforward to do the. Do the list of them. So I can I can do, the list of them. And then just we'll just talk about one of them. So okay. In the chat there's a comment about having more about hdi design concepts. This isn't really the hdi class where we talk more about that, which is 428. But the same time we're going to talk a bit more about. hdi stuff. In terms of empathy and. So on so we'll do a bit more. But if you're interested in hdi then i'd encourage you to look at 428 so well. Okay. Anything else.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Could you maybe just expand on like where we're at in the Semester like where we're how far into the textbook we should be and. Like 40% so is that, like. chapters like 124 chapters 123.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we're not falling. Reference book so closely. From 2008. feels like a long time ago now. I wouldn't want to do that. Say we're looking at the social context. And some hdi concepts. yeah so it's not required for the textbook but I gave you a link to the blown to bits book. A reference. So I understood the question anyway. The topics in this in the calendar description. we're going to be guided by current events as well. and see where our discussion takes us. But the idea is to touch on these different things. Captain crunch. So. We can talk about what the exam is going to look like. Okay. Just reading the comment about. That Captain crunch. A few. A few meetings ago I had a link from. CBC ideas about. The philosophy of science, Professor who is talking about. trust. You know, so it says it's not even. That we debate things. In society with debating. strenuously and passionately. That, at some point in time. When people are at the point of saying okay. Well, I don't accept your your your set of facts i'm going to leave my own set of facts. and continue on so at that point that's where were the real problems so i'm I want to be careful about. Saying everyone's personal opinions and so on. TV. there's a connection. So you can have personal opinion that supported by facts Mitch. agreed upon facts situation. You can have opinions, based on. fabrications which are. Not agreed upon his fact. So then it's about how do we make. How do we make arguments about that. and What are what are some pitfalls of logical arguments. That you might get into and then is it. Is it is our only job to analyze the information we have, or do we have to apply judgment as well. take on those things right after the break. So. was done last last offering is last winter. For the final exam was to. was to have a blog kind of post. kind of blog style at SA. an essay like the take home question like the blog entries. That was. So I had a few topics and people will get them around them, and they have a certain amount of time to write about them. So that that seemed to work. As. A file is an exam format. As a kind of an extended exam format. That would. strike a happy medium, I think, between scheduling a particular exam at a particular time. anyway. So we can continue to discuss that. Alright, thanks for your replies we're out of time today. right on the nose I guess. So I have an office hour today at 233 30. Right. now know from three surgeries. You know, when I have and it's on the website i'll be there. And if i'm not there it's rated to. Start i'll be there right away. Okay anything else so. And i'll. wish everyone a great break and. Stay warm and stay well and. we'll see you on the 23rd. Okay. bye everyone.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Well, thanks, very much have a good break.

    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;yeh, people are also making tiktok on this
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Im just not going to leave the house for 3 months
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;My friend is smashing a brittle cold banana peel every day in his car
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;problem solved
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I watched the movie The Ice Storm and when the flag froze I was like, hey I live there!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I am very grateful for my garage

    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Please, put another micron of plutonium in the fire...
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;yes sir
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;We've mostly separated church from state, now we need social media to do the same!
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;oh the lawyer!
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;lol heard that
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Interesting metaphor @Shareef
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;oh that was funny
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;thanks, hopefully we can work out the kinks
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;next time I'll choose a golden retriever as my lawyer
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;heard that they are good boys
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, lawyers
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;There was this deep fake rolling around last year where people used Elon Musk's face and I tried that with my meeting with university for coop term
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;"Stop hissing at my witness!"
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Fun times let me tell you
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;There was this one video going around where a person used pre-recorded video of himself on a zoom meeting and others didn't realize it was pre-recorded
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;the lawyer put his secretary under the bus however &gt;:(
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Just own up to it my guy
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_Efy9iiQJM&amp;feature=emb_title
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Check this out
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;feels too fake tho
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;like wax figure is talking
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah it was not perfect but fun little thing
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;wait, that was you!
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;No lol
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Panth is next elon
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Hahahah I wish
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;The Canadian Hacksmith guy is the next elon for me
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I personally find it clear
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I do as well.
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I think it’s clear as well
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it is pretty clear
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes I find it difficult to think of something to write in the engagement
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe just added a recommended word count for those who dont attend the lecture
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I'm a philosophy minor so sorry if my musings are long, it's just who I am as a person.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;These all look like solid topics for the blog. Thanks for posting this.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;That's less than a tweet!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;jk
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;A clarified word count would be good
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I like that. Make it 140 characters, to force only the most important concepts. Just like a tweet
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;"Me, We" Mohammad Ali best philosopher fight me
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Id be good with keeping it short too
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I'm fine with short but that seems really short
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Given I've never bothered with twitter so I may just not be used to it
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;what should be the length of blog1?
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;900 words
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;likely has to do with bits
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Something like the size that gets piunged to the tower?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;omg lol wow
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Because it used to be 140, but when they switched to 7-bit encoding were able to squeeze in an extra 20 chars in the same 140 bytes
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I wrote 2 paragraphs lol, my bad
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;160 chars * 7 bits = 1120. 140*8 = 1120
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;so how much should we write for engagements
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;SMS is 160 chars, but uses 140 bytes
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;reddit is 40,000
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;reddit it is
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Twitter is now 280 chars
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;as of current*
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Im good with an 8 character response
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/02/twitter-creator.html
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;cat?
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;can we see the cat please
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I see your cat decides class time is the time to sing the song of its people as well
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;hahaha has someone got a cat audio filter on or is that a legit cat
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Cat requires snack
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;hahaha
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;hahahha
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;we are about to get lawyered by the cat
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;that sounds like a cat-astrophy
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;does he have a cat as well?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;min or max limit?
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;max
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Seems like a good way to do it while keeping privacy standards :)
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Very awesome! :)
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, what are we discussing?
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Can someone please tell me what is min and max limit for engagements?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;ok

    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Good job Preet, you just enabled late behaviour
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;is our blog entry suppose to be in html? like is it suppose to be put on a site?
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;Blog requirements are all on his webiste
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;Rubric, word count, everything
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;yea I noticed that
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I’m not sure why students are being the gatekeepers for other students being early or late
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;it is annoying in the chat
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Agreed
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds like a you problem Shareef
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;but it just seems strange because cs215 isn't a requirement
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;nvm ill figure it out
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;My group had some responses towards increasing the emphasis on HCI/ Design concepts if possible. I think ethics on technology is really cool and the way we conduct class is great, but I'd also like to explore design or UI/UX.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;It says no textbook required for this course
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;The course descriptions also mentions cybercrime and intellectual property theft etc. Is this gonna be upcoming topics
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;the captain crunch whistle hack was so cool IMO
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;From the point of view of the exams, I feel like what we've been doing so far is just debating different points of view about a topic and how we all feel about it personally and not following a specific objective direction. So I am wondering if the exams are gonna be the same or something different?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;early internet days people could hack into the phone line with a certain frecuncy
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;the whistle came from a cereal box and the guy had free phone calling
