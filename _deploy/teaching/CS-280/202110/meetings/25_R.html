      Todays meeting,we had two guest speakers: Trevor Mcdonal and Rick Lee. They are both from SaskTelcompany. Trevor is the manager of SaskTel IT department. He was giving us work descriptionof his department. Then he provided us some valuable info about what qualities companyusually look for when hire someone new. In his opinion the resume should bewell organized, not too wordy, and be specific with skills. He also talkedabout the code of Ethics that his company follow. public interest, avoid conflictand interest, take professional responsibility, contribute to the it,professional to the co workers are the key code of ethics that his...

      I am not completely sold on the IT world. I honestly neverconsidered it when I enrolled in Computer Science. Talking about resumes andjobs is depressing, is that all we have to look forward to after University? Idid find the topic about cybersecurity to be interesting. I would like to see aclass that centers around these topics and goes into detail about how it wasdone, followed by a discussion of the aftermath.
    </li><li>
      The topic we discussed today that I would like to know more about isthe cybersecurity section of the IT field.  Specifically, I wouldlike to know more about what it is like working in the cybersecurityindustry.  I have never considered working in cybersecurity before,but after our discussion today about cybersecurity attacks(specifically, the SolarWinds attack), I think it sounds like a veryexciting sub-field of IT.  
    </li><li>
      In our 25thmeeting we discussed cybersecurity, the CIPS certificate and resume building.We spent some time discussing how a resume must be concise and be only 1-3pages long for companies to hire people. Most of the class was letting acybersecurity expert discuss the recent SolarWinds company attack. One of themajor aspects of how 1000 attackers were able to steal and illegally sell companyand government information include tricking SolarWinds users into fraudulent softwareupdates. The next steps for the hackers were staying dormant for 2 weeks toavoid detection and launching various new malicious programs that no currentvirus defender, firewall, 2 factor authentications and...
    </li><li>
      this meeting was very interesting, i get to know more things from Rick Lee from Sasktel. I got so much to learn from the presentation that Rick lee gave today in this lecture. The most important and interesting part about today's meeting is to customize the resume as per the job requirements.
    </li><li>
      &nbsp;we had two special guests from the SaskTel.&nbsp; In tonight meeting i got answer to one of the curious question which is how long should be the resume. Because most of the time people believe that resume is supposed to be of only single sheet and the another point which was made in the class which is a tip for all the student that don't be so choosy for your first job take it as a opportunity to establish your self because It sector is so vast.&nbsp; Mr. lee discussed about&nbsp; Sunburst breach discovery by FireEye. My favorite tale was...
    </li><li>
      Thank you very much for organising today's discussion session. It was great to hear and learn what are the things going on in terms of cyber crimes. Also wanted to add one more thing from my previous response. Please, if possible add a page on ur courses saying the pattern of the final exam. Thank you.
    </li><li>
      I found Rick Lee's presentation on the solarwinds attack interesting and further highlights the importance of cybersecurity in today's information age. I think there was a nod to the E-Health attack in the presentation (indirectly, that is, I think anyways). Trevor McDonald also had some interesting pointers on resume building and getting into the job market following graduation, which I found helpful, I am sure many other students did as well.
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about different types of hacks that have happened the Solar Winds one was very interesting how it was accomplished. Black Berry had discovered one the lynx server OS that had been exploited by, they believe, the Chinese government. I recently read about how the RTX 3090 is supposed to be very powerful in brute force password cracks. AMD also released a statement saying their ryzen gen 5 processors were able to be exploited by a specter like attack. Hearing more about different kinds of hacks that have happen would be a very interesting area...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we were joined by executives of CIPS who gave us some nice tips on how to apply for jobs and what to expect when looking for jobs in the industry after graduation. The idea was that resume is the first piece of work that we as a potential employee submit to the organization. They then moved on to discuss the very large and impactful cyber incident from last year related to SolarWinds. They discussed the potential threat actors, impact and enormity of the attack.
    </li><li>
      This presentation was very eye-opening to how I could be exposed to malware on the internet. I see how high-profile companies that rely on online systems to operate would need serious security, because a malware attack like the ones presented about could ruin their entire organization.
    </li><li>
      The most interesting thing about today's lecture was how even big companies try to clone their work from other companies and it can lead to legal action. Also it can take long to determine while the plagiarism was happened or was its just by chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we had 2 guest speakers from SaskTel. Rick Lee and&nbsp; Trevor Mcdonald were IT professionals in the field for more than 25 years. They presented a lecture on the SUNSPOT which was a supply chain attack on the malware. The attacker tries to get in touch with the source code and add malware to it, and the company who is launching an app will just see this as an update because it is unaware of the infections malware and hence it can affect a lot more people as it is used by so many people depending...
    </li><li>
      April 12th 2021Shrey Shah200377176CS 280&nbsp;We had the wonderful opportunity to listento guests from SaskTel Digital Forensics group. It was really cool to learnabout the multinational Solar Winds data breach. I think adding in more topicsabout security is very relevant to this class as there are a lot ofintersections between security and ethics in technology.
    </li><li>
      5G is being used more and more widely, but Saskatchewan has been slow to build 5G. I think maybe in the future we will be able to use 5G in Saskatchewan. This technology has gotten a lot of attention, and even caused political disputes in some sense, but the spread of new technology is often for the benefit of people, and I look forward to the day when 5G is used in Saskatchewan
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we talked with two guest speakers who were from SaskTel. Trevor Mcdonald and Rick Lee the ones working in the field of Information &amp; Technology for over 25 years. They gave us a presentation on the topic of SUNSPOT which was basically a chain/branch of supply for fighting against malware attacks. Basically, the one trying to attack the software would try adding malware to the source code. Hence, when starting the app, it would ask to update and spread the virus and eventually would cause trouble to many individuals.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      Reflecting back on the SaskTel guest speakers that we had there was one big thing that stood out to me was the fact that the one guest said that they specifically looked for special accreditation, such as CIPS. Specifically it was sought after due to the fact that CIPS accredited computer professionals have to honour the CIPS code of ethics. Which is very interesting, as it ensures that us as computer professionals are programming and applying our computer knowledge professionally and ethically, while for the business we work for (if one isn't self-employed) has the peace of mind that its...
    </li><li>
      In my most recent class, I had a great time learning new stuff from&nbsp;well-known&nbsp;experts.&nbsp;The talk was absolutely fascinating to me.&nbsp;Personally, I&nbsp;thought&nbsp;the&nbsp;presentations&nbsp;were really appealing, and they&nbsp;greatly&nbsp;helped&nbsp;in&nbsp;developing&nbsp;a coherent understanding.&nbsp;I&nbsp;like&nbsp;the&nbsp;idea&nbsp;of these informative lectures because they&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;us&nbsp;students&nbsp;consider&nbsp;the&nbsp;many&nbsp;options available to us so that we can&nbsp;make&nbsp;rational decisions.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we had two new hosts. They delivered their knowledge about CIPS and also about their own experiences that how they started their job after studying computer science and how gets promoted to higher positions.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we have guest name Rick Lee who came to give information about windows management instrumentation and cyberattack and more. We all learn and understand about it in whole lecture and in last 10 to 15 minutes some students ask questions regarding their doubts or trying to know something more on it. At last we thank him for&nbsp; gave some information and knowledge about it and we learn some new things also.so, thanks to our professor for inviting him and providing us some new information.
    </li><li>
      I found the presentation to be quite alarming, especially given how long it took for such a major security breach to be detected (the process took ~9 months!) The hackers were able to get into some very important systems. What gets me is that there is no one who is really at fault for letting this slip by. The hackers were just really good. It makes me wonder if other such cloud platforms are compromised , but we just don't know it yet.
    </li><li>
      The last meeting was one of the most interesting meetings of the semester. The whole session was so engaging, interesting, and knowledgeable. I liked how they had visuals in their presentation which was eye-catching. I wish we had more meetings like that but nevertheless cheers to Dr. Hepting for arranging such a session, thank you very much!
    </li><li>
      I loved the presentation by Rick Lee. It was very detailed and I learned a great deal about the solarwinds cyber attack. I learned that cyber attacks can be very sophisticated and can have huge impacts. The techniques used by the attackers in Solarwinds attack was interesting. I learned about the Attack Life Cycle and many more things. Very fascinating presentation.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, the discussion was really worth to attend , as I got to know a lot of knew things. we had two guest speakers, discussed about the the opportunities for job seekers as how to build a strong resume and the expectations of the HR team from a individual.and the second discussion discussion was on the topic of SolarWinds. A proper Agenda was shown to find out how we used SolarWinds. overall, it is always pleasant to have a guest personality to share their experience and knowledge with learners.
    </li><li>
      In the last gathering, the conversation was quit different and interesting, as I became acquainted with a great deal of knew things. we had two visitor speakers, examined about the chances for work searchers as how to assemble a solid resume and the assumptions for the recruiters&nbsp; from a person applied for the opportunity.&nbsp;furthermore, the second conversation was on the subject of SolarWinds. An appropriate Agenda was appeared to discover how we utilized SolarWinds , who are the suspects, victims of the attack and many more. it was a totally new topic for me to know , hence worth to...
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, wehad two guests’ speakers from SaskTel 'Trevor McDonald' and 'Rick Lee'. Theytalked about their job current job roles and what their study background andhow long they have been in the position they are currently in. Trevor also talkedabout the resumes and how resume needs to clean and organized. After that, Ricktook over and talked about the solar winds in which he disused about the wholescenario how the solar wind attack happens and what type of malware was usedand who was the victims and suspects, its life cycle, and post breach activities. After that, we had a...
    </li><li>
      Talking about resumes,&nbsp; I have worked few part time jobs, and most consideration I have gotten , have been from my short detailed&nbsp; resume rather than the long one. The resume should&nbsp; have&nbsp; neccessary&nbsp; details but not long enough to whoever wants to goes through them.
    </li><li>
      The class was about the solar winds IT Software Management explained by the two SaskTel employees. They also explained the hacks that happened, the advantages of the software, and also how it works. There was also discussion about how things work when the software is used and what happens exactly. They also discussed how the student's resumes can be perfect.
    </li><li>
      We all learned many new things in thismeeting, it was a great interview with Sasktel officers. They make us knowabout things like real cyberattack by suspected Russian organization. They talkabout how the privacy and security were compromised during the breach. The U.Sfederal departments and many other international companies like Microsoft, SolarWindand other were under attack. So, we learned that it disrupted whole system ofIT industries.
    </li><li>
      it was very interesting lecture. there was two guests from the SaskTel. Lots of things I learned from the meeting. also, we discussed little bit about project proposal.
    </li><li>
      Today meeting 25, there is a sasktel guest came and talk. I have no question to ask for this meeting. It was great
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned at last meeting was to always be critical of products. It is important to know where they are coming from, why they were created, what they do, and potential problems and worries. It was hard for me to understand exactly some of the aspects of the 2 cyber security cameras and how the public good. I want to learn more about objects that I take for granted like security cameras, understand the need or or issues with them, and be more critical.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      The last class was about cyber attacks and their effects both politically and economically.&nbsp;case studycompany: SolarWindssoftware: Orionmalware and foreign DLLs: sunburst, teardrop, raindrop, supernova, sun shuttle, gold max, sibot, and gold findermission:-breaching email accounts-getting into the cloud attempts-the stealing of red team tools from fire eyeloss: $25 million&nbsp;things to learn from the incident:-how important is the security field for any company-work with ethics; unethical usage of technology/resources can affect so many lives-take personal credentials and privacy on the internet seriously-keep away from malicious content
    </li><li>
      Having the presenters from SaskTel in class was very interesting. Getting to learn about the cyber attack was very cool and it peaked my interest about possibly choosing a career in cyber security.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      We got the opportunity to listen to guest from sasktel who also are a management team of CIPS. They let us know what an employer look into new developer when they want to hire and how we need to improve ourselves everyday and learn. Then there was a presentation on solar storms which was inturn internet hacking and it was extremely interesting. It should how less secure we are in virtual world.
    </li><li>
      Last class, we invite two guests from Sasktel.&nbsp;In this class, they discussed cybercrime.&nbsp;The economic losses caused by cybercrime are countless. How to effectively avoid cybercrime is also one of the most important issues in the computer field.&nbsp;The new encryption system and security system are very important.&nbsp;These are the areas that the computer science community needs to focus on in the future.&nbsp;There is no completely secure system, but frequent updates of security software can greatly reduce the probability of being hacked。
    </li><li>
      In last Meeting we had a guest lecturer from Sasktel. One lectures gave us tips upon improving the resume and another lecturer Rick lee gave us a presentation on Cyber security, in which he discussed about Solar Winds Orion system whose system was attacked by hackers and data of the clients were compromised, this company had a clients like Department of homeland security and Treasury department and this attacked came into light much later.
    </li><li>
      &nbsp;Speaking about resumes as well as tasks is disappointing, I didn't expect this from IT industry. This is something we have to look for after graduating. I did find the subject regarding Data science to be intriguing. I would love to attend&nbsp;courses that teaches more about it
    </li><li>
      One of our guest speakers mentioned that CIPS membership signified ethical conduct to them, as an employer. I was somewhat surprised by the extent of his trust in that designation - from what we've been told, members aren't tested on ethics, they just have to affirm that they will follow the code. This may work legally, but logically, does this really hold up? In an age when every computer user has learned to click "yes" on various user agreements without even reading what they're agreeing to, taking a user affirmation as proof of ethics knowledge and ethical conduct seems risky....
    </li><li>
      It was really good and I would like to appreciate your effort for bringing the guests from Sasktel who explained us what employer think before hiring what they need from us and how to apply. Moreover we learnt how unsecure it is that even someone can hack us while we are upgrading our software
    </li><li>
      In last meeting,&nbsp; We learned about the solar Wind Orion Breach. We learned that Russia was a suspect. Solar Winds contains all admin passwords. All Us business and government institution rely on this. We learned of the different types of attacks. It surprised me that Solar Winds server password was solarwind123.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we had guest speakers from SaskTel. They gave a presentation about the SolarWinds Supply Chain Cyber-Attack. Even though the presentation was good, I felt that we should have done this earlier in the semester. The last few lectures should've been used to clarify the doubts students had about the course contents and the final exam. However, having said that, the presentation did cover a number of topics relevant to the course. The guest also invited us to a tour of the SaskTel data-center in the city, and if this was done earlier in the lecture, we could...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we had guests from SaskTel talk to us about the solar wind breach that happened last year. We were provided with the details on how this breach took place who was behind it and what loss did it do to the companies affected by it. It was a great talk. Thank you professor for bringing such guests to the class.
    </li><li>
      I feel like you've really listened to me this semester. once again those guys were grate guest speakers and I learnt a lot from them for example proper way to build resumes, more about the CIPS program and so on. I was wondering how long we would have to do and submit the final exam ?.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we had the opportunity to meet with two guest speakers from SaskTel, Rick Lee and Trevor McDonald who are IT professionals in the field for&nbsp;more than 25 years. They presented a lecture on the SUNSPOT which was attacked by implementing the malware in the system. The attacker tried to get in touch with the source code&nbsp;and add malware to it, and the company who was going to launch an app will just see it as an update because they were not aware of the malware attack.
    </li><li>
      We had an excellent meeting on the Solarwinds hack; today, we have digital forensic experts, we still have espionage and other cyber threat. Recently, we have espionage that is on Solarwinds company which is responsible for many things. It believed the Russian did it because of the similar tools they have to perform the espionage. So, Fireeye on Russia. Sunburst is the file name, and through it, it is the central part of this malware.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was about cyber attacks and cyber security. It was interesting to learn about the Russian cyber attacks on the Solar Winds data base. This presentation gave me some perspective on how valuable data bases are. I'd like to learn more about the advancement in cyber security and what the current threats are.
    </li><li>
      It was really an interesting and educative session with the IT Professionals from Sasktel&nbsp;Thank you prof for creating this awesome opportunity for us to have these professionals in our midst.I really learn a lot because my main interest in the field of information technology is in the aspect of Privacy and security.It was a great session for me in the sense that I was able to understand some of the fundamentals of how security can be bridged and ways to prevent thefts from invading into our network.I wished I could have more of this session&nbsp;Hopefully if we can have the...
    </li><li>
      It was good to learn about real world examples of where keeping security in mind while developing is of key importance, as well as some of the methods we have to be aware of. Often we are taught to "keep security in mind" but short of learning how to check for SQL injection at this point we haven't really learned how these things are executed. It also goes to show that even these massive companies can have the same issues, so no one is safe from attack.
    </li><li>
      The talk about data security reminded me about a website called https://haveibeenpwned.com/ which checks if your email has been compromised by a data breach. It is important to always keep an eye out for possible suspicious behavior from your account and always be acting securely online (such as changing passwords on the regular). This website is another tool that we can use to stay secure and hopefully minimize the damages that data breaches can cause (as data breaches are sometimes not relayed back to the people affected which of course is dangerous and careless). 
    </li><li>
      In last class we talked about Sunspots with two guest lecturers Rick Lee and Trevor McDonald form SaskTel.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In the last class we had two guest speakers, one was from sasktel and he talked about resume and jobs. The other was from CIPS and he mostly talked about hackers. The most important thing I learned from the class is when applying to jobs, we should try to not make our resumes longer than 3 pages.
    </li><li>
      I think we had one of-the most interesting lecture of the semester where we had two guest-speakers from SaskTel and one talked about SolarWinds-case where an Espionage which believed was from Russia against US that took last year and affected big tech-companies like Microsoft, Intel and many government-branches such as military and homeland security. It was interesting because it was first time I hard such a deep discussion about Espionage and how it takes place and I was surprised by how much planning and effort was put into it. On the other hand it was kind of scary because usually...
    </li><li>
      Trevor MacDonald and Rick Lee, two highly qualified IT experts, hosted my last lecture. They disclosed information about a malware supply chain attack. Seeing two IT students succeed instills trust in our CS students.
    </li><li>
      In my last lecture, two well IT professionals, named Trevor MacDonald and Rick Lee were the host of the meeting.&nbsp;They gave information about supply chain attack on malware.&nbsp;Following their presentation, they became an inspiration to me.
    </li><li>
      The guest speaker was very informative. The topic about cyber warfare is definitely an interesting one. It is quite interesting that people can infiltrate large networks and stay undetected gathering information for long periods of time. The fact that every country does this kind of act, and it is done by governments is disturbing. It would be great if the world could share resources and information, then there wouldn't be a necessity for these kinds of attacks.
    </li><li>
      Meeting 25 was great and I got a lot of information about the work environment and also about hacking which was very good. Thank you, Dr. Hepting, for the insight and for inviting such great persons.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 25, we have a guest from&nbsp;SaskTel, who talks about the benefits and needs that SaskTel can bring to students.SaskTel provides wired and wireless communication services, which can better bring convenience to people's lives.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture our guest speaker Mr. Trevor McDonald from Sasktel told us about how to write a resume and what are the qualities that should be mentioned in the our resume. It was really nice informative talk about the job applications. Another guest speaker Mr. Lee who i guess was in technical department talked about cyber security and gave us a detail presentation on SolarWinds Orion. Overall I really enjoyed the presentation and lecture
    </li><li>
      In this lecture we had 2 guest speakers from SAKSTEL named Rick Lee and Trevor Mcdonald who were IT professional. They gave details on SUNSPOT which was a supply chain attack
    </li><li>
      Name: Yiming Zhang StuID: 200404814In this lesson, we discussed the issue of cyberattacks, specifically about cyberattack and hitting other breaches.We listened to the speech, which put forward a large number of network attack cases, which has become the focus of the focus of network information security.How to maintain good network security has become a hot discussion in the class.Many students put forward their own understanding of the network attack behavior and phenomenon.In the speech, related problems and phenomena were discussed in depth, and the future and solutions were analyzed.
    </li><li>
      Last meeting was so interesting and amazing. Mr Trevor McDonald &nbsp;from SaskTel told us and guide us about how to make the resume and resume should not be more than 3 pages and, he also mentioned that what qualities we have to put in out resume. We also talked to Mr. Lee who is I guess from technical department he gave presentation on the Solar winds and also talked about cyber security as well and over all I really enjoyed the presentation.
    </li><li>
      Many data breaches are often the work of hackers. However, in my opinion,as a hacker, morality is fundamental, which often decides a hacker's future and fate. If people start learning for fame or illegal profit, they can't call it a hacker. However, the virtual network world can not be managed by the real norms, and hackers are the most eager for freedom and sharing in this virtual world. 
    </li><li>
      I enjoyed the presentation given by the guests from Sasktel. I hadheard about the major data breaches that occurred but didn’t reallyknow any of the specific details so it was interesting to learn alittle more about things like the Solarwinds exploit. It was alsointeresting to learn about the online security certification programsthat exist on sans.org and comptia.org so kudos to whoever asked thatquestion.
    </li><li>
      in the last class meeting, we had a discussion on the topic as it is something quite different and interesting one class in that class we had two visitors, speakers, as they examined the work searchers as that how to assemble a solid resume apart from that the next topic is related to the solar winds as about the discovery about the SolarWinds and also about the victims of the attack so these are the important topic for me.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we had to guests from SaskTel this topic was very interesting because we were exploring very important topics like computer science students it was the global threatenings as serious issues nowadays. the problems of the security global the researcher showed us that there are so many different types of threats at the Web and historical threatening examples When the hacker knows your email address, he will have half of your confidential information, and all he needs now is the password. Hackers use several different methods to achieve this, and the most common is a phishing email.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      I found the previous guest speaker talk very engaging and interesting. It was cool to hear about and see some of the things employees in the industry do and what they're concerned about. In my opinion both guest speaker lectures we had were very informative. It was nice to hear from a different perspective, especially someone currently working in the industry.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we had two guest to have a discussion in our class. The way in which the recruiters pick a person for a job and the importance of a good resume was introduced in the class. We learned a good number of things from the guests and had a great time with them.
    </li><li>
      The past meeting was an interesting one. We had teo guest who took our class and explained different things. We learned how to build a perfect resume and the way the recruiters select them. The importance of presentation and knowledge matters the most. Overall, we got to know many things and enjoyed the class.
    </li><li>
      The guests from SaskTel in this lecture talked about the&nbsp;resume and the code of&nbsp;ethics from there own professional experience was really helpful for my future employment planning, thank you for holding this meeting!
    </li><li>
      I thought the presentation was extremely interesting. I was a bit confused at first as I wasn't at all sure what it actually was or what happened when they were going over who was involved and such, but it turned out to be a really awesome presentation. I did enjoy this presentation a great deal, it was probably my favourite of the semester and I'd like to look more into it all in my own time.&nbsp;They made a&nbsp; point that espionage was mostly normal and accepted which seemed odd to me considering the potential damage that could be caused. I...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we had a great time with Rick Lee and unfortunately I can’t recollect second personality’s name cuz the way they explained about the CIPS and what good achievement he got from working at SaskTel and how we as future IT professionals would need various certificates or other requirements to grab a good and deserving positions&nbsp;in IT industries.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In the last class we had a discussion with two new guests. They provided information on CIPS and also provided their experience about their job. It was really fascinating to learn about hackers attack and the way they explained it, was really interesting.
    </li><li>
      In the last zoom meeting, we met two new guest in our class. I remember the name of one of them that is Rick Lee from Sasktel. I really found that interesting for me. Most important thing that i learn is that he taught us the right way to write our resume. What are the main requirements of a good resume.
    </li><li>
      Last class was the visit of Sasktel Official who gave us helpful information about the hiring of the people what all points are taken into consideration for the hiring process and we came to know that further in their hiring process having CIPS certification will be an asset .&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In last lecture, we have had an opportunity to dive into how cyber security is crucial to protect important files. Rick lee and mcdoland were representatives from sasktel. Rick lee illustrated the whole incident about solarwinds cyberattack and how the government was vulnerable from the attack. He also gave some insight about a website called sans.org, it is a website where one could learn about comptia security and many other courses. Overall, it was an amazing experience.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      I have been eager to learn about cybersecurity for several years, so today’s class was especially engaging for me. I enjoyed learning about Rick Lee’s work as a Forensic Technology Investigator. I found his insight into getting involved in the cybersecurity sector very valuable and will consider learning from the online resources he mentioned. His presentation on SolarWinds was eye-opening, showing me how essential security and multi-factor authentication is online. This is something that I often do not regard with much importance on my own online accounts. It also left me wondering how the tech companies detected the mentioned cyberattacks....
    </li><li>
      Today meeting was conducted by the guest from Sasktel whose speech was very knowledgeable and informative. The speaker talked about the todays technologies and its risk as well as their rewards. Relating to our past meetings he also gave information about the ongoing circumstances and our study related information. He also talked about the Code of ethics when it comes to information technology. The code of ethics is most important in our software and information technology.
    </li><li>
      In last class, there were two visitors in our class and we discussed about work searches, expectations or assumptions for the appliers or recruiters and also creating effective resume. How things work in big organizations related to work. We also discussed about the SolarWinds, like how we can access this.Even, SolarWinds is also software developer business in America.overall, the class was totally awesome, it was great to meet the guests and to learn something new.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, meeting 255, a guest from Sasktel gave us a speech about how Sasktel chooses their employees, we need to have our skills very well and study hard. Also, the speech is showing how the network running for Sasktel, which is a great speech for us to learn more about Sasktel.
    </li><li>
      Excellent presentation by the guests. Not only did they shed light on a recent isssue regarding privacy and ethics, the employment tips were really useful.
