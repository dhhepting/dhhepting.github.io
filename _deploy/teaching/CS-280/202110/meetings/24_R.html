      I work in HealthCare, so patient information isconfidential. Yet in the technology world, seem like user information is notconfidential. Like a game of hot potato. Pass that stuff around so everybodycan have a turn.Honestly, if the code of ethics is followed, then everysingle app and corporation is getting fined. But it is like lawmakers are waytoo busy with many things that they can’t focus on this issue of protectingcitizen’s data. It’s like a data information war between the corporation andthe user.
    </li><li>
      In regard to the David Dobrik accusations, I don't think YouTube is at fault for not taking action and removing the video. The video in question was online for a few years before the accusations against David and the vlog squad surfaced and it then became a problem. In my opinion, in cases such as these the victim should contact YouTube and report the video for being harmful at which point it should be removed. YouTube should respect reports such as these but beyond that, I can't see how YouTube would be responsible.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In our 24thmeeting we discussed data ethics with the companies Uber, Lyft, the governmentof road traffic and a youtuber’s allegations with consent. Uber and Lyftaccording to the government’s research showed traffic has increased despiteUber and Lyft’s goals of decreasing traffic. Some of the solutions proposed isto take collected data of consumers and find solutions while following ACM’sEthics 2.5 and 2.7. The ethics 2.5 and 2.7 relate to showing how the data isused by making it as transparent as possible. The accused youtuber according tothe article given in class was shown defending his position and abstaining fromcommenting further about his vlogging...
    </li><li>
      In the breakout rooms, we first discussed the stated concern that driverless taxis could increase road usage and therefor decrease the public good. We then discussed YouTube's moderation process and technical concerns in regulating 500 hours of uploaded content each minute. YouTube has demonstrated leadership in preventing abuse of their platform and inorganic relevancy attacks. I find it amazing that every hour, 42 million hours of YouTube videos are streamed.
    </li><li>
      Today we discussed multiple articles and how they relate to the ACMcode of ethics. The most interesting topic that was brought up, in myopinion, was the unintended consequences that technology can have.For example, Uber and Lyft were initially designed as ride sharingservices, but ended up being used like taxi services, putting manytaxi drivers into precarious work situations and increasing roadcongestion in certain areas. If issues like these can happenunintentionally when creating technologies, it shows how important itis to think about all the possible consequences of developing atechnology before you create it.
    </li><li>
      In the meeting today, we discussed about the newchanges that professor did in URcourses. After that professor talked aboutfinal a bit. Then, we had 2 breakout room in which we first discussed aboutUber and Lyft, and it was bit hard to relate that topic with ACM code of ethicsat least for me. Then in the other meeting we had very small discussion aboutone of the members in David Dobrik’s YouTube squad facing sexually assaultaccusation and one of the actresses from that video pointed out the Davidposted the video without the consents. I think YouTube should be regulatingsituations like this as...
    </li><li>
      In today’s meetingwe again discussed about different ACM code of ethics. We had 2 breakout roomabout different topics. First one was about “What We Got Wrong About Uber andLyft”. That article basically about private companies plan to reduce traffic.They were suggesting that carpooling can be solution to have less taxi on road,that way we will have less traffic. But the main question was if Uber or lyftshould share data with government. In our opinion both the government, Uber andlyft need to work together using the collected data while following ACM ethics&nbsp;1.6(respectprivacy) and 1.7(Honore confidentiality). Our second breakout season was about...
    </li><li>
      We discussed the ACM code of ethics in context of companies like Uber and Lyft, the ride-sharing companies making the problem of traffic worse -&nbsp; a problem that they were expected to solve. The article that we discussed gave suggestions to sharing of data between these apps and city administration to devise better policies. However, there were doubts raised about this during discussion that this data could be a breach of customer privacy. The data can be masked to remove any personally identifiable data so in my opinion, that argument does not stand.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about how big tech companies like Uber and Lyft market their&nbsp;platform to save resources and reduce traffic by initiating on-call drivers, but when researchers looked into their data it was the quite opposite. They were causing more traffic than reducing it, especially in downtown urban areas. Uber said that there would be less traffic as people would call upon a cab when they want to unlike public transport that they kept wandering, but most of the Uber drivers did wander around without any fares in the cities contradicting their own policy to reduce traffic....
    </li><li>
      I find ACM code of ethics topic quite boring so the last meeting was not that much interesting. Discussions in breakout rooms also began quite late, everyone was silent but we still discussed quite a few things.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      1. Uber and lyft are some of the reasons for the pollution and and increase in traffic although they promised less traffic when&nbsp; they introduced&nbsp; their services. in present they one of the reason that public transports like buses are being used less.2. David dobrik is one the famous youtubers across country. in term of the allegation public cannot decide any thing&nbsp; if he will be held accountable because we don't know the proper truth. maybe he is responsible or maybe not. allegations around celebs takes a long time to resolve.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      Any company should be willing to share information that could harm or benefit society, this is no different with new technology like Uber and Lyft. By not sharing information on their company that could potentially harm or help society, should be, a right for the government to have to benefit everyone. Companies such as oil and gas have a history of not telling people information that could have lead to a better society for everyone. If uber and lyfts attempt to 'reduce traffic' are increasing it then they should not be allowed to continue saying they are reducing.
    </li><li>
      Today's class went okay, the breakout rooms were somewhat poor though. I felt the Uber/Lyft article jumped around a lot and I couldn't really see the specific point they were trying to make. I think it's sort of a different situation from those we've previously looked at as I feel the original intent was in line with the code of ethics, just that in reality it had unforeseen effects (arguably similar to the David Dobrik situation as I understand it).
    </li><li>
      What I would like to learn more about is how we can get companies to act. It one thing to critique a company about how it can do better, but without the means to enforce it, then the company might not improve. For example, if we know Lyft/Uber can be better how can we get them to change? The reading gave some examples such as changing the law (making it more expensive for idle uber drivers and thus creating an incentive to reduce idle drivers) but there must be more (that don't require slow passing of laws).
    </li><li>
      I think it is an interesting balance between what is efficient for uber to operate as a company, and what is efficient for the cities uber operates in to organize themselves. While the cities uber operates in can not demand to see all of their information, I believe the best option would be for uber to get bought out by the government, so that rather than finding compromise, they can just be organized by the same leadership.
    </li><li>
      This might not be fully relevant to our discussion, but since it was in the news recently and has to do with moderation and censoring on video and streaming platforms I thought I would share it to continue the conversation. Might be fun for a brief discussion in class. Intel has a new software called Bleep that censors hate speech, but you can select how much you would like to see on a dial. Obviously I think it's interesting that we need a tool that does this when maybe we could ask people to just... not be shitty on the...
    </li><li>
      In meeting 24, there are some report saying vloger or youtuber are sexual misconduct to their member. In this case, many of brand cancel the&nbsp; cooperation with them. In my opinion, their are no evidence can prove this happen in the vlog team, members are unilaterally accused their leader. If the case really happen, the court will judge the leader; If not, it already damage the team relationship.
    </li><li>
      It seems that ride-hailing has become popular in recent years. Unlike traditional taxis, ride-hailing uses an online method. Uber is undoubtedly the largest ride-hailing platform. However, how to use online ride-hailing to solve urban congestion has become a big problem. For example, Uber might try to share some data to improve road problems across the city. In fact, from another Angle to judge such taxi-hailing software, I think the emergence of new technology has suppressed the living space of traditional taxi drivers. Obviously, traditional taxi drivers are not the beneficiaries of new technology. Some of them may not be able...
    </li><li>
      Topic of this meeting was about the uber and lyft which are the two companies which provide on demand rides. Initially their view was that if people will use these apps they will save money by doing car pool and it will be good for environment as well. however, now its more like taxis where everybody is using their own rides and avoiding carpool. This is also leading to same kind of pollution which would be their if everybody used their own cars. In addition we also talked about youtuber's content being not good for audience.
    </li><li>
      Two main discussion of this meeting were youtuber's content and use of uber and lyft which are on demand rides apps. i personally think people can post whatever they want on social media if it follows the community guidelines however its totally the choice of audience what they want to watch. In case of uber and lyft their initial view was that by using their app people can get on demand rides without affecting the environment because they would use car pooling. However, it ended up being more resource consuming as everybody is using it more like taxis.
    </li><li>
      Well for this topic we looked at how ebuer and the other car pool thing. Now the thing is that for honestly reason is I see it more of the city blaming those companies considering they have the data already I mean they know that these people are out there since there clearly causing some road increases use. So why dont they just fixed it and for the privacy act they can give it still but cut out names and in residential areas like no tracking in there and give it.
    </li><li>
      First of all, thank you for organizing ur courses it looks great and also very easy to access the summary and responses separately. One more thing to add i know I wrote in the previous response too but if possible whenever you get a chance if you could add a page saying final exam and describe what should we will be expecting that would be great thank you!
    </li><li>
      I really enjoyed Meeting 24 and the discussion about Uber and Lyft and how technology would help solve the problem. Also, I want to thank Dr. Hepting for the new interface on how to access the meeting details, it is really helpful. Thanks.
    </li><li>
      April 12th 2021Shrey Shah200377176CS 280&nbsp;On Thursday the past week, we had a longdiscussion on the fall from grace of YouTube’s most rising star: David Dobrik.Dobrik and his colleagues of Vlog Squad were involved in several sexual assaultallegations from another YouTuber. The compelling evidence from the misconduct investigations arenot a fool’s errand. It should have been David’s job to manage and at leasthold his colleagues up to a respectable standard. YouTube does publish and holdaccount its own ethics guidelines and founding principles. These principlesoutline how YouTubers are to behave to a certain extent, the question is howeveris YouTube allowing them to...
    </li><li>
      As far as the Uber and Lyft case study goes, it did not seem to me that either intended to increase traffic volumes and become a taxi service. They tried to brand themselves as 'rideshare services', focused on carpooling. Reducing traffic seems to be the government's responsibility if that is where its priorities are. In that sense, I suppose taxes are a natural method to reduce demand for these sevices.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we talked about a couple of things and one of our focuses was on the article by "The New York Times" about how companies like "Uber" and "Lyft" expanded in the urban markets. The article basically showed nothing but how such companies advertise their working mechanism whereas when the data was studied carefully by the analysts, the scenario was completely the other way round. More chaos was created in dense urban areas instead of getting reduced. The cab drivers literally used to wander around the block and do nothing but go against their policies wasting gas....
    </li><li>
      Relating to the David Dobrik situation, I think that with people with very large followings on the internet can use their positions to seriously abuse power dynamics. When a Youtube celebrity has lets say 10 million people watching their videos, if they ask someone else to do something and that person refuses, 10 million people suddenly dislike that person for not following what the celebrity told them to do. This can lead people to do things they don't actually want to do out of fear of being socially ostracized.
    </li><li>
      The articlereferenced referred to the two services as being initially created as a ridesharing service, to have multiple people carpool into work, when, at least inmy mind, that was never the primary use case for it. Cabs have always beenincredibly expensive, as they more or less have a monopoly on the non-publictransit in cities. Having Uber and Lyft arrive to a city made it vastly lessexpensive for people without a vehicle to travel, even if it adds to the idlingtime of vehicles in the city, as there are now both cabs and ride sharingcompanies waiting for requests.
    </li><li>
      "But the effects of the ride services suggest that emerging transportation, including driverless cars, may need regulations ..." I feel that this line is most significant, specifically the driverless cars bit; but I feel that in the case of "driverless cars" it is a completely different story than what the rest of the article deals with. I am not so convinced that tons of regulation is needed for services like uber and lyft but what is far different in the case of driverless cars is well, of course the lack of a human driver. This is another discussion all on...

      the meeting was about how technology is gonna help and how the uber has changed the lives. Also related to last meeting we had a discussion about the code of ethics and about the courts at the states. Also we had a view on the YouTube vlog on David Dobrik. We have also discussed about the prpoject proposals and the topics.
    </li><li>
      In this class we discussed what would come for the final exam. Then we discussed about how Uber and Lyft are not working how they promised to work for and are the reasons for increased traffic in the city. We were also asked to discuss about the same in the breakout rooms were we gave our opinions on this case.
    </li><li>
      This meeting was an amazing talk about how we got wrong about the Uber. After analyzing more about the Uber it was implemented to reduce the traffic and influence the public transportation which led to total opposite. The promise was not been kept as Uber and Lyft were expanded they started in urban areas with strategies where people's hobbies are to ride. The riders later on were roaming everywhere searching for ride and clogging the traffic. The concern was also for the incentives that some cities added their charges when the rider is searching for the ride which was charged...

      We learned manythings in this class, we started our discussion by the word Copyrights. I learnedmany facts about that and then we discussed about the issues with the uber andlyft. How costly it is for individuals to travel, through this medium. Theserides are so expensive then it seems, as one travel in the downtown it cost alot for both the passenger and the driver or say owner. Nowadays, apart fromcost, the traffic is rising daily so there are no days far from the destructionof this companies.
    </li><li>
      Reflecting on the article about Uber and Lyft and our sometimes overreliance on technology to solve our problems. While I am a firm believer in technology and we should use every breakthrough to advance and serve our communities we need to mindful of our externalities -- both positive and negative. Especially when we work with applications that serve the community, such as a ride-sharing service like Uber, it is important that we are mindful of how are users are engaging with our service. There should also be collaboration with government to ensure best practices and positive outcomes for the community,...

      This semester is almost over. We discussed a few things about the final exam. Deepen the understanding of computer professional ethics
    </li><li>
      In meeting 24, we are discussing about technology will help solve the problem for uber and lyft, they need to share its data,&nbsp;Developing transportation policy, and&nbsp;requiring proper guardrails for new technology.
    </li><li>
      When discussing the Uber and Lyft case study in relation to ACM’s Code of Ethics, I think that Principle 1.1 is necessary to consider. This principle stresses that “computing professionals should consider whether the results of their efforts will respect diversity, will be used in socially responsible ways, will meet social needs, and will be broadly accessible.” From my exposure to Uber, respecting diversity and accessibility can be further improved by (1) accounting for differences in users’ age, language, and economic and cultural backgrounds, as well as (2) not only centering the services in urban areas. 
    </li><li>
      In regards to the question "should YouTube be regulated?" my answer is no. YouTube is supposed to be for people to make and post their own videos just as long as they adhere to YouTube's guidelines. Adding regulations to YouTube would ruin it (in my opinion) regulations would result in a very boring social media platform.&nbsp; It would also give YouTube the power to dictate whos videos get posted and whos do not. With the David Dobrik situation it is not up to YouTube to punish Dobrik that is the job of the police not the social media company.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      The example of Uber and Lyft just goes to show how well intentioned tech companies can be but how they're intended impact is not necessarily a reality. An initial vision of the benefits of a certain technology could seem great but as the company truly develops we can see large issues arise. The article mentions Uber and Lyft sharing their information to help cities plan and develop around it. I think that is a great idea and I think ethically every company should be working with the public interest in mind and should be lawfully forced to do so.
    </li><li>
      In the previous lecture we discussed about many things. It was very helpful.See you in the next meeting.
    </li><li>
      Any new technology or project designed to serve the public should be regulated in advance to implement new rules and requirements, and the company providing the service should offer the data to the regulator so that the service can be adjusted in time.&nbsp;However, in my opinion, the so-called sharing economy, especially in the field of public transportation, is clearly that the&nbsp;entrepreneurs are using public resources for their benefit. In the early days of Uber and Lyft, the potential drawbacks of this form of transportation were deliberately obscured.&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      I believe&nbsp;Companies should cut ties with YouTuber David Dobrik amid misconduct allegations against his Vlog Squad because no company wants to have ties with such negative connotation especially when it comes to rape allegations. And &nbsp;getting a ride with the tap of an app would help reduce traffic and increase riders’ use of public transportation seems to be false because the ratio of taxi drivers to car owners are starting to increase in number. I have really like this class and I hope I do grate on the final exam.
    </li><li>
      I was keento know more about the news feed that we mentioned in the previous lecture.Initially, I was not sure why the companies have broken ties with a well-knownYouTuber, but I felt bad for that lady after learning the facts. As a girl, Iknow how important our respects are to us and how horrible thing happened to her.I like his bravery to admit his mistake and to apologize publicly for it. Yet, everyoneknows that saying sorry doesn't reduce the victim's pain. They are reallyeligible for strict punishments.
    </li><li>
      Our main topic of discussion was the ACM code of Ethics and Professional conduct in the last meeting. We discussed various general Ethical Principals and professional responsibilities. We discussed these codes with examples for better understanding for instance out discussion regarding Uber and Lyft. What ethics should these Ride-hailing services follow. Both Uber, Lyft, and government should follow the ACM ethic 2.5, by providing the customers with comprehensive and thorough evaluations of their system and all the possible risks. In short, they need to be as transparent as possible with their customers. These Ride-hailing services should not disclose their customers'...
    </li><li>
      In the last class we talked about the article we read on " what we got wrong about Uber and lyft". The most important thing I learned from this is that we basically cannot always predict what may happen in the future when it comes to the use of technology.
    </li><li>
      I wasn't aware that Uber and Lyft were causing increases in traffic. Obviously in a city like Regina it isn't particularly noticeable. It's not too surprising though as the only effective way to reduce traffic congestion in a city is to make alternatives like public transit and bicycles more convenient.
    </li><li>
      In last meeting we discussed about Uber and Lyft case study. In which Uber had clain that due to their service in future they will help reducing traffic in highly dense urban areas, but in real we can see that due to uber services traffic in urban areas increased subsiquently. We discussed in break out room that was it ethical in point of view from uber. We also discussed about David Dobrik in another break out room&nbsp; and discussed that will he be held accountable.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting , we continued to discuss our ACM code of ethics and professional conduct. in this class, we saw some examples of Uber and Lyft, which makes us better understand this code. specifically, this example relates with ACM ethic 2.5 and 2.7 , which says that users should be facilitated with analysis of all possible risks and detailed evaluations. which means that transparency should be kept with customers. with that, we also read one ethical misconduct case of David Dobrik.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was about using technology to solve problems. An example presented in class was Uber's failure to reduce traffic. There is a clear conflict of interest because Uber is a corporation driven by profit. Uber wants more drivers and more users to increase profit which led to increase in traffic. Technology obviously made our society more efficient and productive but it is not the answer to all of our problems. I'd like to learn more about specific problems that technology solved to get an idea of its capabilities.
    </li><li>
      In last class the ACM code of ethics and the article of The New York Times based on what went wrong with Uber and Lyft was discussed in the class. The user infomation is a sensitive thing and should be protected at any level. The government should not allow the applications like Uber and Lyft to get access to the data of the user unknowingly as it is against the code of ethics. In this way, the user will be protected.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, we have done a discussion about David Dobrik and his vlog squad a vlogger on youtube so, mainly the discussion is about youtube and the videos, vlogs on youtube.&nbsp;A video vlog represents a video to a sort of vlog. Indeed, very much like web journals, you can video blog about nearly anything. A video blog is intended to share experiences, thoughts with people. Despite the beneficial things that YouTube has added to society, and its life-saving, critical thinking abilities, it has additionally been a bad effect on a specific part of society. Private recordings, assault, crime,...
    </li><li>
      At the last meeting, we’ve discussed how we are going to use our UR courses website, and the project proposal marks have been posted which is very happy. Also, I’ve read the article: “What We Got Wrong About Uber and Lyft?” by Shira Ovide on March 29, 2021. Like the fact that Uber and Lyft do not promise the technologies to help solve the traffic difficulties, oppositely, ruins the city’s traffic. Shira and Dr. Erhardt have studied the reason behind this situation by 3 points. Finally, we also discussed Youtuber David Dobrik’s case about kissing a woman which he should...
    </li><li>
      we discussed about the professional responsibilities and conduct, code of ethics (ACM), case of David dobrik. We learned about the ethics followed by the big organizations such as Uber or lyft. We got to know that these companies are based on these codes, as these codes species the service provided by these companies, in a clear way. These polices should be clear and easy to understand for their customers, as much as it can, so that customer can get to know about each and everthing about their service.
    </li><li>
      Uber and Lyft can create traffic, but it is also a part of the public transportation, but I think this can not be the reason that the drivers roam around even if they don't have fares that do not sound true because it costs them money and it can't be said for all of the drivers, so it's not entirely true.the Youtuber will face for sure defamation, but not the charges because he has not did the crime.
    </li><li>
      we discussed about ACM code of ethics, ethical principals and professional responsibilities. We also discussed code examples related to uber, lyft.&nbsp; the code of ethics which are followed by these organisations, and by which customer can access their services, according to their code of ethics. moreover we also discussed about professional conduct.on the whole, we learned and discussed about how these organizations work on the basis of the ethics and principals, moreover, these ethics and principals are verified by the government in order to check customer privacy and convenience.
    </li><li>
      One interesting thing that we learned in this meeting was how sometimes we misjudge how people will use the technology we built like the case of Uber and Lyft. In the meeting there was a fun discussion about companies like Uber should share their data with the municipals such that where most of people will go using their service to help municipals give better public transportation using that data which resulted in conflicting opinions because some student argued that those data are trade secrets of those companies and companies relay on those data to run and sharing it with municipals...
    </li><li>
      Professional code of conduct and ACM code of ethics were the main topics of this class.Uber and lyft were discussed with respect to these codes for a clear understanding.It was also discussed how govt, uber and lyft should follow ACM ethics 2.5 and &nbsp;should be always accountable and truthful to customers. Also David Dobrik case was discussed and came to know about the ethical misconduct against his vlog squad.
    </li><li>
      The prime discussion for this meeting was the recent alleged allegations against a famous Youtuber, and whether Youtube had any stakes in the ethical issues related to this case. I believe that such popular streaming/video sharing sites become less cautious about enforcing their rules against questionable content when dealing with content creators with a massive fan base. This results in them getting away with controversial content which they cater to their fan base, including kids. This partial treatment needs to stop and the ethicality of such issues needs to be handled better.
    </li><li>
      Last meeting highlighted the professional responsibilities of a computer professional. We discussed about a YouTuber, he failed to accomplish those responsibilities and how it affected him and his surrounding. First thing he did not treat his colleagues with respect and dignity which led to separation of him and his colleagues which further ended up into losing contracts from big companies. On a media platforms &nbsp;when you have this many subscribers you need think thoroughly before releasing the content as you are influence such a big mass. &nbsp;
    </li><li>
      We talked about what we got wrong about Uber and Lyft? We discussed that these companies know the information about their customers, then share it with others, but sharing data concerning privacy is not reasonable, and it should be confidential. For example, some companies know that things are wrong in their systems, but they do not inform the officials. So, computing professionals monitor it. Moreover, another topic that whose responsibility the company's or its customer's to think about the code of ethics; I believe both ends responsibility.
    </li><li>
      Name: Yiming Zhang&nbsp; &nbsp; StuID: 200404814In this lesson, we discussed the grading of some personal assignments and answered questions for the final exam. And then we moved on to the website and the video about the course itself, we watched the David Dobrik Vlog, and we thought about it, and we're going to deepen our thinking about computer ethics in the last few classes of the semester.
    </li><li>
      In class one of the main things we talked about/main points was that of Uber. A question I have regarding a company like this is what else can be automated for our convenience? Now I know Uber isn’t exactly fully automated. It we do have an app that pretty much does all the work for us we simply just order the food and someone brings it(in the case of Uber eats), and in the case of regular Uber we get someone to come pick us up from an app instead of having to phone and make physical contact with another...
    </li><li>
      Topics discussed in the meeting are about the project proposal and also about how the technology has changed the lives. We also discussed about the technical problems about logging in to the UR courses. Also how the technology went wrong in the case of uber and lyft. Also the accountability of David Dobrik on his vlogs.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we had a discussion about a topic that is related to the ACM code of ethics and professional conduct. we discussed these with the help of the examples for a better and good understanding regarding Uber as these and government should follow the ethics code conduct and in short, we can say that they need to be visible to us as possible then. apart from that e also discussed the case of David dobrick.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we were talking about the whole David Dobrik thing going on at the moment. Personally I feel like it’s a classic case of cancel culture although if those allegations are true he has definitely done some wrong things and I believe like everyone else he should be given the opportunity to learn from it and not just be punished and left to be miserable&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a great discussion about big companies such as UBER and lyft. Also we had breakout room as well to discuss those points with our classmates.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned last meeting was the importance of designing and planning around consequences of a product. Its is interesting to think whether the traffic jams and similar issues surrounding Uber and Lyft could have been avoided given more consideration towards the code of ethics. I would like to learn more about the development processes of these products and how they fixed/plan to fix many issues the public seems to have with them.&nbsp;Initially I found it was hard to see how these issues relate to the code of ethics. I have taken Ubers many times, but...
    </li><li>
      In ACM of code, we know Leaders should consider the personal and professional development, accessibility requirements, physical safety, psychological well-being, and human dignity of all workers. But ，to David Dobrik，He didn't do it at all, and he did various misconduct and exploitation against the Vlog Squad members, including rape against one of Dobrik’s friends. I think he lacks certain morality. Finally, this popular Internet celebrity paid the price for his actions. Even if we were not leaders, we should abide by the law and discipline.
    </li><li>
      last meeting was really helpful to me We talked about the new computer softwares coming up in the future in the break out room.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we have discussed ACM code of ethics, with the help of some examples.We discussed various general Ethical principles &nbsp;and professional responsibilities .we had a great discussion in group to elaborate the examples regarding uber and lyft. I think both uber, lyft &nbsp;and government should use ACM code 2.5 by providing through evacuation of their sustem to the customers so that they can analyze possible risks.They should increase transparency as much as they can
    </li><li>
      Youtube and other social platforms should regulate the amount of power they give to their influencers. While David Dobrik and his squad should take the blame for their actions, youtube should also regulate its services
    </li><li>
      In last class we discuses about the flaws lies in the Uber taxi system. According to them they have developed the system to cause minimum traffic where there is high activity of Uber but it is not true. The system is a frailer. They says that the system is very efficient in reducing traffic but when you actually see it you will see more Uber driver then needed at a particular place at same time and without fares.
    </li><li>
      I learnt that&nbsp;Uber and Lyft have said that individuals driving themselves are the greatest wellsprings of traffic. That is valid, yet it doesn't clarify the flood in rush hour gridlock that the administrations have added to urban areas
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we discussed about the article published regarding the misconduct in vlog squad of David Dobrik. We also discussed the article on what is wrong with uber and lyft. They should follow some ethical rules in order to improve their ride experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li><li>
      I think the david dobraik case is very messed up,in no world should you bribe someone to keep something in which that person is not happy about. I think they should've taken that video down as soon as they were confronted about it. Being able to show positive content on a page that children younger than my siblings follow would be better for the society and show the positive side of tech but in this case tech is used very badly.
    </li><li>
      David Dobrik scandal is notsurprisingly a new issue. We can find countless examples of YouTube failing totake proper action against such incidents. David Dobrik has failed his supportersand should be held to a higher standard considering his following. With hisfame and power, he needs to be more responsible and therefore just a dry apologyshould not be the only consequence. This seems to have become a pattern. For acouple months sponsors and the viewer will boycott him and then all this will"blow over". It is impossible to control the internet but as aworld spread platform YouTube needs to take responsibility. There...
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about how the big tech companies like Uber, etc use their platform to save resources and reduce the trafficby initiating on-call drivers, but when the researchers looked into the data they find all the things opposite to the data provided by the companies. In reality,&nbsp;they are causing more problems more traffic than reducing especially the busy areas.&nbsp; Uber said that there would be less traffic as people would call upon a cab when they want to avoid public transport.
    </li><li>
      In the last zoom meeting, we discussed mainly about the ACM codes of ethics and Professional conduct. Also, some of the principles of general ethics and their professional responsibilities. Moreover, we discussed some examples related to our topic to make it more clear. Most important thing that we also discussed the case of David Dobrik and ethical misconduct against his vlog squad.
    </li><li>
      We spoke about something different in the last lecture.I had no idea why two well-known corporations' connections had been broken.The man, on the other hand, admitted his error, which was a positive thing. 
    </li><li>
      The past meeting was about the article on The New York Times and the issue of code of ethics with it. The article explained the way in which government should stop the distribution and use of user data for the benefit of some companies. According to the code of ethics, user data is the most important thing to be protected and this was the issue that was discussed in the class.
    </li><li>
      Last class, we have talked about the new driver technology these days - Lyft and Uber. We also have read an article in class.&nbsp;The article was saying they viewed Lift and Uber as initially being made for carpooling to work.&nbsp;In the article, it mentions an added fee on private rides in places like New York to discourage congestion on the streets by both drivers and passengers. In my experience I don't know how effective this would be. I mean, if you really need a ride a fee that is a couple extra dollars probably isn't going to discourage you that...
    </li><li>
      In the last gathering , we examined concerning Why organizations have disintegrated their binds with YouTuber. Yet, the later on , we became more acquainted with that the actual explanation of breaking the ties was something personal . Finally , the guy going about as great individual acknowledged his misstep.
    </li><li>
      tech is useful
