      It is important to be aware of possible implications of what we are writing, but to not let it completely dictate whether or not we do it. Absolutely anything can be used to the downside of humanity, developing a messaging app can be used for cyberbullying, marketplace for selling illicit items. We should be aware of these possibilities and look into applicable methods of limiting/preventing it from happening, but it should not hold us back from developing out of the fear of what it can be used for.The same thing goes for much of life, if you are too afraid...
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we talked about computer science or technology is used in an evil way even if it is not intended to. Well, I think that with some power will come some destruction its laws of natures with positive there will come negative. People who invented nuclear fusion or fission never thought it would be used to create an atomic bomb. When a programmer creates any technology it is not intended to use for evil purposes. It’s the duty of the person who uses it for the betterment of society or destruction. After all the good and the...

      On accountability for organizationsThe previous lecture we had a group discussion/breakout activity on sustainability for organizations. An important topic that my group brought up was the question if corporations should be held accountable for sustainability going forwards. This is quite a vague statement so let’s try to break it down into the core aspect. Data is currently used by each and every organizations to gain more fans, grow the userbase, and network with industry pros. However, data collection is not always sustainable. For how long are we to expect the gathering of data by modern organizations as ethical? Another interesting...

      The past meeting was about related to CIPS that is Canada's association of information and technology. It is an association of 10 provincial regulators that license IT professionals in Canada and all over world. We also talked about the CIPS presentation on march 25 in class. In between we also talked about the blog entry 1 grades.
    </li><li>
      It was a great discussion on Everything is connected. Looking forward to learn on march25th in CIPS presentation in class. Also wanted to talk more about the topic we discussed in meeting 18 on a specific topics with examples for better understanding.
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about the CIPS. I know that they are the accreditation body for Computer Science in Canada and that they establish the standards/practices of IT professionals; as well as provide some networking and certifications, but that is basically it. So I suppose I look forward to the CIPS presentation on the 25th.
    </li><li>
      Nowadays, the Internet world is changing so much that people's lives are also changing. The progress of science and technology deeply affects each and every one of us. At the same time, there is also a dark side. For example, there are cameras everywhere nowadays. Will they invade our privacy? Do these cameras, while providing security, cause harm to us ordinary people? These are topics worth exploring. This is just a metaphor, but I think we need to think more about these kinds of issues, to look beyond the surface, to think for ourselves and to question them.
    </li><li>
      I think that abstraction plays a big role in computer science. Data abstraction, permission level, features. Data abstraction is to protect user data from being exposed to other sections of the code. One person must work part of the code while another person works on another. So, they must protect their section of data and only pass what is needed. Deeply related to the privacy issue.If you publish your code online for free use. There could be a case of people modify your code and use them for their gains. If that is the case, are you still part of...
    </li><li>
      I think accountability is way to an abstract concept to define when making things. If we look at any kind of technology it can be used for good and evil. So how are we supposed to hold a computer scientist accountable for something someone else does with their technology? I would say intent is a much more concrete thing to have ethics around. If it is there intent to harm then it is not ethical, if they are making a technology to help people and someone else uses it to harm how is that the original persons fault.
    </li><li>
      In our 17th meeting we discussed abstraction coding, ethics with research and the marks that came back for our blog 1 and project proposal. We were asked a difficult question of how coding should relate to abstraction. I was put into a group and I discussed how abstraction could mean the code’s relation to reality or how versatile the code should be with the different levels of abstraction. When it came to computer science research, should every coder question the ethics of every program they help build. I suggested for every step of the continued research we should actively update...
    </li><li>
      When it comes to generating software that is built for serving a diverse population, how can we as developers expand our understanding of different peoples walks of life and how that affects interaction with software? It is a given that someone will solve a problem/generate a program in a way that makes most sense to them. Is it problematic that the majority of the employees in computing are dominated by white males?
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture we discussed about CIPS.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we discussed how learning computer is a long process because we have to learn a lot of things and taking the time to learn it is the key. We also discussed about cips at the beginning of the lecture thanks
    </li><li>
      The major problem of the Internet of things (IOT) is the security concern, as everything is connected in this process from larger to larger to smaller to smaller thing.As in today's world data is the most powerful tool it can help a business to grow but can also proved to be worst if comes in the wrong hands. The thing that we can do to protect is education and awareness among passes so they can have unique and different passwords which helps the data to secure and becomes difficult for hackers to hack the system
    </li><li>
      The meeting was about how everything is connected and about the sustainability and about the computer sciences professionals contributing to sustainability. the topic related to last class is about the discussion of due dates for the blogs and about he grading of blog one. the topic difficult to understand was about how sustainability contributes to computers.
    </li><li>
      We learned many new things through this meeting, I learned about the importance of sustainability in the modern world of technologies. It is important for the improvement in medical sector and standards of lifestyle. To maintain ecological balances. We also learned about the quote, “everything is connected”. So, this quote states that the connection is like roots, that would go deeper as it grows and becomes more stable. Everything is connected and so it will improve and evolve as time passes. For example, google personalizes and improves it services.
    </li><li>
      Our discussion about the ethics of what we code got me interested in wanting to learn more about the laws (assuming they exist) that govern computer science (for example any laws that restrict what we can code). This is because as a student I haven't really learned about the laws governing CS but as an individual that can code shouldn't I be knowledgeable about the dos and don'ts of what I can code? It just seems logical that there should be restrictions in place as what we can code can cause great harm to those around us (such as malware)....
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed about the CIPS presentation that is going to be held on Thursday, 25th March. Then we discussed the topic "Everything is connected" and were sent into breakout rooms to have some discussion about it.
    </li><li>
      The question imposed in last class was how do we deal with everything being connected and still write code that relies on abstraction?Though this question is a little difficult to answer, I believe that we have to make sure we think of the consequences of the implementation. Besides that I think also, in coding terms, I think that a database is a way to implement code that keeps everything connected as well as abstract. Also, I think by applying design patterns like MVC design. It a pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components.
    </li><li>
      The link to watch the video "Everything is connected" under the plan for Thu-18-March-2021 is not working but the discussion during class was very engaging and informative.The discussion about using Abstraction and writing effective code was interesting. I would like to know more about what options do programmers have if their managers are forcing them to do something is not ethical.
    </li><li>
      in this class we discussed about how sustainability is playing role in programmers world. Why sustainability is important and shared our views in breakout room. Moreover, we discussed about the upcoming meeting that is on 24th, all of us were very excited.
    </li><li>
      First you extended the deadline of blog 2 then we discussed about connecting.
    </li><li>
      In the previous class, we talked about computer science and technology are being used in an evil way even whether it is intended or. Well, as the renowned law of Inertia states "Every action has it's an equal and opposite reaction" as in the same manner, the law of nature states powers always lads to boon and at the same time destruction so with positive there will come the negative impact of everything happening to mankind. At the point when a software engineer makes any innovation, it isn't planned to use for abhorrent purposes. It's the obligation of the individual...
    </li><li>
      In the lecture, we discuss how we deal with code abstraction while everything is connected? so, the use of data abstraction permits us to change an unpredictable information structure into one that is basic and simple to utilize. The impact of this is that a program with an undeniable degree of code intricacy can be changed into one that looks near English. The public ones are the best way to utilize the information
    </li><li>
      In class we talked about the abstraction of ones work when it came to coding. In my opinion I don't believe one can have true abstraction now when developing code as so much has already been developed but rather that one can have abstraction towards already created codes. Think about it in a way where you're changing another person's code. I believe in this context is the only true way you can put your own spin on it as all other times there's only one true answer to how a code is ran.
    </li><li>
      according to me here are few points that motivate one to add abstraction in code :-to keep things less complicated and easy for the client to understand.-protects one's ideas from fraudsters and competitors.-job security. ;p
    </li><li>
      I found it difficult to conceptualize writing code that relies on abstraction when we have to still consider that everything is connected. Decoupling things to reduce complexity is a normal practice in programming, especially in terms of dividing and delegating labour on larger projects. Programmers working on disembodied functions could be missing context that contributes to the greater whole. So what's the solution? Does that mean involving everyone every step of the way, guaranteeing education and transparency? Do we have to always consider everything or do we need to accept that abstractions will result in uncertainties? Does this mean we...
    </li><li>
      In our last class, we talked about how everything is connected and how it impacts our ability to write codes. Quite a while ago I read about the butterfly effect, how the smallest change in the past can radically change the future. As I went through the speech of Tom Chi(I think it's related, cause the link in the website is keep showing error, and he talks about the same stuff), I think that the basic fundamental of both philosophies is same. Everything that happened in the past, accident or planned has led us to where we are now and...
    </li><li>
      Everything being connected in our world of technology makes our lives simpler but makes things more complicated for programmers having to incorporate the ability for their program to communicate with everything else
    </li><li>
      Understanding motivation also allows for a greater understanding of social networks. It notes on Facebook that people act as nodes and that their "friendships" act as edges or links. Usually, descriptions of Facebook networks are based on friendships between two people. "But adding one person, creating a triangle of friends instead of an edge clenched by two nodes, results in a more powerful analytical tool," he said. "It allows you to get a closer look at the" small-format "relationships and, ultimately, a much better understanding of the larger network and a clearer idea of ​​what is happening with the participants....
    </li><li>
      IN THIS CLASS WE HAVE DISCUSSED ABOUT OUR ASSIGNMENT
    </li><li>
      The topic of discussion for the past Thursday meeting in the breakout room was how do we deal with everything being connected And still manage to write a code which relies on abstraction . This was the main topic which we discussed for a long time
    </li><li>
      In Last lecture we had a great discussion about CIPS presentation also we had a discussion on how everything is connected.
    </li><li>
      I learned that Code powers our digital world. Every website, smartphone app, computer programme and even microwave relies on code in order to operate. This makes coders the architects and builders of the digital world.
    </li><li>
      This meeting's topic, everything is connected, was very interesting. I watched the ted talk video by Tom Chi where he talks about how everything is connected and it was fascinating. The way he explained it made me wonder how far deep have we come and how far we still have to go to discover many more great things.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, i learnt about the concept of CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society) which is a professional association in Canada that helps to strengthen the Canadian IT industry by establishing standards and sharing best practices for the benefit of individual IT professionals and the sector as a wholeIn this meeting, i was really struggling to understand the actual concept of "Everything is Connected"I will appreciate if i can get a better knowledge and understanding of it
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we discussed CIPS, which is the body that establishes standards for computer science professions. we also discussed the grades on blog entry 2. in the latter part of the class, we discussed abstraction, which is to protect the user's data from another section of the code. In the breakout room, we discussed how everything is connected and we still write code that is based on abstraction.

      The most interesting discussion in this meeting was during our breakout room where we had a discussion about abstract and weather we as the developers were responsible for the programs that we make, but many student believed that it is not the responsibility of the developer because once a program is created it could be used for good and bad intention depending who's the person using the program. Many students believed that it is mostly the responsibility of the company or the user of the of the program how and what they use if for and I agree with that...

      In the group discussion we were discussing about sustainability. And earlier in the class we discussed regarding checking the assignment feedback. I wanted to learn more about how sustainability and privacy are inter related because in group discussion we discussed how data protection and privacy can affect sustainability

      As technology continues to advance, the spiderweb the connects everything on the world-wide web grows. As it grows, it continues to hold on to more and more data about each one of us. Google knows nearly every step i've taken since 2015 and now with a screen on my fridge. Google knows what I eat, how much and when. How long is it before our algorithms stop asking us what we want and start telling us what we want?

      As discussed in our class we know how everything is connected to something and everywhere. The concept of everything is connected is shown by speaker about the heart, breathe and mind. Starting from heart which speaker says is a little iron atom which is created only by the supernovas and supermassive stars. Than it leads to the collision of a galaxies, the immeasurable heaven this all process of galaxies joining together, the collision of galaxies colliding, massive star formation process and this all drives creating process of iron which is related to our single heartbeat.Moving to breathe, going back it...

      Marxism holds that all things in the world are interconnected and developing, and this connection is objective, diverse and universal. We can think of this as a correlation of an event's occurrence, which can be translated into a specific probability. And when everything can be digitized, programming can create a virtual world.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we discussed writing code that relies on abstraction with everything connected. One reason for implementing code at the abstraction level stems from security concerns. If a data type contains an abstract member, such as animals, then this member can be a variety of types like dogs or cats, but if a data type contains a relatively concrete member, such as dogs, then the member is relatively fixed not to change. Obviously, abstractions are easier to change, and writing code at the abstraction level helps hide information, thus improving security.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we discussed about the technology in general which is being missed used. According to me, as a coin has two sides everything comes with a positive and a negative side but it depends on us that how we want to use that thing. When a company creates any technology they don't intend to use it in the wrong way. It is the duty of the person using that piece of technology that how it's being used. We also discussed about CIPS.It was an interesting lecture.
    </li><li>
      I found the idea of being mindful of the technology we create an interesting debate. As someone who worked the last few years for an unethical company, and has continued to witness everyone around me deteriorate from unethical practices, I have found that most ARE mindful, but in the end powerless.

      I am looking forward to the presentation of cips and id like to talk about the aspect of privacy coming up again because if we enter any information online it'll get spread. This is usually how scammers get our numbers and emails and so on, and its mainly due to shady sites selling our information. We are living in a very big world where people will go to any length in order to make money and you have to be aware of that and protect yourself. It would be cool to see some ways we can protect ourselves online in...

      To be completely honest, I found the last meeting's question hard to understand. I went into the group discussion but nobody responded which was unfortunate because I would've liked to have some discussion on the topic as I really wasn't sure on it. It did get me thinking though, and returning after the discussion time I got to hear a lot of thoughts that were very different from mine which was nice because there were a lot of things I just hadn't considered. I had kind of thought of it as using a bad metaphor in a way, and especially...

      Professor gave us some insights about CIPS presentation. He also talked about the article “everything is connected” and also gave a reference of a tree, how it has deeper roots and they are connected to stem and branches. It also incorporates how the “internet of things” tech has made itself a culture where all the ordinary objects are connected to internet with the help of sensors, controller and many others. The article also emphasizes on how the future will be for the internet users and how crucial is it to conserve the energy from using this products.
    </li><li>
      The topic of discussion for this meeting was how everything is interconnected and what that means for computing professionals? Should we aim for more connectivity between different things (with the advent of internet of things, we can see where this is heading) or should we aim to bring about abstraction in our approach and render things disconnected for the sake of privacy and abstraction? The breakout room I was in, ended up discussing how the latter is almost impossible with the amount of interconnected applications we already have which care less about our privacy and more about their control on...

      On meeting 18, we’ve discussed an abstraction topic, A popular ted talk video “Everything is connected” shows the connection between everything, the suggestion of this connection may solve the question that troubles humans for thousands of years: “why do we exist?” and the CIPS presentation showed us the influences of the electronic media to the public.
    </li><li>
      I believe that abstraction of information in terms of coding doesn't have to be a problem if everything were to be connected. I mean this in technical terms if we were talking about coding and software itself. Connectivity doesnt mean access should be granted everywhere for a system to function properly.
    </li><li>
      The Internet has undoubtedly changed people's lifestyles and living conditions. In the past, the Internet only stayed at the electronic level. But now the Internet has undoubtedly penetrated into all aspects of people's lives. The Internet of Things is one of the most promising areas in the future. When everything in the world is connected, its efficiency is quite amazing.
    </li><li>
      we talked about CIPS presentation and about article "everything is connected".
    </li><li>
      “How do we deal with everything being connected and still write code that relies on abstraction?”I found the topic somewhat unclear. I’m not entirely sure what is meant with the idea of everything being connected and relating that to abstraction. Abstraction can be used in a program to only present the user with the information they need without overwhelming them. However it is possible for this to be manipulated in negative ways so the programmer has to keep these things in mind.
    </li><li>
      According to me a programmers job is to create program with good intentions but in the end the usage depends all on the user itself and hence he may use to wisely or in a wrong way.

      In class we had a discussion on blog post 2 and the marks of blog post 1. Then we discussed on privacy and sustainability and what is the duty of a computer professional towards making a software sustainable. We had a group discussion where we discussed various aspects of sustainability and how as an individual we can work on it.
    </li><li>
      We discussed about the connections of all the data we have been talking about and how each and everything connects briefly in the lecture.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we were talking about who to hold responsible when coding in abstraction as far as privacy is concerned. I personally think it depends on the situation for instance if it were a program for a company stored on the companies servers I feel like the company should be held responsible.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 18, the important thing is we talking about the presentation on Thursday.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture we discussed about the article "everything is connected" and how it relates to Computer Science in general. Professor also gave us general overview on the CIPS presentation. In the breakout room we discussed how letters play important role and how it is interconnected to the other applications we use.
    </li><li>
       in the last class I enjoyed the discussion about who is to be responsible for coding in abstraction with the concern of privacy and then also say something like you think it really shouldn’t be something that the programmer should be concern with but rather those who the programmer is programming for like if they are working for a company or something
    </li><li>
      Prof in class today talk about the CIPS presentation and talked about the article EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we learned about the computer the major problem of the internet of things which is the security concern apart from that we also discussed in BRooms about that how we deal about each and everything that is related to internet as we also discussed about CIPS presentation.
    </li><li>
      We discussed about how we can write abstract code about the world in which everything is connected. I had some problem understanding this question and how to go about answering it.Meeting 17 response:In meeting 17, we discussed how to write sustainable code and do sustainable business. In my view, sustainability means the way of doing things that can continue without affecting the surroundings negatively
    </li><li>
      Nowadays, with the development of technology, everything is being connected. The connecting things together using technology is also known as Internet of Thing (IoT). With technology, we could create many more machines which is used in many fields, many purposes. Take mobile phone and tax machine as an example. With mobile phone, people could keep in touch with each other. That is one of a tool for connecting people around the world. Moreover, tax machine helps people send document, paper within a minute to the distant place. It could help everything connect more easier. In conclusion, Internet and technology are...

      Designation for information systems professionals; we need to account for social costs and externalities. Our routine is on a monitor and making codes, and no worries where our code will work because we should be proud of our codes. Moreover, we need to care about data abstraction, and the work should not be under discrepancies(beyond our models): a user and a system cohesion. A coder can solve a real problem, and we have an anti-problem model/s for a problem/s. We have the accountability to do the right job at the right time by using the best coding. If more portable...
    </li><li>
      in the last meeting, basically we talked about the data abstraction care. also, about the coder who care about the code and solve any type of problems even real to real problems and make the anti model for those problems. it was really an interesting topic for me. Even though we also discussed about the blog entry 2 which is now due on tuesday night.
