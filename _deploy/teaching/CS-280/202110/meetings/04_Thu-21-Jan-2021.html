      My response on your ques about videos is that the programming is a fun and we have to take inspiration from little coding that we can learn it and make it more interesting and from other video also is that we have to influence from it
    </li><li>
      I am sorry i post the wrong discussion actually it was about the meeting 2 i post later for meeting 3
    </li><li>
      It was nice discussing in depth about each video in points. A suggestion from next class if you can use any text editor instead of writing with a pen in notes it's just easier to read and understand. Overall everything was good and also Dr. Hepting if you can upload course material so we can understand the course in a depth and know what we are going to do in the overall semester.
    </li><li>
      Today we discussed about the conclusions we had about last meeting's two videos. We discussed how everyone should start learning to code and once we do we must find a proper moral framework on using personal user data.
    </li><li>
      Our discussion about choices to permit or deny the collection of user data from a computer system made me think about how these choices are influenced by the nature of the entities that provide the software/hardware/services in question. It seems to be widely understood in the tech sector that data is now a valuable commodity. Since publicly traded, for-profit companies are accountable to shareholders who expect to see the value of the company (and therefore their shares) increase over time, there is a powerful incentive for such companies to collect and monetize data. Open-source software projects supported and managed by...
    </li><li>
      From this meeting I clearly know the syllabus of this course.
    </li><li>
      Hey everyone, here is my response to today’s discussion:Change in viewBefore today's class I thought the two videos 'Code Stars' and 'Moral Operating System' were relatively unrelated. After today's class however, I find the contrast between them really interesting. Code stars can almost be seen as a recruitment drive to try and motivate people to go into development. It highlights many of the more positive aspects of coding, but ignores ethical issues surrounding technology and development - there is 'no moral imperative'. On the other hand, 'moral operating system' brings to light some of the issues with technology, and how...
    </li><li>
      My understanding of computing is that it is the process of using computers to perform unique functions for us because our time is too valuable and computers are much more efficient (when they work). We use them to assist us with achieving more than we could on our own.There are also some creative merits to computing, too, as you could get a computer to create any application that you want.
    </li><li>
      Today was my first class in this course and simply by it alone I can already tell that it is going to be one I find very interesting. From this class I had one topic that stuck with me and that is what are the limits of computing? I know this wasn't discussed directly within the class but when we talked about the programming of the mouse and the creation of things such as Microsoft and twitter, I thought of how far programming could go and what innovations will be the next step for our current generation of programming. Another...
    </li><li>
      Q: WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PURPOSE OF COMPUTING?For me, the purpose of computing is to create tools, software, applications, etc. that will help people (either professional or public) - whether that's to automate a task, offer support or accessibility, meet some kind of need or solve some kind of problem.Q: Talk about something related to today's discussion.I was grateful to the student (sorry, I can't remember who) for mentioning that "Code Stars" felt like a recruitment short. There was some sort of uncomfortable undercurrent that I felt when watching it and I couldn't put my finger on it...
    </li><li>
      While our discussion had a lot of different topics I think I would like to learn more about digital data collection. I, like many people (I would like to think), don't really read the user agreement/private policy/etc. of goods and services I use. In fact, I don't really understanding them, even if I read them. This is potentially very dangerous, as if don't really understand how a particular good and service has used/collected my data (and invaded my privacy), I have not prepared myself on the potential repercussions of my personal data collected (say if that data was hacked). Thus,...
    </li><li>
      When we are talking about a moral operating system, I do not think this is necessary. A moral person will do moral things and someone who is just after money will ignore morals for money. As we see with twitter bans, twitter knows what is wrong however they chose not to ban everyone. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/trump-twitter-account-copy-tweets-glorifying-violence-suspended-a9545831.html The article shows that twitter knew a long time ago that most of what trump was tweeting however did not ban him. So the question then being do we really need a moral operating system? Twitter banned an account that did everything Trump did so therefore...
    </li><li>
      In todays class we talked about the 2 videos that we have watched in last meeting. Professor was asking about our opinion and observation based on the “Code stars” and “Moral operating system” that, what computing is useful for. Many people had many opinions about it. Many of us discussed about their thought on this questions. Some people said: its an expanding industry that’s cross multiple fields, recurring drive, way of creating job opportunities etc. In my opinion computing is a way to express our technological thoughts. There are no limits into it, you can build anything you want by...
    </li><li>
      My opinion of the purpose of computing is a skill. It is a skill that you learned and acquired knowledge over time. Just like in any other field of science or any other profession. It can be used with good intentions such as the first video of the past lecture “Code Stars”, where they overly make it look like coding is just for good purpose only, which is not realistic. It can be used with bad intentions as well, such as hackers. For example, last year, Sask eHealth was under a ransomware attack, and a lot of data about the...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this past meeting is the purpose of computing and software. The purpose of computing and software is to increase productivity and to make our society more efficient. Compared to the past, we can finish many tasks more easily and quickly. With the advancement in computing and technology, there is more opportunity to create innovations and to improve the quality of life. We are able to find and access information instantly and becoming more productive everyday. One interesting question that arose from the meeting was whether a software is about helping people or...
    </li><li>
      Hii everyone the response about the last discussion topics is here,firstly in the last class we were discuss about the last 2 videos that we supposed to watched and doing the discussion about the that topics such as the code stars and the moral operating system. Then after that we get the description about that two topics that are really interesting and have a contrast with each other as that the Code stars can almost be seen as a recruitment to try and it motivate people to go into the development. and as well it highlights many of the more...
    </li><li>
      I found that we didn't cover much in Monday's class beyond what was included in last week's video, but I found the instructor view of UR Courses to be very interesting! :)
    </li><li>
      The purpose of computing is essentially to make our lives easier. Computing has made a lot of aspects of our lives easier such as communicating with people who are far away, and completing complex math problems that take humans quite a while to figure out in a matter of seconds. It has also made storing and retrieving data a lot easier with the sorting and search algorithms. Industries like manufacturing have become almost fully automated due to computing requiring for humans to work less on strenuous tasks. 
    </li><li>
      From my point of view,Computer is a big need of present era. We can't imagine our life without computer. Everything around us is working by computer. Computers are general-purpose information machines that can perform a variety of tasks on data.
    </li><li>
      During the session itself, I found it very interesting seeing the different things that people got from the videos, and was refreshing to see a semi-wide variety of conclusions drawn from it instead of all sharing the exact same thoughts.In terms of what the "Purpose of Coding" is, I think it is a way to solve problems. Whether those be creative or logical problems, it is an outlet for us to find solutions to problems. Whether we are designing compression algorithms to make accessing content online easier to those with poor or limited internet access, utilizing as a creative outlet...
    </li><li>
      From last meeting, we've gone through some brilliant ideas of the video “code stars”. Here’s my thoughts from the last meeting about what is the purpose of computing?From “code stars”:The reasons are the development of industry and the job needed from society. We can see many traditional jobs have been taken by programs, which do more efficiently than human work. It's a trend, there will be more needed jobs requiring computing skills. And not all about jobs, learning computing is not hard as calculus, it’s fun, and easy to get resources online. Software can help people in different ways, to...
    </li><li>
      Watching the two videos posted has put things in a different perspective for me. I never thought of online spaces being compared to real life spaces. The speaker makes some excellent points, these platforms are very lax on structure and don't offer the necessary structure for long term survival. Different applications are different spaces and therefore constitute a different response from users. We need online spaces that reflect real world spaces.The filter bubble video was also very informative. It's true you can't see the big picture if there are gatekeeping algorithms hiding information from you because they don't think it...
    </li><li>
      for me the overall purpose of programing is to make some contribution to another field. a good use of computing is to make something that would otherwise be impossible or too dangerous and make it possible. For example the use of computers to render a visual image of a black hole based solely on the math. the reason that I got into computer science was in partly due to my curiosity of how this device that we spend most of our time interacting with works. but the major reason was to create the program that I perceived to be missing...
    </li><li>
      The lecture started with a discussion about the two videos that we had to watch and a lot of points were put forth by the students about what the main theme of the video was. There was a consensus between majority of the students, that the 1st video was a recruitment drive, inviting people to learn to code and highlighting how it is as simple as picking up a brush and starting to paint. It showed a picture of how there will be shortage of computer science graduates in the upcoming years compared to the number of jobs that will...
    </li><li>
      We discussed the purpose of computing. I believe multiple reasons affect me in why I want to do computing. First, it is a growing industry, it can be applied in nearly every field, and can find a job with well paid. Secondly, it offers a lot of things that what we can be computing on. It also has the power to change the world such as AI. Computing has the power to create things from our imagination.For the moral operating system, I believe it is a really hard thing to do. Because people's perception of what is moral and what...
    </li><li>
      Well from what I learn from the lecture on is on how there are so many different responsibility and on how theres so much going on.
    </li><li>
      In my opinion the purpose of computing as I understand and see it — is ultimately to solve problems. When we code and make programs and the like, we typically have an end goal in mind. Be it mathematical, scientific, or something creative. Computers can do what we as humans would rather not do, which is repetitive tasks, be it dozens, hundreds, thousands or even millions of times. To use a topical example, suppose you wanted to model COVID-19 and its spread - sure you could sit down, crunch some numbers, and plot a little graph yourself - but why...

      When first deciding which field of study to pursue in university, I was unsure about Computer Science. I was under the assumption that the evolution of computers would dominate the future and was weary about what this would look like. However, upon taking a web-design course in high school and thinking critically about my goals, I realized that, if computers are to shape the future, why not be part of creating the future that I wish to see? I decided to take what seemed like an unknown path at the time, and I see the immense benefit in that decision...

      As for "beware online filter bubbles", Web companies will adjust services according to people’s personal preferences, like different people search same item at website, the output of results are total different. We hope that the web company can let everyone set their own personal preferences.And for "what obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good", social media is already indispensable for everyone. We can learn about the latest news or news happening around us from the Internet. Anyone can post a message on social media to let others know you more fully.

      Computing is any objective-arranged action requiring computers to manage, and process communication/information handled by a person. Computing creates an environment to design and build software and application programs for a wide range of its own purposes which could be processing, and also managing various types of information. Moreover, there are different contexts in which the term “Computing” have been used based on specifics. Computing itself deals with mathematical concepts, it follows an endless systematic algorithm concept. In reference to the Babylonians in 2400BC, the earliest tool used for computation was known as the abacus. The main purpose of “Computing” is...

      In meeting 3 , we talked about the two videos(code star), as what is computer programming and its answered as that programming is something like instructing the computer, what to do and the morals of computing like maintaining privacy. The discussion was about the purpose of computing. My understanding of the purpose of computing is basically, performing all the logical calculations in seconds, storing large amounts of data and developing new software to help out the whole world . And the main purpose for studying computing is to being updated with the new technical techniques as nowadays its all about...
    </li><li>
      From the last lecture I got to know about the course outline. I got to understand the purpose of computing also about the moral adapting system.

      It was really help ful
    </li><li>
      From the last discussion I found coding to be a very powerful tool. You can be from any profession but still you can become a programmer. Computer technology is growing to a vast extent. I learnt about the growing opportunities in the field of computers. Computer technology deals with benefits and risks both.
    </li><li>
      Hi, in my opinion the purpose of computing is the not difficult and not all about the math too and, computing is that it is the process of using computers to perform unique functions because time is too valuable and computers are more efficient.
    </li><li>
      Thoughts on Filter Bubbles and ObligationsThe first video is a snippet of a TED Talk presented by Eli Pariser, and the inventor of the term “filter bubble”. Eli is a political activist presenting interesting thought points on the internet and its role in our society today. His points go further and reach out to how certain companies have changed the internet by monetization or recording data from its users to feed into internal machine learning models, and how that affects the end user’s mental, and political state of thought. Parsier easily communicates the concept of how these online companies have...
    </li><li>
      My understanding of the purpose of computing would be that of the development of either hardware or software that helps in making certain tasks easier for us. In all our daily lives we all have things we really don't feel like doing or wish someone else could do for us and this is where I believe computing comes in. The development of things like washing machines, dryers, cars etc. all came as a result of this so as to make things like washing clothes and travelling easier.
    </li><li>
      In our meeting 3, We discussed about the 2 videos that we watched in meeting 2. We went through the videos in details and professor took the opinions from all the students. After that, we briefly went through the syllabus. Professor also asked us to answer this question “What is your understanding of the purpose of computing”. My understanding of computing is that computing is an necessary to our day to day life. Now a days computers are everywhere such as; school, collages, hospitals, work places, supermarkets and more. Computer made our life easier. We can’t imagine having our life...

      Previous videosAs per video code star:we can say that there are huge opportunities for those are in the field of computer as there are multiple uses. The developer should make the application or program with the consideration of users. Concept of helping people creates the feeling of humanity.I learned about the opportunities and concept of humanity in development of software. As per video Moral operating system:we can say that it is hard to make decision to break the rule of personal privacy to protect humanity as it involves the ethics and etiquettes. So, it is hard to get to decision as...

      I think one major importance of computers and the internet is that they allow people from all over the world to communicate with each other. This provides many benefits to most people but it also has some downsides. Criminals can communicate with each other and conduct illegal activities over the internet. Finding out about and stopping these activities can involve invading the privacy of innocent people which is a huge ethical dilemma. I believe privacy is very important and I am interested to know some of the leading opinions on dealing with this issue.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing you learned from this past meetingComputing is the essential part of the last meeting. I learned that every sector globally is growing and handling the complex systems we need to make things more effortless and secure. Learners can also benefit from it like mastery, and it has no limit anytime and anywhere. According to Pastori, "Do what makes a lot of money, do what a lot of people use" means a person should play over the public's interest. Softwares in the market -Softwares are about happening people and solving real-life puzzles.The concept from this past meeting...
    </li><li>
      My take on purpose of computing is basically to solve issues. There are lots of places where we can apply computing, from industry to day to day lives. In each situation new set of problems appear and by computing we can fix those issues. Now, in general sense, computing is basically working and playing with information, to calculate, to understand and apply data. But these information is not something completely isolated. Each of these data, calculation and understanding helps us to solve a problem, create something new or improve existing technology. So I think in the end of the day,...
    </li><li>
      According to my understanding, the purpose of computing is to make human life easier and better. It also includes various kinds of purpose regarding information processing, structuring and managing. We can gather the information on anything of our need, and this can be possible through programmed data. In the field of technology, computer science is the department which helps us to know the way in which technology works and the way in which software engineering is changing the world for everyone.
    </li><li>
      Computing is a tool of creativity. The purpose of computing is to expand the variety of things can be done in the industry. It is really helpful to people and everyone can use it too. Computing is limitless, you can create whatever you want to create with it. The interesting thing is that its not that difficult if you really understand the basics like as said in lecture not all math, you can simply use logic in it too. The softwares are really about making things easy to people. Computing is designing and building hardwares, softwares for various purpose. It's...
    </li><li>
      One of the question raised in the class was: What is your understanding of the purpose of computing? I think the purpose of computing is to make our life as simple/smarter as possible which includes helping people in the process.
    </li><li>
      We learned and had a good conversation about the two videos which was helpful and motivational. That is we can use computer in many every field and is very helpful. But we also have to take in note that we don’t breach the privacy of any person by using technology we have. Indeed computer programming is the best field for me and this video helps us feel motivated.
    </li><li>
      The purpose of computing is to have solution of every problem.In this world of technology, the advanced computing system has gives us many opportunities to fulfill our dreams.Human can make mistake, but computer don't. The algorithm helps us to know how machine works and solve problems.The computer science is not longer just a vocational for getting job instead it is completely foundational for getting any job. The tech industry is fast growing and there is no greater opportunity to change the world through technology as it is effecting every field. It's not only about computing device but also medicine, space...

      starting with the ted talk on beware of bubble filters, this is something that is well known to a lot of individuals in recent time. Most social Media pages are tailor made to suite what an individual would is most likely to want to see on his timeline and they avoid things we don't want to see. Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are all the top media app that use the bubble filter. Honestly, I don't mind the bubble filter cause it narrows it down to what I want to see and the one major trouble individuals have with the...
    </li><li>
      The purpose of computing is to evolve world. Computing gives opportunity to humans what they can’t do just by man labour. Computing makes innovation limitless. Though its our responsibility to decide what we do with this opportunity. Its very similar to a man possessing a rifle, he can either use that to save people or he can do evil by killing innocents. For me, I’ve been into gaming from my childhood and it just fascinates me to see how computers can make those virtual worlds. Learning computing will help me answer those questions and open new doors for me.

      the last meeting was focused on the various aspects of risk and reward and for a major share of the lecture i got the knowledge about the cyber crime.
    </li><li>
      Question from meeting 3: "What is your understanding on the purpose of computing?"The purpose of computing is to perform calculations, process various information, and store/retrieve data on a scalable level. The ability to compute created businesses, some of which are now the most profitible and powerful in the world (google, for example), as well as brough forth an unprecedented level of scientific research and discovery. For instance, we never would have seen the first image of a black hole without immense computing power. We would have not seen many amazing discoveries without the power of modern computing. Lastly and perhaps...

      Hello"Beware online filter bubbles" by Eli Pariser talks about this online filters that are created by complex algorithms to create a tailored experience for user. He explains it as a filter bubble and tells everyone to beware of it because it is filtering the content based upon what algorithm thinks we like rather that what we really like, in fact controlling the internet for us. Many companies like Facebook and google are doing it without even user knowing about it. To explain this he took the example of his Facebook account which shows him filtered content. In addition to that...
    </li><li>
      I think the biggest thing I took from the discussion was the contrast between the two videos. Computer science is often portrayed as a very innovative and even sort of hip thing, with all these cool offices and startups and such. The problems of privacy are another very big thing and are talked about frequently as they're a huge concern, but I've never really seen them put together and the topic of privacy really isn't brought up much when learning about computer sciences and such which I had really never noticed. These issues have everything to do with computer programming...
    </li><li>
      I think that computing is very important in the present time and that each one of us should learn about computing because our day starts with it and also ends with it. It helps us to better connect with people, help them by making software beneficial for them and create a benchmark in the technological world.I want to learn more about computing because computing is an endless world. Every day we can learn more about it, discover more about it but still, there would be a huge portion left to know about. 
    </li><li>
      In meeting 3 we discussed as a group the videos we watched in meeting 2, like how in video one it talks about how great a job in computer science can be with its good pay work environment and how there is a lot of opportunity. One person noted that it leaves out the bad of computer science.then in video 2 they discuss data collection and how far we should go in collecting that data is it morally right to do so.
    </li><li>
      The third meeting is all related to our real life activities. The first video, beware online filter bubbles is very much true and the same things happen with me all the time not only on google but also on other social platforms like Instagram. it is true that internet shows us the things that it thinks that want to see not the things that we should see or know. the thing i learnt from this video is that web is not standard anymore. it will show us the results basis on our previous searches.the second video is quiet similar it...

      For me, computing has many purposes. Some of these are listed below:1. To drastically reduce the time it takes to do complex calculations2. To reduce or eliminate the repetitive tasks that humans have to do so they can focus on things that cannot be accomplished by machines3. To empower people to create4. To help solve real problems faced by the modern civilizationMy purpose of studying computing is to learn about all the super cool things that go with it, be it AI, machine learning, IT infrastructure, cybersecurity, etc. And learn how different computing technologies can be applied to solve various...

      1. the most important thing you learned from this past meeting- what is potential of computer science, in next few years- important for everyone to learn coding- profit vs ethics2. the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understandhow can we choose between ethics and profit, in a particular situation what we can do, should we hinder someone’s privacy to make profit or not3. what you would like to know more aboutunderstanding moral operating system in detail, and how can we use technology so it does not empower us.4. something you encountered that is...

      My understanding of the purpose of computing is process, store and data. Process and store are common "couple" in most people's understanding that are never accept formal CS introduction. And I like to visualize things when I first time meet them, In all of my CS class, I can say none of them are not trying to describe computer/ computing is base on a human brain to me. Same as I, when we thinking-is same as process, when we memorize things is consider as store, and the event or knowledge that we memorize are data. But human brain is limited,...
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting I get to know more about what Computing is and why is it necessary and all. But the new and most important thing that I learned was about filter bubble. Before watching that video I had no idea about anything going like this in my surroundings. And now I also think this is a problem which is also somewhat related to ethics and this needs to be resolved. We think that we can get complete information about something we search for from google but in the reality we are not getting any information in a proper...
    </li><li>
      Studying computing solves different aspects of problem related to business, science and social context. Computing helps open up great opportunities for innovative ideas.
    </li><li>
      In my opinion, the purpose of computing, is like collecting data, storing the data, doing the calculations and so on. For the word of computing, it is already existing in world for thousands of years. Computing benefits people in many things whether count how many money earned today or population census. In the world right now, since we can easily find a calculator or computer, computing is more like a computer things. It can be used on analysis data or even predicted data. With the help of machines, computing is becoming more complex. So there are different computing right now...

      The purpose of computing is to make life easier. Computers can make our life's easier by doing many things such as completing repetitive tasks, dangerous tasks, calculating long complex calculations, storing data, sorting data, forecasting etc. I find that even though computers have made our lives easier, the use of this technology by greedy corporations has also made us mental slaves. For Example: Many people are addicted to the use of social media platforms. These platforms have a huge impact on our lives, they can influence people into doing crazy things.I am studying computing because computers are used in every...

      It is really crucial of one to know how to code in this era, the technology is evolving. The only way we stay with pace of the world is by coping with it. Coding is one of the most important way to cope up. It helps to increase the productivity, helps to connect to the internet and also help to make a program which might represent your surroundings. Therefore, it is easy to learn.The aim of the exercise was to show that while most people can embrace their favorite smartphone instantly, far less can understand the moral values that underlie...

      The most interesting aspects of last meeting were the fact that coding is a tool for many different ways to impact the lives of others. Not only that, but the first video could be seen as hyper-positive. The up-side to coding, and jobs in coding, was the only side brought up. What's more is they used the trendiness of the workspace to try and encourage people to become coders as well. Again, like the first meeting, the ethics of data collection was talked about, and is something I would like to learn more about.
    </li><li>
      My understanding of the purpose of computing is that it is instrumental. Like a music instrument, computing takes time to learn and requires lots of practice. However, with comuputing you can get creative in terms of design and purpose similar to how with an instrument can be used to make different music and portray different purposes.

      For this lesson, we have discussed What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?What is your purpose in studying computing? In my understanding, the essence of Computing is to help human to better complete data analysis and processing, which can make our study and work further improve efficiency.I learned Computing because I was interested in logic and processing. The program is just like mathematical formula, which can clearly deal with different types of computing problems.Then we think of privacy issues, according to the articles and video data, more and more people are concerned about the privacy of the Internet,...

      After looking at the first video, I encounter the term filter bubble. This is a state of intellectual isolation created by popular social media and personalized search sites. As a consequence, consumers become separated from knowledge that conflicts with their perspectives. The database algorithm maintains a record of information, such as past click actions, search history, etc., and then, according to the primary priority of the user, it selectively determines which content will be presented to the user. In this way, people are being effectively isolated in their own cultural or ideological bubbles according to what they would like to...

      The purpose of computing according to my opinion is for the advancement of humankind. It is to make humankind independent and self-reliable. Computing is now eases our day-to-day life routines and makes space travel possible. Artificial intelligence progressed due to high-end technology and computing. Thus the purpose of computing is for the betterment of the society.
    </li><li>
      Computing to me is to program or code various machines and software to invent new things and refine existing ones to make the earth a better place. it is a superpower available to everyone with which we can make lives better and sustainable. One thing that could be improved in future meetings is if only our professor could type his notes instead of writing because I am not able to understand any written notes.
    </li><li>
      What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?To solve problems or create convenience through information searching and retrieval, entertain or distract with games or social networking, and above all make money.What is your purpose in studying computing?I have a need to create and a desire to solve problems. With an ever-growing interest in the world of tech, I feel compelled to learn how to code and be my own boss. Our world continues to be shaped by technology and I no longer want to be just another user.

      The purpose of computing goes way back to the time of World War 2. Alan turning created the turning machine in order to encrypt the enigma code. He is said to be the father of computer science for creating algorithms to solve complicated problems. We are programmers who use coding as a tool to solve real-world problems and to make life easier. We as a computer scientist create machines which help us do a lot of repetitive work as well as high-level thinking as supercomputers. Supercomputers can calculate billions of arithmetic in a matter of seconds. Computing helps to achieve...
    </li><li>
      Q: What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?A: To me the purpose of computing is like the purpose of being a Doctor or a Lawyer or really any sort of profession. Some people might be in it for the money or the social esteem but at the same time there is a great opportunity to help people. At the end of the day Computer Scientists are really creating tools for people to use, but that doesn't mean that those tools are always going to be helpful or cause more good than harm. Computing is just like anything in...

      computing has a very vast use from simple machine like microwave to the international space station. computing makes thee life easy, by just clicking few buttons. learning computing is not very hard, it is very easy if you understand how it is works. It has reduced reputation of human work to low percent. It helps to solve complication problem with the help of creating algorithms and managing data.

      Meeting 3 we discussed the two videos from meeting 2 and we learned that based on a teacher's claim his students improved by 30% after they used code. The first video was mostly about bringing famous and successful people from Facebook, Twitter and other platforms to talk about coding. WE learned that people who know how to code are more creative and successful and there is a lot of jobs will be available but less people are interested in the field. Second video talked about ethics and how we should make decision as a developer on things such as handling...

      The class was highly emphasized on the purpose of computing such as to build software. The initial discussion was on the code stars and moral operating system. This semester I am also taking CS 330 which is introduction to operating system and I so that the reason why the dissucsion about operating system was more realistic for me. The professor had given us important knowledge about the moral operating system and the thing which I liked most was that he was so excited and interested in knowing the views about the code stars from the stand which was a motivation...

      Computing is an action that requires, takes benefit of, or creates computing machines. It contains studying and testing mathematical operations and developing both hardware and software. It has scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological and social aspects. Major computing majors include computer engineering, computer science, cybersecurity, data science, information systems, information technology, and software engineering. The drive of the Computing is executing calculations, store information, retrieve data and process information. A computer has programmed data or computer language that tells the computer how to fulfil its purpose. The computer will only do what it is programmed to do.

      Social media is/has become such a massive impact on our lives and each year it gets stronger. To developed such a world changing platform is amazing, at the same time scary. These people who can do things as amazing have the most powerful deck of cards. Each day we grow and grow. I hope to making something world changing myself but hopefully not the path of a social media since it brings harm to some and censorship is a problem that a code cant pick up on/ my understanding of the purpose of computing is to make my life, and...

      The first video shows how we are being controlled by internet and how the personalized life which is provided to us by default is dangerous for us. Our future is at a risk of not being more explored and internet ends up controlling our future personality instead of letting us to evolve, shrinking our brain evolution to zero.The second video shows the behavioural differences in human beings and how social media research results shows us the content that they want us to see following the social norm and classes. They follow according to the classifications and shows us the contents....

      From the last meeting, we discussed the purpose of computing. We were asked about what that means to us and from my perspective, the purpose of computing is to share information with others. A network of networks to distribute and gain access to information all around the world. The idea was to further mankind in ways we never could before because before we had the internet, people had to use phones or books which caused a lengthy amount of time to further their knowledge to tackle new issues. Today everyone has access to the internet and the moment we need...

      I found the ted talk about social media platforms especially interesting. I know that social media is a very central part of many people's lives, especially with limited physical interaction during a pandemic. It is important to realize the power that the corporations behind these social media platforms have over their users, so that we can use them better. I especially liked the idea of thinking of a social media platform as a "space" for sharing, like a city of people working together to build their community in the way they want it. I do not use social media very...

      In our class discussion, the concept of "what programming means to you" was brought up and over the last few days. I have really been thinking about what it means to be a programmer and why I decided to pursue programming as a career. For me it is really about how open the computer science field is. As technology continues to advance, the need for programmers and those who understand the various subjects of development is continuing to grow. The options are unlimited for programmers and that versatility is something I have always desired. Not only that, but the ability...

      In my opinion, computing has various of purposes in the modern world nowadays. It could connect people around the world together. It could be a useful tool for many fields in the world today. For instance, it could help people calculate many things. It could be a software that people can utilize it, for example in the factory, in hospital, in restaurant, in studio and so on. Currently, computing is essential for everyone. It creates more works for many people. It also a source of entertainment for people to relax after working.For me, my purpose of studying computing, firstly, is...

      In meeting three, we discussed the videos about the code stars and moral operating system. Also, we talked about the purpose of computing and how everything worked. Professor also discussed the morals of computing and privacy. My take on the purpose of computing that it is an essential skill to learn in this modern world of technology. It gives us access to the worldwide net, where we can connect with people and learn about their ideas and experiences throughout the world. The purpose of learning to compute is to developed new software and hardware which can further help in solving...
    </li><li>
      In todays class I found how these two videos code stars and moral operating system are related to each other.I also find difference between both of them.Code Stars showing the benefit of become a developer.It show only positive side of this technology and ignoring the ethical issues behind the industry.However,other video shows us the information regarding some ethical issues with this technology.
    </li><li>
      computers are able to perform logical calculations even the calculation which takes years to compute takes very less time in computer which helps to calculate those things which are impossible if done without computer computing this shows us how computers will help us in future to discover new things which are otherwise impossible
    </li><li>
      In meeting 3 we basically discussed about cyber crime, we learn that the fight against cyber crime has always been important as it assures the integrity and credibility of the systems. We also discussed about the purpose of computing system. I mean its basically creating something that is user friendly and serves the purpose of making things easier for the intended person. Interesting point where you question yourself as to not only how but why? Why are we doing what we are doing, everything serves a purpose and so does computing. Coming back to cyber crime, privacy and security are...

      Utilitarian moral framework:This has to do with measuring out which choice is better and knowing how to make the best choice at the given time.Millian consequentialist: This is a term used that judges if something is right or not by its consequences.Kantian deontological moral framework: rules to distinguish between what is right or wrong.From the second video, the term “Framework” was strongly defined, and its types were made clear alongside the concepts which were Kantian deontological moral framework, Millian consequentialist and Utilitarian moral framework.
    </li><li>
      CS 280-001Prof. Hepting19 January 2021Meeting 3 discussionIn this discussion I will discuss the purpose of computer and understanding of purpose of computer from the Code star video and Moral operating system video in the upcoming paragraphs.From the code star video, purpose of computing is to deliver the information that helps to entertain the people as well as this helps to develop a strong bond with friends, families and so on. The computing allows to expanding the industry. this helps to make a lot of money by developing apps that most of the people use. The computer industry hires thousands of...
    </li><li>
      My view on the purpose of studying computing:I believe people study computing for various reasons, most especially to be able to solve challenging and complex problems. There are also people who study computing because they would like to make a positive difference in the world by being creative.I decided to study computing because I would love to learn new skills. I believe the use of technology is part of our future and by studying a course like computer science it can help me make a great impact in the world.
    </li><li>
      Computing for me is a system built to make our everyday tasks a little bit easier. Every day, we find ways to make our daily tasks easier and more comfortable to do; computing is just one of the most efficient methods we have created. From our workplaces to our transportation and back at our different homes, there are computers there making things easier for us and it keeps getting better as time goes on.My primary purpose in studying computer science is to solve problems. There are always problems around, in scientific, business, and social contexts. it is our responsibility as...
    </li><li>
      I think the purpose of computing is using computer programs to help people to solve problems, and bring convenience to life.
    </li><li>
      For me, coding is a tool used for creating art. Much like an artist using paint and brushes on a canvas. At this point in my experience with computer science and coding, I wouldn't say that I've encountered a situation where I found myself creating something that would require a moral framework. Of course I will encounter this in the future when my work is able to reach and affect more people. I'm looking forward to learning more about what I can do as a programmer to think about the influence my creation has on other people. While thinking about...
    </li><li>
      I liked the "Code Stars" video a lot. I think it delivered an important message and I agree with the idea that coding should be a basic skill for people &amp; not something restricted for people in that particular field. As technology advances everything is being automated through the use of computers &amp; obviously when there is a piece of hardware there has to be a software which is operating on that hardware - coding becomes more and more important as we advance IMO. Ergo, knowing how to code would prove to be useful for everyone this way or that.As...

      Nowadays, people cannot live without computers in every aspect of their lives, so computers' future is auspicious. There are five Purposes of computing.(1) people need computing for recreational activities, such as watching movies, listening to music, playing various games, communicating and making friends, etc. And, There is no doubt that computing brings people a high experience in entertainment. For example, more and more realistic games bring real experience to people.(2) People often use computing for numerical calculation, so computers are widely used in scientific research, engineering technology, and other aspects. In general, most people have used computers to do accounts.(3)...
    </li><li>
      My understanding of the purpose of computing is slim when overlooking the vast utilization of modern technology. Generally speaking, my understanding is that the purpose of computing is either to simplify manual processes or to create something new. For example, it simplifies things such as building and maintaining a database, communicating with others locally and globally, and running through a great number of processes in a short amount of time.I'd say that if I needed to solve one hundred math equations, it would be easier for me to build a program to solve them for me. I believe that concept...
    </li><li>
      In my opinion computing, it is a goal-oriented activity which helps us to think in a different way, it led to the advancement of humanity.Computing is used in each and every fields nowadays.In the class, we discussed the two videos which were 'Code Star' and 'A Model Operating System'.The first videos motivated about learning the code and the second suggests that we need a model operating system which knows the difference between right and wrong.
    </li><li>
      Meeting 3 was all about filter bubbles and their affect on common people. The internet is providing us the information that it thinks we want to see. It has started working same as Facebook or other social sites like when we search for any thing it keeps us showing the same kind of results for the next time. it has created a sense of isolation for the searchers or internet surfers. the difficult thing for me to understand was the reason behind the concept of filter bubbles.
    </li><li>
      The video 1 gives you an idea about programming. Its basically you teaching the computer to do things for you. Its a process of breaking down the problems. Its a way to express your creativity. One thing specifically draw my attention was "You don't have to be genius to learn how to code, you just have to be determined." Whereas video 2 highlights how to utilize this power ethically once we have it. How to use the data we collect constructively and by maintaining the privacy.
    </li><li>
      Computing for me can be said to be an introduction to a brand new dimension. We have been using the latest technology for years now without even knowing what reasons are they created for and how are they created. Keeping the learning portion on the side, the engagement to the computing lets us deal with the creator side of the tech we have been using. Of course the factor of security, privacy, improved experience, money, and many other things matter. But the greatest factor for today's generation is socializing.
    </li><li>
      the most important thing you learned from this past meeting-&gt; Purpose of Computing and Moral ethics to followthe concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand-&gt; What should be the ethics of code in Computing Businesswhat you would like to know more about-&gt; Security against the purpose of computingsomething you encountered that is related to the past meeting-&gt; What Purpose of Computing really stands for
    </li><li>
      We discussed the purpose of computing and discussed how computing can be used almost everywhere and it has endless possibilities. Also, we discussed how we should use computing for good causes and to benefit people in the society. Then we lead to talk about a moral operating system which will not be selfish like some of the applications and operating systems which collect way more than the data that is needed without the user being fully aware of it.
    </li><li>
      In this lecture we just discussed about the two videos from prior meeting. In the first video 'Code stars' , we get to know that coding is not all difficult, its a fun and we can make a lot of money in this field. From the second video we learned privacy is important although with this superpower of computing we can get access to everything but there should be limit. And my answer for the understanding of computing is that computing can make our work more easy and we can introduce many new technologies with its help.

Inspired by Eli policies video about Paris. Video about Social online spaces. I've been working on. Little see the opportunity for some improvements in the online space for the course. That I've created Yes, I'm going to get to the password for your attendance. Concerned people those attendance. So let's deal with that first so So, Let me just share that with you, first of all, Share your password with you. posted it in the chat. And let me know if anyone has. Problems with it. Finding the attendance activity. Screen.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Professor is today. The first day where we're taking attendance.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Have a question.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Um, it's the password going to be for like every session or it changes.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, I'm Gonna Be generated randomly each time.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Will need to go through this I don't want to make it a big deal that A colleague suggested that having just a few minutes have it open for just a few minutes. Now, not for the whole session. But then I'm not sure how to How to handle that through smoothly. And I'm not trying to make this
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Punitive
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Could you Maybe have like a time link on your courses that opens with the password. That just might be easier than posting it in chat or something.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I'm not sure about that. I said, I think it has something to do with I guess I'm not eager to spend a few hours trying to experiment with your courses about something that isn't, it isn't. Isn't going to be
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, no worries.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;What's the word. I don't know. So the thing is, I have to create all these Semester I begin with A very positive outlook on what I'm going to be able to set up a new our courses. And then it My enthusiasm fades, a little bit, not for the course, not for dealing with all you wonderful students But Finding the right now are Getting your courses to do What I think is reasonable. Anyway, that's a long Long story with not much To do with the class. So I will try it out. So my feeling is We'll keep the Keep the attendance period, the same for the whole class and then I'll just post the password. Each time Okay, we'll see how it works. trouble finding this place. My screen there, record your meetings. Can I look at report with you on screen with me.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yep.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I'm curious if I can use it set myself up as a student. Okay, so here's the view that you get as a student look familiar, that says, Submit attendance.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Here.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I find that interesting. Who is who's going to log in and record themselves as absent. anyone understand the situation for that one.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe work for classes of smaller capacity, like maybe like 30 students
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Capacity classes. Was like, if it just model capacity class maybe the professor would be able to keep track of each and every student, but in our class, for example, it's 150 students. It wouldn't make sense to have the apps and option.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Because there's no way you'd be able to drag each and every student
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, no, I just meant. I don't think students are going to, I could I could record people as absent. If I'm taking attendance. But I'm I'm just saying students to give students the option to record themselves as absent after they login connectivity is kind of funny. I thought Oh, here I am, I'm absent today. Anyway, It's just funny to me sitting here. And I sense. It's not funny to anybody out there unless I see a lot of Check the chat. See if I have any Anyone else thinks it's funny. Okay. Oh, there we go. Thanks. Will do for attendance in some form. We'll see how it goes. Let me switch to the class. Okay. So I did have the syllabus across yesterday, but then I realized it didn't have the link your courses running to it. So here's a PDF From my website. The dates are correct and the links are working to So there'll be Talking about assignments. The first assignment first individual assignment would be Do on Thursday, February 11 in three weeks. That's to write A blog post. And I have a description. I just, I just need to get it. Turned on again. Sorry. I'll do that. Today I I planted it today or possibly tomorrow morning. Topics. Yeah. 123459 Units. Knowledge areas. So the SP is Knowledge. Area, and then the social context, for example, is the knowledge area. Click there then we see Learning outcomes. So you can pick whatever Pick something from this list of My Mac Book is having Some issues have crashed on me yesterday. And then I call I tried to put a call to support and they gave him my phone number and settle kairos in two minutes and I didn't hear from them. And that was completely unexpected for Apple. Expected to hear some kind of Response but We'll try it again next week. So anyway, write a blog post and I'm going to have a sound of a sample. Ready for you. Are included with the description and I'll send a note when that comes up. So there's these three assignments. So there's a blog post about A topic of your choosing from this list of topics. Or From this list of knowledge areas. And our knowledge unit. You can find one that's connected To the topic here. I want correct myself again. So we'll just say topic, pick a topic from this Collection here on the web page. And then we have A project that can be a research paper. Can be done in groups, small groups of your choosing. Okay, so sorry, I thought I turned off direct messaging. Okay. So majority have a question, would like to rate. So, It's not about the videos per se. It's not about Can include the videos. Idea is to write a response. Following the meeting and see if I can change that wording a bit better. It just happened. So here we're talking about meeting for So for meeting for what's the most important thing you learned from this meeting. Like that could be something That that you include in your response. If there's a concept from the meeting that was marred. It was difficult for you to understand What was it What would you like to know more about Something you encountered thats related to the past meeting. So meeting for if there's a link or the story that Came up Filter. Topical thing. These days, And so is this discussion about How to improve social networking platforms in The kind of responsibility. So speaking about your courses. I think for me to get the desired effect from From this meetings for my need to make them make a forum for each meeting. And so the idea is for you to Post things Until you have until midnight as a day before the next meeting. So for today's meeting you could post a response. Until midnight of Monday. Well, practically midnight. So to make sure it's Monday. Is one minute to midnight. On Monday. Okay, so I gave you a option to say your understanding of the purpose of computing That could be a one of you. It could be your response. Yeah, so I'm not looking for specific right answer I'm looking For things that came out of The meeting. You're able to really send me direct messages.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Dr happening. If we If we wrote about those two videos that you linked under meeting three, is that OK. Enough for engagement or
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so that's fine. I'm not asking for a full summary of the videos. I Everyone's concerned about marks. I'm not sure how to make this clear. Okay. So just somebody say I reset the chat to send to everybody. So I said stop sending direct messages. Because the person who is sending me direct messages. Now, is no longer in the meeting. I sent that I tried to sit return to stop sending direct messages to that person and then zoom told me, they're not in the meeting anymore. So I'm just sending it to blanket to everybody. Because even though I'm selecting Participants can Chat with everyone publicly It's not stopping direct messages. And I would like to make sure that comments, get out to everybody. And I put a smiley face at the end so Just to set the pro not to make it too. Too much For someone just send me a direct message like this. Yes. So don't do that. So I don't know what Zoom is good for in this case because it says I'm able to give the impression I can set something to to not allow them, but they still keep coming. So please be aware that you're Huh. Anyway, okay, so
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;It's
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;almost halfway into class here. So let's try and progress a little bit So I, I put those two videos in to the Into the meeting. Summary from last day. So really, Date of birth, they don't post deal with filter bubbles. But the second one is certainly An important topic.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, you said that there's videos for today, but they weren't. Where were they
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;There at the end of the last day summary.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;In the future, is that where those are going to go. Are they going to be under the plan for today, like they were in for the week two meetings are they going to be in one place over the other, they can kind of be moving around.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so that was my comments at the beginning about rethinking how I'm organizing things online. I was thinking that Instead of having to different places for things And I will Restructure things so that I'm just Making notes about meetings in one place. So if I look over here. Came up here. When you look at a data. So there you have the last day can be a summary. Show this summary shown as a summary, but the plan for today can show that this is an outline I'm Kind of in the middle here. strat and trying to take the feedback from last semester. To make things more transparent and to Make things More accessible. So I was going to be consistent with this. Maybe I could knit call this next meeting. Instead of a subject here sort of a topic there. I could see next meeting.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it just makes more sense to me for have like the plan for next meeting before where we can go to, like, get ready for the next meeting. So we have the videos there as well as the topics will be discussing Versus having that in the summary for the previous day because I see the summary, the previous day more of a What, what do we talked about last class for writing up the summaries. You go into it. Look at the notes and get refresh on it doesn't make a lot of sense to have the next week's classes and the previous day's stuff as much
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Sure. Okay. Here. New client. Up screen. saw someone raise your hand, Jennifer. I didn't mean to scare you away. Part two Okay, so here, let me in Poland, I'll share it. So about 5050 Certainly more than 50% didn't see it. Okay, so What I'll do then is I will not Put next meeting stuff into the summary of the previous meeting, but I'll put it into the plan. For the next day. Okay. Please stop sending direct messages. In chat. Okay. Thanks. So just, it seems like the setting in zoom to disallow, it doesn't work. And I would just rather not have the conversation directed at me. Okay. Okay, so let me take some time to Start a breakout room here breakout rooms for us. So because I'm not doing registration for meetings and not everybody is Using their year Jana dresses. I have a feeling it's going to be difficult to do a breakout groups. So what I'd like to you to think about is I'm going to put you together with See Many Around five other people Maybe See what options. I can do. But anyway, so it just like you to spend some time to discuss amongst yourselves. What is The purpose of competing for you. And does that Require moral framework to support it. Makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, that sounds about right. That makes sense to me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Alright, so here we go into our random breakout rooms. actually create Will create breakout rooms. Okay, so you're gonna be put into a breakout room and then And then about 10 minutes call Bring us back and then we can Discuss so we Discuss what came up And Go from there. Okay, so here we go. Any questions, I see a couple people coming out of breakout rooms. Daniel row hand. You should. For those of you who have come out of the room. I don't need to reassign it to the room, but you can Join Should be able to join on your own. Discussions about, well, you can ask what the discussion is when you're in the room. All right.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Hi Dr have 10 looks like no one in my breakout room is just talking at all.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Which breaker where you're in
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;A Dean one eight
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, there's somebody in the room normal I'm not sure.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I'm just Ready to close the rooms. Now, so we'll talk about somebody Pick up Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Because there were a couple people are there in my room and then just like no one was just talking no one at their minds on our video nothing
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;All right. So we'll talk about that. I'm just going to close the rooms now. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, sir. You're welcome.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;It wasn't bad.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;It wasn't bad. Okay, so Let's see, for breakout rooms that we have Video on and microphones on We're dealing with five or six people. I think That can be reasonable. reasonable expectation So you don't need microphones on For the For the main meeting room me main meeting room, but we can To encourage chat. And to encourage discussion so cameras. Cameras on all without microphones are Welcome for the main meeting room but As you say cameras on and microphones on for the breakout room. That's the expectation, so that People don't Sit there and Wonder what you're supposed to be doing, and nobody's talking and nobody see seeing each other. So I heard about one or two groups that Had problems that were or were there were other people in the group, but no one was doing anything. Anyone has some experiences.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;breakout rooms eyes. I think it was fine.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. So I think we're not going to keep the same breakout rooms so I'm glad you had a good discussion. Anything that
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Came up, you want to share
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;We kind of just talked about why we got into programming and kind of where we're going. Where we plan on going in the future and classes that we're taking this semester and just getting to know our classmates, things like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Good.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Um, yeah, I find it a good experience we. It was a little bit awkward at the start, but a managed to make a Google Doc and write down some some thought points about those two videos. Sounds good.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Good.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah we I forget what group we're in, but we talked about what like what we like to do with coding kind of projects we've worked on experiences we've had with the moral compass and programming and such.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Good to know.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;The bias in the data systems and data sets that we have right now, which Question is about the model system and how it will eventually have the same biases. If we use the same old data sets.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;That's certainly an issue that if you think that Computer systems are going to magically save us from our Our biases. It's a nice thought that, you know, if we do it by machine then Things are going to Get better because machines are cold and calculating But on the other hand, we forget that it's people who tell the computers what to do. And so It's become an issue with Bias in Recommendation systems. So that we see that this Is a danger for for not aware of it. We don't May have intention to Deal with it. And when in encountered That one biases encountered That the virus will be transferred into the systems. That will be Perpetuating our own
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;One thing we discussed in our group is how um you know in terms of many professions. There's like Sort of an accountability council that you have to join whether your physician you have like the College of Physicians and stuff like that. But with with Technology, there isn't something like that you can opt to join it, but it's not something that you're just part of and part of that is just due to the fact that, you know, Basically the the barrier to entry is a lot lower. When it comes to technology, anybody can do it. So you can be self taught you can be You can go through school. You can get a certificate and so That would be difficult to implement. Like a regulation system that you have to join right from them from where you are.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, that's right. And so in Canada. We have the Canadian information processing society. And then the information services professional This designation that some people have There's an interesting issue in Canada because Engineering on Claims idea software engineering and they have a PNG. And this is This has not been handled well for the last Several decades, I think, and I don't know if it's going to be handled well in the future either. The so there are competing designations that aren't required And so we'll have someone from kips come and talk to us a Bit later in the semester.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Another interesting thing about that when we can say like, it is not confined to just one field. You can use computing and all sorts of fields from biology to like physics statistics so
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah so computing is ubiquitous. And that makes it even harder to to regulate We don't see ads say that, you know, we need somebody with a ISP or a PNG designation to write code for us. It's like, can you do this. Well, sure. I can do that and then You know the manual read Or you're looking to stack overflow or something. As you go through and Anyway, I see that we're past our meeting time today. So I encourage you to Keep these discussions going and And for Tuesday. We'll look at both of those Eli Pariser videos. And I'll make them appear in the plan for Tuesday. As well as have Yeah, so then the assignment stuff will will appear in your courses and also to know when that does
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;So,
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so thank you for today. And Have a good weekend and I'll see you on Tuesday.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;A doctor happening.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;So the filter couples video do you want us to watch this on our own homework or will be we will we be watching those in class together.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So the idea would be to watch them at a time. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;You're welcome. One more question.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;If we've already discussed the filter bubble video and the other video in the last discussion, what should we discuss in this next upcoming Post

    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Awesome , thank you
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Just Titled Winter 2020, other then that all the dates look correct.
    </li><li><strong>S49:</strong>&nbsp;Can you please tell us how many assignments contribute to 35%?
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;majority of all have a question that, what to write in meeting 3 about the new videos filter bubble or old ones code star and moral operating system?
    </li><li><strong>S51:</strong>&nbsp;Would it be possible to include a small assignment description and the due dates on the syllabus?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I think it was the summary of all our ideas about the videos
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;from moral frameworks, to what is computing, etc
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;I think we had to write about our understanding of the purpose of computing.
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;You're just supposed to comment on the discussions/topics of the last meeting
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;Ok, so it is just the discussion of that meeting not the videos posted. I got it. thanks.
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;I thought it was understanding of purpose of computing
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;me too
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, that's what I thought too - only "your understanding of purpose of computing"
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;We discussed that during class, y'all. It's a valid topic. He's just ensuring you're interacting with our class discussions and taking in the information.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;so we can discuss things brought up in the links?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;^ i.e those two TED Talks.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yeah, as long as we talked about it in the meeting, you can discuss that
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;stop sending direct messages :-)
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;ah sorry...
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds like windows update
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;hhahhahaha
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;that was an accident sorry
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;I didn't notice that there was video posted for us to watch!
    </li><li><strong>S56:</strong>&nbsp;K
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;How many people watched it?
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;yes me too, i slso didn’t noticed video
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I was looking for it in the next meeting section after someone mentioned it on their response, but coudnt find it
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Sounds good, thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;That will be much better
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;that sounds helpful Dr. Hepting :)
    </li><li><strong>S57:</strong>&nbsp;srry
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;So, we are going to write response for filter bubbles for meeting 4?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;^I think so yeah
    </li><li><strong>S58:</strong>&nbsp;@Jie that is an option, if you want to, yes, but you can write your response on what you want, it's up to you
    </li><li><strong>S49:</strong>&nbsp;so are those videos for today or we will get new videos for meeting 4
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;what's the topic for forum for this meeting?
    </li><li><strong>S59:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah sorry, there was no sound or chat. Wasn't sure what I was supposed to be doing in the room
    </li><li><strong>S59:</strong>&nbsp;Can you reassign me to a room?
    </li><li><strong>S60:</strong>&nbsp;yes me too
    </li><li><strong>S59:</strong>&nbsp;Gotcha, thanks

    </li><li><strong>S61:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Will we ever vote online?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;^Like vote in an election?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;yup
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;For the municipal election in Regina this year online voting systems were used
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;It seems inevitable, although it might take long to make secure
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;^^^
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;^^even with the offline voting, there is so much talk about interference with the EVM machines, I can only wonder how bad it will be, if it goes online
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Eventually there will emerge online credentials linked to your identity and enforced by government officials. It could take longer to get there though. Picture your driver's license, but online / hosted by a verified source.
    </li><li><strong>S62:</strong>&nbsp;There is a nation that is doing that massively
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I was Denmark or something right?

    </li><li><strong>S63:</strong>&nbsp;computing-art,hacking,business,mastery,solve complex calculations.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;China has a ton of online systems and widespread facial recognition law enforcement. "Safe cities" which track and record misdemeanours as ID'd by facial recognition identification systems, enabled by a network of security cameras.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;There is this one 'idea' of a space nation called Asgardia.
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;even japan is great in technology
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Oh and in China they plaster your jaywalking mugface on outdoor screens
