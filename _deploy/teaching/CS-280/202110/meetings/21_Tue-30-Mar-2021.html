      What is professional certification? It is usually used to certify a person's professional quality in a certain field, and to obtain a certificate or license by passing an exam. In fact, many people immigrate to Canada every year. If they choose skilled immigrants, they often need a professional certification in this field to prove that they have professional standards. Professional certification is a very effective means to guarantee the professionalism of employees in all walks of life.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned in this class was that a degree has more to it than just a degree. Before this class, I didn't even know what CIPS was, let alone accreditation/certification/membership. Who knew that a UofR CS degree could provide us more qualifications automatically and help improve our credentials. I wonder if there is any other thing like CIPS we should be aware of. It would be helpful to have these titles when trying to enter the workforce and when writing an updated resume.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we talk to Thomas richard who came to explain us and give some information about CIPS accredited programs it is an educational program for universities and colleges so he explains us about it and give all answer about the questions we have so it was nice session and we get chance to learn about some new programs as well.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we had a presentation by CIPS Saskatchewan Vice President, Thomas Boxall. He introduced us to the certifications that CIPS offers and how it can be a good add on on our resume and CV. The AITP is a first-level certificate which will help students who want to continue their studies in the IT industry. It was a good, insightful presentation and helped me figure out the steps needed to put a foot in the IT industry.
    </li><li>
      I thought this presentation was interesting, as while many of us may know about different certifications you can get to add onto your resume, it was good to see what they can actually mean. It adds meaning to the string of letters you can see after names on job titles, as well as shows the benefits to being a part of these organizations or getting certifications, both connection wise and pay wise. It was also good to see that we can qualify for some of these with minimal extra effort on our end, just by having our program through the...
    </li><li>
      in this meeting, we had a guest from CIPS. CIPs is Canada's association of IT Professionals. the guest was Mr Thomas Boxall. he explained to us the meaning of this organization, one of the interesting things I have learned that this association provides licencing/certification from CIPS (Canada's association of IT Professionals) for certain IT NOC for SINP (Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program). It is amazing to have this certificate in future and it only takes 2 years of experiences to get it plus it is recognized all over the world
    </li><li>
      During the presentation last class from the CIPS Vice-President, the main takeaway was that it is important to get a leg up on other competitors and applicants when applying for a job. With the additional accreditation that CIPS offers for our program, we're able to have access to a title that looks good on our resume and is appealing to future employers.
    </li><li>
      Great to know about CIPS as I am about to graduate next year. Right now, I am struggling with my job search. As long as there is something that can help me to the next step, I am forever grateful.Very nice of Thomas for going through the application process and answering all the questions. Free membership for students is great. Lots of good questions that I didn’t even think about.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we had a presentation on CIPS.
    </li><li>
      On last meeting, There is a speech by the CIPS manager, he introduce the CIPS program to us, The speech is talking about mainly the three program designations. CIPS stands for Canadian Information Processing Society, which is a national IT association of 10 Provincial regulators that license IT professionals in Canada and abroad. For AITP which is Associate Information Technology Professional (AITP) can be easily get by apply for it through the CIPS official website, another two required knowledge test. The benefits of getting the designation is: when apply for a job, the employer will see the title beside your...
    </li><li>
      Well there was no lecture that day so nothing so discuss but it was a great presentation and was knowledgeable!Thank you very much for organising!
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was about the value of the CIPS certification. It was helpful to learn about the better job prospects and better pay that comes with the CIPS certification. I will definitely apply in my third year of studies. I would like to learn more about other certifications that could help my career.
    </li><li>
      We had a very interesting discussion at the last meeting. I liked to hear Richard. In all honesty, I was totally unaware of this professional designation before the previous lecture. However, I am now interested in it, and so I have surfed some websites to learn more. I believe this is a very positive step in making students knowledgeable of the opportunities. If you know that you want to be and how you achieve your destination, you will work accordingly and will succeed in accomplishing your dreams.
    </li><li>
      I learned quite a bit from the presentation and do plan on becoming a CIPS member and getting that designation. I wonder if all CS students get this presentation, because I had never before heard that the U of R's CS program was accredited. It is certainly a nice bonus to hear of.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we discussed many things and learned many of them with vice president of CIPS organization about the professional conduct and procedure for becoming a member. He discussed many things about how CIPS helps for getting good job and maintain you to be an important part of organization. We also learnt how CIPS suspends the members if they commit any internal or external IT crime.
    </li><li>
      I would be interested in hearing more about cips from the employer side. The people with cips would obviously like to brag about how good it is. How do people employing across boards and within boards find cips on a resume if it makes a big difference or not.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, we had a presentation explaining CIPS and its AITP designation. Something I worry about is not having the prerequisite experience to get hired after graduating. That's why I think it's nice that this class offers this information to get a potential leg-up on other applicants. Another example of the University doing this is changing the Comp-sci bachelors program to have two mandatory classes dedicated to software engineering (now that 476 is mandatory). So I'll give this AITP certificate a serious consideration if it will actually help me in the future.
    </li><li>
      We got to know about AITP. designation and how we become a member of CIPS.
    </li><li>
      I wasn't really interested in the job opportunity that was presented last class, especially since I'm only in my second year and it applies to after graduation
    </li><li>
      meeting responsein the last meeting, the professor introduce CIPS. So what is CIPS? CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society) is the professional association of IT professionals in Canada. Since 1958 CIPS has helped strengthen the Canadian IT industry by establishing standards and sharing best practices for the benefit of individual IT professionals and the sector as a whole. CIPS represents thousands of members across the country as Canada’s Association of Information Technology Professionals. CIPS offers Networking opportunities, Certification of IT professionals (I.S.P. and ITCP certifications), Accreditation of IT Post-Secondary programs, a niche IT Job Board, a voice to government, and represents...
    </li><li>
      In this lecture, Thomas Box, vice president of the CIPS Saskatchewan had a presentation about CIPS and the different designations offered by CIPS. He really had a good presentation and we got to know a lot about CIPS, designations offered (AIT, ISP, ICP), and what is the eligibility and how to apply for these designations. It was a great session and hope that professor arranges more sessions like this.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture, we talked about a couple of things out of which our major focus was on "Professional Designations". The term "Professional Designation" basically stands for "a stamp of approval". It means that you're professionally skilled for working in corporate world or your particular field of work.
    </li><li>
      The CIPS presentation by Thomas RM Boxall was very education. I learned about the three different designations AITP , I.S.P. and ITCP. I will definitely be applying for AITP before my graduation. I strongly believe having a designation such as AITP will help me land a job quicker.
    </li><li>
      Today was my first introduction to CIPS. Although I am not interested in IT, I find CIPS provision of job postings, mentoring programs, and networking opportunities to be very valuable as a student that will be entering the tech industry in a few years time; these resources are beneficial for helping students like myself develop the necessary skills to navigate the industry. Moreover, I find hope in computer professionals working towards CIPS membership and designation, which requires years of experience in the field and to uphold the CIPS Code of Ethics and Standards. It is important for us to honour...
    </li><li>
      The most important thing was to know how each device is connected to each other thru internet, although we have setup security for each links but there are still loop holes that needs to be resolved not only on devices but in networking as well
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned from the last meeting was the benefits of professional designations and the designations I can apply for. Although it wasn't too difficulty to understand, I am still unclear of the differences between the ISP, ATP, ISP, and ITCP regulations. I would enjoy learning more about the professional benefits that these designations provide. It seems a very simple task to apply and receive these designations, so I would love to learn more about what these designations signify. I have seen presentations or representatives of KIPS at job fairs and heard mention of mention them in...
    </li><li>
      In our 20th meeting we discussed an optional computer science opportunity that will help us with finding jobs in our Computer science careers.
    </li><li>
      We discovered the 3 different classifications in CIPS presentation: AITP, I.S.P. and also ITCP. I am going to undoubtedly be making an application for AITP just before my graduation. I firmly feel having a classification like AITP will certainly assist me land a project quicker.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we discussed Cips (Canadian Information Processing Society). The definition of Cips is also explained and described in detail. The goals and significance set by Cips are very significant. We also focused on how to apply for Cips qualification and what is needed. Many questions have been answered
    </li><li>
      Having a professional designation for computing professionals would be a great idea! By using this designation you could control what a computing professional is capable. You can limit what is allowed by only letting people with the designation to be able to do things. This could forward ethical programming. This like a computing governing body that looks into the ethics of progamming and audits companies for their ethics would be a very good idea.
    </li><li>
      In previous meeting we had presentation about CIPS. The vice present from CIPS Saskatchewan explained how this CIPS course can be a good addition for student who want to build a career in IT profession. I never heard of this course before but now after the presentation I would really love to research more and have this addition to my resume for future benefit.
    </li><li>
      On professional designationsWe had the chance to learn about CIPS, that provided a professional designation of information technology to students and recent grades from the computer science background. Much like an engineering degree carries the professional designation as a professional engineer, this provides a similar mark of recognition for IT professionals. It’s also important in addition to taking this designation to know the in’s and out’s of various information technology related procedures. Managing databases, planning for network architecture, supplying key organizational documents from the ground up all are valid requirements within the field of IT. It’s also interesting to note...
    </li><li>
      Our guest speaker was highly interesting and provided a great connection between the classroom and our future work. In the days since I've been doing some reading on CIPS, and was struck by the difference in the organization's status from one province to the next. While CIPS is legally recognized here in Saskatchewan as a self-regulating body, there are other provinces where this isn't the case. This had me wondering: with remote work becoming increasingly popular with tech workers and companies, are there jurisdictional issues surrounding ethics enforcement where a member's work crosses provincial boundaries? If a CIPS member does...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we just listened the lecture delivered by the guest and asked him questions. It was interesting
    </li><li>
      The last lecture about AITP is really helpful for me, thank you for holding the lecture.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting we had a Guest lecturer, who is currently Vice president of CIPS Saskatchewan. He told us about the certificates CIPS provides and the opportunity we will get by getting to enroll in this program. He also told us about the CIPS membership, which has jobs exclusively available to CIPS members. Overall, it was a great experience, and I came to know about lots of new things.
    </li><li>
      In meeting 20, we have a presentatiion about CIPS, which proviides us an oppotunitity to have a job after we graguate from universiity.
    </li><li>
      Meeting 20 was very informative about professional designations. I want to thank Dr. Daryl Hepting for giving us the early opportunity to learn about CIPS. I hope to get my certification soon.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, we had a presentation from guest "Thomas Box" VP of CIPs (Canadian Information Processing Society). Before this class I didn't had any idea about CIPs certification as I am almost about to graduate this certificate will help to get a job in IT profession.
    </li><li>
      I appreciate that Thomas took the time to outline the AITP designation, but the IT world is the last thing that I am concerned about or even remotely interested in. I fail to see how maintaining a designation is worth the commitment of renewals every 3 years, and the potential of a marginal pay raise after investing so much in a Computer Science Degree. I can’t help but think about the ethics of obtaining and maintaining certifications. I was reminded of the conversions in earlier lectures pertaining to Blog Entry 2, of how some companies may claim to serve the...
    </li><li>
      In this meeting. We listened to a guest lecturer and asked him some question. It was good. However, i got lost in middle of a the lecture. I guess i get the most of it. Overall it was good for a change.
    </li><li>
      about the cips, I want to join it. But I concern about am I able to pass the program. Because my grade is not high at all, and the talker said it can use in any country. It like an international pass, I'm afraid the program is hard. So I decide to not join the program
    </li><li>
      In today's meeting the lacturer thomas was a good impression and I acknowledge the tcp connection, it was nice to know about the membership of kips and how it can help in the near future for the opportunities
    </li><li>
      I think CIPS certification has certain benefits for computer science majors. After the CIPS certification, This certification will be of great help in our future work and more in-depth study of computers. Second, CIPS certification helps show students CIPS members' views on IT industry opportunities and the importance of professionalism, ethics, and continuous career development. Although I want to apply for this certification, I may not be able to participate for some personal reasons.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned was that Kips is not equivalent to a degree, it is a designation. What a designation tells employers is that you are on the path to becoming an IT professional. Meaning that one has gone through the training of an accredited program and you have gained the knowledge necessary to to be considered an IT professional within their eyes.
    </li><li>
      I think the guest speaker was grate and I have already registered to become a member of the organization. it would be nice if we could have another guess speaker before the end of the semester.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting we a had Thomas Boxall from Sask CIPS as our guest who give us useful information about AITP, ISP and ITCP. I think it was very helpful to have him because he give us useful information such as that we have to personally apply for AITP designation before graduation as it's not done automatically. I think we shouldn't have to apply for AITP designation ourselves and it should be done automatically by the institution that we graduate from as these will help us find jobs easier in the future.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we had a great discussion with gentlemen from CIPS. That session was having lots of information regarding student's career and Their future planning. Will excited to attend some session like this.
    </li><li>
      The most important thing I learned in the class was about CIPS organization.
    </li><li>
      Really informative about job searching and certification and i really liked it but it was just for bachelor student so would be more nice if something was for diploma students as well.But really nice session
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, there was a guy named Thomas who was there in the class meeting discussed all about the CIPS he also taught that how to receive the CIPS certificate and what important role does it plays.It was a very informative secession and if possible it would be great if there are secessions like this.
    </li><li>
      The class was about CIPS seminar and it was an informative session. I learnt about how to get an extra credential as a computer science graduate.
    </li><li>
      the last class I learnt about cips, I also learnt about different types of certifications available
    </li><li>
      The CIPS representative enhanced the information about the designation of DIPS and how important is it to enroll in CIPS as a member and accomplish the certificates that he mentioned. He also inclined more how it would help you to be one step closer to get a job.
    </li><li>
      The last meeting was pretty simple. We discussed and learned about ISP, CIPS and their application process long with other stuff that will be helpful for us to get professional standards.
    </li><li>
      In the last discussion , we attended a virtual presentation by mips sask. I gotta know about the eligibility of their certification to diploma and degree students.
    </li><li>
      Last meeting we talked about AITP designation. I learned that this is important and advantageous when applying to jobs. Certification is based on the completion of a cs degree. With this the holder is able to have access to CIPS. I also the process of acquiring the free certification.
    </li><li>
      In the last class meeting, we had a meeting with Thomas Richard (co-host) he gave us information about the computer-related fields about the CIPS as the description of the courses like the accredited programs and membership registration, and personal certifications for work like how to apply for that and more information about these all in detail. as it is the kind of virtual presentation by MIPS sask. it was nice meeting with him. we got a lot of knowledge.
    </li><li>
      I was unable to attend thursday, i sent you an email telling you why. I do have some questions though, did anyone hear anything amazing during Thursday, or was it informational? i hope i can check out the log file when i get time, it was defiantly something amazing to look forward to.
    </li><li>
      In class we were visited by a guest speaker who brought up a company in which students like us could seek employment for once we are out of the computer science field. I don't have much to say on this topic as if you attended the lecture it was pretty self explanatory but one question i do have is how hard it is to get into this company. What is the percentage of people who get accepted?
    </li><li>
      Cips is a good introduction to the computer professional society... it helps build good professional relation of a computer graduate and improve the job society at large
    </li><li>
      In this class, we mainly completed the introduction of CIPS and the explanation of how to apply for the membership. We listened to whether the membership of CIPS would provide extra points for students majoring in CS in their future resumes.This is a constraint on the ethics of the computer industry.
    </li><li>
      In the last class we had a guest speaker talking about cips explaining what its all about as well as how the certification program takes only 2 years and is very recognized worldwide 
    </li><li>
      CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society) is a federation which provides many services to IT professionals in Canada. They provide certifications to IT professionals: the AITP, ISP, and ITCP designations. These certifications tell employers that the certified member follows a code of ethics and has a high level of knowledge and ability. They also provide accreditation of university programs which allows students from accredited universities to have a fast track to ISP and ITCP designations. Lastly, they provide a job board for IT professionals to find work.
    </li><li>
      In today’s meeting we got to know more about CIPS an national IT association. Other professor talk about it in details and guided us through how can we apply and what all are the requirements and qualifications you need to apply. It was a knowledgeable meeting.
    </li><li>
      In the past lecture, we had a guest in our class. He made us introduce to different topics such as professional designations and CIPS and I learned a good number of things related to computing. Hope to know about more new things in next lectures.
    </li><li>
      In the last class, we had a guest speaker discussing about AITP designation. The pre-professional Associate Information Technology Professional designation and Candidate Membership is the first step to obtaining Professional I.S.P. status. AITP holders have recently completed a relevant IT University or College education program, but do not yet have the required experience for the Professional I.S.P. designation. It is the primary qualification for the I.S.P. and ITCP Designations, which gets you access to CIPS and their resources.
    </li><li>
      In the last meeting, we had the professor introduce us to CIPS the Canadian Information Processing Society. It acts as a society of people who establish a standard for best practice for IT professionals.It can be a great skill to acquire and to add it to our skill set.
    </li><li>
      In the past meeting, the idea of professional designations was introduced in the class by the guest. It was a good experience as I got to learn different things from him. The idea of CIPS was also a good thing to know about. Overall, it was a great experience.
    </li><li>
      I thought it was really valuable to learn about the CIPS membership and the benefits involved. I'm curious to do a bit more research to see what the value is for members and whether or not it's worth the yearly membership but I appreciate that my schooling is enough for the certification process and I very much appreciate an accountability process for members. I'd love to know more about the many types of certifications available out there to expand my options as a future computer professional and how CIPS stands up compared to those other certifications.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we discussed about CIPS organization, we had an interesting session with Richard
    </li><li>
      Richard was the host of the previous meeting. CIPS was something different and fascinating that I heard about.
    </li><li>
      the last zoom meeting was delivered by the guest named Thomas Richard i really found it interesting for myself. As he taught us the information about the computer related fields especially about the CIPS as the description of course like accredited programs.

    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Usually it's something I mentioned everybody that longest continuously department in Canada. there's some question about what's. So accreditation as a department. is one thing and then accreditation of yourselves as. Computer professionals is another thing. Here, let me. Do something on the web. For today's meeting I got the responses. together here. So I read on this a little bit so. This is. These are the responses. And I tried to. Identifying information. A couple of people who first identifying information in each time. So I. Remove. This is going to be on the public website. And then I thought, because we're limited to 100 words. So I have the original data. The identified. And i'm just for the display i'm putting it in words that we talked about. So in the summary of the meeting from last week. The transcription the audio. So our speaker. I think appears as. one. See. well. Yes. Okay, if I wasn't sharing my screen so that. it's a little bit less informative isn't it sorry about that. Okay, so let me check out see. here. Okay, so. David and then. The responses to meetings. Ideally I would like to just have it as a have an opening time that the the forums don't have an open time. So I will endeavor to. Ask the questions, no more timely fashion. I think ultimately i've chosen the wrong instrument to. For these responses. Online text. text. Alright, so very popular in the chat today, but nobody wants to. Use the microphone. The chat window here a little bit. that's do today. was extended a week exactly. So if you submitted on Thursday, then it's a 10%. penalty. Okay, so. Let me take care. Okay, so here's the password. In the chat and on screen. So the idea of the assignment about the empathy map is to. have some empathy for. The process of doing the onboarding. For proctor track. So we're not going to be using it for our exam. Have a discussion about. The practice test as well. Okay, so a couple of polls here for based on last meeting. So the first one is about certification. So certification, important to you, yes, no, or only if it's required for employment. So watch that. give it a couple of minutes for that. responding. winning. answer is only if required for employment. will explore that a little bit. Here today in. breakout rooms. Another guest. In class so i've got a Pole, for that so. Yes or no for. First, is no not another guest in class, yes, from an employer perspective, yes, from a recruiting perspective and, yes, for another perspective. give people a little more time to reply to that current poll. Alright, so. Nine people voted for not another guest. 30 so the most popular responses, yes, from an employer perspective. closely by yes from a recruiting perspective. And then, yes to another. 20%. So i'm going to type in a question to the chat to we can reply to you. Or we can even discuss using the microphones. Okay, so question what is. Driving you'd like to see. That relates to the pole have. Another guest in class. So pull it i'm still sharing it should be visible on your screen says another guest in class question mark no yes, an employer yes recruiter yes either. So. But what's. So i'm particularly interested in the people who said yes other. As a way to. Okay. Okay. Okay, so please don't send me direct messages. Okay, so let me talk about Philips comment. comment is. Definitely out of the scope. of our class but. I think it professionalism as a discussion is. This is the scope of the class. and I think there is some questions that Thomas has left open about. What, how do we decide what are it professional jobs. So let me ask a quick question about the exam the empathy map assignment. Project deliverable. Stop reading. Well, focus on typing a question. So the question for the breakout room is Australia and island. Just kidding. mom is from saskatchewan I believe. The kind of connection that. is in practice. So is it possible to act professionally without certification if so. supplement here's the tips ethics page. The question clear enough i'll make it i'll send you off to breakout rooms. Now. we'll See you in 10 minutes, and you can ask for help, if you want. Okay, so we're back. size of breakout room much better today. Okay, so. We have three or four people talking. When there's 10 or 11 people in the room, then that's better than. Having. One person talking when it's four or five people in the room. So anyone want to share what the discussion was about and I don't want to hear anything about. Australia, being an island.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I in our group. We talked a lot about the, the number of options out there that there's a lot of paths to demonstrating your skill set and your knowledge, including certifications kits and otherwise and. undergraduate degrees, we talked about the fact that none of these things is by itself, necessary and that it's kind of attractive to to have a lot of paths to demonstrating that you're a professional but. We also talked about the limitations of organizations like kits and their ethical certifications in the sense that. it's almost impossible to get one industry wide standard in one industry wide organization that certifies all computing professionals by just by nature of how huge the field is there's. going to be a lot of smaller organizations like caps that have a smaller jurisdiction and we sort of have this big jumbled puzzle of ethical frameworks, if that makes any sense I. think my colleagues expressed it much better than i'm explaining it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, that sounds good. i'm not sure that there are too many. Professional designations in Canada, I mean if you do if you're in. Here in the software systems engineering program, then you get a different there's a different path, but there's also a certification. A professional certification. But, in general, though the. The computing field is. Not like medicine rainy or or the. Or the Bar Association for lawyers, where you need to be a member. Of the professional group in order to. be certified to practice. In a jurisdiction. Because I think competing as much more results oriented isn't that. You can write code. And you're willing to. Work on some projects, then. OK. So the benefit. Of a membership in a professional societies more than just the certification. I would say. So you work defines you. And also, maybe your. you're also defined by the company you keep. So if you're. On your own and not belong to a group. You don't benefit from the. From the. status of the group. anyone else, like to share a comment about this.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Actually, I was wondering if people lose their certifications if they are unethical.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;If the people who are the certifications still might still act unethically.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Well, I think that's.
    </li></ul>

<ul><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;good morning
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Good Morning!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I hate winter
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;You never know when it flips around
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;its so drastic! +16 this friday
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Hey professor, is there any way that you could open up the class response forum earlier after each class? I completed my response on Thursday and it wasn't available until Monday at noon. I even checked monday morning. As a result, I didn't get the mark for my effort, so I would appreciate an earlier forum opening time. Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;sorry what are we talking about?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I mean id be more interested to hear about what people who hire think. I know people who always got a job without cips
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;^ David… I get more and more frustrated with this each class :(
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Professor I sent you my 20th meeting response on your email.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;what is that map assignment?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;3 pages-ish of using proctortrack and what you think, feel, say and do. Also how to improve proctortrack from your experiance
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Is the prof sharing his screen?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;nope
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Is it possible to get a little more time for the maps assignment, unsure if anyone else feels the same but I realised this was due this week during the weekend and havn't had much time to figure out proctortrack. Unless its easier than I think?
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;yes please
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;Yes Please
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;yes please
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;is there an attendance code?
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;An extension will be helpful
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;yes please
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I think it was already extended almost a week
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;not yet mario
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;can we submit it on Thursday?
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;just a couple more days will be helpful too
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I feel the same was. I feel like we need to talk about the empathy map at some point before it is due
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I usually like more time but the empathy map is very straight forward. I got it all done in 3 hours this morning
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;way*
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;We have talked about it in class
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;To anyone who hasn't done the onboarding with Proctortrack, be warned: save everything ahead of time. It closed all of my open applications (including LibreOffice) without any warning and without saving anything.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I even had fun recording myself talking about a movie (its part of the proctortrack quiz)
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;lol true@ Michael
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;thank Michael, that actually saved me because I was going to do it on the side as I did other things
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;For me it didn’t detect the microphone at all. Even though nothing was wrong
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Might be helpful to just post the question for the rest of the forums now so you don't forget
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Good point by Michael, I lost some work data due to proctortrack lol
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;I had to use a different device
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Would it be okay if I sent you my #20 by email? And rip Philip :(
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;David, I did already. go ahead I say
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;noted dude, thanks
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Was the attendance code posted? I may have missed it
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Proctortrack closed the word document I was doing the assignment on and I lost everything haha
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;nope aden
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;U are supposed to keep the proctor track on ???????
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I was doing mine in browser in Google docs, didn’t lose anything if anyone needs an alternative
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Me too Nicholas
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;Same nicholas
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;you guys are lucky, I had previous proffs who made me use proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, force closed my OneNote but asked if I wanted to close discord. Priorities.
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I think the video posted on the website of the guy doing proctortrack onboarding is pretty accurate for reference while writing
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Didn't even think of doing it that way, Aden. Good idea
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;Proctortrack was incredibly invasive in my laptop’s privacy. I was very uncomfortable providing it access to most things that most of my other apps don’t have access to
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;attendance password??
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;i guess you should know about the proctor track onboarding if u don't know than try for it and after you close write your experience. i think it is best way to go.
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;No attendance yet
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I had a proctortrack session ask me to disconnect my second monitor... :|
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;BEcause dual montiors wasnt allowed on it haha
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Same here, I can’t use my main monitor so I had to switch computers to do it
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Wow that sounds incredibly sus
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;I have chem final proctored but there are tables and and other stuff that we are supposed to use during exams, idk how I woukd use them with prototrack
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Mandeep, if you are worried, take all the files out of your computer, use prostate exam and the factory settings the computer
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;The host can enable proctor track to allow certain programs
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;*then
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;use a virtual box, no risk to any files on your machine
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Yug you cant use a VM it checks for tha
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Could be flagged and wanted as cheating though
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Do we only do the onboarding part or do we do the practice test as well?
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;proctotrack should not have been invented
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;both are the same test for the most part
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;both will ask what is the capital of Saskatchewan and what is the weather like
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;...offhand but why is Greenland the biggest island? is it not Australia?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;australia is 4x larger?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;probably saw one of those wrong world map where Greenland is as big as africa
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;found same hing in many other places too
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Australia is classified as a continent and hence it is not a contender for the biggest island
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;that, does not make much sense
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Whether or not something is a continent has no bearing on whether it is an island
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;island definition is literally != bigger than continent.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;mainland Australia is smaller than Australia+tasmania+new Zealand, makes it an island lol
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;bros island is something that is surrounded by water on all sides and something that is not a continent
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;hmmm, Wikipedia seems to agree with Shrey! well, today I learned
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;“Australia is technically an island [...] but it is more commonly considered a continental landmass.” Greenland is the largest non Australia island
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;(assuming Wikipedia is correct)
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Actually Shrey, island would have to require fixed mass (so not ice sheets, Antarctica). It also requires that it is not a continent (so something could be bigger than Australia, not a continent, and an island, theoretically.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;....to the Geology faculty! Banananan!
    </li><li><strong>S34:</strong>&nbsp;Agreed. It's an interesting jumble of logic and landmass.
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;its simple and logical
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;It also has to do with the fact that Australia sits on its own tectonic plate, whereas Greenland doesn't
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;Australia is a continent that's why its not an island!!!!!!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;there are some weird stuff with geology. Caspian sea is ompletely surrounded by land, makes it a lake, worlds largest one at that, but everyone calls it a sea
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Whoa, boom! @Yug with the definition of a continent now :)
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Breakout room discussion: Is Australia an island?
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;hhahahhahhahah
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Might have more participation rate for it
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Question : What is an example of “other” you’d like to see?
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;what do you mean by other sry I zoned out
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;oh I see
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;maybe we could have our
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;a researcher
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;a researcher sounds cool
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;a researcher
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;like a researcher talking about their role in a project
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;software engineer
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;guys poll is already done
    </li><li><strong>S39:</strong>&nbsp;Honestly it will be great for us if we get a guest from computer profession because it would be a great opportunity to explore about  jobs
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;Basically I am good for all of them like I am neutral
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I voted “no”, but if we are having another guest I would like a really intriguing philosopher/deep-thinker. Somebody to provoke thought and challenge how we think
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;Justin trudeau
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;@Neha agreed, I'm always down for anything career related
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;smith going big
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;It will be great to have IT Professionals
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;agreed with @Neha
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;agreed with smith
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I’m not so interested in career/work stuff in this class. There are other places for that, and it doesn’t align with the scope of this course.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;That is a good point
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;The guy from Regina and then Freakin NASA was awesome, perhaps someone from Boston Dynamics as well
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Right. Networking is what I was saying probably isn’t
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;elon is from it right?
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;we can have elon
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;hey, using software to control a robot can come to mind!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Heads up, project is also due In like 9 days
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;It would not affect if someone has done EM he can submit and start project
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;^ April is here unfortunatly
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Admittedly I'm far less concerned about the Empathy Map than the final project as we already got an entire extra week to work on the EM. I'm swamped and a little more time to work on the project would take some of the pressure off for me.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;me too, our group better start with combining our coding and such
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;My problem with the project is Dont we have to wait for the response for your proposal?
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;I would like the project's deadline extended
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Empathy map took me like 40 minutes last night, pushing it back causes issue with the research project timing I feel
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;and we also get our feedbacks for the proposal we submitted to know if we should carry on with what we had in mind
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Pushing back to Thursday (2 days)
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;can*
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;I would like some type of feedback from project proposal
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;I'd rather have the project deadline pushed back and receive feedback on the proposal before it's due
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;^yeah that would be better
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;Yet to get feedback from the project proposal
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;what do we have for our final exam?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I think the project due date is much more important to extend than the empathy map due date just because of its size. So if we choose one to extend, I'd really appreciate the project having an extension
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;yea
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;maybe talk to him in his office hours for feedback is my best guess if you want it early
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;EM is fine. project is the matter.
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;I think bonus marks should be awarded to students who finish the assignments on time if we are going to push back the deadline.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;2 people getting ahead of themselves and submitting the Project Deliverable already. The real MVPs...
    </li><li><strong>S42:</strong>&nbsp;Wow!
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;interesting name Zoom User...
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;is User german?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;ITs straight and to the point
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;very accurate name
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Honestly bless you Daryl
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for doing that prof :)
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;oh dang
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;what would we have for final?
    </li><li><strong>S45:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, thanks for listening to our recommendations!
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Since my CS 476 is due tomorrow, pushing the empathy map to Thursday allows me to work an extra hour or whatever on 476 today (my Thursday is wide open).
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Not too picky either way though
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;^^
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;A personal extension for that might be better in that case
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with Phillip
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with Philip, I also have CS 476 due tomorrow
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;Yeh same
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Depends on how many it’ll effect though
    </li><li><strong>S47:</strong>&nbsp;I have an assignment due tomorrow so I agree with Phillip as well
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;If you guys find the time to do the EM, it is honestly the easiest assignment on the planet (the only hard part is accepting that horrid ProctorTrack on your computer)
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you :)
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you so much
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;thanks much!!
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;^ Shareef, I do expect that to be the case. Nice not to divert my train of thought from the 476 project though (worth 100% of the weighted grade in that class)
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Hahha :)
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;ahah
    </li><li><strong>S49:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I KNEW IT
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;Lol
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;nice:)
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;maybe
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;I was like wait
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;oh jeez, Phillip. I think you will find the EM as a nice break. you get to talk about your favourite movie for 5min
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;he got me there
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;you said what we meant by "other"

    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;I think it was  moose jaw
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;can we get back to track ?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Breakout room: is it possible to act professionally without certification? If so, why is it important? Discuss.
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;^ yes please. Ready for the breakout topic
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;Brilliant!
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Seems clear to me
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;https://cips.ca/ethics/
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;https://ethics.acm.org/integrity-project/
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;http://ethics.acm.org/integrity-project/ask-an-ethicist/
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I think it went very well
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;much better, thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Much much better
    </li><li><strong>S56:</strong>&nbsp;Definitely
    </li><li><strong>S57:</strong>&nbsp;The best breakout room so far xDD
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yes much better
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, much better
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Better, but only 3 people discussed of 10
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;More people was a good idea
    </li><li><strong>S58:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I mean we had 3-4 people talking instead of 2
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;or none lol
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;it seemed to provoke much more discussion
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, it was better
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;we discussed Austraila being an island for the last minute
    </li><li><strong>S59:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah much better
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Better because we actually had a discussion (last time I was alone with 3 silent people)
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;lmao much better, last time it was just 2 of us
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;mine had only me and one other talking
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Better than 1 talk in a room of 5
    </li><li><strong>S33:</strong>&nbsp;nice
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Better than nothing yeah
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Why should we have to pay every year for a certification skill, we acquired and very will have it for the rest of our lives? And is this ethical?
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Was some good discussion this time
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. 3 of 10 is better than 1 of 5 because there’s a discussion
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S57:</strong>&nbsp;xD
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;oh shoot, there goes my discussion
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I think it is possible to act professionally without certification. Tech is a very 'loose' field educationally, so I think there are multiple ways to achieve professionalism, including, but not limited to, certification, education, and work experience.
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;I am not paying $200 just to label someone that I am ethically certified. My work defines me!
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;It doesn’t defines the firm though
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Oh my mistake, I think I slightly misinterpreted the question
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Also if you have a membership with a group there are accountability processes that can ensure that you're representing that group accordingly
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I am fine with the membership if it comes with a number of different benefits, however, if it is solely for the purpose of keeping the certificate, then I wouldn't want to pay
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Not a compelling enough narrative for me. I don’t think I’ll choose to have a membership with CIPS. Their value-proposition isn’t worth jumping through the hoops to me, especially not any ongoing hoops, and not to mention ongoing fees.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;The certificate is good to have but realistically, I don't think it helps with getting a job
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think if an employer wants to make their employees certified, they will have the cost
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I think joining a social group that codes and puts on community activities would be good. Like that group on campus that hosts hack-a-thons
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;I believe it definitely helps with "getting" a job, but certain certifications might be better at preparing you for specific jobs like diplomas from polytech
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;Microsoft certification is good
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I would say certifications of commonly used softwar is more important than cips. Seeing as cips gives it to all uni students in regina. This doesnt mean you know how to use the software that a company needs used
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;I feel like certification are great for knowledge, like a "I know how to do this", they feel less impactful when its a certificate saying "I will act this way"
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I 100% agree with Keegan
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;like a driver's licence. "I promise I can drive and drive safely"?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;As far as networking goes, however, I have been advantaged by my work terms and am not worrying about finding work / proving myself
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I think the point where CIPS will be valued highly is when it's treated like a professional practices college, if that makes sense. Im not sure if those are the right words
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Shareef a drivers license you take a test that states you know how to drive a vehicle. Notevery kind of vehicle however
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;I am thankful that we don’t have a gatekeeping society. Lots of room in the world for bad programmers / I.T. people. Lots of room for good ones to stand out
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;IT doesnt promise you will drive safely
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;that's my point, it proves competence
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;not promises
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for class today, I appreciate the extensions and clarifications on the assignments as well. Take care
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl! Good discussion :)
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;ohhh makes more sense
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for class :)
    </li><li><strong>S45:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S57:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks ^__^
    </li><li><strong>S30:</strong>&nbsp;Take care!
    </li><li><strong>S60:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks Daryl, Have a nice day!
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;hi prof, I have a question?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Can you come to my office hour today?
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;yes, thanks
