<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning. dropped out and restarted on me. Maybe that's a sign that we shouldn't do too much today, or maybe that's an April fool's. prank. zoom. Stick around. I found some resources. An acm website for. professionalism that I thought might be interesting to. To have a look at. Do the attendance here, first of all let me get sorted out here. Okay, so I thought I would share this. Little six minute video it's from the states, of course, but. Maybe it's. interesting and useful. For us today. Okay, so it should have sound being shared as well. six minutes long. unmuted. That sounds so boring seriously if you're a founder executive or worker in the tech industry, then your work is likely covered by one or more codes of ethics lack of familiarity with the codes. can have serious financial and legal consequences for you and your business now, the first thing you should know is that there are two main professional organizations that cover the tech industry.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;acm Association for computing machinery and I Tripoli, the Institute for electronics electrical and electronics engineers between them, the acm and the ieee sponsor most of the conferences scholarly publications journals.They set curriculum standards and they set the code of conduct for people that are working in computer science computer engineering software engineering and electrical engineering.So that the acm I and the ieee each have their own code of ethics and they've also jointly collaborated on the code of ethics for software engineering, so if you're practicing software engineer, for example.You might be a bit surprised by some of the things that are in here principle one software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.I mean really That was the first principle of the software engineering code of ethics and professional practice so everything that software engineer does every day is supposed to be consistent with the public interest should be in your mind all the time.software engineers show assist colleagues and professional development.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So does your employer help pay for you to attend conferences or to increase your technical or leadership skills, did you know that the code of ethics says that they're supposed to do that.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;also got some some mail, these are sort of frequent objections, I hear about the code of ethics, so this one was sent in.from New York in 1919 I guess.So.Dear Bo stop wasting my time come back when these are laws not codes well i've got some bad news for you, even though there isn't really any law in the US that requires adherence to these codes.they're trying to find their way into some court case you might remember the Oracle versus Google case.Oracle was suing Google because Google had copied some Java api's into the android operating system at trial Google argued that it was fair use but oracle's lawyers snapback deciding the acm.code of ethics and professional conduct violations of copyrights patents trade secrets and the terms of license agreements is prohibited by law in most circumstances.Even when software is not so protected such violations are contrary to professional behavior copies of software should be made only with proper authorization unauthorized duplication of materials must not be condemned.So.let's do another one here.See here, dear Dr brinkman you've convinced me to cancel my memberships and that acm ieee.Okay yeah I mean I hear that idea, but while it's true that the acm ieee can't enforce the codes of ethics against.People that aren't members of the acm and I Tripoli.You know, when a big professional organization creative code of ethics and publishes it out in the world.The public and the courts tend to see that as a statement of the conscience of the profession, you know, so you know we saw in the Google case.The Oracle versus Google case that even though the the people that were involved in that case may or may not have been acm members, the lawyers for Oracle clearly considered the acm code of ethics to apply.To the Google engineers that were involved in that case.So one last postcard here depot if there aren't any laws regulating our conduct, why did our professional organizations waste all this time, creating.burdensome regulations on us okay two points, first of all, I mean these rules are intended to be.The basis of self regulation, you know sort of the philosophy of regulation of the professions is that if we do a good job of regulating ourselves then hopefully we'll avoid some more burdensome regulation.from outside forces so that's part of it, but also, you know, these rules are also meant to help workers, stand up for what's ethically right.If they're in a situation where.they're under pressure to do something that's incorrect, you know, for example, I have a recent.op ED here from the New York Times.So here.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;If apple employees refused to perform the software engineering tasks that would be necessary to provide the FBI with access to the contents of an iPhone used by one of the shooters in the December mass killings in San Bernardino California their decision would be explicitly. wasn't just you. Okay, so let me. I got bumped out again. screen share. So we're not going to watch the whole thing again just give me a second here. Okay let's watch from here. Oh, did I not have this sound on for the last bit. I see lots of chat messages. yeah okay. Let me try and get. again.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;gonna continue.apple to unlock that phone.So what I hope you take away from this video is that, regardless of what career stage you're at or what role you play if you're in a tech industry.Then acm code of ethics I Tripoli code of ethics and the joint ieee acm software engineering code of ethics.are going to have an impact on your business, and if you want to find out more about them or read the full code of ethics, you can go to http ethics dot acm dot O rg.And you could also like and share this video that would help us and, if you want more materials that will help you discuss ethical issues with your co workers or with.Your boss, then just subscribe, the Committee on professional ethics is going to continue to create new videos and new materials over the course of the next couple years.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So who appreciated his sense of humor. This the hands in his face at the end and. The postcard from 1919. yeah So this was made in. I think 2016. and yeah it's not been a tidal wave of new material since then. This is her look at the integrity projects YouTube channel. So don't forget. soon as crash twice and then since we've and meeting. And I forgot to turn the audio on once. So that's why it's taken. The time. For a six minute video. OK so. The fact that this is the video you just watched it four years ago and there's 3.1 page views. And hundred 57 subscribers to the acm. Ethics integrity project. 757 K subscribers.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Just.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Just noticing that. Maybe has a bit of a popularity problem. Go ahead Keegan.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;um I think one of his arguments was fundamentally flawed when he said that Oracle brought up the code of ethics in their battle against Google. The problem with, that is, you can bring bring up anything in a court case right you just basically throw on everything and see what sticks with the judge so just because we brought it up doesn't mean that it's has any legal basis. So my problem with this is if you're asking people about ethics and not like Okay, I agree, we should all be ethical, but if there's no actual law stating how you should act well anybody that act on ethically it's easier to get. Through most businesses and stuff in like our society so when you're looking at it if there's no actual law guiding that then everybody who's unethical will slowly push out. All the ones that are ethical because they won't be able to make as much money, so their businesses will go under, so as soon as you don't actually have it as a law, I feel like. It doesn't really matter.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I think okay fair point. But I think, also the common wasn't that it wasn't. They weren't forming the basis of decisions but. They were being mentioned in court cases in it, the next step would be for them to be. cited as. An authority in in those decisions. So it's not it's not yet there but. yeah. Gaining some traction. People start to. to acknowledge it then. it's playing a bigger role in the conversation. i'm not defending. i'm not saying that. i'm not disagreeing with your point Keegan it's just. I think it's it's different how they. serve on a continuum of being. Granted, more authority. That makes sense. Okay. So there's lots of different codes here so there's the code of ethics for kicks. And the ieee and. ECM and software engineering code of ethics and. So there are many different versions of this, so I think what the takeaway is not. Is not to. diminish. Not to say well there's, no, no agreement about particular code of ethics, so I can. Because there's no agreement then there's. No comment concepts. shouldn't be bound by anything. However, we look at the code of ethics codes of ethics. You see there's lots of overlap, so the kips ethics. We looked at the other day. A little bit. let's see if I can. So the first principle in the kips statement to protect the public interest in privacy of information. I invite people to. Use audio me instead of trying to read through the chat and keep track of things. Okay. I wanted to just. show some these other what else is on this YouTube channel. So recommended viewing for the integrity project. The ethical dilemma of self driving cars. Stanford set so it's four minutes and 16 seconds that's a Ted ED video. Stanford seminar on Oracle vs Google Java eight our API is copyrightable that's an hour and 15 minutes. And then there's a story about hackers remotely kill a jeep. On a highway. And then there's another. minute and so video about quarter inch across the nation or using a computer program to protect. Who will. be a feature criminal. there's a resource if you're interested. Okay, so. These. pages are not very well maintained, I think. So there's a couple. Items here both vulnerability disclosure and software. And then grey hat hacking. But there's also some case studies. i'll put this link in the chat. Let me look for some other places here. See if we get any other better hit on. The on professional ethics. We have a microphone on the SME to say.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout rooms, based on. The case studies here. So. Make. Bigger rooms like I did last time, the larger size. And we'll take 10 minutes. And then we'll. we'll take it from there after 10 minutes okay. So clear enough. Okay. So it seems like everyone's back now. To set a good discussion.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It was OK.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;OK.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I think I had some troubles reading the article I was reading. Can you do it, she would you explained a little bit more what it was about can I do for like more context.

    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;good morning
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;morning
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;good morning
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;+10 baybeeee!
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;good mornig
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;same
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;HAhahahha
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Alright, see you next week then?
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;helloo! sorry joined late
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;frozen?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;they hacked it anyway so Ive heard
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Yea
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yeah
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;is it just me
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;No
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;FBI used a certain hardware that was free in the market or something
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;nope
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;maybe it is an April Fool prank
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;the universe does not want us to learn today
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;its illuminati
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;there's no sound from the screen share this time
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;no audio
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;no audio
    </li><li><strong>S18:</strong>&nbsp;can't hear
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I liked this video, very concise with the ethics
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I liked it too. Prof, what would you say is the code of ethics CS professionals should follow? Theres at least 3 that have been mentioned in class
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;He says they're going to make more videos at the end but this is the only video on the channel. :(
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Shoot I missed the start of class. As a short list, what have I missed for context?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think CS Ethics is like early Babylon. A ruler finally made the first Constitution that everyone followed
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;first law "An eye for an eye"
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;@Philip we've basically only watched the video on screen
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Philip, there's a video on the Mtg 22 page of the CS 280 website that you missed
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Thank1
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;maybe that's why he did that at the end lol
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Hahaha :) And I slept in after a late night for the 476 project
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Great start
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah there isn't much reach regarding these code of ethics
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I'd say clearly ethics is undervalued in tech lol
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;I thought an interesting point was that the codes aren't legally enforceable, but they are in place to help a professional to avoid breaking the law.
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;if it affects the case or had any value in that particular case, it sets a precedent for future cases
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;CS Ethics is like Jurrassic Park kinda, We are concerned if we can and not how we should.
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;I LOVE the new respond to meetings. Very clear what’s expected, and the list of meeting numbers is broken up to include due dates and ‘submitted’ status. Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;@levi IF that's a big if seeing as a lot of judges don't understand tech
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I mean, the case is out there, I'm surprised he didn't mention the affect that the code of ethics had on that confrontation
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I also don't think you need to be particularly familiar with tech to know about fair use and the ethics of behind some of those "rules"
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I think CS professionals should promote their ethics like the Hippocratic Oath
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;^^ The Hippocratic Oath also wasn't universally accepted at first
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;What ever Dr. Mengele did, don't! XD
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I mean @levi I would argue for the finer points you do. If you look at how the senate interrogated zuckurger none of them knew what was wrong with what he did. How can you make laws if you don't understand the problem
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Does this mean Facebook is violating the very first CIPS code of ethics and standard of conduct?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Ye, since its conception it was a troublesome child
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;did we do attendance?
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;pngky8
    </li><li><strong>S22:</strong>&nbsp;thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Thats a very good point @Keegan, but I believe a major part of these codes are to separate tech from their ethics and to make clear, using terms lawmakers might understand, the problems like what zuck did
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;the problems with what Zuckerberg did*
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah for sure but even a senator said they weren't going to do anything about it in the interview which is more concerning
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;maybe thats why the code of ethics needs to hold more weight, legally
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So do they still not understand or are they apathetic?
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Oh I agree that was my earlier point.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;https://ethics.acm.org/integrity-project/case-studies/
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Last year the US senate kept asking the Zucc and the Twitter CEO how to do the social media things and not really anything actually important like changing the outdated DMCA laws
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I dont think you can bash the argument from the video that the code of ethics are trying to become more legally binding
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;He never said that in the video. All he said was it is important because Oracle brought it up in a court case which is not true.
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;Bringing it up it court shows how it can be though. Its significant that it was a part of such a large case, it would be even more important if it affected such a case in a meaningful way. I dont think it did tho or he would have mentioned it lol
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;breakout room: pick a case study from https://ethics.acm.org/integrity-project/case-studies/ and discuss
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Can and is are very different. Normative things aren't relative in court battles
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;relevant*
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;I thought the point he was making in the video was how the code of ethics could one day become something more than normative
    </li><li><strong>S21:</strong>&nbsp;and how showing up in court was an example of it getting there
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;that’s my interpretation
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;GOOD discussion?
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yup
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, but a bit too short
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Took a little while to read up on the article and decide though
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;Longer might’ve been nice for time to read and discuss
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;it was very straight forward, "don't make heart pacer Bluetooth enabled"
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;A picture of the website design in question would have been helpful as it was difficult to visualize from the article's description
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;It reminds me of when you go to download a program or media and there will be an ad that says DOWNLOAD that's for a completely different thing, but you are more likely to click the ad rather than the proper download button because the ad is more flashy.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;and making the X the smallest thing in the universe
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I wish I could Alt F4 that sh*t
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;and then you press X it redirects to another website
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;^I swear this enrages me so much!
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Get an ad blocked extension^
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;was a kid back then ^
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I wish the ad was the tiniest thing on the planet and the X is average or bigger...
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I like ads with a big X...mmm...
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;literally force quitting because of the avalanche of ads hahaha. the internet was a dangerous place in the 90s
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;facebook is worse than those tho. selling my data and showing me god knows how much ads
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;I swear every time I talk about something an ad for that exact item appears within minutes
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;^ same
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah! why?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;the internet needs a patch fix?
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;understandable, they read your data and sugest products
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Starlink taking up all the bandwidth
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;but how does wish algorithm actually works
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;I never searched for those
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;the matrix is going through maintenance...
    </li><li><strong>S27:</strong>&nbsp;Ahahah wish’s algorithm is on something that is forsure
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Does wish have an algorithm? They recommend the weirdest stuff
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Reasons for internet slowness: https://www.csis.org/programs/strategic-technologies-program/significant-cyber-incidents
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;...so all my coding basically?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;sorry prof!
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;oh nevermind, I thought I sent a direct message
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;lol

    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;...wow the story is rough...
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;sure
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for the changes to meeting responses, it makes it a lot easier to submit
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Have a good weekend everyone!
    </li><li><strong>S25:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you. You too!
    </li><li><strong>S28:</strong>&nbsp;Is there any office
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;What is the attendance code?
    </li><li><strong>S20:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, have a great weekend!
