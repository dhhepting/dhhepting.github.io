<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning, everybody. see so many people Online with cameras on And not talking So I I muted your Your AUDIO So I now I can I can request for you to To unmute yourself, but I can't do it for you because of privacy concerns.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So you want to send muted.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, sure. We can do it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Just explaining the way the lay of the land, so to speak. Okay, so my name is Darrell happening. You can call me Dr happening or Darrell just try and limit yourself to one of those two And I'm a professor in the Department of Computer Science and This is the US to at risk reward and information society. So, I just want to go over a few things.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Today,
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So how is the break for everyone.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Break.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;T shirt.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I feel that
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;My wife and I are kids, they're not at home with us anymore. And so we got a puppy. We started talking about Gagan new puppy and then the opportunity came up and so Now we have a puppy. Is not yet host trained But otherwise, Yes, you will see the puppy. But not today. I think Okay. Well, yeah. I'll do something I'll make some arrangements for to make an appearance, maybe, maybe on Thursday. So he's a. His name is Elgar after the British composer, not all guards after the famous Rough Rider player. Only people get that reference Not, not to the composer, but to the right to the Rough Rider. So this would be a good time to see how we're gonna Do things Because you have 100 and I didn't check last number I saw was 139 students. So I'm not sure for for still there. Or some people Need some other choices. Let's So, Keeping you muted during the meeting is Why while you don't have anything to say. While you're listening. I mean, Is good because then it just keeps the car keeps the audio clear There's not a lot of going back and forth. But I suggest that we use the little blue hands. Okay, so you should see Your participants window, you should see Some icons. I'm not sure why the hands aren't blue. Very good. Are you doing emojis. Looks like So thank you for giving me your reaction which is okay.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, the other blue hands that are normally underneath the participants window, they're not there right now.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, there is an update yesterday and I might even class had them in the morning one didn't offer did the update. So I'm guessing that's it.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;My morning class this morning did have them.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Just kidding. I have no idea.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;20 minutes ago. So I'm assuming that's not the issue. But I don't know.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Let me just See whether it's hidden a new option army. Emoji hands are You would even work better than the blue hands. Let me just take a peek here about a setting. Yeah, I did an update. Recently, too. I don't see anything immediately popping up. So look into it for next day. minute ago. I don't understand why. You see if I can If anyone wants to Have a chat on discord. There's a an invitation to my Server. Okay, so I made a text channel in this Court for our class. To add 2021 can So I what I did last semester. Is I saved the chat and I'm so I wanted to tell you that I'm also doing an audio recording As Well, I'm actually doing a video recording as well. But I'm not using that I'm not posting that anywhere. So that everyone gets The note about being recorded. This meeting is being recorded. Okay. So what When I did last semester was I Did it I use I can get an audio transcript of the recording. So I use the transcript to summarize the contents of our meeting. And then So I put The chat window guy saved and the audio transcript and I match them up. So that was somewhat successful, but I think it's probably better to Summarize what's what's going on. So we don't have A minute by minute breakdown of Are the students last semester said, instead of having The transcript organized by By timestamps it's better to have it organized by scenes and then Make it a little bit easier to track down what's going on and where So I'm gonna try and adopt and So I will So if you if you find that you need to have a copy of the audio transcript of the meeting. Or is it not the transcript with the audio recording Because I think what I might do is just To keep that for myself and then just post the the summary based on the transcript. So you can let me know how that goes. All right. If you can hear a little bit of a Muffled bark in the background. That's my puppy. Did you hear the phone ring there. Anyway, I apologize for that. Didn't turn on. Do Not Disturb, I guess. Okay, so let me share the screen with you are Emoji hands up. Is there a question. You have a question. welcome, you're welcome to unmute yourself and Let me know. Okay, so can you see that screen here.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yep.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Great. Okay, so here's your courses student user guide. And I'm going to post a link to the department head David guard made a student orientation video And I'll post a link to that as well. Over here under the general course information. So the next one. Next, like there's she has to add on my website. So the arrangement is that I'm going to Use your courses for For work and for scheduling things and But the content with the on my website. Will be on my website. So let me just show you what that looks like. Know 10 To 120 21 winter. Okay, so I have a list of office hours here. A little bit bigger than I'd like to make it Screen space. For the Participants window. Well, good. Parts that aren't candidate or the class meetings and gray here. That's not great as smart as I am. Thanks. So starting Starting today, I'm going to have an office hour at 330 to 430 And then a tough times between On Mondays and Wednesdays. To office hours to office hours. And one and one. So makes total of six contact hours. I should post the link to my Office. Meetings. There's 26 meetings during the semester. Here's the first one. So this should link to the upcoming events in your courses. Calendar. Okay, so I haven't added my office hours. You can see the Course meeting time So next week we'll Start doing attendance during During our zoom meetings. 5%
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Participation work.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;And did anyone have to go through the US YOUR QUESTIONS site policy agreement. You have to agree to that before you could get into your courses this semester. So I thought I included here just to make sure that people saw so so dealing with intellectual property, so forth. Those are Parts. Part of our discussion this semester. And in this course. Your courses page link. So here are the past exams have had I didn't update. This was a final exam from last winter. But I will do that shortly. So these are the past kinds of these are the exams are done in the past when I've taught this class. And I'm inclined to to forgo a mid term this semester. That Would anyone be heartbroken without a mentor. Anyway, so Trying to not have the final exam. I mean, not the midterm. And the final exam. If we do I suppose there are cut Well, Do the final exam will do will be using proctor track. And we can talk about proctor track. More detail, but that's That's the way to do final exams. That are Well, I think that's maybe the easiest way to do it. And the final exam date has been set. The 29th of April. Or it might be the 20th I think one is that one. I still not sorted out in my head in terms of which dates are which Anyone taking two or five In an hour. Ago switch from one One zoom meeting to another. Okay, so then in terms of topics that we're going to talk about the semester. So we can look at Overview Work in progress. But our SP that where we get most of our topics from Stanford social issues and professional practice. So this, this text is written for the 2013 report. So there was supposed to. There's an effort to revamp this for the 2020 We're supposed to be a 2020 report, but I'm not sure the status of it. So, Some of the details are Are not quite as fresh as You might expect, you might See them today. Just remember that things were written in 2013 Of ethics. Professional Conduct Was rewritten in 2018 I believe So question that we have before. So, Let's just read the preamble competing professionals actions. Change the world to act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of the work consistently supporting the public good. So a question. That I have for you, not just for today, but for the semesters. How do we talk about how do we understand the public good. If I'm a member of the public and it's good for me. Does that mean that I'm doing something in the public good. Maybe not. But we'll, we'll examine that a bit more closely. A look at things in the news. Certainly some things that Are going on these days that Reflect on reflect on the fact that computer professionals, change the actions, change the world. So what does it mean to be a computer professional And Yeah, how do we support the public good. How do we understand the public good, because you see that there's A lot of discussion about keeping upholding the public good, but without An operational definition of public good. It's a little bit vague, I think. So some of the things are going to social context or The social implications of competing in a networked world. The impact of social media and individualism and collectivism and culture. Person control the Internet. Referred to as a digital divide differences in access to digital technology resources that's resulting ramifications for gender, class ethnicity geography and or Under underdeveloped countries. Or countries in the developing world. access issues. Accessibility issues, including legal requirements. And context or computing Okay. So those are the that's the general Overview of The topics will consider So in terms of the plan. The same as what appears under the meeting for the day. And then under the meeting for the day. After the fact, also at the transcript. So that's just how lovely things out. And Material to look out for. In support of the meeting would be here. So we'll see some of that for next day. Can you hear the commentary from my headphones. No. Okay. Okay. My headphones are telling you which devices are connected to And when when they lose connection with my iPhone and Anyway, I'm never sure what's What's the audible
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Anyway,
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;My schedule. Make sure that this link is correct for the office. So if you want to send me email. Please don't try and message me On your courses or Either use a discussion forums. Or send me email directly. And then this would So don't do your courses email. And I don't accept your courses contact requests, because it seems to me that the contacts are just They come up and go ahead of any context around them. So it's hard for me if I have three classes going on in this semester, I don't know where the messages are coming from. So, I just try and Encourage. Encourage I encourage you to use the discussion forums or send me email directly So in terms of meetings. The meetings are So here we are on the 12th of January. And then we go through So we have two or six meetings in January. Six. In February, and then Many more nine in March. This is worse than doing math on the board. 21 plus five. six and six and nine and five is 26 So, Briefly. To look at the breakdown of marks. So, I'm going to ask you. Not starting today but To write something about the meeting. Within 24 hours so When When I Created the transcript and posted that so you can eat. Look at that, for your comments. So If there's a question or comment or resource. Or something. Some related idea to expand. Upon the discussion. So ask you to submit that here. Seems like the beginning very semester. There's a few hiccups so This technology. And so I wasn't sure that we're going to have our Your questions. Page Setup and properly put that worked out. Anyway, so we'll get into force for stride on Thursday. Individual assignments. Will be 35% of the mark. There'll be a project. That involves A number of different options. For 25 And then the exam final exam will be 25 And then five marks for participation. So that will include attendance at meetings and some other things. OK, so The PDF version of the syllabus on Thursday. Do the breakout rooms breakout group. So instead of having them act be randomly. Configured from date from meeting to meeting. I'll make up a list of groups. So you'll have be in the same breakout room breakout group for the whole semester. So instead of Having to Click on your microphone when there's 129 practice people Listening to you. So we'll make the groups, a little bit more manageable. So you can have a discussion. And maybe I'll call on different groups, different group each day to to the summary. See how that works. So make sense. Any questions or concerns about The breakdown of So,
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;How the marketing of group assignment will be done. Make 100% so
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so there's no group assignment. It should add up to 100% without the group assignment. So 10 plus 35 is 45 plus 25 is 7025 for the exam. 95 and then five for participation. If that's not correct. I'm not gonna give you something other than It should total 100 Oh yes, I forgot to say about research credits up to the 2% up to two bonus marks. So in the case that there are research. Credits available. You could get a new god all 100 marks. Then you could end up with 102 So those So the total with a bonus are On the page. Has anyone heard about these research credits from Computer Science Department participant pool.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;But not for
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so the Computer Science participle. This modeled after the one in psychology And So if there are, because from time to time. It's nice to actually Get People to try things out. So they might be user studies or they might Be some Things are I guess their user studies in in general terms. So you can earn one mark. Preach study in which you participate So the idea is in a little talk about this in terms of an ethical position. So don't want we want enough to say thank you, but not so much to say it's no longer possible. I don't really want to do this but Because the amount of bonus works is so high. That I can't say no. So then you don't have not giving free and informed consent. Because you're being coerced. If I say I'll give you a 75% bonus To do this. Study And might be too hard to say no. Anyway, so we're not, we don't have a 75% bonus So one 1% bonus per steady doesn't. I don't think it's two courses. So since thanks, who not Not, not it's not enough to Pitch to do something different. If you're really opposed to the idea of doing the study, then One one bonus Mark won't dissuade you are would encourage you to Lisa my my thinking is so it's enough to say thank you, but not enough to encourage Her to act of coercion. Anyway, So I'm the research participant pool coordinator. So if, if there's something going on. You'll see it here. If there's an opportunity. You'll see it here. Okay, so there's nothing listed There isn't going to be anything available. Okay, that makes sense. Think suddenly turn their microphone. Microphone on but didn't want it didn't mean to speak to the whole group.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Hardly mark the attendance.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Goes through that next day so I'm going to Share a password with you. I think we'll do it about midway point through each meeting. But we'll try it out. Next day And then we'll just do it from then on. Okay, so there's like a Code to use that all put in the chat. And then To have a window and For you to enter your attendance. Okay. So this isn't a new way for me to do it. I've heard great things. This is a This is a great way to do it. Yeah, so we'll see we'll work it out. Okay, so I've got a couple of videos in mind. That like he's looking at for next day. So I'm just gonna One of the one from Damon horowitz's TEDx talk called My headphones. You're telling me when it loses my connection its connection to my phone. It doesn't tell me when we gained it so it just hear about it being lost. Anyway, So I think it's called Covered a moral operating system. So I'll put the link in the transcript from today's Chat. And The other one is from the Hour of Code. Anyone heard about the Hour of Code. Well, There was, there was Computer Science Education Week. Well, they still is. Yes. It goes on. During or it scheduled to coincide with a week that Contains grasshoppers birthday. You will know who Grace Hopper is She Person behind Kobo I could ask anyone know what cobalt is Common business oriented language. And she's also the person who popularized The phrase computer bug. By finding a moth amongst vacuum tubes. And I believe she also popularized It's easier to get forgiveness than permission. And there's a she do, she was on Letterman in the 80s. I think that hasn't been taken down. Anyway, I'll post some information about her. She came to the University of Regina in 1974 to give a lecture when the Department of Computer Science. Was just getting started. So it was a big deal. So, and we had Dave Palmer. Alumnus From our department. give a presentation on December 9 which is grasshoppers birthday. Anyone see that virtual presentation. Anyway, I have to I'll post a link to that as well. But anyway to get back to code.org so An hour of code. So there are a few years when CS education week was Getting going along. And then No and see 2011 I think or so. Maybe 12 The idea was to get people to do an Hour of Code. And so to support this. They had a couple of videos. And the videos have changed over the years. So I'll put a link to the current one. To a 10 minute video. The serve Well I study computer science. Kind of video So I'd like you to look at that one as well. So does anyone think we're not going to have enough topical material to talk about this semester. I think we will not run out of things to come from the news.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;There's plenty to talk about, I think,
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Maybe too much to talk about. But anyway, so we'll see how the idea is not to take sides. Anyway, the idea is to talk about the computer professionals role in this. And examine things From the perspective of What we can do do As current and future professionals. This aspiring professionals, where we can do to uphold the public good. Okay. So I think it'll be A lively semester. So we're not, I'm not going to ask you to do anything. Today, but we'll get the Get the spot for your Your, your thoughts about today's the next meeting. Or the just past meeting most not start that won't start that today, it will start it on Thursday. Okay. So any questions or concerns.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I'm Seeing A lot of discussion about proctor track in the chat. I don't know if there is an alternative to that or maybe a different solution for a final exam or something. I'm just seeing a lot of people concerned about it in chat right now.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks. Again, Discussion about it. And I'll put it. So what I'll do is I'll add some links to the material from the University In terms of Okay. So, hello. just posted the link to the video that I was going to add So this is the one Okay, so Concerned about proctor crack So, In general, I mentioned proctor track today because I mentioned proctor track because I didn't want to not mention it. But in terms of my My approach to the final exam. I would like your input in decide in developing an exam and evaluation that Is a fair assessment. Of Your learning over the course of the semester. Yeah. So I noticed people are sending me used to be called private messages. Now, Lucy updated direct message. So please don't write to me privately. The conversation. So if you send me a direct message that I'm not included inclined to include it. But if I'm summarizing the The contents of the chat. I wouldn't put anyone's name in it. So, So just as a Rule of thumb. Let's try and Keep the conversation. Public But not so public that mean we're not going to do this in a public forum. We have some protection are the Only people who can join The meeting here are those who got the invitation. And registered. And I think that's a bit of an oversimplification. And for some books or for someone who got zoom bomb blast winter. I'm a little bit more wary of Limitations of zoom Anyway, Time for today. So I will So we're out of time for today. And I don't mean to say that we're going to have a certain kind of exam. I wanted to Say if we're going to have a proctored exam. This is we need to use proctor track. There's some other options. And turn it in as Is a reasonable solution as well. So this is a conversation to have. Yeah, so I can Make a poll about some things Some options. And I'll make I'll do I'll do your courses. Feedback. For saying this generally in meetings so that We have a record outside of zoom There's a question about Polls and you're in, zoom, and then, so those are Nice, in some ways, but then they don't start to make them last outside of zoom For So anyway, lots of questions, lots of discussions to have And we're out of time. Like I Said today. So we'll talk about things. On Thursday. Okay. Thanks very much. See everyone on Thursday.

    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;we must see the puppy.
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;wanna see that pupppy
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;what kind?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Guest speaker
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;if you don't mind me asking
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Having the same issue
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;I’m pretty sure the hands are yellow now due to the Zoom update. They used to be blue
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I think in the new update, zoom changed the layout
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;Mine are still blue.....
    </li><li><strong>S26:</strong>&nbsp;ya mine too
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;I havnt updated yet
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Thats probably it, my guess is its based on the hosts zoom if they have updated or not.
    </li><li><strong>S23:</strong>&nbsp;lag?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;^^ Yeah that could be the case
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;Sir are you lag?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;discord: https://discord.gg/xpAfzdsY
    </li><li><strong>S45:</strong>&nbsp;Can you explain the rules and outline of the course
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;i didn't see a syllabus on the site, is there none or did i just miss it?
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;it works, haha.
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;it's great
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;it's great
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I use it a lot
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;me
    </li><li><strong>S31:</strong>&nbsp;It has been quite handy for me
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;Yup
    </li><li><strong>S35:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S47:</strong>&nbsp;Yes
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Yup
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;yesd
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;Sure!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Yes it popped up for me this morning
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;yup
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;no sir
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;...no?
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;No
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;it heavily depends, hahah.
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe a little because then its nice to know how you ask questions/mark
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;if there's too much mark on final, I will be heartbroken
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;i agree with rhythm
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;facts
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;I prefer TurnItIn over proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;The 280 exam is on April 20th
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;it would be nice to use turnitin instead of proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;280 final is on the 20th
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;less technical, arguably more effective...
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I would be very open to an alternative to proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S49:</strong>&nbsp;agree
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I am concerned about privacy concerns related to proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S50:</strong>&nbsp;^agree
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;NO
    </li><li><strong>S51:</strong>&nbsp;No
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;Is the syllabus posted? or I am missing out on something?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;The topics section on his website is the syllabus
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;on his website
    </li><li><strong>S44:</strong>&nbsp;do we have attendance today?
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;What about the marks distribution, midterm dates descriptions etc?
    </li><li><strong>S45:</strong>&nbsp;is there a group project?
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;^The marks distribution I think is given on UR courses, all the sections have the percentage assigned to it, but I'm not sure
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;...I wish I just had a 1-2 page accumulated summary of all the assignments...
    </li><li><strong>S40:</strong>&nbsp;we will let you know if theres concern, just keep going as you please!
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;26 in total
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;god I thought there will be 35 assignments for a second
    </li><li><strong>S45:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;lol same
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;🤣🤣
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Is the group project a required component of the course?
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;it doesn't make up of any marks tho
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;yeah what is the deal with that?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;the others make up 100% already
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;my guess is project itself is a group thing
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Ok works for me thank you
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;sorry I was late are we takingattendance？
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;No, we’re just discussing the breakdown of marks
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;forgot to ask
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Project is individual ?
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;okay thanks
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;No problem (:
    </li><li><strong>S38:</strong>&nbsp;@Mandeep There’s no project this semester
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;did you mark the attendance ?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Nope
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S51:</strong>&nbsp;No
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;That would be a great bonus
    </li><li><strong>S41:</strong>&nbsp;hahah rats
    </li><li><strong>S36:</strong>&nbsp;For projects are we going to work in group or individually?
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;still concerned about proctortrack
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;^^ Individual
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S56:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S32:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;You could create a virtual machine for protrack @muhammad
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;nice idea 💡 @keegan
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;what do you mean keegan?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;We had attendance that way in CS215 and it seemed to work well
    </li><li><strong>S57:</strong>&nbsp;lol I think that's cheating
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;proctor track will know your on a virtual machine
    </li><li><strong>S54:</strong>&nbsp;do we need web cam for exam in this course？
    </li><li><strong>S24:</strong>&nbsp;CS215 was a movie last semester lol
    </li><li><strong>S48:</strong>&nbsp;yes you need a webcam for proctor track
    </li><li><strong>S58:</strong>&nbsp;yes
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;Nope
    </li><li><strong>S55:</strong>&nbsp;no
    </li><li><strong>S37:</strong>&nbsp;nope
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;if you guys must know, I have the most 4kHD desktop monitor and some random 3 hour long recording of my face
    </li><li><strong>S59:</strong>&nbsp;nope
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;...me being random, don't mind me
    </li><li><strong>S60:</strong>&nbsp;where is the syllabus/
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;assembly language
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;and paper right?
    </li><li><strong>S61:</strong>&nbsp;😳
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Proctortrack probably doesn’t work with VMs
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;So privacy concern still remains
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;@keegan &amp; @Jennifer I believe their is a way to set it up with video capabilities but ill look into this. I
    </li><li><strong>S46:</strong>&nbsp;Proctortrack can still be bypassed but it is still much more effort
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Especially with compromise of the proctortrack last year
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I think we'll have lots
    </li><li><strong>S58:</strong>&nbsp;the entire great hack or the social dilemma lol
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;Didn't social media help cause everything?
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;social media showed everything in the light
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;It sure helped in spreading it
    </li><li><strong>S58:</strong>&nbsp;started as a utopian world and it seems to dystopian
    </li><li><strong>S52:</strong>&nbsp;I was in cs 201 last semester and my proctor track kept restarting..so my prof had to add me on zoom instead
    </li><li><strong>S62:</strong>&nbsp;https://mediaspace.uregina.ca/media/Introduction+to+Online+Learning/0_1fd99ylw
    </li><li><strong>S62:</strong>&nbsp;The department head recorded this and he covers Proctortrack (and related concerns) very well
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Link to video that I mentioned at the start: https://mediaspace.uregina.ca/media/Introduction+to+Online+Learning/0_1fd99ylw
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I think protrack proposes some concerns but generally the alternative is a much harder open book exam.
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;^ open book exams are ruthless
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;One suggestion right off the bat is a term paper based on topics we've learned
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;i.e take home essay due in a couple of days or so.
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah I'd rather not have an open book exam for sure
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I’d take open book exam over use of proctortrck
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;rather write exam with eyes closed and hands tied than open book
    </li><li><strong>S63:</strong>&nbsp;I would prefer marks spread between a midterm and a final rather than just a final
    </li><li><strong>S29:</strong>&nbsp;lol
    </li><li><strong>S62:</strong>&nbsp;^^ Rhythm haha :)
    </li><li><strong>S43:</strong>&nbsp;@reanne same
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;^^^^
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Time based closed exam on Zoom and UR Courses can be a good alternative
    </li><li><strong>S53:</strong>&nbsp;People can still cheat hardcore that way. I think the term paper is a solid idea cause it can be vetted through turnitin
    </li><li><strong>S64:</strong>&nbsp;If we have any options for final exam like blog writing etc. then it might be good!!
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;^agree
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Would Dr.Hepting be able to make a poll on URcourses to see what options we like?
    </li><li><strong>S19:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S17:</strong>&nbsp;Can we make groups by our selfs ?
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you professor, see you next class :)
