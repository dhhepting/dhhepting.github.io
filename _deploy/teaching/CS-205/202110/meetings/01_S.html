<ul><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Hello.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks for all the emails I got yesterday, asking about your courses and so I was worried. To begin with, I got an email that said, so the functionality of adding students to classes wasn't working. But it seemed to work overnight. As I was Finally, They got it working in time to get things done overnight. Doing today. Wow. Very close awesome, amazing. That's very good to hear. So, My wife and I got a puppy, over I guess just over a week ago. So he's been occupying our time. Keeping us busy. His name is Olga after the English composer. And not the farmer rife writer. And you will get that I'll see If he can make a presence of an appearance on Thursday. Okay. So I just had a meeting with. I'm not sure if anyone's in two at 130 students there. As a few more cameras on So I'm not gonna force fields and put cameras on From time to time. Or perhaps put a picture. Or it's not a picture movie or drawing or some kind of Avatar. Thanks for the few people turn them on, We'll get through it somehow this semester. Okay. So some of you I know from last winter or previously. And so hello again. This is a little bit different experience and last winter because Last winter we had some face to face time to Get to know each other a little bit before we end retreated to our Room with computers and Cameras and microphones. So, Take some time. So important to make sure it's doing okay with The isolation. I think it's not a bad setup to do Remote classes like this. In for me it's I noticed Last fall, that there were a lot of students. In the cameras on and then use the microphones and So, For me, I found it. difficult at times to Connect with everybody. When they just black squares, rectangles with names on them. So we have about 2029 in the class, I think. So maybe that's not too bad. In terms of For comfort level if you need to. Speak up about something or So you could do a chat. You can put things into the chat and I'll try and address them. So what I did last semester was I saved the text chat window. And then I also did a transcription of the audio. And then I combined them. By timestamp into a Into a transcript. So, Turn audio transcriptions isn't 100% Typically you are courses. All this comes up as your courses, while you are So, Anyway, Let me say that I'm doing the recording. Not, not to jeopardize anyone's privacy. But to create better Create a better record of what's going on. So my plan this semester is to not do a verbatim transcript by minute by minute breakdown of the class discussion. rather look at Create a summary with topics. And put the links and So on and so forth into the Into the transcript that will show up. For next next week. It'll show up on the website. Once I get it processed. So unless somebody needs to have the audio recording is I'm inclined disinclined to share that with you. So, I'll share Pictures. And other videos and things Links and so forth. Well, share pictures, my own pictures, pictures to come up with our discussion or drawings that I do. With my tablet and so forth. Maybe, maybe not directly because I get Some people give me poor marks for legibility on my writing. doesn't improve with the tablet. Anyway, so graphics, I would I can Share on Dropbox. And if I'm recording a video, I can do that as well. And then I'll put three But I won't put the The audio file likes up anymore. If you need to see them. You can let me know. Or if you need to hear them. Pardon me. You can let me know. Okay. And you can see how The video this transcription seems to Work out Anyway, So there's that. I realized it didn't say who I was. My name is Darrell happening. I'm a professor in the Department of Computer Science. So you can call me Dr happening or Darrell please choose one of those two I'll leave it at that. Okay, so The idea here is that we're Exploring together the content. So, I welcome your input on everything. And I'm going to talk about how it's formalized Trying to formalize it a little bit more. So this semester. So let me go to the website. I'll share the screen with you. Okay, so this is what our page looks like on your courses at the moment. So Dr. Garrow the department head in computer sciences created a video. For students and the English proctor track and all kinds of online learning remote learning issues. So I haven't added that here yet, but I will So we're using zoom to conduct these synchronous meetings. So we have a scheduled time For class. And so this is these meetings will occur at our scheduled times And then, um, And then we're going to use your courses for some things, as well. And The transcript and so forth. Of the meeting will go on to my website and so Click over there right now. So the first line is office hours so Calendar here. Office hours Mondays and Wednesdays. From 1232 to 30 And then So you can see here the cyan. I think so. I Think this is called. This is the all of color because they did it to Protect pick the color with the stars. Oh, for office. One two hours, four hours and then Afternoon Tuesdays and Thursday afternoons on the also be available. 330 to 430 for questions or concerns or discussion. Okay, so there's my schedule. Here's a link that will send me an email. I prefer that you do this. Because even since the subject we just Don't know if it's going to Be VLC it But if you click on there. It's should open your email client and set the subject for the message to two or five and So if you have something Something a question. You'd like to communicate to me directly. You can use email. If you have a question for the class, I would encourage you to use the discussion forums. So I'm not doing you are courses email and I don't accept your courses contact request. This because it seems to me that they're very hard to track down I get messages from people and they say, Who's this And what's it relating to you. Because some students don't always say, Hey, I'm a student into a five. Question. Sometimes I get emails that Are the students name is not even included And the original email address is not a big clue to help me determine who's the person's name. Anyway, so email. Preferences. Discussion forums for everybody in class and then second choice. Or if it's something personal sends an email to me. Hey, so we're going to have 26 meetings are class the first one. Here is the sole schedule. So six meetings in January and February. Nine in March and five and April. Okay, so we can look at An individual meeting and say, Now you can look at the upcoming events with Your courses calendar. So you can see the The meeting times are in Or in the calendar. I haven't added the office hours yet. And the assignments. And other due dates would be appearing here as well. Zoom meeting invitations instead of Including links. Are having recurring meeting links and so on. So I got zoom bond last winter so I'm not Sending out meeting invitations is a Good way to do things. So, If you register and if So if you're registered like I asked you to do today and to Register using your, your China email address. Then I can use it more easily put you together in Groups or breakout rooms and I can manage that more easily. And then it's also easier to track. Your participation in class. I think because Sometimes people can join without including an email address and well if I don't require registration, then Then I might not get an email address. And then if people are registering without you rejecting email addresses. Keep track of. How many different How many people are how many different email addresses refer to the same person. I guess that's That's the issue. So it's not an imposition. That's sort of my request is that we're Stick with your agenda email addresses. And then Just keep things near Okay, so Any questions or comments so far. Okay. So never to formalize your interaction with The meetings and the meeting contents like Not that you have to Sound. Some days I understand you're not not able to Participate in in the synchronous zoom meetings. To review the material for the meetings, including the transcript of what was covered And within a day within 24 hours. Make something, make a comment about make make a post About the words, an important idea or a question you had or some extra material that would be useful. So just for you to be engaged. So there's a particular kind of form. That sort of That's set up for tomorrow for our next meeting. Will be worth 10 marks over the whole semester so That's an easy way to get 10 marks a little bit as a time So if you have exam questions. Or things like that in mind. Anyway, we'll talk about that again on Thursday. So there are five So five individual assignments. For total of 20 marks. And then there's a project that can be individual or group. And then there's the lab. So I just checked my mouse here. So 10 plus And it was labs. It's 70 And then exams are 25 To 95 This is from last Semester. So, I, I'm not expecting to do a mid term anyone heartbroken about not having a midterm exam. Okay. So check If you are There we can talk about can discuss that in the forums, if you're having an issue with that. And then lastly, this participation. So try something new. To do attendance meetings. And we'll go. We'll do a dry run on that on Thursday. And then after that, we'll just Handle it. Okay. And then finally there's research credit Since I'm the participant pool coordinator If there's an opportunity to get a research credit. You'll see it here. And you might see available and other classes as well. But the ideas of their researchers who would like to have students try things out or do a new user study or something similar. And they have research ethics board approval. Which they need to They want to Make use of that user study data at all. Anyway, so they can decide they can use a particular pool to recruit And so fairly Steady Every project which you Participate you can get a bonus mark. So it's about two bonus mark and not a bonus 50 marks. So that it's enough to say thank you, but So much that it would of course you to Do something he didn't want to do You think why I really don't want to Do this study, but it's such a such a Large Mark, I can't say no to it. Because I would influence your Would not be giving your free and informed consent. In that case, so we're just doing one one work or study is the way to say thank you. As a token of our appreciation That makes sense. So today are 202 with these up to the two bonus marks. So I'm not sure there's anything coming up this winter so You may not see anything here but If something does come up, you will see it here and you'll hear me tell you about it. Okay. Okay. Going to Discord server that we can Use if you're interested. We create a channel. I was looking at this record is what and the opportunity to Capture text channels. And put maybe include them in the transcript of the meeting. So apparently there is something There's Somebody written some code to do that. But I'm not sure that that's Anyway, again, the idea of not having a verbatim transcript of what's going on. But I'll try and Incorporate comments I see and discord into the Transcript for the For the meeting the summary is a meeting. Okay. So I didn't I'm not sure about having Let's see. So I think last time when I did this. Discord server I has the link the wouldn't expire and then So I was trying to be A little more protective of as well. This Is just experimenting a little bit with it so I would appreciate comments about How better to manage these things. Anyway, I'll do another invite So the assignments set up for Thursday as well. So there'll be five individual assignments. And then the project. Your courses. So I won't have we will don't plan on having a midterm. The final exam. Will be In April. I want to go and find it now. I'll make sure that information is correct for serious thing here. I believe If we do a proctored exam. It needs to be with proctor track. And So I just want to mention that now. Here are some previous exams that I've done in the class. And I need to update this with the mid the final from last the last offering offering So I have the PDF version of the syllabus ready for Thursday as well. Semester. These are from the ACM and I Tripoli. Computer science curriculum. That's from 2013 so This gives a bit of an idea of what Some guidelines, some Indications for the content. But it's not necessarily completely up to date. I think there was a new version planned for 2020 but I'm not sure where that stands right now. But anyway, so the idea is that we're going So the machine lower Presentation of Data And the computational science data and information and knowledge. Just sort of dealing with encoding. So how do we Look at some of the deal. Some of the big ideas. So we have analog data. We're going to digitize And what are the issues that we have to deal with in Going from analog to digital From continuous to discrete Nice video about Entropy from the Khan Academy Because I'm going to put a link in here. In in Summary of today's meeting. So GV as a knowledge areas graphics and visualization. So rid of graphics Dealing with Color and Vector in bitmap kinds of graphics and And the connections between bitmap vector format and Continuous and discreet He is or we're going to talk a little bit of interactive Things. And multimedia systems. And web web platforms. You're going to deal with because Multimedia systems. We were talking about How to represent audio. And movies. And then the web platforms. How we can deal with Creating creating content for mobile platforms and Responsive design. And the impact Their desire to Have responsive design graphics and Good performance how those relate to our choice of Graphic formats and so on. Changing things around over the break. And you've seen the your courses side policy agreement. Is the thing that was That was new today with the upgrade that you have to create to it. So it's also a good reminder terms of Considering how to use other existing material. And so we're not doing it unfairly or without Trying to misrepresent misrepresent other people's work as our own and Good stuff like that. There's nothing Nothing for today. So include that. Those videos I mentioned As prep and the transcript for today, but also as preparation for the second meeting on Thursday. OK. So the lamps are going to be dealing with Adobe Creative Suite. And so we conceptually covering the same areas as we're talking about in class. We're going to be dealing with Are going to use P five, which is a web based So does everyone have a computer science account on Hercules, or wherever it's Used to be called Hercules anyway. Feeling my age now and I'm not sure to the names of the OK. So the idea is So you can create a personal lead page. Do you know about public HTML on Hercules' If you serve a directory called public HTML. Like this for you to Be too. I didn't mean I'm just giving you a I'm still talking about peace. In my mind I haven't stopped talking about it. That didn't sound very good didn't even sound funny. So we can work with things directly in the editor, so you don't need to put things on to your homepage into your Hercules account. That there's a possibility for you to do that. As well so So I just want to say that this is this is what your web address would look like for the content that you put into publication underscore HTML. Because it's an Apache web server. And then they have per user directories. Indicated by the Tilda. The squiggle on your username. I think the Domain is right. Yeah okay so converted it to a link But the username part isn't There isn't anyone named username. So if I change that to my My username. So my web page looks that can be accessed like that. So my username is happening. And inside my public HTML directory. I have this Yeah. Okay, so we'll go through those details. I'll put some Linking relevant documentation and You can discuss it. Next day, okay. So, So if you don't have Hercules account. Send me an email. Regarding the Hercules. This you would use it to get to So you just from your home directory you do a major Public underscore HTML. And then I change my mode to 755 Anyway, I'll go through those Details. I'll send you Include the link to the details. Of how to set that up. So, the point was you didn't need to. So It's not necessary to To do things on Hercules, but because you can do them still inside The Editor. Ask So I know the updated version of my zoom client. It's gone from private message. So it's now called direct message. I don't think it's functionally any different. But I would encourage you to not Send me direct messages, because I And I'm not sure whether I can turn that off. Let's see. Change the setting here. Prefer that if you, if you can, to Use Chat to everybody, because that way. Communication easier. Okay. That makes sense. If you need to reach me directly. Well, you can do that. I guess but Anyway, how about if you need to send me something privately, then you use some other channels outside of the class meeting. Okay. So I'm just thinking about Converting the chat into Or including the chat as part of the summary of the of the meeting. So I don't want to Get involved. I mean, I'd prefer not to include anything that's been sent to me personally. So if you don't Have that option then maybe that makes it easier Question. Anyway, I'm just trying to be upfront about My decision making my my thought process in Creating the Meetings, and so on. Available. Earlier, she now these are emerging hands. I don't know whether they're that's a feature. Or I can see any of the icons, because I'm the host. I don't get to give myself feedback I
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Guess.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;But then I don't know what Oh, someone's clapping Thank you. I'll take that. Thumbs up. Okay, this for the, for the people who are the hands up. This is there. Are you Clicking on that on the hand button when you end getting the emoji or is emoji. Every action, different from the end. I don't know how many different kinds of reactions are Available. Anyway, So because there's 2425 of us now. Let's say we don't have to Raise your hand if you want to You can unmute yourself as you see the need. Okay. Let's see. All right. Reaction. I'll take that as a yes. Anyway, let me just since we've got about 10 minutes left. Let me go through Okay, one, yes. Very good. Okay, let me go back to the editor here. Okay. So for our purposes for today's purpose. This is just A sample. Running in p five. So can you see the animation. So you can interact with it. So what's in the Associated with this. Sketches called so there's a JavaScript file sketch JS. And then there's index dot html file. So this is Getting the Versions of
