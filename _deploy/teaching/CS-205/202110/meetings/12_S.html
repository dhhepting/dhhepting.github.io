    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I was able to submit something in the proposal copy.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Next, part of. Your courses, they can navigate to the topics. Well let's go say how he's feeling much better today than yet on Tuesday there now i'm. Training. For you as well i'm sure. It was exciting to watch me. said. Your courses to correct. So that should be okay. And for the one person who submitted and I didn't see what was it was submitted. The original one. Please make sure that you know submission. place. So if if you have a. group same be working together. make up for. Students in. Each group. So if the numbers, they will be working together, making. Your insulin. identify the adequate number. magically. work in the same group sure. To make sense. Okay well. So i'm not gonna scribble today, I think. You could look at. Well, actually my scribbles from the past couple days we are good idea somebody is interested in the project. About. Australia, with different colors spaces, we talked about. Transforming between them. assignments. They can see. The text words. relax and enjoy. here. example. Specifying and. So this is a. See the. equation source code here so set up. So 100 101 50. To.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;250.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we can try, so this is a careers are named after a. French. word. usual I. Design clients. Is a little bit about. So you can describe this a curve. In terms of. What control lights comdex hall. And then. So. Interesting feature these curses they all stay inside come on back small. mind. shakers and you can see us. Then. So you can see all the changes between them. So if we just connected the endpoints you can imagine being on a roller coaster train right in on this track this corner it's going to be revamping. If it's just if you just connected. If we have a. little bit more caring attaching them so that. So that besides that control oh not job. So the edges. were going in the same direction. Part of this lie on the same line. Then. We made. The smoother dropping the connection. Between the queries. Then we're gonna have a smoother. The speed may change. In our training. But if. It happens to be. So the segments lineup and the same thing. Then. that's. The best kind of drive all together. So we can talk about Caesar and see one in cq. Canadian schools. User that can use that. So you can see it not very long connecting here. soon. So much more. more tragic than saying. function.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;picture again.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So you can see the. text commands. will create the. The pictures of the words. We can. install. You see, that saying the shoe and text and image on web. want to get the text out of it. Unless it's written as html it still maintains its. excellence. Then you can. extract it from the images. Like napa vector images and since. Since my channel. was the object. The vector. description of the object. So any questions or comments in the system in the ritual Simon. Where the next project. So on to give you an update of. What. we're alone, this is working at NASA. The senior scientist at NASA. did his bachelor's here masters or. PhD and pruning them. So he's involved with. Making the self driving car once. So you can turn that he's able to give it. will join us on march 24 Wednesday. 7pm. So I think that would be quite exciting to hear what he has to say. So i'll send out a link to register.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Something near pinching.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;You can so that's why we extremist. You are courses wrangling took the wind out in the sales. Not an excuse just mission. anyway. Anything else. In the text chat messages.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Okay, well, I won't fix it all right now. We want you to lunch.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks everyone. Have a good day weekend take care and stay well.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Just me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks fine.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I can you hear me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No see yes.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Oh sorry I just had a quick question regarding the mid term. For some reason I had one scheduled for this weekend and looking at the syllabus again last night, I noticed that there isn't a midterm in the syllabus has that been changed.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;No.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;there's no.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Oh okay i'm not sure where I got that from them, maybe. I just looked at the wrong syllabus.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;check. Around but.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;yeah no I just looked at. The one last night and there wasn't anything about a midterm on there, so I don't know where I got that information from previously, but it was kind of. The beginning of the Semester so.

    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;good afternoon!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Hello everyone
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;good afternoon sir
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Professor Hepting - did you happen to look at the Discord server yesterday? We realized that we can't upload the assignment.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;lots of options that look like it wouldn't be used
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;It says I’m not a member of any group and cannot submit
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;me too
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;^ not a member of a group
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Now there is no link for the submission
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;That's still the original submission that it shows
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;it says to contact teacher to be added to a group
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;You can see it on your screen
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;"Not a member of any group, so unable to make submissions"
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;can we all just submit, we have each say we are in a group (or not)
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;I submitted for everyone?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;*submit, we are in a group (or not in a group)
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;The submission had us all in the same group.^ So yeah...
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Whoever was the last to submit will be the class submission. It was only accepting one file so every time someone submitted something it overwrote the last submission
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;It selecting one submission and displaying on every account
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;still not a member of any group
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;is setting it up for individual submission not working?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah may be ungroup everyone will fix it
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Aryan, you're unmuted
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;someone in our math class flushed the toilet
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;...
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;clogged and everything, I think a plunger was involved
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;...jk
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Btw if you emailed me about a group I responded. Sorry for the late response but I’m looking to add people who still wanna work together in a facebook group chat and we can discuss further there. Or you can try add me facebook “Khelan Natha” and msg me. Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;5 have
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I have not looked yet at the next individual assignment
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;this was very helpful
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;FYI there is the same issue for the next individual assignment
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;the due date for the next assignment is 2020
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;we wont bw able to hand it in
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry I may have missed this info somewhere along the line but is there a midterm? I have one scheduled in my calendar for this Saturday for some reason, but looking at the syllabus again last night I didn’t see any mention of a midterm
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;I just checked, this is an issue for all the assignments
