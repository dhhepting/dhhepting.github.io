<ul><li>
      The concept of encoding is very interesting. I particularly enjoyed hearing about the method of storing images such that there is a 24 bit colour pallet so that each pixel may only use 8 bits.At the end of the meeting you mentioned encoding with entropy and I am very interested in learning more about that, and how entropy can be used for better encoding.The binary question game made much more sense to me in this meeting, and it was interesting to see how that concept can apply to encoding.
    </li><li>
      An important thing I learned this meeting was why basic ASCII was/is not a good language option for computing as it is only compatible with English and can't fit other languages in the bit space.However as a classmate mentioned, there is "extended" ASCII which is 8-bit or more and can fit the requirements of different languages.There wasn't anything in this class that was particularly difficult to understand, however I failed to grasp the whole reasoning of the image failed to load illustrations near the end. I hope to learn more about the image failed to load illustrations next time.
    </li><li>
      Today's class was interesting, I learned what is ASCII in this class, and I saved the picture of the table because I want to check more information about it after class.
    </li><li>
      - I found it interesting that the binary number 'magic trick' was ultimately a unique case of encoding.- One concept I didn't quite understand was to try think of entropy as a surprise instead of a natural tendency towards greater chaos and disorder.
    </li><li>
      I think one of todays takeaway is that all not character sets are created equal, and choosing one is an important design decision that can influence a user's experience.
    </li><li>
      I learnt basic form and some foundation imformation of ASCII. But I prefer to learn more about how ASCII can help me to code program in c or html, herhaps ASCII just is an independent and funny knowledge to know.
    </li><li>
      The card game has certain complexities in starting but using binary number will resolve it to some extent and there are certain ways to do it but it will really helpful if you make a video on that.Thanks
    </li><li>
      After yesterday's class, I did some of my own research to get a further understanding of the difference between ASCII and Unicode. ASCII, while great for plain text, limits our ability to share our ideas not only by limiting us to the 26 letters of the alphabet, numbers, and regular punctuation, but also is designed with the English language in mind. Unicode allows for a much greater library of characters including accents and emojis. While it does take up much more space, the larger library allows for many more languages to be used and is thus better for most applications....
    </li><li>
      On meeting 3 we discussed about syllabus for this semester and also continued on the topic information entropy. Then discussed about how ASCII is represented in 8 bits and in order to include more languages like French we may need to use extended ascii which gives extra 127 characters.
    </li><li>
      We learned about encoding and a video about compression codes. In the video they use the concept of binary trees for a binary communication business. The business made binary tree nodes of combined least probability. Overall using Huffman coding, compression of large data into smaller data can be more managable. However if you use Huffman coding for transfering an image, the image will lose color and pixel quality.
    </li><li>
      I learnt how encoding is done, at first I found it difficult to see how this is related to my everyday life but I am reminded that there are some texting app I use that make use of this, which made me more interested in this topic.
    </li><li>
      would like to know more about optimum coding.
    </li><li>
      In today’s class I learned about encoding. Process of converting data from one form to another is known as encoding. Different types of encoding are images encoding, video and audio encoding and character encoding. Character encoding encodes characters to bytes. 4 bits is not enough to represent alphabets. Since there are 26 characters. ASCII (American Standard Code Information Interchange) is used for electronic communication. It includes characters both upper and lower, symbols, numbers, special characters. We also learned about Unicode. It is Information Technology standard for consistent encoding symbols. It represents as well as handles text in all most all...
    </li><li>
      I learned that ASCII uses 7 bits but it only encodes North American English characters. To encompass the entire world's characters from all different languages, Unicode is used instead.
    </li><li>
      In this lecture, we reviewed the binary guessing game and how we may be able to extend the table by copying duplicating the table and adding a leading bit on the last 4 combinations. Lastly, we talked about encoding and how the ASCII system was encoded using 7 bits.
    </li><li>
      on last lecture, at first discussed about binary and cards from last lecture and then we studied about the encoded, like the characters, colors and symbols have the own encoded codes and they stored in bits.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture, I learned about USASCII chart and and how we can use Unicode to encode a character. Each character(A to Z, a to z, 0-9, &amp; other symbols) in USASCII table represents some binary value. Computer only understands binary language. Using this binary value and USASCII code, we can encode any character or symbol. I also watched the video about Compression Codes. The most important thing I learned from the video is about Hoffman Coding.
    </li><li>
      As per my understanding we want to represent the infotmation for in the form of image we have to devide whole image into so many tiny portions and than we can send this image as a colour symbols. And in binary all colurs have tahier own unique binary code and system use two bit code method, which is very long and complecate for to understand for humans. here humans can decode the number but they cannot able to simplify the original meaning of information. So, to overcome this massive problem David Huffman provide us optical stratergy based on building binary...
    </li><li>
      it was taught how we can reduce problem of decoding by compressing the bits of code using hauffman method. by combining and adding two least possibilities and again repeating the process we will be able to reduce bits.
    </li><li>
      we also learnt about USASCII code chart and binary guessing game.
    </li><li>
      We also learned usage USASCII chart to encode the a particular character or peace of information.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we learned how to encode the information using USACII table. Normally one can not undrrstand the bunch of binary code which contain specific information So, to understand David Huffman provide optical Stratergy based on building binary tree from bottom to top which work based on 2 bits. I f we use the Huffman 2 bits than at the end we loose some information for Example: one can try to encode image using Huffman methode that image will loose some pixels In other word clearity of image.
    </li></ul>
