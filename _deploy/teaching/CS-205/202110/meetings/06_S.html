<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;realized, I was muted there for a second okay. So. let's go back to. screen. Okay, so this is. A line for today. So the decode unicode. kind of fun video. That was made a few years ago, but every with every iteration of every release of the unicode there gets to be more and more characters. And as you look at Matthew carter's my life and typefaces. Another is interesting because. Cocteau designing for different displays. Designing some plans for. Certain resolution displays was the challenge of the time we undertook many challenging activities and. Then they. A particular challenge at a given time that. relented. wanted to find some other ones. some more general terms here. Okay, so. To answer some more questions from last day. Do you see my reply that it says, I would talk about some of these extra bits and so on. So I thought, maybe these so just watch a little bit of this. Video. But compression codes. Probably not convenient for the audio but i'll make i'll put the captions on. Okay. Do you see a connection there between. entropy and encoding for. UCF encoding UCF eight encoding of unicode symbols. Okay, so.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Let me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;By the way. Having these two classes back to back sometimes. Let me just do this quickly. Okay here's the presentation. generator myself. About that i'm still finding. Some issues I need to tweak in your courses. Okay. So let me clear up from my mistake anyone find my mistake you and see my hand from the state that mistake. intuit is six and six decimal and binary. Because, all I did was I wrote. A can twice, I did can hear Gray so eight plus. Two Stan is a, but I also did eight plus. Two is six no that's not right, so these two bitches slept so I should have got 0110. So. This changes. To the date was correct, but this should change to a nine. Because those two bits are flip. And that's correct. So here's the encoded. smiling face smiling eyes. You can see here. On the. Page unicode.org. here's our smiling faces smiling guy So you can see that there's a number of different. Alternative. representations. unicode. unicode code point. So the number that. corresponds to the character. lead us to. This one. So, separate from the. satanic. ideal of the smiling SMILEY face smiling is. This code points or expresses the ideal. And this is. What what what different platforms realize provide to this realization of that ideal. So this is apple. You see my cursor is and then. Google and Facebook. And the i'm not sure what windows. windows, I guess. And Twitter. and so on. So we'll talk about. Those in a minute or maybe on Monday on Tuesday. next level of. realization we can realize the texts that were encoding. look carefully at these this table. The sort of the order of the. emojis is different than their colored points the code points aren't in numerical order. Determined determined by. locale data. character locale data register cl Dr. that's what this is. That abbreviation. Okay, so let's go back to. Our example with a salon. Okay, so if we have an ascii character. etfs eight. If we're sending. Now, for we say that we're going to. send a message and etfs aid. The only bites that can be perceived be ever then. The only advice to the leading zero are one byte characters which correspond. To the historical asking. characters are common. So you can think of them as being. At the top of the. probability tree, so they get the shortest code. And the code starts with. zero. So what does it mean to. leading not lending. is meant to say that anyway. That worksheet. curious based on the Wikipedia page. So we can say that maybe have one. Leading that meets means as part of a multi. The continuation. Of the message. we've missed we've missed started the message if we. tune in and we find a bike that one as one zero To begin with, that means it's. Either the second, third or fourth bite of multi byte character. mean. Right. there's one how many ones are there 121. We can have up to four Bytes so we could have one. preceded by for that, for one. And zero bed. makes sense. to buy. to buy a message character encoding. One continuation. So it has this has the advantage of. We only have to wait until we get a. bite, starting with zero, which means it'll be a single bite character. And self contained character self contained within a bite so that's the leading leading zero if it has a leading 110, then we have to only wait until we get. Zero or. One to avoid it has leading multiple leading ones. So if we saw a continuation bite like this. In a message like this. Making sense. And I understand why Oh, thank you. Emily. Okay, so we have five. Leading by. Four by character. We need three by three that's. The first. And then we have. One zero start the continuation bite, and then we have. six sets of data. here. We don't know how many, we have to wait for except that. We have. the middle of something. So we just need to. check the next one, so we're in the middle. And then, when we start we if we encountered this bike. And we know. The start and because we see for that view for one that's at the beginning, we know they're gonna be for by itself together. So, in terms of transmission. We don't need to. wait for any other characters. Once we get a new character here. So we get a. start by then we can. move from mill you know there were a lot of middle or at the start, so we can reset our. Our decoding here. So do we. have been converting between binary and hex. or. Changing notations. If you read these and write these betsen into hexadecimal. see what I can. Be. i'm not sure if I specified a valid here to here, I think I should be all right. There are some. stipulations. This ETF 16 only permits. 20 bits total and here we have 21. So that there's some. can't express more than. 16. anyway. I think the web page to do a fairly good job of explaining that once i've linked. Not to. I would say the details are interesting but not so important in terms of our. interest here. Let me do one thing here. So 100 is eight. And then 1011 is 11 which is. Be. So I can look that up. should be able to find something. So any conversion between binary hacks. Group. In front of it. So the. No. sweet, we can write them in. Other groupings of numbers. So instead of grouping four bits together we can group three bits together. And those are called octo. What is every leave us with. two. Eight anyone get eight Oh, I see in the chat okay thanks. guys range from zero to seven. Maybe easier to read these continuation characters. Right over that 107077. don't worry it'll. Be tomorrow is not so helpful, I was reading about. In and storing. Using auto presentation, because they be. A continuation of six bits of data. And then, in this case, there was. Three bits of data and the leading plate as well. So makes for. I also want to. touch on the idea of. not creating different representations. Which is grouping things differently in terms of. binary hex and optimal. they're just. ways that unicode is organized. So at the. Center. Of the. dmca encoding is. Is the seven paths for the ascii so. The lowest order bite. Is. ascii So those are the most frequent these characters. And then. Then, to add all the different kinds of Latin. characters for the different languages, their accents and we need to buy because this 11 bits of data allows us to you to get most of those characters. And then, with 16. Yes. Basic multilingual plain. Chinese Japanese and Korean. characters that are common. force plate. Access to other planes. I think there are 17 other planes that are defined. So let me show you how i'm unicode. My rambling too much well probably yes that's just. rambling too much, but. The message gets through. We get immediate access to the basic multi lingual plane. Without any so we're using two bites as our unit. starts we don't have anything any. characters encoded in less than two byte. This. These two bites will access the basic multilingual plane. And then we can add another two bites to access the other. plane planes. So, because of the limitations of UCF 16 in terms of. How it. encodes ease of supplemental planes and so on. We can access. All the. available. To the 20. 16 encode the same code points from this. Collection of to the 20. copy this down. characters. thousand and 59 characters use. This in March 2020 and they have. A they have plans to I think the last time they added about 5000 characters. So they have a plan to roll out more and more characters. More and more to support more and more languages. Like was discussed in that video about the unicode decoding unicode. Any questions or comments about that. So the idea is. That there are these different assignments. And i'm not sure. If these are. A New York. So. here's an example of a note of a sketch to do. To illustrate entropy. So you can use that as a. entropy example. So you can use that as a starting point. So I apologize for not talking about this. On Tuesday. The I set the first two days, to the tune of two weeks from the past Tuesday. Okay, so. message in the chat so, can you please repeat, is a direct message, can you please repeat it as a message to everyone. Okay, so basically how I got the different numbers, so this is a chart chart was in is. very similar to presently in the Wikipedia page. So when there's one bite this seven there's a leading zero Plus seven bits of data. mark by the axis. And then there's two bites. In. The continuation byte six bits of data and the continuation byte. And five bits of data in leading bite. So that I get 11 for that. And then. Three bites. six plus six bits of data is 12 and then four bits. leading place on 16. For the 16 bits of data. equals a to buy. You equal to Bytes of data. which corresponds to the basic multi lingual playing. We can access using UCF 16 112 white word of etfs 16. Okay. I got it okay. Anyway, every day, tired of talking about zeros and ones. that's not quite true. anyway. So back to. So you can make the dates a little different. How many people are just gonna say simon's page for for a. Now. State can be flexible. Just as a way to get you give you some experience with. P five GS and the concepts are talking about in class. So let me know about the date, and we can change it. As required so don't worry don't worry about the date. The first one, and then the second. there's a project that you can do in small groups let's say. And I should say bless you. generally. So let's say groups of up to four she like and then you can think about. Something that we're doing. In terms of writing a. web based. interactive web based multimedia presentation of your topic so that's the deliverable. And so, think about. Some of these things. And how much you're going to research and how much you're going to write in P five js how much text you want to write and. How much coding, you want to do. is to be a little bit of each but. can be predominantly one or the other, or. Equal equal parts. make sense. Make sure I get the gradebook hooked up properly. I think i've got the. engagement with meetings set up properly now so they come up to 10. For the total mark. is a bit of a. country like extracting One way is to be able to do it one way and I couldn't find that way to do it and then. I. I was told about another way that. seems to work so we'll see that problems been solved. For now. Any pending your. results obtained through that setup and great book.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Activity code.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. yeah. I think that was not intended for everybody. Okay, so we'll talk about the project that more. On Tuesday okay. Since we're out of time for today. Any other questions or concerns. Okay, seeing Nanos say goodbye for today thanks for your attention and your patience as my scribbling and rambling. And we'll see you on Tuesday. Take care have a good weekend. hi there, yes, Edward with innovation innovation hi hey yet some single dishes a few days ago, did you get looked after, no. Not it's not a large number of shingles the spot, where they came off the roof is seems to be covered by snow down yeah kind of put a hinder on everything we're doing. we're opening it back at it next week, though. Are you wanting us to take a look at it, or. Well i'm not sure what the priority is. In terms of if this is important to do now we're gonna wait till spring or. Was there plywood showing was a building paper underneath it. yeah you know I didn't see myself okay. Maybe it's something we should look at just to make sure that. It could be there may be something we could repair next week, on Sunday on to help control the snow off. Okay, I mean I we were we're fixing shingle now and I have no concern that their permanent fixes this time of year. So I mean it is something we can definitely do this time of year okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
