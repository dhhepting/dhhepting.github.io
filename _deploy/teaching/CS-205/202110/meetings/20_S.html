<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so i'm just going to get the tenants passwords out for you. Anyone able to make it to the. presentation last night. So i'm going to. get a video up shortly sometime next week, I hope, once I get everything finished. Clean things up a little bit and. package, it up a little bit nicer. Okay, so i'm just gonna do the. chat. A T shirt now i've got my sweater back on so. it's not quite summer yet. Well, I had to restart my computer since our meeting. Our last meeting, but let me see if I can find a sketch that we started. Let me make sure. I screen sharing. screen here. can't even hear. there's a big crash downtown and I think all the ice melted. It was too related. Happy there's no more snow yet again. As worried, though we're in for round two around end of winter n plus one of winter. snow, the other day. yeah the ISIS. Never fun this year on a skating rink or curling rink. And a couple falls last year. One on some ice and I thought I broke my nose. faceplant. turned out to be nothing so serious. I just been a little bit more. more careful since then. So anyway. So what are we doing in this transformation here were you looking at the frequency. Of this. Modern like sound that I generated from the image. And so, for each. I think we. were looking at. Every 10 every 10th bucket in the spectrum that returns from the analysis. Yes, I think I did put the password and let me just do it again. My clipboard. Anyone. Anyone not into it come for the tips presentation today. Anyway, so, then I. Last class I just didn't get the attendance password out until the end. Well i'm going to have the. Details of the. Other kids presentation. Recording is that available. For anyone who's interested. Okay. Okay, so we're sitting each time we're driving this reset the background color. And then we position, a camera. And then we're talking about the. material, so the blue. Spectrum analysis. And then, for each to go through zero. And then. attend to that and then tend to that. Until we get to the end and for each of these positions were. doing a translation. So we translated in X. and translate and why based on the value of the spectrum. And we don't translate in zed. And then we draw the blocks or the cube. And the size depends on the. spectrum. we're looking at. translation and drawing statements are surrounded by push and pop. Because we're doing. So this creates. If you're familiar with. A stack we can push. push it onto the stack and pop it. So we're we're insulating the effects of these transformations. So we're scoping the transformations if you think about. Programming language kind of way. see what happens. So let's look at what the camera is looking at the cameras looking at and see look at school, from there. The first three parameters are the position of the camera. So you could see that we're moving an extraction there. Now we're moving in the y direction. And then said direction as we're increasing. And here's the Center. that's where we're looking with the camera. or panning and X. zoom off to the side when we were moving. Where. we're not moving very much for when we zoom in we're moving quite a bit. Because that's the foreshortening. We talked about a little bit. So here's the statement, where we have X, Y and zed and then Center X Center wide centers ED and the last three numbers are the attractor so which way is up for the camera. So this way we're saying zero and zero so the y direction is up. Pushing. Can. You store that display. get my mouse to work here. We have the. We get. The transformations be effectively cumulative. And that's how I see them in a straight line. Essentially, a straight line. And they begin with. The origin. let's see if we can find a better way to. camera. The camera. yeah. Okay let's make this a little bit. i'm looking at the position. numbers are the position of the camera. Next, three numbers or the position of looking at. And the last few numbers are the direction that's up for the camera. So, what happens if I change this. To one. change this. Time. i'm looking at it from the other side now all right. What happens if I change it to. we're saying that the opposite direction is up. To action is minus y and. Making the camera upside down compared to what our usual. let's restore this. well. going to try and draw something again. I have some trepidation about. doing that. To the pixels. So we don't really. we're not really concerned steps we just. make a decision which gets put into each pixel. Which which sampled value gets associated with the pixel on the screen. or in the image. We do perspective, like we did. In in the case of the boxes. Like a camera. looks like an x not much exciting there. For let's try and to the. again. We don't have a sense of. space. When are talking about 2d. So today we can think of actionable we have dimensions X and y for the width and the height. Then we also have a dimension said. For distance. where we can. decide whether objects. Are. Well, closer. More distance or closer. So there are two choices here, you said. Not a position of said, I mean, so the access is going to be so, this is the positive X. direction, and this is positive y direction. So we can choose to have either. go into the screen are kind of out of the screen. So. We can say the the Left handed or right handed coordinates. So the way to do that is. Really decide whether it's left handed or right handed. Is a lot of the the Cross product between positive X and positive by. And then. causes that is the direction your thymus pointing. So then, if it is if it's left hand coordinate positive X cross positive lie. And then positive said is pointing into the screen away. Does that make sense. we're not seeing anything, and we can. it's kind of an off by one kind of air to check, so if there's a plus. If we think we've got this this is going into the positive direction. We put a minus sign me can. might see the. See the opposite. or by making that change we can get a different perspective on things, so we saw. The simple changes in. signs in that camera. made a big difference in. The view that we saw. There are two ways that we can. Do this to projections in 3D graphics. supposed to be apparent hologram parallel. So we can do. So graphic. Change. Trying to. Make measurements, because we can still measure and. here. Whereas now if we see that. perspective projection. Things that are further away. will be smaller than things that are close by, even if they're the same size. will appear closer optics will appear larger because of the foreshortening of distances. Let me go back.
