<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Today, so. You can be the judge of that as well i'll try and be a little more chipper. Everyone have a good break. that's good. To. know. it's not all gone yet, but I was shoveling a lot yesterday. Still still watch the show too, but anyway. So I asked this question to the other students, the students and the other class. and So we had a chance, one of our. alumni is working at NASA on the perseverance. Rover and he's available to speak to us before March 29. or after April nine. So we're looking at having it in the evening so probably unlike Dave plumbers talk, it would be. Live presentation. Via live. question and answer will be recorded so also live question and answer. So in my other class, it was much more evenly split. And it was like 5553 to 47%. For before March 29. And the pole. Working i'm going to propose a date. i'm going to propose to our guest. Wednesday march 24 at 7pm. So let's see how that goes. here. Oh smooth is unusual. rgb colors red green and blue. we're still using red green and blue is the colors as the primary colors when we look at hsbc. So what does he stand for. The Hong Kong, Singapore bank. The hsbc Hong Kong, Singapore bank of Canada. I think I have that one right. When I used to go to airports there's the ads were very prevalent in the jellies. Okay yeah we'll talk about the project. So you can think of. Most of you in 3D. Around the outside. it's an ankle. saturation is. On. The desk of the colon. or perpendicular to. And perpendicular to the value. Which is. Which is also another name for brightness. goes from zero, which is black. So you can see from the diagram. The value zero then there's just a point, so the only thing that can. come out of there is black with values 01 and go to the top of the Cone. middle of the Cone. color choosers. light is in the middle and then the color around the outside. wish I could. know in advance how to get the lines converted to. straight lines, because they could see that the last diagonal, but I do got converted to a. Line instead of my. character filled scribbles. Anyway, to me it doesn't seem to be. Okay. On. The the access to the Cone then we get we're getting blacks and whites and grace, as you change. that's too too small. Well, better baby. along this axis here. So if we're value of rain, this one. You get white. And, with no saturation but as we add saturation then we. get to the food that we add color. So this is. Fully saturated. make sense. We can just say we had read. up here it's bright red and then mixing the very red with. black. As we come come down this curve. So there is some comments about. The hexagon hexagonal colors. Well, not hexagonal colors for identifying those primary colors along the wheel. so far.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Can you try writes a little bigger it's just hard to make out what you've got written they're just moving forward.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thanks. you're welcome. hexagon. origin. red. Green. and blue. hope it is. One dimension, so we stand up the queue. To go. Read was at the top. Of the circle. Green. and blue. So between red and green is yellow. Because that's the next. red and green and green and. blue. And red and blue is magenta. 60 degrees apart. Once I finish scribbling this will do the password OK. We have displays recreating colors from black so. The screen. is black, to start with. And we go. We had red and green and blue some combination to get the color and so that's why we say it's additive. The freezing cm line. Which are these alternative colors. And the nexus between the red green and blue. We use these in printing. Different wavelengths so we get. The colors by subtracting from white subtracting white. detracting. Different wavelengths from white light to get the color on the page. cyan magenta and yellow. So it's red green and blue free if we give 100% red green and blue what what do we get. Right okay so rgb we get away. And in cm why we get black that's right. For some technical reasons. it's not great to have. full coverage in three inks. To make black. So that's why in printing we also have. K for black. So it's not a three color process but it's a four color process. So we printed with black black ink is below. So that way we don't have. soggy paper and. mighty black. So we're going to get a crisp plaque without. Without mixing those colors. That makes sense. Attendance before I forget. I won't share my screen i'm just gonna post it into the chat. Converting between red green and blue and. He saturation and value or he saturation and brightness. there's another translation, we can do. Our different kind of color model to have. And this was. This can be related in terms of black and white and color TV. So when. black and white pictures started appearing. On color TV let's see so black and white TVs or maybe easier in the sense of the just Gray scale. But then when the color TV kids came about so, then we have the three primaries red green and blue. So we need to communicate. Not just luminance or greatness. But. chrome information or color information as well. So this y UV. model is. Is is sometimes so. And the y UV is kind of a general form of it. There are many more specific cases. Converting. rgb to y UV. So, most of the information is carried in the luminance. So, in terms of. In terms of compression in different formats for that data. We can allocate more bits. My apologies for my. My poor handwriting here, let me try different configuration. luminance has has more more perception relevant information. So if we need to cut down on. The number of. This that we're transmitting or if you wanted to some compression if we convert. To y UV. kind of color model color space, then. we allocate more depth. To the luminance than the chroma. mentioning that, because of. Writing is not very good today. configuration is not so good. Day i'm going to try and. try and do better. So this particular. So the idea is why you see color space is. That luminance has more conceptual information, but the takeaway. Okay. I think i'm done scribbling for today. Oh do some practicing let's think about ways to. use this in a better way. Okay, so PowerPoint slides don't work so well for me either. project proposal. can make this. yeah sure oh. Oh. Looking at the chat again. I will endeavor to. to work on. My. printing so that I will convert nicely to text. On the sketches on the whiteboard okay. The. rubric is to give it. So it's not a. A very flexible structure so i'm asking only for a page. Good examples. Of the projects that I gave the other day was. colorblindness. Is colorblind. So you could do some things some of the questions. In P five. or. well. yeah you can. display or the questions and piece i've js example. And then. Content written for the web page, to say the background and. And the research that identifies. The questions on such a test and so on and so forth. So part of the the content that you're. Creating. or. He. You know, necessarily going through a. You know, designing the questionnaire. That you're. Looking at examples of questions. and creating an online instrument course. Then, so that that's the. So the content is. In that case. When you're writing subtext. And then you're also designing the web page. And you're designing. The element, the interactive elements. For the test. example concept. What do you want to accomplish with this project what's your vision, what are your goals. So. You might be interested in color blindness and. interacting interactive web site. explorer. You might say you want to explore the topic of colorblindness. and being very good point I can hear you can hear a bit to. The goals project. Such as it might be would make. A piece IP to. Create create an interactive website that incorporates. html. P five GS and. All those things into a nice package. So the ambition. is just the idea of having a. sense of of what might. be hard to do and. This semester. To talk to the content, already, and then the plan would be. To think about and lay out a schedule. For. project. Say you're going. To do this, html. you're going to do the research. For this, this online test and create the questions and. document structure. first, and then maybe you're then going to. pursue the. Questions in each in P five. So you can do this and groups up to four. If you'd like to do that. So you don't have to have the group set up beforehand, but just indicators in your group, if you want to do a group. don't have to do. Just indicate the names of the group members. On your submission and then we'll figure out the groups. will set up the groups for the next part. submission of this. assignment. Now, as I gone. over some in the cell phone you have more questions he can articulate. me. The reaction thing here. You can choose to do it. i'm not going to give you any more details. Yes. Not just any javascript. You might do something with. Some other things, but. focus and P five. If you're interested in, as I would say this new some topics to. to explore with colors that we've been talking about the different models and. Sorry converting between. The ones that we've talked about today, like rgb and H SP and. y Z. So one proposal per group. yeah I mean. So I would say. it's meant to be open, ended. But also. Some interesting things. Certainly, on the on the website, in terms of peace. and In. jazz have designed sketches. And we looked at. taken a brief glimpse at. Can. give you. ideas to go for inspiration.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I guess for now that's good probably once we get into it will have some more specific questions, and if if we are I do, then we can address them then.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;sure.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;what's interesting. And then, what can you do. What did take what interests, you and. make a sketch or two or three. that are related to. to explore some of the interesting issues and to make them interactive. And might be a good place to to go with project proposal. And look at P five js website and examples and the generative design sketches examples. See kinds of. Things that are interesting and then you know. There is one we looked at for the snowflakes, which is a particle system, I think. Well, I think it was snowflakes the idea was. So you might look at a particle system and if you're interested in that kind of thing. That good you know you could do a little bit of a write up about that and. explore how they're used in different ways and. so on and so forth. So the idea is that you're looking at things that are. Trying to give you a. An open invitation to explore something that interests you. Soon okay.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.

<ul><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;good how about yourself?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;good
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Good!
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Good
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;good sir how are you?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;good
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;good afternoon sir
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;gd afternoon prof.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;yes.  did you?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Good afternoon.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;what is the seminar for?
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I am unsure if I can attend anything in the evening
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;anything in April is too close to finals for me
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;What is the password for attendance today?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;he didn't give it yet
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;at some point in today's class, could we talk about what is expected for the final project and the final project proposal?
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;hue, saturation, brightness
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;Yes please
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;huea, saturation brightness
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe we did not get the password for attendance yet
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yep
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Black
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Hey Professor, could you please write a little bigger? Notes are somewhat illegible. Having trouble following along
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe if you could just zoom in. I think everyone should be done with the top stuff
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Or maybe once you’re done writing a section you could just repeat verbatim what it’s supposed to say. That would be really helpful. Because making out the words is tough right now
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry not trying to be pesky, just can’t read what’s being written
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;there should also be a text box option yes?
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;ppt slides work good for me.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Apparently there’s a way to convert handwriting done with Apple Pencil to text, maybe this would be helpful for us all?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT211774
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Haha thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;im good for the project
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;Is the color blindness test something we can choose to do? or just an example
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;it uses JavaScript like before yes?
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;P5.JS yea^
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;okay thx
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;K sounds good.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Could we have maybe a few other suggestions? Or some previous examples for inspiration? Or do you want it to be super open ended and up to us?
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;If we are in a group, do we each need our own project proposal or can we write it as a group and just all submit the same one
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Anyone wanna be in a group? Email me natha20k@uregina.ca please! Would be awesome to work with someone. Or multiple people even.
    </li><li><strong>S16:</strong>&nbsp;good day
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks!
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;have a good day!
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Good Day!
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;You too!.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;thank  you
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;thank you
