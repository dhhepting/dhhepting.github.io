<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good afternoon. I think I didn't have my microphone switched on my desktop anyway good afternoon. Already for. starter February. She was a little nicer today, then at the end of January so. Take that for. So this is. All the assignments. Straightforward experimentation with P five js. And then. Projects It can be done, individually or. small group of up to four. you'd like to work with somebody for that. So the idea is to create a web based. interactive presentation, so they can be some mix of. Research and implementation or. Writing and coding. So one that I, an example of a project that was done in the past was. color blind. So the web page has some details about the. color testing for color blindness and then some questions. That were done in P five. So that was all integrated into a web page. So, as we get further along. So suggested the project proposal in. Three weeks from Thursday. After the break. And then do on the last day of class. Okay. different ways to. To make better use of your courses. Because I asked the question. zoom the zoom meeting and. Feedback feedback into your courses, but then that was. decided that pulling this prefer to doing that. trying to pull here. So you can sort of see my. stack of windows here from zoom. yeah. I think that's a bug not a feature. Because they're all. Let me pull but then it puts the other windows in front of it. i'll put in other as well, but i'm not sure what other is yet. here's me trying to find the SAVE button to click on. There we go. So it's interesting. I found because my reason for. Trying to your courses feedback was that responses could be persistent outside of. The zoom meeting. But people seem to like the idea of. It was oh OK, so now the zoom project kind of taking off. For more people to vote so we'll see whether. that's okay one more person to vote. Okay, seven loaded. Okay anyone brave enough to tell me what the other. option would be. Okay, so there was kind of a. Preference okay. appreciate. In the cases when. they're there to be I mean. that the option is. The question is clear ahead of time. i'll set them up ahead of time. more detail later on. I don't want. It caught up in that moment. Okay, so. People are interested in important details like what's the password for. posting media. So without me trying getting to transcribe them into a summary. About posting them in on the page, so you can access and. They wouldn't be publicly accessible and dropbox but, so the audio recording. And the chat transcript and the audio transcript I could post them as raw. unedited and filtered. MEDIA and then. I would use those to then create a summary. Okay. One block here. updates and so on, since you last logged in. So, to me, the recent this recent activity is a good summary cooking on full report of recent activity so you're not quite so useful because it has all the headings. Whereas, this is just. So important things have changed so when I bought when I update things. They would appear here. And while i'm here, I wanted to show you that. So you don't need to go into your courses to find my zoom office links. So here here are my office hours. master. And then there's zoom link. And that link is an email sends me an email, if I can arrange a different kind of different time for an appointment. And just realizing the choice of colors is not great here. But there's certain links as well. So you click on that, then. You know you look you'll get into the office. Okay. last thing we talked about in the end, to add that might be applicable here. So the amount of switching to other websites other website being my personal website. So the thought was. Possibly to. Add links to the meetings. Links for all the meetings like that. So would that help you a little bit of help. Did as an example for today's meeting. Any suggestions about. A couple people still to reply. One more person. Are there any suggestions about. How to go to do better than just having a direct link to a page. So i'm disinclined to put content onto your courses directly. From my years of experience, using moodle. This seems. I think the flexibility is valuable. don't want to be confusing and. seem to. become onerous to navigate to a different website. So if you have any. Any suggestions, there are appreciated. i'm open to them. anyway. comment about Hercules getting slow. So there's a possibility of moving it to the. server game. guiding videos and where to find them. Thinking of. Creating creating a page with the videos. or the other materials see where they. Are they come up. So thinking about putting the videos in one place, based on. where they occur in our discussions. Okay. Alright, so i'm going to stop sharing this. Okay, so anyways there's some things that are. Still hidden gotta clean that up but i'll do that so. they're giving you the links to the first assignment. assignments right, I think. Any questions. Let me just. Participation discussion. not going to do that now. I just want to give you a place to. Report bugs. notice your questions yeah. Okay. sure. I share this one, I think I did. Talking. yeah. So he's now. See how well he hates it is create spying on him. Okay. Any questions about. Please, we talked to her last day. If you can hear the cats probably tormenting him. as well. Come visit me. I feel like there's another scribble as I did last a new didn't make it here. Take your time here. Any questions. talked about it in really good. check what's going on. Okay, so the unicode decoding unicode video. Any thoughts about that. quite impressive that there's so many character sets included already and there's. So much room still to be. utilized as far as I can that's what I would say. Even was. 16 as encoding. unicode code points. 22 to the 20th is. You can see over a million characters. And I think we're at about 10% of that with unicode 13. So this is the last room. mean some of the some of the details. Some of the characters aren't going to be. available for public use. But even not there's still lots of room to grow. Anyone see themselves cutting and pasting. Okay, so let's go to the onto the other video type my his life and type faces. Any any thoughts or questions about that. Okay, so what, what are the two distinctions between. We talked about fonts and. And such. In that video there are. Two things that we're dealing with. Accepting chat messages. well. Nobody. Not even in the chat room. Okay, thank you fit maps yeah that's one way to do it. terms for for. Usually, we have a bitmap display a bitmap. Working definition of bit maps are good map. Okay pixel. Any any any ideas will look at pixel references.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry, what was that last sentence say.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Each pixel is mapped to the display okay thanks. The pixels mature picture elements that's how the pixel is. The word pixel. So I can fix people. microphone is open, but. I I can't force people to be unmuted. it's interesting because. I just I can only ask for you to unmute. No, I did it man I turned you micah. anyway. Okay, so that your descriptions of fun fun cliffs. So the. unicode gives us these code points for characters. And we. transmit them and efficiently, we. We can use an encoding format like ut FA to minimize the. The number of this for us to send it right. So for using ascii. usual ascii characters. It turns out that those are the very lowest. Parts of unicode and we can. We can just submit to this transmitted one way, instead of four Bytes. character, a. New tfp. So I put in quotation marks because it's. it's the idea of a word that. We don't have a representation associated with it. necessarily. Because it could be. The number to those others. look more like an A. Change. would happen there got an A. That looks more like my second one, then.

<ul><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;good afternoon!
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;good! how was yours?
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;it was great
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;good Afternoon Sir
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;I have a question about assignment submissions. The requirements say to submit a link to our assignments, do you also want a copy of the JS files so the code can be marked, or will the marker just use the inspection tools of their web browser to grade the code?
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I put other because I don't have a preference.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;YES!!! Zoom lets go
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;haha
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I would just like it to be setup before class time so we don't dedicate class time to the setting up of polls, yah know?
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;password for meeting
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I have never used Zoom polls before so I’m not totally sure how they would work
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Can it be setup so as you log in one can vote
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Although I like the idea of them so that those who are here in class are able to get the credit they deserve
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I agree
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;what's the password for attendance?
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;agreed.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Student password
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;worked
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I honestly don’t mind having to navigate to the meeting site on my own from the link at the top
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I think what would help me at least would be posting the videos to UR Courses.  I find it a bit confusing where to find them (Summary, Plan for Today, Review).
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;I just mean the YouTube links you post so they're all in one place.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yup agree with you
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;It will be good for us.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;That would be very helpful
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;that would be useful. it messes with my head a bit to have to go to the previous day's notes to find the topics for the current day's class.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Bit maps
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;vectors?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Vectors?
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Individual RGB components that together make up a screen display
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;hi Mann, you're not muted.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;so sorry, but it showing I'm muted.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;oops !
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Vectors will scale up more easily.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Vectors can be enlarged and maintain smooth edges vs bitmaps get pixelated
    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;using the power of math
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, you too!
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks you too.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;have a good day! let that puppy out :)
    </li><li><strong>S14:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S15:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you!
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;thanks
    </li></ul>
