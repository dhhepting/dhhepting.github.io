<ul><li>
      Today in class, after doing the translations between the Unicode values for characters and basic hexadecimal numbers, I will need to do a little bit more looking into how these translations occur. I had a bit of difficulty following why we used the 10 at the beginning of the bites but I'm sure after a bit of searching I can have a greater understanding.
    </li><li>
      Had trouble grasping exactly how the UTF-8 encoding process works. It was a little difficult to follow along with the examples, but I think when the last example (smiley face) is redone to fix the errors made in the class example that could help clear up some confusions.
    </li><li>
      I found the concept of encoding and decoding Unicode to be fascinating. I particularly enjoyed the TedX video recommended about Unicode.Encoding the Unicode to binary was certainly the most difficult part of this class. I tried to figure it out before class, but it was certainly a lot more difficult than when explained in class!I'd be very curious to learn about how entropy was used in the Unicode encoding process. Was there a significant amount of analysis on the alphabet and other characters as to what was most common? Was there some other technique used?This is related to the last...
    </li><li>
      I learned UTF-8 in this class, and I learn transfer between the number and hexadecimal. It is not hard, hope I can learn more about UTF-8.
    </li><li>
      I'm a little unclear on what the leading bits in the UTF-8 encoding bytes are used for, it seems to me like wasted bits.
    </li><li>
      In today's lecture, we converted HEX code to binary and the smiling emoji into binary as well. We also watched a video talking about this concept, it was interesting.
    </li><li>
      On meeting 4 we learned how binaries work. And also we did some hexadecimal to binary conversions, out of these hexa to binary conversion the most interesting was converting simile emoji to binary.
    </li><li>
      An important thing I learned from this class was UTF-8 encoding. It was interesting to know exactly how the characters are encoded online.The one thing I didn't get from this lecture was how exactly the character numbers are assigned in the encoding in the first place. Was the English language assigned the first "x" characters and now some company is in charge of adding new codes for emojis and such?I have already used decimal, binary to hex, etc. before in other classes so this was a good refresher to confirm what UTF encoding was.I hope to learn more about unicodes...
    </li><li>
      In our 5th meeting we talked about saving up to 4 bytes or 8 bits of data transfering when using and sending code in UTF-8 or UTF-16 forms. We also talked and did a few examples about encoding a UTF-8 emoji into binary and hexadecimal code.
    </li><li>
      I will go over the reasons for the extra bits and how it relates to our class discussions so far in our meeting tomorrow [smile]
    </li><li>
      The most important thing that I learned was binary encoding works and how can we encode UTF 8 Unicode, and also converting them to hexadecimal codes.It was also interesting to know that there is a possibility of ternary computers and quantum computers. Looking forward to knowing more about this.
    </li><li>
      In this class I have learned about Unicode Transformation Format example UTF-8. Instead of using 4 bytes character every time we use UTF-8 as an encoding format for code points. UTF-8 uses as low as 8 bits to encode former ASCII characters up to 32 bits. ASCII is included inside Unicode, but ASCII only needs 7 bits. We worked on a worksheet and Smiley face emoji. I learnt how to convert Unicode to binary; Insert bits into required form and converting into hexadecimal.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture we learned about how computers, laptops and other machines stores informations and data in Binary code.
    </li><li>
      in the last lecture we learn about unicode and decode some heaxadecimal variables into binary. The ascii code have many alphabets and symbols. also we used some examples of numbers and letters then decode it to binary.
    </li><li>
      In the last lecture we learn about hexadecimal to binary conversion and smile emoji to binary.
    </li><li>
      During the meeting 5 i learn how to convert Unicode value into binary. ,How to determine the bits of the last code point .As well as got to know about how exactly binary code works and what letter does any particular number corresponds to .
    </li><li>
      In previous class, I learned how binary system works as well as learned how to encode character in binary and hexadecimal. To encode character, it is important to know how to convert decimal to binary as well as to know which number is greater than or less than or equal to another binary number to determine which Last Code Point to choose to encode character.
    </li><li>
      In this meeting, I learned that bits are encoded and decoded in different systems such as UTF-8.Last meeting I had trouble relating the decision tree to encoding.I would like to be introduced to more character encoding systems.I found that some emojis were encoded differently in different platforms. I found that certain emojis were unavailable on android device that was available on my apple devices.
    </li><li>
      In last lecture I learned so many interesting things about UTF-8. How we can use UTF-8 method for converting Hex code into the binary and other such information like emojis into binary as well. UTF-8 uses as low as 8 bits to encode previous ASCII characters from 0 to 32 bits.
    </li><li>
      we learnt how transfer and decode utf-8, but I do not understand how it can relate color of indexed views.
    </li><li>
      I've learned that Unicode is the superset of ASCII.As ASCII only has 256 characters with very few symbols. But Unicode on the other gives freedom of writing various characters not only including the English alphabet but including most of the other languages in the world.Unicode can write up to 65,536 characters and symbols
