<p>
  This page presents data obtained through the Faculty of Science course evaluation,
  which is administered online.  Students complete it outside of class, during the last
  few weeks of class meetings for the semester.  I receive a summary report sometime during
  the following semester. Information from the Faculty of Science course evalation summary report
  is limited. Most open-ended responses appear in full.

<h3>Identify what you perceive to be the main strengths and weaknesses of the course.</h3>

<ul>
  
  <li>No strengths. This is a super weak course, there is little to no content. We mostly watching ted talks and videos from the 90's. Discussion is frequent but instructor is not good at dealing with off-topic or derailing conversation. Several class members do not understand social cues or appropriate ways to discuss things and frequently interjected and derailed things or dominated the class with what should have been 1-on-1 conversation.</li>
  
  <li>The course usually deals with the interface between users and computers, As well as it mainly focuses on behavioral science, computer science and other fields of study in sciences.</li>
  
  <li>The course’s group project assignments are a great opportunity to apply class material and get to know other students.</li>
  
  <li>This course is fine as it is. There are insignificant drawbacks, but they mainly come from Dr. Hepting's nature, so I find criticising the course pointless. It is appreciated by the absolute majority of students, I hereby guarantee that.</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Identify what you perceive to be the main strengths and weaknesses of the instructor.</h3>

<ul>
  
  <li>Instructor explains every chapter with real-time examples where it would be easy for every student to understand and gives more space to work as a group.</li>
  
  <li>None.</li>
  
  <li>Putting on ted-talks and talking about elevators or your trip to IKEA for several classes is not very stimulating or informative. He also has allowed the marker to completely stop marking things. We have only gotten 1 assignment marked and it is the end of the semester tomorrow! We haven't even gotten the midterm back.</li>
  
  <li>PRO: Dr. Hepting has significantly improved his communication with students in past years. Removal of Piazza as useless and janky interaction platform and shift to URCourses as the unified course action platform is a remarkable improvement. I appreciate the &hellip; CON: Lack of clarity, his undecisiveness and huge pauses between phrases in lecture performance are still an issue. Please work on decision-making and presentation performance. I am strongly convinced that Dr. Hepting possesses a lot of useful knowledge, it is just his communication bottleneck that scares people off at times.</li>
  
  <li>The instructor has creative assignment ideas and is always willing to help students in need.</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Comment on the value of the textbooks and the assignments in the course.</h3>

<ul>
  
  <li>If there was a textbook for this class I didn't buy it. It would have been useless. The assignments are filler junk that do not reaffirm learning nor teach anything new.</li>
  
  <li>Individual/group Assignments given by instructor are very useful for every student to work as a team and information given in textbooks are very keen to understand.</li>
  
  <li>Meh, whatever. Not really much to say here. Students were encouraged to resort to external sources that they find useful. And I think that is correct. Please keep it that way, it works for everyone. That is fine.</li>
  
  <li>The length of time it takes to have an assignment marked and returned to us was unacceptable. Here we are in the last week and the midterm has not been marked. Most of the assignments have also not been marked. This is unacceptable.</li>
  
  <li>The textbook and assignments help apply class concepts and the instructor’s lecture material.</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Any other relevant suggestions?</h3>

<ul>
  
  <li>No</li>
  
  <li>Teach this class in a room without a projector and let someone else make the instructor's syllabus</li>
  
</ul>
