<h6>
  Most Important:
</h6>
<ul><li>
      In today&#039;s lecture we discussed in depth regarding the course email. Also, in the breakout room we discussed about the good interference design.
    </li><li>
      User experience and usability have different concepts. User experience refers to the purely subjective feelings that users get in the process of using the product. Usability is an important quality indicator of a product or system. Therefore, we can use four dimensions to evaluate: functionality, learnability, flexibility and industry design.
    </li><li>
      I got a basic idea about the kind of discussions that will happen on the breakout groups. It will take some time getting used to but it seems like a good way of learning new things.
    </li><li>
      In todays lecture I learned about few HCI foundation. I did get a change to open discussion in breakout rooms on topics like what makes a good or bad interface and user usability and experience. This response field is kind on one bad interface example - User can not see the whole text/response. If the input/answer field had an option to expand or resize it would be a much better user experience.
    </li><li>
      User experience is a  framework where user gets use to all the tools and  structure of interface created by developers. However, the user experience is overall about feeling that a user gets before, during, and after using a website.  Usability is a statical data use by a user that can be scalable in terms of features provides by the developer and testing teams.
    </li><li>
      I learned more about the subject&#039;s site as well how to access the book. I also learnt about usability of the interface through group discussion.
    </li><li>
      in breakout room we discussed about good vs bad interface design from the perspective of a non technical user and ux vs usability. got to learn about heuristic system design as well.
    </li><li>
      I learned a bit more about group discussion and Response Wiki.
    </li><li>
      The most important topic discussed in todays class was what constitutes a good interface design and a poor one and also what the difference between user experience and usability of a website was. Majority of the discussion happened via the breakout room. We discussed how the different user interfaces such as Apple&#039;s UI which is among the best in terms of user friendliness and how innovation is not always the necessity to capture user attention as there are possibilities of confusing the user further.
    </li><li>
      In today&#039;s class Dr. Hepting initiated the topic of what makes a good  design or bad design. In breakout room we talk about the Norman door. The design should be simple which is not complicated and understood by everyone. It should be universal so that it should be familiar to most of the people. The product should be simple and it should also be familiar so its easier for the use to start and using it even if they are new.
    </li><li>
      in today&#039;s meeting, I learned how to differentiate the good or bad design. the problem was that the groupmates was not discussing the question that you have given us for the discussion. so i thought my breakout group is bit boring.
    </li><li>
      In Today&#039;s class we learned and discussed about the good and bad interface. We also learned about the difference between usability and user experience. It was a great start and I&#039;m looking forward to know more about it.
    </li><li>
      The thing that I found useful was the good interface. It is really important that we focus on good interface. There are four Es for good user interface. Easy to use, Easy to understand, error free and effective. At the end of the day, the purpose of your website should be to get the user to your product as quickly as possible. Good UI makes this happen.
    </li><li>
      We got to know about characteristics which make a UI design good or bad.
    </li><li>
      In today&#039;s meeting we first discussed about the course outline in detail we also talk about project and assignment stuff. In between of that we had a breakout rooms and the today&#039;s topic for the discussion was, &amp;quot;What makes an interface design good or poor? What is the difference between user experience and usability?&amp;quot;, while having this discussion in the breakout room one of the student compared good and bad designs with bad doors which is usually known as Norman Door, that&#039;s what I learned in today.
    </li><li>
      We discussed the difference between a good interface and a poor interface
    </li><li>
      To outline for today&#039;s topic- If a first time user can understand the task without verbal or written note and complete the task successfullly then it is a good design otherwise it is a bad design.
    </li><li>
      Was from the breakout room session. The importance of having a best interface design and try to have the most helpful setup so that the user having less knowledge about the technology feel comfortable while using the setup. Also, the difference between user experience and usability was shared in the class. It is the thing that everyone should know and work acoording to that.
    </li><li>
      In break out groups, we discussed what the difference is between a poor and good user interface design. As well as, the difference between user experience and usability in the terms of a user interface.
    </li><li>
      I&#039;ve met new classmates in person. Discuss about the class and breakout rooms.
    </li><li>
      In today’s class we discussed in breakout groups about how good user interface design makes an huge impact on how user access the application and use proper features. Having  Proper UX and UI design plays a major role in how applications are built more successful, and better used by the clients. Which this also helps developers make meet any business requirements and goals, one of the major part of business is good GUI. Having good usage of UX and UI design also helps in reducing overall costs for business
    </li><li>
      A good design emphasizes on making the interaction between the product and the user as seamless as possible. the difference between user experience and usability is the necessity of the device. The interface was selected in my own breakout room  is usable because zoom provided an easy way to navigate and communicate with others.
    </li></ul>
<h6>
  Most Difficult:
</h6>
<ul><li>
      Good day professor, I do not understand how to access our syllabus. Every time i go to check i only see Fall 2020. I missed the first class hence why i do not understand.
    </li><li>
      What is the difference between user experience and usability?  I think
    </li></ul>
<h6>
  Want to Know More:
</h6>
<ul><li>
      Today we discussed about good and bad design and I would like to know more about what makes a design good or bad. Also, what are the things on which we should focus more while designing.
    </li><li>
      I was not able to join today’s meeting due to a late registration. I would like to learn a lot of things during this course.
    </li><li>
      In today&#039;s lecture we learned about what is the difference between user experience and usability and also what is the good interface and a bad interface we were divided into groups and we discussed it in the breakout sessions..
    </li><li>
      Is the philosophy behind the interface design for Zoom? Is effort being made to make it easier for new users or experienced users with new features?
    </li><li>
      I would like to learn what makes a good interface design, and what factors would go into giving the user a better experience when they are using a software. Would they like more simple options or more complex options? The interface for the breakout room I think was good, however I did not have the zoom update, maybe if zoom forced users to update and or patch prior to launching that would be helpful.
    </li><li>
      we talked about user interface design and i had some previous theoretical knowledge in this area but still i would like to learn more about how the design can be improved more for better usability.
    </li><li>
      Today we had a good discussion within Breakout Room 3 about factors contributing to good bad design. The interesting part was to be able to draw the line between usability and user experience. I would like to learn more about specific factors leading to good and bad design and also discuss in detail about usability and user experience.
    </li><li>
      While we discussed the second question in our breakout group i.e. difference between User XP vs usability, it will help if i get a formal answer
    </li><li>
      I would like know more about the questions that we were asked to discuss in the breakout room because I found it interesting as the course is about it I am eager to know more in the upcoming sessions.
    </li><li>
      I would like to know more about interface accessibility and how it contrasts with user experience and usability.
    </li></ul>
