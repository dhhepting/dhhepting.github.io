<h6>
  The most important thing that I learned:
</h6>


<ul><li>about the radical empathy is that it allows us to notice people and imagine yourself, then take actions which indirectly helps our society to work better.
    </li><li>Today’s meeting was a quite interesting one as our topic of discussion was features of design of a page. I think observer o of objectivity is one of the most important features of design to take into consideration for  that  Bluetooth toggle bar page.
    </li><li>Learnt a few mew Mac features and I am enjoying the interaction in the class.
    </li><li>It was an quite interesting open class meeting. I really like this way of discussing instead of breakout rooms. Also, i would like to make a note on that Bluetooth toggle bar page. I feel like colour is an essential element of design and there must also be consistency between all design elements.
    </li><li>In the meeting, I learned the concept of design, we need to consider the user experience.
    </li><li>In today’s lecture The most important thing I learned about was how important it is to have consistency in interface designing. We had a good discussion about on/off switch label and “+” task for windows Bluetooth interface. I totally agree with author of that document who was tricked by it. Also read few documents on Radical Empathy + HCI
    </li><li>In Today&#039;s class we have learnt about the evaluation and execution. Like every interaction, users must overcome the couple of challenges about understanding the current state of a system and figuring out how to change it. Evaluation: Understanding the state of the system Execution: Taking action to accomplish a specific goal
    </li><li>We talked about evaluation and execution that what kind of interface design make user understand the system by some example.
    </li><li>that there could be so much discussion about an on/off switch!
    </li><li>In today&#039;s class we discussed about a real life example of gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution regarding the Bluetooth interface of windows. The gulf is more in this interface as the present state and future state are confusing in the windows interface for Bluetooth.
    </li><li>Is that even simple designs such as the Bluetooth on a computer needs great clarification in the case if someone believes that the other setting indeed is on, it will be hard to convince them otherwise if that is what they have thought to be right the entire time.
    </li><li>emapthy map, switches and assignment 1
    </li><li>It was interesting to see how a simple Bluetooth button display could be the centre of discussion of human interaction with computers. This has opened my eyes in regards to the how careful we should be when designing interfaces
    </li><li>More clarity on the Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation, especially after reading the textbook and todays lecture to clarify with an example on the board
    </li><li>Today, the class was discussing about different design about the functioning of the switches. There were some interesting ideas about bluetooth switches which intrigued me when it was compared to the gulf.
    </li><li>in today&#039;s meeting, I learned how the two UX gulfs work and how to reduce the gap using different attributes of interface.
    </li><li>So the today’s class was so important and we discussed the real life example of the Bluetooth interface for the two UX. In addition I came to know how important the consistency is in the interface design. Last but not least is that I got some knowledge about beautiful and ugly interface design
    </li><li>We started with discussing about our assignment and then carried on with discussing what was wrong with the bluetooth toggle on/off button. This pretty much lasted the whole session and we didn’t have time to go to breakout rooms in the end.
    </li><li>Today we have learnt about  the gulf of evaluation and execution works
    </li><li>The discussion about windows bluetooth settings page really peaked my interest. Contrary to other&#039;s beliefs, I feel like the button provides all the necessary information and Microsoft did a good job with that. The colour scheme and the dynamic button makes is perfectly clear what the status is
    </li><li>Got to know about how representation can increase or decrease the gulfs.
    </li><li>Today we discussed more about gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation particularly taking Bluetooth design that in what manner it should be designed so that the users can understand it easily &amp;amp; also to overcome large gulf. There were many different views from the students and had a great discussion on that views. Talking about the design of Bluetooth we can enhance it by defining it and giving some explanation or some kind of indications over there and also colors defines the intensions in a better way.
    </li><li>I came to know about how to start with activity assigned to us and in class we also had a discussion on color toggel button which was interesting to listen about. What I feel is the color alone is enough to distinguish the feature of the button so no need to text if its on or off the grey and blue color itself says a lot of things.
    </li><li>In design, the space distribution method must be taken into account in order to obtain a successful and distinctive design. Color is an essential element of design, where design needs color to appear more clear and beautiful, and color has the ability to distinguish between good design and bad design, and between beautiful design and ugly design. Accuracy The designer must take into account accuracy in all the details of his design, no matter how small. Objectivity Observance of objectivity is one of the m
    </li></ul>
<h6>
  The most difficult thing for me to understand:
</h6>


<ul><li>Is there any way to compensate the golf of evaluation with the golf of execution?
    </li><li>Metrics for gulf. How can we conclude some &#039;X&#039; implementation has high gulf or low?
    </li></ul>
<h6>
  The thing about which I would most like to know more:
</h6>


<ul><li>In today&#039;s discussion we discussed about how we are going to do the assignment 1. That was so important to discuss because that gave me a clear view but still I want to know more about it.
    </li><li>I would like to increase my knowledge about the two UX Gulfs: Evaluation and Execution. For example, we talked about the Bluetooth icon on the system; how it works and how it is designed.
    </li><li>I would like to learn more about the radical empathy
    </li><li>I would like to learn more about the course final project and the requirements. There is a section on UrCourses, however it is empty.
    </li></ul>
