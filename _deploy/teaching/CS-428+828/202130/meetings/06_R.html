  <div class="card card-body"><h5>
      The most important thing that I learned:
    </h5>


<ul><li>in the article by kathryn is that how successful execution depends upon correct evaluation. They both are interdependent. Designers should support both  of these gulfs in order to build a good model.
    </li><li>Is the capabilities of different application, showing the loading, but also additional procedures that can provide a great balance to user experience.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting and breakout room, I learned simplicity and responsiveness and security and correctness about the attributes of interfaces.
    </li><li>In todays lecture I learned about empathy map (also read document that is linked for empathy map in assignment 1 description. We talked over 2 gulfs - evaluation and execution and in breakout room we discussed the qualities/attributes which can help minimize this gulfs. I will be adding breakout room discussion summary in breakroom discussion section.
    </li><li>We discussed about gulf of execution, gulf of evaluation and learned empathy map today.
    </li><li>Gulf of execution can be referred as the effort of the user to interact with the interface to do any task. An empathy map helps to understand how the user feels about the interface. Empathy maps help the UX professionals to realize the users&#039; needs and help them in decision making.
    </li><li>difference between gulf of evaluation and empathy and empathy map.
    </li><li>I learned more about the Gulf in HCC. there were several example that illustrate the concept in better way
    </li><li>Understanding the Gulfs of Evaluation (understanding the system state) and Gulf of Execution (how to change this state). Also what to do to bridge this gulf.
    </li><li>The most important thing I learned was the gulf of evaluation and the gulf of execution. Evaluation: Understanding the state of the system Execution: Taking action to accomplish a specific goal
    </li><li>In today class we talked about the Two UX Gulfs: Evaluation and execution. Evalaution is the understanding the state of the system and execution is taking action to accomplish a specific goal. They both are interdependent. The best example was the bluetooth
    </li><li>In today’s meeting we learned about the attributes of interface, the real difference between gulf of evaluation and execution and it’s really helpful to get better interface. Dr. Hepting also explained the assignment 1 but would really helpful if professor explained it again in detail.
    </li><li>The real idea about the Gulf of Evaluation and Gulf of Execution.
    </li><li>We have learnt about the gulf of execution and evolution. we discuss about the attributes of interface to minimal the gap (gulf) of execution and evolution.
    </li><li>Empathy map for UX
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting we had a breakout rooms in which we discussed about the attributes of interface for which the gulfs of execution and evaluation are minimal, in which we had a good example from one of the student about mobile phones that how the interfaces are getting better day by day taking an example of how the feature of zoom has get better by pinch out and in from the icons that were used before. We also discussed about empathy map by taking an example of choosing own breakout rooms &amp;amp; want know more.
    </li><li>We talked about the attributes of interfaces where the gulfs of execution and evaluation are minimal
    </li><li>Empathy mapping concept where it has four quandrants of what user feels, does, thinks, says.
    </li><li>I learned the definition of two terms. Gulf of execution is the degree of ease with which a user can understand the current state of a system and Gulf of evaluation is the degree of ease with which a user can perceive and interpret whether or not the action they performed was successful
    </li><li>As a breakout group, we discussed what design attributes lead to minimal gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution for a user interface.
    </li><li>The Gulf of evaluation reflects the amount of effort that the person must exert to interpret the physical state of the system and to determine how well the expectations and intentions have been met.
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The most difficult thing for me to understand:
    </h5>


<ul><li>I was not able to understand the definitions of gulf of execution and evaluation. So that was the difficult thing for me but I got the the clear view when one of the guy from my group shared a link about these definitions.
    </li><li>Hey, I didn’t understand the assignment could you explain it again and can you encompass people to communicate in the break out session so it’s not just one person talking all the time.
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The thing about which I would most like to know more:
    </h5>


<ul><li>Today we discussed about the attributes of interfaces for which the golfs of execution and evaluation are minimal and it was really worth to discuss this question in breakout room. And i would surely like to dive deeper into this topic .
    </li><li>I would like to know more about gulfs of evaluation and execution and go a little more deeper into the topic. this topic really caught my interest.
    </li><li>I would like to know how to accurately quantify gulfs.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting, we talked a little bit about interface attributes which could contribute to the reduction of the gulfs. In the breakout room, we had some interesting idea about having some kind of feedback mechanism (including visual) to reduce the gulf of evaluation
    </li><li>we discussed about gulf of evaluation and execution in today&#039;s class and how could we design the interface to minimalize misinterpretation. Although, there are some details that I have to learn about this topic to get a better stance.
    </li><li>today we discussed the attributes of the interface to reduce the gulf of execution and evaluation. It was an interesting topic to discuss. I want to discover more facts in this concept.
    </li><li>As my PhD research involved with search interface evaluation and how we can improve the design of one search interface, I would like to focus my research for this course on this specification.
    </li><li>Empathy map and the first assignment. It was a great class and we had a good breakout room session.
    </li></ul>
