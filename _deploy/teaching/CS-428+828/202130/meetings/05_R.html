      The most important thing that I learned:
    </h5>


<ul><li>The reading that compares sympathy and empathy suggests that empathy is more valuable than sympathy as it achieves a greater understanding of parties in distress. It is crucial to consider needs, abilities and disabilities, and cultural backgrounds and experiences of oneâ€™s audience with an open mind in order to better construct technology to serve them. In order to do this, we need to first practice empathy.In UX, empathy helps us to identify not just the instant dissatisfaction of our users, but also logic
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting we discussed about the Assignment1 requirements and its due date.
    </li><li>In this we discussed about our first assignment empathy maps, how emapthy is different than sympathy, and how UX professionals practice sympathy over empathy. Looking at the UX article, the importance of us as computer professionals having a good user experience is paramount and something we should strive to deliver. i think, without practicing empathy in UX we will not be able to understand how people feel and how we can acknowledge them.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s lecture I learned about HCC basic terminologies like 1.Gulf of execution - it is the interaction between the user-goals and computer-comments. 2. Gulf of evaluation is the information given to user about bitmapped display from computer as the feedback about the current state of interface.
    </li><li>Understanding the gulfs of execution and evaluation. Both are vital to a user&#039;s experience with an application
    </li><li>In today&#039;s class, we have learned about the creative confidence and what is difference between sympathy v/s Empathy. One should able to solve the particular problem with a creativity. &#039;A creative mindset can be a powerful force for looking beyond the status quo&#039;. And also waiting for starting the assignment which will also test our creative mindset.
    </li><li>In David Kelley&#039;s video, I learned everyone has creative ideas to help others in designing new thing or redesigning. We should have our creative confidence and believe we can change the word a litter bit.
    </li><li>Today&#039;s meeting was about assignment 1 and I learned a figure about gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution. Users always face two challenges. Users try to interact with the system. User try to give some input to the system and then the system gives some feedback to the user. Evaluating the feedback and understanding what to do next is the  gulf of evaluation. When user gives input they want to understand how to use the system which can be referred to gulf of execution.
    </li><li>today, I learned about what to expect from the meetings and I am looking forward to learn more
    </li><li>Sympathy VS Empathy in UX
    </li><li>In todayâ€™s meeting professor went over the personal assignment regarding and the gulf off evaluation and execution. It describes how to make the prototype of what user wants and how to get feedback and improve the products and how it is a cycle.
    </li><li>Today&#039;s lecture was really impressive. We learned about how to build creative confidence and also some basics terms of HCC like gulf of execution and evaluation. In addition, Dr. Hepting explained about empathy map of the first assignment.
    </li><li>the most important thing I learned was that &amp;quot;New opportunities for innovation open up when you start the creative problem-solving process with empathy toward your target audience.&amp;quot;
    </li><li>In  this meeting I learned about the gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution  that helps us to figure out the current state of system and what we can do to interact with the system and  change it to new state. Successful evaluation requires perceiving the system-status indicator and interpreting what it means.   Execution requires both planning an action based on an understanding how the controls work, and actually manipulating the controls.  Now using a bridge we can support user interactions.
    </li><li>1. In today&#039;s meeting I learned about David Kelley and watched the video on &amp;quot;how to build your creative confidence&amp;quot;
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting the most important thing i learned is about creative confidence, Doug&#039;s story was really very emotional and motivating which illustrates that by creative problem solving process we can get ideas for innovation. The way in which the healthcare for children and parents were changed the design of the rooms was excellent. Moreover, we also discussed about assignment 1 looking forward for this activity.
    </li><li>gulf of execution &amp;amp; gulf of evaluation diagram
    </li><li>Doug assembled a group of professionals to address the issue, which included employees from a nearby science museum, youngsters, and healthcare staff. The final outcome was an inventive, design-driven approach that completely altered the children&#039;s perspective. Doug is the Lead Design Architect for two important innovation accelerators and holds six utility inventions more than 16 registered designs. He also educates new product or new as part of GE&#039;s &amp;quot;creativity at workplace&amp;quot; campaign.
    </li><li>Was about gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution. We also talked about interacting with the system. The first assignment was also introduced by the professor and the use of empathy map in it was also explained.
    </li><li>It was a good session, we got came to know what we have to do for the assignment, also the diagram drawn on the board for easy to understand and came to know a things about gulf of execution, gulf of evaluation and still more to learn about the user interaction with the computer. Looking forward to learn more.
    </li><li>Some positive influences are drawn from Doug Dietz&#039;s adventure series. First of all, patient satisfaction scores increased by 90%. Children no longer suffer from anxiety. Instead, some of them ask their parents if they can come back tomorrow. It makes it easier for children to maintain their stability during the procedure, which in turn prevents doctors from having to repeat the examination. This lower need for anesthesiologists means that more patients can be examined each day, which greatly affects the fi
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The most difficult thing for me to understand:
    </h5>


<ul><li>7w8uoe
    </li><li>Is how to empathize with teachers for that assignment. I have never really been in that position, and doing this assignment will help me realize how difficult and how much professors actually prepare for us students when it comes to using the urcourses moodle site and such.
    </li><li>How to design a good Empathy Map. The concept is strange to me
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The thing about which I would most like to know more:
    </h5>


<ul><li>Today we discussed a little bit about empathy map and I know we are going to discuss it again on Monday. So, I would like to know more about empathy map that how we use it in human-computer communication..
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting, I get the information about the empathy map of the first assignment.
    </li><li>Assignment 1 and how to proceed that
    </li><li>we learned a bit more of the Gulf in user design. but I did go through the 4th and 5th TED video materials and that was really inspiring and i wanted to learn more about how people get the best feedbacks from the users and what are some of the best possible ways to approach the improvement process
    </li><li>For now the assignment 1 is not completely clear to me i.e. what to do. Please if more details can be provided on the expectation for this assignment.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting, I learned how human and computer machine interact. It is also vital to learn how interaction going on between human and computer.
    </li><li>I would like to know more about the kinds of activities that can be added. An example/demonstration would be great.
    </li><li>I would like to know more about the resources for the course.
    </li></ul>
