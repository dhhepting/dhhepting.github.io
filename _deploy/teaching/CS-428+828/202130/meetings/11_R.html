      The most important thing that I learned:
    </h5>


<ul><li>Mental models is a representation of human minds and how they work in this real world. They are made with a unique concept of personal individuality.
    </li><li>The most important thing I learned today was about design. And Abbas do shared some interesting stuff.
    </li><li>I like how you refer to online website examples for your explanations . can you explain the project assignment again.
    </li><li>In today’s meeting, we discussed about The mental model and its impact on HCC , however I didn’t get to know much about it and would surely like to dive deeper in this topic . Apart from that, i really liked the abbas’ 1 hour exam idea, it was interesting,
    </li><li>I learned a bit about Mental Models we talked a bit about information given on Nielsen Norman group - mental models webpage.. Also got to know about Abbas research topic. I will be watching Don Norman- 3 ways good design makes you happy video on weekends.
    </li><li>In today’s class, we have learn three ways of good design makes you happy.
    </li><li>We briefly talked about the mental models today.
    </li><li>about project and user interaction principles
    </li><li>The mental model and its impact on HCC
    </li><li>It was interesting to use the empathy map for yet another interesting scenario.
    </li><li>Today we have discussed about mental model which is vital topic in human computer communication
    </li><li>The most important thing that I learned in today&#039;s class was the 3 ways good designs makes you happy.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s lecture we have learnt about mental models.
    </li><li>About the mental models, that there are two things,  when people are learning and using a system they develop knowledge of how to use the system and to a lesser extent how the system works. and these two kinds of knowledge are often reffered to as a user&#039;s mental model
    </li><li>In todays meeting we talked about mental models and I would like to know more about that. Also we discussed about emailing about project groups.
    </li><li>I learned a new term in this lesson , which is Mental Models. It is one of the most important concepts in HIC
    </li><li>I liked the ted talk video of Don Norman. In this 2003 discussion, design critic Don Norman examines architecture which brings happiness with an insightful eye towards elegance, joy, enjoyment, and feeling. He describes three emotional states any well object must address in order to be successful.
    </li><li>I was most interested in participating for Abbas Research study where we have to take an 1 hour exam and we get rewarded for $30. Also we discussed about empathy maps today
    </li><li>Design is a process of formation and innovation in which some elements and components of the environment are collected and processed to put them in a specific configuration in order to give it a function or a meaning and to come up with a new and well-made product, with distinctive aesthetic or functional advantages, to perform its function effectively and meet the purpose of its design. Design is divided into several branches, such as: technical design, architectural design, engineering design, decoration
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The most difficult thing for me to understand:
    </h5>


<ul><li>I am a bit confused about empathy mapping.
    </li><li>I would like to understand Mental models one more time.
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The thing about which I would most like to know more:
    </h5>


<ul><li>i found the don Norman video very interesting and would surely like to know more about hoe design can makes us happy. According to Don, the design can be visualized in three ways: - Visceral experience. It relates to appearance, touch and feel of the product - the behavioral level; It concerns the interaction between the user and the product - the reflective experience.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting, I learned some important concepts about mental models.
    </li><li>In the session we continued our discussion about empathy map and the design interface. We also talked about the individual assignment.
    </li><li>Today we learned about mental models. The belief of the users impacts how they use of the system. I will try to have more ideas about this topic.
    </li><li>It would be much easier for new students like me if groups are randomly assigned by you professor because we have never interacted in person and do not know anyone from the class.
    </li><li>I would like to learn more about empathy maps.
    </li><li>today professor discussed about mental model, where we have imaginative model of a particular object. Moreover, I would like to know more about this model.
    </li><li>For today meeting, Dr. Hepting shared a empathy map with us about getting proof of vaccination. In the feels section he filled that section with &amp;quot;I have to logout according to the warning&amp;quot;. Why not an emotion?
    </li><li>More on mental models
    </li><li>I would like to know more about the other project assignments. This would help as it would guide our group with the selection of an application or website. For example, are future assignments focused around redesigning and wire framing the selected website or application?
    </li><li>is about the group project. Do we need to inform about the names of the group member before? I enjoyed the rest of the class and submitted my first assignment in due time.
    </li><li>I watched Don Norman&#039;s video and the video was really good and loved a lot and felt like knowing more and I found some websites about it and I would like to read about it from those sites.
    </li><li>I&#039;m curious for the project assignment, does it matter if we choose the same application or website as another group?
    </li></ul>
