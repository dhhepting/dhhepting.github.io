    </h1>

  <div class="card card-body"><h5>
      The most important thing that I learned:
    </h5>


<ul><li>No matter what the design is to be human-centered, we need to repeatedly test and get feedback from users in order to improve and refine a better design.
    </li><li>Today&#039;s meeting was interesting about the Norman door, actually, it happens to me many times and that is correct about &amp;quot;Push&amp;quot; or &amp;quot; Pull&amp;quot;. Whichever doors are confusing doors are often called Norman doors. As the design of the door tells us to do the opposite of what we are supposed to do as it gives us a wrong signal. As we can say that Norman has taken a controversy in saying that the design research community has had an impact on the innovation of products
    </li><li>The Norman Door is an example of the bad interaction design. Design with wrong signal or do not gives feedback when people interact it is considered as a bad interactive design.
    </li><li>about the course description.
    </li><li>Todays meeting was primarily focused on a video showing a good door design and was summarized that a good door has only a push panel as thats all a door requires and here door is an analogy for user interface and the single panel design showcases simplicity and purpose.
    </li><li>Norman doors...and how usability could be improved
    </li><li>Watched the video later on Norman Door and was quite an eye opener. Key from the video are the principles of discoverability and feedback.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s class DR. Hepting was trying to figure out how to resolve his website issue. We talked about Norman doors.  Its a door which everyone gets wrong. It symbolises a design what if we continually get the something wrong  its actually the fault of the design and not the user. And of the the red flags is that when everyone gets it wrong then its definitely the designs fault.
    </li><li>I liked the professor presented us with the video. The video gave me a impactful reference to compare the design with the real world(Norman doors)
    </li><li>We talked about Human center design.  What are the bad design door.s    Norman doors: A Norman door is one that is badly constructed and leaves you unsure whether to push or pull and the design tells you to do the opposite of what you are actually supposed to do. This door gives us the wrong instructions and needs a sign to correct it. It came from the name of Don Norman that write a book about the design of everyday things. In this book, he tries to learn us the principles of correct design.
    </li><li>Prof had some issues with is website. He discussed about the group and individual assignments and lastly he also showed us a video on Norman doors which also had issues and we ended up listening just the audio.
    </li><li>All about Norman doors and just got to know we can have our own website on uregina domain. Saves all the AWS costing. Thanks :)
    </li><li>I watched the youtube video to learn the concept of good design and bad design using the norman door example.
    </li><li>After watching the video, I realized that an obvious and effective slogan is very important.This gives people a clear idea of how to use it.
    </li><li>Learned a case of a design problem, which is Norman doors. Also discussed ways to improve door design so that the direction of the door is discoverable.
    </li><li>I suppose this design was intended to introduce an extra step in the door opening procedure, a speed bump, if you like, to reduce the possibility of the door being opened accidentally. From a usability point of view, we might immediately reject any system that should have detailed instructions to inform the user to perform a simple task like an interesting idea: the door is designed in such a way that it is &amp;quot;less usable&amp;quot; to deter users from using it except when necessary.
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The thing about which I would most like to know more:
    </h5>


<ul><li>I would like to know more about today&#039;s topic &amp;quot;bad gates&amp;quot; because we were only able to listen to the audio but the video was frozen. So I want to know more about that.
    </li><li>I would like to know more about the specifics of the project.
    </li><li>Today only part of syllabus was discussed and would like to know more about the actual topics and chapters that we will be covering in this course. Also would like to know more about that is expected in project. I would also like to see and know about your website once all the links are fixed.
    </li><li>The video related to Norman doors mentioned discoverable functions. This suggests an end-user that is unafraid to experiment with a system. How do we as UI designers encourage this fearless approach required for self-discovery?
    </li><li>In today&#039;s lecture we didn&#039;t discussed that much. In future, I would like to learn more about the websites and their interface designs.
    </li><li>The syllabus is discussed in the class which includes assignments, projects and final exam so I am exited to learn the course by giving my best performance in all the work.
    </li><li>I was not able to attend this meeting due to internet connection and I have sent you a mail regarding this. But from my class partners i got to know that you made us learn about the Norman view door.
    </li><li>We know more about project and I&#039;m excited to do project
    </li><li>We didn&#039;t really cover anything today... I&#039;d like to know more about Norman Doors I guess.
    </li><li>I would like to know more about the video link that professor showed today but unfortunately we can watch it but could hear it, so I would just watch it and know about it.
    </li><li>The subject description : what we have to done in this course like what type of project we have to work on.
    </li><li>We discussed about what was taught in previous class, basically Dr. hepting designed HTML website where every resource for lectures are available and Today&#039;s class we discussed about how norman-door principal is used and what are their basic applications on how human-being minds are manipulated by confusing them with error in Push &amp;amp; Pull of the Door..
