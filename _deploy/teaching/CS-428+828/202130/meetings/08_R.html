      The most important thing that I learned:
    </h5>


<ul><li>Today we did a little experiment that how zoomâ€™s breakout rooms work which was quite interesting and important for understanding the gulf of execution and all. We also discussed about project which is again an important thing that we have to choose our own groups.
    </li><li>In todays lecture we discussed about the the breakout room interference and also about current voicemail system and some changes that we would except in coming years.
    </li><li>I have read the nine dot problem article , which i found the interesting one and  also something new to learn. Its basically a kind of classic lateral thinking practice, where we have to think out of the box to solve the shown problem. Though, every person has their own way to solve any  issue but i think that when your are thinking most creatively there is out of box, it just simply your unique way to tackle an obstacle or puzzle.
    </li><li>When we encounter any design problems, we should change our thinking and direction instead of being limited.
    </li><li>I learned about a new kind of answering machine known as marble answering machine today.
    </li><li>In todayâ€™s lecture we had a discussion about marble answering machine and we also talked in comparison with modern voicemail systems. Also also talked about history of the nine dot problem
    </li><li>First we have discussed about the joining the meeting rooms and did attendance. Learning the history of the nine dots problem.
    </li><li>We talked about the nine dot problem and discussed the influence of Durrell Bishop&#039;s marble answering machine today.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s lecture, we just have the group discussion about today topic as well as our first individual assignment.
    </li><li>We had some pretty interesting discussion in the breakout room.
    </li><li>History of 9 dots. In 1992, Durrell Bishop, then a student at the Royal College of Art, came up with an original answering machine design that is considered as one of the first tangible user interfaces (TUIs). The machine spits out a marble each time an incoming voice message is recorded
    </li><li>today we have discussed about nine dot problem. we have discussed the way of &#039;outside the box&#039; solution for the puzzle and also other ways.
    </li><li>The most important thing I learned is that the nine dot problem is a classic lateral thinking exercise.
    </li><li>we have discuss about marble answering machine and difference between marble and modern answering machine.
    </li><li>Durrell bishop marble answering machine
    </li><li>In today&#039;s meeting we talked about the nine dot problem which was very interesting remembered the old days when we use to do this which requires thinking outside of the box. We had a breakout discussion where we discussed about the marble answering machine which was a very interesting concept. Though some of the features of that concept is already existed there were some new features like sorting messages which includes saving important messages &amp;amp; deleting non important messages and so on.
    </li><li>We talked about the marble answering machine and how it can relate to modern voicemail systems
    </li><li>Durrell Bishop&#039;s Marble Answering machine example, discussions
    </li><li>i learned about the history of nine dots problem
    </li><li>Was from the history of the nine dot problem. It encourages us to think outside the box and we can have many solutions to same problem. Marble answering machine was also discussed in the class.
    </li><li>I have learned about marvel answering machine.
    </li><li>In Today&#039;s clase we had a really good conversation about how Marble Answering Machine concept can be used in today&#039;s world with use of some Arduino + RFID + Telecom API Technology. We had breakout group discussion and this was the most interesting part of todays class
    </li><li>Making a suggestion means telling another person what we think that they should do or what we think is a good idea. We are giving our opinion about what action another person should take. It is important that we are able to make suggestions or recommendations because we need to do this often in our professional and personal life.
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The most difficult thing for me to understand:
    </h5>


<ul><li>Todayâ€™s class discussion was about the modern voicemail and marble answering machine. Also i have read the nine dot problem article that means to think out of box . I believe when you have to think out of box there is no box or no limits to think about a creative idea.
    </li><li>The most difficult thing for me to understand is why we never considered making a more graphical UI for voicemail. Sure it works fine, but wouldn&#039;t it be more nice? Or is the UI just our keypad when accessing our voicemail? I guess it works, but it&#039;s not labeled and the options have to be repeated a couple times if you miss it.
    </li><li>The voicemail dilemma was really confusing for me. I feel like the UI for that probably can&#039;t be any easier than it already is unless we package into a separate application (Which would have major implications on all the existing phones)
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The thing about which I would most like to know more:
    </h5>


<ul><li>In this session, we continued our lecture about gulf of evaluation and execution. We discussed these terms in more details.
    </li><li>We learned about the 9 dot problem and the marble answering machine. the implication and impact of it in the modern voicemail system.
    </li><li>If the concept from Durrell Bishop&#039;s marble answering machine has been used in practice somewhere to make life easier when using answering machines
    </li><li>Is there a more interesting or creative solution for nine dot problem
    </li><li>I was not aware of todays discussion topic as I had not seen the video. So I will watch the video and would like to know more about it and how Durrell Bishops marbel answering machine is similar or different from modern voice mail system.
    </li></ul>
