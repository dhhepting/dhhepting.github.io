<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;how's everyone doing today. Late to plug in my second monitor so my screen is blank right now as they're trying to negotiate. There we go. My Internet connection is. stable. and on campus. 33 232 plus me. What three four now okay. Start sharing my screen here. I can. Okay, so just going to click on last days meeting. So I have a new entry here called media from this meeting, which is the picture the whiteboard I took. Then the summary. copy of golf some execution and innovation and I included a picture there. This whiteboard drawing of the gods between user and computer. So any questions about that. last day. So I see again that now that i've started sharing my screen like. gallery view those on the second my other screen is now the column inside of my laptop my screen. anyway. syntax error here. Okay, so let me share the screen. So i'm using this. notation. i'm just i'm writing things out. In this format, called the animal, which is yet another markup language. Which is related to json. To a different way of expressing json data Center call I should be more precise in my definition. Of anyway, so I have a colons. Here too. So these keywords like this desk or description. and align and then. So that means I can't do another colon inside the text of the line, so I had the one here. there's one here. So I had to. Get rid of them. And usually i'm. Like I catch those but. not easily. flagged automatically. Alright, I don't know yet. We do that more reliably than. watching for. error messages. So. No questions from last reading, so what. So can anyone give me a. Give us a interpretation of the gulf's of execution and evaluation. Either verbally or in the chat these.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I can go first.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Here go ahead.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So the goal for me of evolution is like how the. User other human being misinterpret dates, the state of the system, so the system is representing something and the. user is getting something else, so that is like the Gulf of evolution like how the user is misinterpreting and. It can be on the Gulf could be narrowed by like better information display I guess. And then the other way, the Gulf of execution is the other way around like how the system may misinterpret as the intention of the users so let's say i'm trying to do something with some xyz that come in and. I think that command is for that purpose, but the system does something else right, so I think that's gulf of execution, and I think it could be. narrowed by like better activity design.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thanks. That seem. seem okay. Other people who are not ready to chat we haven't done.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;This.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Nobody likes to type in emojis anyway, I guess.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So my my own view on the diagram is when they look at the Gulf of the faq shown on the Gulf of volitional so when a user interacts. With the computer true comments, there might be some time now, a lapse between the actions taken by the user and the feedback from the computer the system or the product users interacting with, so the whole idea is that we can use I guess the feedback from the system, the better. As I guess maybe the user interacting with the system and it takes a longer time before it feedback is received from the user that's the way around the students.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, well, that that can be one thing that contributes to. The gulf of evaluation. Because. This just waiting for that time, the time for feedback to. be presented. doesn't help the user understand the current state of that system. But more than just time it's the quality of the feedback so. If we do if we have really good feedback. that's delayed. That might be better than. Not such good feedback that you send it immediately.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So I would argue, regarding that point like I like to add on I don't think like let's take an example, since we're on a coding environment on our screen like we can see your coding environment page, so the response time. I don't think it does matter that much in in context of the Gulf right, so it may be like i'm like if we are trying to like write some commands on here and trying to say the compiler okay. do this for loop and put the object in the first loop or something like that and we ride like as a human beings perspective as a. As we understand it, like maybe we say that Okay, maybe if I put this thing in the first for loop, it will put it into the first place, but how the programming logic works, maybe it's a. Different way or something like that, and it may be into the inner for look like in the second or third fall, we have to put it in right, so I think that's kind of the goal. As a humanist thinking okay if we're thinking of the first thing you should go into the first for loop, and if it's the last it should go into last fall or something like that so. That kind of confusion, I think, is the Gulf of evolution and execution, you know, because when the user hit the run button and he sees that the output is not what he wanted right so maybe that's the Gulf of execution and evolution from both and.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. So what I want to say about your first answer service. Talking about. The associate misinterpret with the Goths so I don't I don't think it's necessarily. You can talk about these things only in the context of an error or misinterpreting someone's in.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;A way. I guess i'm. Talking about the Gulf measurement of the size like how it is measured, the size, I don't think I was talking about the proper definition of golf. I was like. The previous do you also give an example, and we said that the goal was really narrow at that point it's not a big gap between the. user, it was a narrow gap, so I think I was trying to explain the. Gulf measurement like the Gulf of execution and evolution measurement how big is it is or how small it is depending on the thing so that's why I gave the example of misinterpreting like.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;If.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;I don't know if it makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I would say if you're misinterpreting. That that's. there's a negative connotation. So you say. Small gap we don't have very little misinterpretation and that's kind of go. wrong or double negative. We don't have misinterpretation. as being a sign of a good interface. anyway. So right, so we want to think about in terms of use you're looking at a system, we want to say. The question is what commands can we are used to achieve our goal, and then between from the system back to the user, the golf evaluation is what is the current state. Of the system, so we understand the current status system, so we. can plan for the proper commands to follow them. So I have. I had in mind, I think it's going to show. So i'd like you to OK now i'm not showing that screen. Okay. So. let's do a breakout first discuss the attributes of interfaces which develops execution and evaluation or minimal. So we're where the conceptual distance between the user and the system is. Is the smallest can be. So what kinds of things. What kinds of properties those interfaces have. Our. How, how did, how do we get interfaces like. that's a question for a great break up so there's probably a couple of students, I think two students who are doing breakout groups who have joined since Friday. If if you're not in a breakout group right now. send me an email. And then just pick one. Okay, and everybody else it's going to your own breakout groups does that question make that discussion topic makes sense for you. Any questions.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Could you type up those questions for the breakout rooms.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;There we go.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;copied and pasted.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Something works for me today copy and paste work like I expected it was so small victory. Okay i'm going to start the breakout rooms now. Okay, there we go. No again after open.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;hello, Professor. No i'm not in any break or can I join it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;sure we can do that today and oh I didn't have a chance to. to figure out to go through the list and figure out who is new. or just the regular group so i'll i'll do that later today, but for now just join join one.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thank you very much for.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Joining joining reach over you like. Okay, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yeah Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;hello, Professor.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;hi.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;hi so actually I was unregistered from this course. My student Union. And by your permission I was granted to revisit history in the same class and they registered me like after two days so. I missed my to meeting responses and my attendance so sorry about that and I wasn't break breakout group number three, but now my name doesn't show over there, so which breakout group will be assigned to me now, could you please tell me that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So why don't you go and group seven.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Okay Thank you so much, I will go in groups I haven't.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, I just. Say no yeah no.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you so much for meeting me again to re register.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome I. I was just I. gave permission before you were. So I I was. Anyway, i'm glad it's got sorted out. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you. Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're very welcome. Okay, so is everyone back from break out. So i've posted the password for attendance. The chat. Now i'm ready to run the whiteboard again so when we end the screen share. So you get a bigger. You, the camera. For me. Okay, so any anyone like to share from your discussion in the breakout room. About. You can see that qualities of the interface, which has normal adults.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I do.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so you don't have to. be the only person who answers. Just don't want you to feel like that's the burden, you have to bear. Okay, but go ahead. Sir.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;i'm sorry I thought that he was saying about the text, I thought that is it visible or something like that that's why I said yes, I do I didn't get the question can you repeat maybe then.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;All of the question that we had from the breakout room.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Oh okay so yeah in our group, we were discussing about like a particular example, so it was like a how the smartphone developed and how they minimize the Gulf and also the how they. Design better user interface so we're talking about the first. Sorry yeah so we're talking about the first generations of the first smartphone so at that time the gesture control for the smartphones were very limited, it was just like you know touch swipe and maybe you know for zoom even they didn't have this action they only had the plus. magnifying plus most to zoom into a frozen stuff and as the year progresses they find out Okay, this kind of gestures to introduce different various gestures so. After like 20 years or something like that it's very not 20 actually tool something years offer so they like. Is it became a familiarity for us like okay so to zoom into a picture of zoom into a context just pinch and swipe like this and, like pinch out to you know. Like zoom out or some like that so we're talking about that actually makes sense, and that is a good user design to you know minimize and relay the message and relay the intention of the action briefly and like very. accurately I guess.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so smartphone interface. gestures. Alright, so smartphone interface with gestures and enabled direct manipulation of screen contents so that's not necessarily. The best way to phrase it, but I hope that gives you an idea okay anybody else.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I was maybe thinking, like the Gulf of evaluation can be summarized as the amount of effort that a person more spin on the. Physical state of a system to determine how well the expectation. Our meeting the requirements of our design. makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;it's more like into interpreting the physical state of a system.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. So that's what happens that's what we're doing when we're evaluating.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;what's the character what characteristics makes that evaluation easier.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;The amount of effort we're spending. Because like we need to focus on the parameter of like time or ghost. How long is the process.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. So that's a good way to think about it. So there's this way to operationalize the idea, so that we can. We can measure things. And then we can we can compare them.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah because we like well probably like when you design something you're going through metrics just and you compare your models. and To find which one is the best option.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Alright, so that's a little more theoretical. We can work with that and certainly.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I wanted to add to the Gulf of evaluation what we discussed so since we have very good definition right now. So I wanted to say is just to be able to evaluate that in terms of the users, so you do have some kind of feedback mechanism, whether visual in the system, for example, if you're downloading a file, if you have a progress bar. showing you all your data is like 50% complete 70% complete the user is able to estimate okay my phone is getting down to. So that it wouldn't help to reduce that gap between was the system is doing and what the user, he thinks the system is doing so some kind of visual feedback mechanism, just like a progress bar. A loading kind of symbol and things like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so if. We just have a screaming. Well, or wire was spinning ball like on the knock it has a little beach ball spinning beach ball death and sometimes it's called. We don't have know that it's we're getting feedback what the system that it's. Working but we don't know if it's working towards completion carpet stuck. So, yesterday I was going on a website. And I was asked to visit and it said. system said well we're we're doing system maintenance right now sorry it's not available. But it didn't give me a time. To say like when when this started and when it would be done when I might. Come back to the website to complete what I wanted to do. So that. So the fact that he gave me the information that the website was down was helpful, but it would have been more helpful for me to understand that. it's going to be down for 60 minutes together, maybe have some kind of. sense of when you know the or the when the times, it goes down the system is down every day at. 10am. Central standard time until 11am or something like that. Right those would have been helpful. Okay, so again a little bit of idea so. Thanks for those contributions to the breakout from the breakout rooms, so you can make notes of them and. Use the our courses tools to. To keep this discussion going offline. Well, not offline it's online. But that's outside of our classmates. So what I wanted to think about. So in that assignment is to do an empathy map. And so it didn't talk about empathy maps to much. A few links there. And there Doug deets video about transforming healthcare for families. When I thought was interesting was the first image in his talk was the focused on empathy. So empathy I think. relates to our question what are. What are the qualities of an interface that has minimal gulfs of execution and evaluation. The been designed with empathy for the users. So the users are the target users are understood. And we've worked on having empathy for their situation. Trying to walk in their shoes understand the through perspective and what their particular issues are if that makes sense. So one way to help. document what people are going through, so if at the user, in the middle and we have an empathy map. Your four quadrants. So it might be from my own experience. It might be for some other one. So we might have individual people who. With who, for whom we're mapping. Creating this map. But it might also be that we can create a map to summarize, a group of users who. have some of the same characteristics, say, students and you're using you are courses of these issues let's say so we could. Have a representative student. might be darryl with two r's. So it's no. not to confuse it with darryl with one are. anyway. So. The four quadrants of the map, say, one of them. So we want to think about what the user does. sense. Thanks. Okay, so that makes sense. So let's think of an example of choosing your own breakout rooms. How do you feel and going through that process of choosing them. I get the sense that some people there might be one or two of you who feel frustrated. Right so that's an important aspect of the user users experience to capture he's. See the whole screen, the whole board here. Anyway, i'll post a picture of it. Okay, so i've written underneath there. we're trying to do is. evaluate or create a. map of the users. actions with the activity or the task of choosing your own breakout room. So that makes sense. OK, so now, I see it's 121 21. A better look at look i'm trying to look in the camera, and so you don't just see my chest. Like i'm anyway. So how about. We take this idea of empathy mapping for the activity of choosing your own breakout room. and we'll fill it in and we'll start with that start with their discussion there. Okay, so on that meeting six o line. just want to point out that there's a link. To the gods of execution and evaluation. So that's got an interesting example that will also touch on next time. Okay, so it seemed all right.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;yep sounds good.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks, very much for today. And we'll see you on Wednesday. Okay. Have a good rest of your Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday morning, I will see you just afternoon and Wednesday whoa and so i'll have an office hour tomorrow at one. actually have a doctor's appointment so maybe we'll make it a bit earlier. tomorrow. let's make it between noon and one tomorrow okay. i'll post the notes of this session. The announcements for forum for that. Anyway, okay so take care, everyone will see you on Wednesday. If you have questions you know where to find me. Right.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I had a question for the empathy map for the assignment one the user, would be a student or a teacher as a student. Because we are given a teacher role.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so you you empathizing with teachers. Okay, setting up that. activity for their classes.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, and we need to go through like this thing feels say and does as per my own experience, using your courses Is that correct as a teacher.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're going to create them out for yourself doing these things as a teacher.

    </li><li><strong>S12:</strong>&nbsp;https://www.educative.io/edpresso/gulf-of-execution-and-gulf-of-evaluation I posted this link in our breakout, I think it's a nice resource that simply explains the difference between the execution and evaluation
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;ohh yeah thats a gd definition and explanation i guess
    </li><li><strong>S13:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah there is also a good example in that about light
