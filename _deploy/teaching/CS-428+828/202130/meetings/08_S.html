<ul><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Hello everyone.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;going so far.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Good how are you Professor.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so I.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;mean.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I was focused on doing one thing today with when I realized. I was having a. Meta track down a bug in my web site. So I don't want to explain all the details, but. Just working fine for meeting seven. Do all the negotiations I hadn't place but then for meeting eight, it was doing something different, I couldn't see why I was doing something differently so I had to. This not storing the. Meeting number, the same way, and so it wasn't. wasn't putting the plan for today in the plan for this meeting. So I. realize it was. It was the way that I was reading the number. And stranger than that there's another place ran. Using the same code. And that was working just fine. That makes sense. Then. share my screen. So here's. So this was not showing up. Under the plan here. And it was showing up when I looked at the the, off the whole semesters. So that was. The puzzle. So I decided to not. Look too much more energy to that, but. flying a fixed it would work and all situation so shouldn't be happening again. So i'm I don't know, can you click on this link do you have permission when you click on this link attendance. Does anyone want to try that. and see if what kind of message comes up. report back about what kind of message comes up.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Your professors also same for me again click that link and it takes a good on. Your courses.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;That doesn't give you an air okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;No.But.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;You don't have a key or do you have a key yeah well.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;same as yours.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah it's just a regular attendance, I guess, like it takes you to the same place.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, let me share my screen of what i'm seeing here. So this is the view that I have. Anyway, so I can click on the key and then we can see the TV. Okay, so. I know also under upcoming events. there's attendance. activity. Go to activity. Well, I can't i'm not a student here. Let me try my student turn into students yeah well that works. So here is the attendance, you see, submit attendance. that's what comes up when you click on the link.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah yeah the same as the regular attendance.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;portal.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. So sometimes. Your courses. doesn't. It it doesn't handle permission permission differences well so sometimes if I have a link and I switched to student, then it becomes I don't have permission to be there. So i'm happy that the attendance is a. it's better at that. So i'll include those links and then. Make sure you get. it's an easy way to get the dependence done. Class okay. Okay, so this one. Is the published version of the website. And I think it should be. There now okay. So i'm back on. On the topic of the breakout room interface because. So I I didn't experiment this morning with my way. So I invited her join a zoom meeting and and I created three breakout rooms. And the first the first screenshot is. Because I wasn't sure what the breakout room interface is like for people joining participants in the room in the meeting so. This is what. The first she wasn't. She didn't see us screen to select the breakout room. So I put a signer to room to, so this is then she found the stream to join a breakout room. So in this case she's already in Room two. So there's no indication that you're in room to. The chance to join one or three. And then, after. Two to enter the main session then she could see this screen, where she could select between. two and three. So. So. In our context context of our discussion of also execution and evaluation. Is there an issue here.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah it doesn't specify which room you're in so yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so in your clients. If you can take a screenshot of the client that allows you how you can select the breakout room in your. resume. And post them to the. I guess post them to the breakout room discussion groups. And then I can look at them from there, and maybe collect some. Okay, so. Keep will keep that in mind. So I said theme for today was thinking outside the box. So when I think of that sort of literally it comes to the mind of the $9 problem i'm not sure if that's the. Best name for it or or not they have a link here that. It gives an introduction to it. And I don't necessarily agree with her treatment here. But the idea is, if you have a grid of nine dots like this. How do you. draw draw straight for like four straight lines. That connect. All the dots without lifting your pen. pencil. They weren't familiar with this. seamless before.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah long time ago.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so if anyone wants to know if you click on the link yourself, you can see what a solution, but all of you that. and So here's. way to do that. I would, I would start in the corner I wouldn't leave the space. here. And so the idea. The phrase think outside the box means. So we're looking at those nine dots. We have. A constraint that we imply it ourselves, is that the. dying gods exist in a box and you're constrained by that box, but the solution. So I start 123 and four. To outside the. Then the area of the box. And I can find a solution. That makes sense. So i'm going to open our breakout rooms and I want to discuss the marvel answering machine. So I would like you to think about what is the contribution of. girl bishops marvel answering machine that was the video that I posted. The other day. And there's nothing to say about modern voicemail systems. So. Are there any design ideas expressed in that. prototype. That tangible. And it's answering machine. That could be applied to. We handle voicemail systems now. Was makes sense for questions. Okay, so i'm going to take that as a yes and make sense, so i'm going to. Open the breakout rooms. And everybody should. Go to the breakout groups. On your questions page if you're not sure which breakout room here and. We saw. Okay. I have these two screens going on. And sometimes the control pops up on the screen too, and sometimes it pops up on screen one. So I created the breakout rooms on screen to, and then the idea is the control control to open all the readings. it's not ready. know that people aren't. assigned to breakout rooms. Okay. This is strange. going to share my screen with you. So. Choose on room.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;We can't see that, on your shared screen.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I thought it was. Set because I could you can see the student password in the background.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;yeah we only see that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;They only see the browser window. yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Alright, so i've set the settings to. All participants to choose your. So before that I skipped over this the screen that says. When recreating the rooms love participants choose on. So now i've. stopped in that screen now recreating. recreating the rooms, so now the rooms are empty. And now. i've opened them. So please go ahead and join the rooms. And if you can. grab a screenshot of your client or your zoom clients interface. for choosing your breakout room that would be helpful for us to to have all your breakout room discussion later today. So I can so we can see what kind of variety, there are. Variety there is in. terms of the smell bad information. So please explain your problem. Can you turn your MIC on.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Hello hello, Professor may join anyone I want. Okay, all right there boom, I was previously.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so. Maybe. Let me go back to. Our courses page. You should be less. and seven. Okay, so that's. that's you should enter group seven. or seven.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Okay okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome. So, how did that go.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;It was good discussion was really good.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;way to think are free.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;But i'm thinking is like, if you tell us about a topic like we have to discuss like we have we have discussed blindly. So if there is something to. like to discuss at least we should get to know about that topic that time before we start. So, like maybe if you mail us like this, these are topics, we have to discuss, we will get prepared for that one day before, so that will be helpful for us in discussion also.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;sure. So I thought, because. I put those links. In the outline for the previous there too. So yeah okay fair enough. So many people not seen the video. Before being asked to talk about.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Professor I didn't see the video to today, but I did read about this marble machine or the concept in the textbook was. A video.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. So any. Any thoughts about. So the marvel answering machine isn't very practical wisdom.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;or somehow practical, we were actually discussing that thing, so it was like 50% or 60% implemented into the modern voicemail system and 50% of that is still not there, so. it's still manual like you have to do it manually by yourself, or something like that so so the machine says like Okay, the voice man number were just discussing that like. they're like five boys multiple they're like five marbles in the order may 12345 and something like that. So that is also that is implemented in the modern world, so when you when you go to your voicemail on directory it says like Okay, you have five voicemail to listen, one by one, this is this that is implemented and the things that are not implemented is like. The important stuff and unimportant stuff in the video it says like Okay, this is not important he put it on to another plate or something like that. And for his flight deal, it was implemented important, so he put that thing into the shelf and write it down this is my flight data or something like that. So those kind of stuff is still not in the model why Why is nothing new, we have to do it by ourselves if anything is important or not judge it like is an important for me. And then to discussing maybe in the future voicemail thing with the help of maybe I don't know on machine learning artificial intelligence or. Just you know voice to text something like that, so another phone. automatically suggested this is important, and this is not, and this is regarding your fog light and it automatically puts into the schedule, if you have the option on and stuff you know that. It is possible, it just like the concept is quite possible to bloomin hundred percent, but I think 50 to 60% is the right now.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;As. Well, so harsh you had your hand up.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, actually, I would like to share to have really good ideas which we discussed in our group. First of all, like the one of them was like creating and graphical like July application, but user can like drop that marble into a specific whole like an you know something kind of a game similar kind of July, where they're able to. Read the voicemail transcript or able to be or what was the decent voicemail and it will show up like how many marbles are their existing. And the other concept which I really liked personally is that using an arduino or raspberry pi we can use api's like voicemail api's from sastre or any kind of telecommunications provider where. We can use like let's say you know how we access the door locks within specific edify the p so in similar way, like we would have five different marvel kind of shaped rf ID. which can be programmed into an arduino or raspberry pi's so as soon as I. I as soon as I have my first my will, near to my scanner it will show me if there's any it will directly play the first recent voicemail from using API and I really like the concept like we can make a small kind of a toy, or we can actually make same kind of a machine.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so. So I think there's still some issues of. Having physical representation that we might lose. The marvels or lose the rf ID. tags that we would like to scan. Depending what how they're set up but. I feel like. So there's like surrounds answer. system. You went straight straight on to it, how we could implement the these things and voicemail systems. So I think it's also important to ask the question. about why things are. What what are useful features and what features would help people to deal with the messages, so one thing So for me watching that video. was like I get different marvels based on. Different family members, there are people different people using that same answering service or have the answer voicemail attached to that same number, we could. indicate. For whom each messages for if you wanted to specify. So if I wanted to say this message is just raw and it's the way else can listen to it, then I could. mean there could be a way to. If that. feature was useful. Then we can think about. ways to implement it. So so there's a biggie of activity design and, and so the tangible interface. gives us some space to. Think about different design possibilities. So we don't necessarily have article. We don't have to think about the marvel answer machine in practical terms like what if we get 100 messages in a day. We have to have you know hundreds of marbles mean there might be. Some practical issues there. But at the same time, you can think about about the ideas what ideas are valuable, what are the positives. We try and refine. The designer and I idea about what an answering service could do. To. To keep the the positive aspects, we see in this other. Miss thought exercise about the marble answering machine. and If I think, also to think carefully about what's. what's possible and what whether what's possible. is always the best the best idea for people.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Well, I guess there's always this dilemma, and this issue of like what is useful and how much do you want to use that feature or something like that maybe if we implement 100% of that marvel machine thing. And people only care about like 70 or 80% of the usability of this stuff maybe people don't want to care about like okay. who's messages this they don't want to care about that maybe they just want to care about Okay, if I missed some important things that is regarding my scheduled like the flight details. Then, maybe from that voice messaging and voice milling system, it could automatically give me a solution hey you missed that thing and I already added that in case just a solution in your schedule or in your calendar in your phone or in your laptop whatever it is, but. So that that might be useful for the user, but like hey is this message for another person or something like that that might not be useful or, in some cases. You know they're like some messages like a friend is just calling and then. or something you're avoiding that friend, maybe let's and he's like hey pick up bro or something like that you like I don't want to hear that thing and all people don't want to like maybe care about that and don't want to go through that so that means we have.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;screen COP well yeah you can screen calls say from non-small. i'm just because see on my screen year one one square above sra. So. So, or if you both have the same phone number, then you don't want to get messages mixed up if. possible. anyway. So. i'm not certain that. automatically reading mail and scheduling appointments. Is. is the best way to put people first. But that's another topic for discussion.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah, it is not.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Quite in. The online form so. I wanted to also talk about. The project today. knife cuts. stuck dealing with my. With my. transient bug in my website. So i'm gonna put this assignment up.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;We have the first individual assignment do on a week from today. So I. So i'm going to. Set up the first part of the project to be doing two or three weeks from today. And so i'd like you to think about over the weekend now i'll get it put up over. On this after this afternoon and i'll send an email about. So, think about who you'd like to work with in a group so think about a likely, a group of four. Or if you're doing research research. If your graduate research involves an interface. You can communicate about possibly doing something on your own. for that. Anyway, think about it and send send. an email. or post to the forum for the project about who you'd like to work with. And then we'll get that set up. And we'll talk about it more in detail. So basically we're going to do the same kind of. Emphasis emphasizing. Identifying opportunities, not just for a particular thing, but for. Anything that you're you're thinking about for your group project that makes sense. Okay, so 21 after one now, so I don't want to keep you any longer.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Have a good weekend.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;any questions you can stick around, and let me know burning questions for the rest of us go. Okay. So thanks again, and thanks again for today and have a good weekend take care stay safe where your mask and indoors settings as of today. and Think about making a plan to vote on Monday, if you're eligible. Take care bye.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I was wondering ever been to in the voicemail system. Like in the model was my sister my I noticed that. We can pick up the. pick up any models randomly. Like there was. In the video. The guy took the first model at first, and the last models in the second so can we do it in the model i'm not sure can we do it in the modern system that we can randomly pick any muscles.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I think. So there's a web interface for the SAS help voicemail system. So the voicemail system, I sauce tell it's interesting a little bit because it, it has some of the same ideas. We could we could. pick them out. of order, one thing I noticed, though, is that the store. The voice recording things as such a little bit rate.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;That the audio quality is. degraded.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;In the was my idea.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;well. In the sauce till, we can also pick it randomly right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I think we can yeah okay.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Professor about the project, I was thinking. You saved me that we can do research but yeah my my research oh sweet in both interfaces but it involves the interfaces of the public library. So. I mean, and there is also some works for the literature review so we'd be. eligible as my project, maybe for this course, if I do any literature review. It systematically literature review.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;well. Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So we'd be eligible, like if I do any. systematic review. Of. Some of the public libraries. I mean. Regarding the log analysis of some of the public library.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. So what i'm looking for is a project. where you can look good an interface design and. A look look for opportunities for improvement and re design.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Okay okay okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;That sounds so if you have a if you have the current public library interface. Then you might say here are the issues. That i've identified and so.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;That sounds perfect I mean there's some interesting I mean I really.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;What i'm going to ask you to do in the. project is to look at two different. I want to create two different designs.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Two different designs. I mean, I have to create another interface right. I mean in project.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so create to low fidelity. prototypes for your design ideas and then. get some feedback on those.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Create too low fidelity interface.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah well so you're going to say here are the things that are missing, so one way that we could do them is. In this we could follow this way to organize. The new features in the interface.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Okay okay okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;here's a different idea about how to. present the interface okay. And then. From those two preliminary designs get a little bit of feedback. And then refine that. And then get. To the. final version, at the end, the class.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So, so there will be two prototype that I have to make right. For me from. dying interface, and then I have to, I have to. argue that here. In the. For one interface, I can do this change and for the another product, I can do this change.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;shouldn't be like website or any. Like a is it any bs like we can create a page or so.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well i'm thinking about listing something that which is just an interface that exists already.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Oh.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So you don't have to make contrive something you don't have to make up something. moment get. Something that exists.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;We have to improve it. I mean we can we will find some way to improve it, we can we can find some limitations and then. Professor, why do we need to prototypes I am not clear about that.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;And also like the it includes any kind of feature or. We can create any feature and find find any problems and get install it on our own.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. So the first question, but like two different ones so. So the idea is. to think about. So it's not. And I don't want you to rush to a particular solution so i'd like you to think of a few different way some different ways to present. The information in the interface, and so two different. approaches to the interface they're done as sketches on pencil and paper. That you can present. To others for consideration.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;fidelity prototype right. yeah and like. We can. If we don't draw draw it on pen like on people and we can just create on in any kind of like using tools like adobe and kind.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I prefer that you. mean the more effort you spend on creating the sketches. The more attached you'll be to them.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, my brothers.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. I mean we've talked about this. i'm not talking any more detail than I was and i've talked about the steps of the project. From the beginning of the class. So i'm not seeing anything different today.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I just want to. Get you thinking and get you. moving in the direction of getting started on the project.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so I what i'm understanding, now that our main focus is actually on the approaches that we follow, I mean there will be two approaches, we will take to. I mean solve the issue. Right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, so.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;So look.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;For you can use two different metaphors for the interference okay okay.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;So one is too broad them in one is the solution.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;No.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Both of them are solutions right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So the first step, trying to understand the problem is. Think where are unmet needs. So, in the first stage of the project we just want to understand the problem, so do empathy maddox and think about where our. issues for the for the user. Like in the screen things about selecting breakout rooms.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;you're finding the problem.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;There there's no way to tell which breakout room you're in to begin with.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah yeah yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;good example. yeah. that the first stage of the project you're not going to. propose solutions to that. just going to let Let there be problems just identify the opportunities for design redesign. And then. you're going to think about two different ways to. reimagine the interface. To provide to meet the needs.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. And I also doubt in that building that is due on Monday. September. So, like. We have to implement something in this activity, or we just ago. The activity that your process like in this action.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. You can define. You think about something for your students to do for your hypothetical students to do. involves you are courses activity and the you are courses resource. So think so, think about that define that and then. create the contents of your section, according to what you've. What you've defined for your students. record students and then think about. For you, as a teacher. What are the issues and realizing that with you our courses interface. See you're implementing what you're proposing to give your students. So it makes sense.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, is this is this for the assignment one right Professor.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah the individual assignment.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So, Professor I was wondering like do you have. To put a square like which. quadrant and then we will answer them in each portrait like what user things 40 user fields producer does and naughty user. says.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So do we have to feel the quadrants or we can just write that the interstate part, this is the points 1234 in the thing part, this is the point in the dashboard, this is the points and in the.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I think it's it's valuable to have them.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;In.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;As a map and.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;You know.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;there's there's our main purpose to make time putting a break.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well yeah that's that's one of the points yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Like so the students when to fill the map or do mean you're.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;going to. you're going to fill it free as you're going through.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;We. Work with really ensure. Creating. The content for your students your hypothetical students. yeah using a you are courses activity and a your courses source that are. So you can grade the activity and then the resource access is based on.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;greed.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Greed receive.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So there is actually to task actually fast, we have to consider us as a teaser teacher and then we have to reconsider us as a student, then we what we can to what we can say what we can. Do and. there's the tray Professor.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;I mean. I still no confusion. Like a. well developed like creating the content and. The issues of able to fill the empathy map on our own right, what we have faced and what what we are feeling What are those others as.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah do you have any meeting we're taking a lot of your time.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No i'm just getting reports about my dog misbehaving.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;At home for my wife.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Oh that's that's a problem.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;cousin officers yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;No problem and. Easy feeling. swings I mean.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So the idea is you're doing the empathy map. For yourself as the teacher so you're. Trying to you're empathizing with teachers doing this activity in create. So. you're not doing doing the activity as a student. Your. Focus thing on how the teacher. uses your courses to set up the content for. Your students not how the students. complete the content complete. The activity, the things described in in your section in your courses. you're. saying here i'm gonna give. An activity. In your courses now have this resource and then. So your empathy so the you want to identify explore. The issues for the instructor and setting up the content for their students. i'm just saying this over and over again now.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah yeah prophesied got it. Okay yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah So if you have questions about the first assignment, you can also post them to the individual assignments question form. Okay yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;All right.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah Thank you. Thank you for your. support.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're very welcome yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Thank.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;You yeah it was a great discussion I really appreciate it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're very welcome.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you everyone have a great weekend.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;thanks you too bye.
