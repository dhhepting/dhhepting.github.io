<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Somebody. says that. That you. Okay, no worries so everyone have a good long weekend. So not so good if you're went to the movie if you went to the football game on Sunday. The writers last badly. But then Calgary also lost so what's good news. First game well that's great. I I have season tickets, but I didn't go to the game on Sunday, because writers haven't put a vaccine mandate in place, whether they promised to do it forward by the 17th so. just trying to do my part. yeah so the next game they're going to be they say they're going to be checking for vaccines. So any interfaces of note. Do you have any good or bad experiences with interfaces that you. thought were more. Over interfaces become more. present in your thinking than they used to be. Since our discussion discussions have started last week. That makes sense. So there's one. quotation on. My webpage that I like. A commencement speech. And I have. I have it on my. webpage but i'll just. Tell tell you the the bed now. Now i'll add the link. So these two couple young fishes are swimming along and. talking to one another and they all the fish. comes by and says hey boys how's the water. And the two young fish kind of look at each other, we kind of shrug and then. After he's got after the old efficient gone by the state, the hell is water. So. So the idea is that they're always. assumptions. We don't. distinguish. or things that we. We take for granted, or we don't see as being. Part of the Environment we're in. So the way we're. Taking that view of interfaces so. When we have. we're clicking on lakes or. Some other swiping left or right, I guess, or. You can use different actions we don't even think about them. necessarily as. we're interacting with technology. But. There are lots of issues at play there. We can consider. That make that make some sense. Oh, speaking of the soccer game, so I noticed Canada tied us on the weekend so maybe there's a chance chance that candidate will be in the World Cup was coming. In 2022 we had our. So, so is to go but. So we have 46 people today well that's i'm impressed. And let's see how many of us have video on. By doing me. So. Safe space to turn your camera on lunch to do that. Okay, so. I want to show you a couple things i've done on the web page. When you are courses. Okay. You can see my browser window now. So with meetings so there's the zoom link zoom meeting link that's been there before and i've added another page another link. Well, to a page in your courses that contains. The links to the all of our meetings. So let me just go into that. So this is copied from my webpage, but I just made the links. On absolute. So that they work in your courses as well, so in August we had one meeting, and then they asked us for a summary. Ours for responses. And then we had second our second meeting. On Wednesday last week. And in summary of responses. And then Fridays meeting summary and responses. And so, here we are, on Wednesday. The eighth or fourth meeting. So. This will give you a space to our page place to go to any particular meeting and then for the ones in the future. don't have married. haven't I haven't occurred yet is just Report No semyon or responses. I don't know about having see Ha ha Ha ha. About preceding the remarkable a candidate needing to. Have a ways to go to qualify for the World Cup. And I say that wouldn't send some human. Okay, so i've done. That so that's sort of. A page that will get you through the different meetings. So that's more of a direct link to what's going on in my webpage. Well, everybody should. is currently in the class should be. In a group, and they should be listed here. I tried to keep these up to date. So, once we have our. there's been a bit of activity, some drops and add so. We have. In class 49 students at the moment. So we have. One group of five people and two groups of eight, so I propose that. Now, after Monday will rebalance the groups that's all. or not. And we can see. Okay, and. attendance at meetings so. let's do. The password for today. Now I hope this is. So I wanted to get a report about what's been going on with attendance. So i've tried this and I hope it's getting the same error that did before, so this is the students so i'm not going to. So i'm going to take all I want all participants. Not specific users. So i'm just using the default here. Okay, so i'm going to download an excel. Okay. So, it gives me this air so MOD attendance attendance plugin slash students not found. More information about this error. This page is not exist yet you can search for this page and other pages. So, as I said, said before. Please. try and avoid sending me direct messages. In class and the other thing i've said before, is that attendance on one day is. Not a missing attendance on one day it's not a problem. I don't want to say. That anyway. it's just a way to indicate. Your. sister another sign another piece of evidence for participation, I guess. So. Now I know that things are recorded because. I. get an air I get a message saying. Let me see what I can. let's go back. To the attendance. let's see. settings. Okay, so if I look at activity completion. So this. So this is one thing that I noticed was. Because i've said for activity completion. Students monsters you receive a grade to complete this activity so i'm I wanted to do. grading of your. Attendance information so that I could so. You could see that you've completed an activity. But if I. So notice. The message here is this activity is already been marked as completed for 53 participants. Changing completion options will erase their completion state and they cause confusion that's the options have been locked and should not be unlocked unless absolutely necessary. So earlier to 62 so I know that. One person has. completed it since. Checking earlier. Let me see if I can refresh it and see. Numbers different again.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;No.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So are there problems. In recording attendance. Are you having problems recording your attendance.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I think everyone did it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;i'm going to keep working on this, so this is. So it's a. it's it's. A little troubling I guess that's the word I want to say us. there's probably something going on, that I have. And I don't. Know i'm not noticing This being said, incorrectly. anyway. So, going back to the error message I would like to be able to contribute to the page. For the air describing the error message, but. that's just enough another layer of complexity that. One read I jumped into just yet. Okay. let's see all right. And here's the. Oh, I didn't make it available yet. So, can you see this with everyone's smiling face or icon. Here, so we are all teachers of this course. So let's make it available to. students. Okay, so this is just. The. This is the bare bones course that you. That. Information Services will provide for a new course. In your courses, so we have announcements, they do the course email. john. has in mind, but. Anyway, so we have these two things so announcements and courses now, then we have a list of features that goes a long. way. So we have 49. plus one for me teachers in this class and no participants. Most students. So that. So this is a way for you to explore. issues with you our courses. If you're interested in doing. Taking on some aspect of your courses. The project. is to give you a way to explore things from a teacher's perspective. Then also. mentioned that assignment. we're going to do some activities and reflect on. Sorry, I didn't hear. Your comment. was speaking there. might just hearing things. Maybe.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we talked about heuristic evaluation last day, so I wanted to. Think about. Applying some heuristics. or thinking about heuristic evaluation, a bit more detail. So. Jacob Nielsen in 1994 put together a list of 10 principles for interface design. hey there you're mystics which means there are some rules of thumb or general principles that often are applicable or work but don't necessarily. always work, so there might be some trade offs involved. So and they're not so not specific rules to follow. So this is a bit more detailed, so we can say visibility system status is one thing. And attacks to talk about discover ability and. feedback. Right, so the idea is that between the user and the computer. You get. The user here. and discover what it's available on the computer running a particular piece of software. That that software and a computer can provide. And then. The computer. gives some longer feedback to the user. So that he or she can. decide what to do next, so there is a cycle that goes between the user and the computer or the device. So when the interfaces designed, well, we can talk about. You know it's just it's just things are just very clear. Things are sad it satisfying experience. it's very effective. All these superlatives. When things aren't. So well designed so well considered. Then it may not be so easy to discover what's going on. what was going on what's available with software or how to access that functionality, so we understand that you could. form a certain function using this laser piece of software. But it's not clear. it's not clear where to find. That piece of functionality within the interface. And it's not there, how to operate the interface once you find it. And the similarly feedback. You might get feedback if things are designed well we'll get feedback that's. How this jacket, what we need to know. to advance our. Words our goal of completing the task. But if it's not designed well feedback might be ambiguous. and many other issues. So we can talk about. When things are designed poorly. The boss of execute they've been golf services, the conceptual distance. Between user and the computer. So we'd like to minimize them. or a good design will minimize these calls. and designing well. Very large results. and sexual distance. And I don't know you just. Hand waving all make a diagram.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I do have one ready with me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Do you. Well, oh one online too.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I have like some notes from previous classes and it has some of the usability thing, so the Gulf of execution and evolution diagram is with me in a DVD format.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Good well. So I was kind of playing because I have a whiteboard in my office here. Maybe do some drawing. Maybe maybe I will I. will say that for Friday. Okay, anyway, so these heuristics of visibility asst status design should always keep us informed what's going on here appropriate feedback than reasonable amount of time. So I was. At a home improvement store on the weekend and wanting to get somebody to help and it's that. there's a button that says press here for help and I press and nothing happened. The CREST again nothing happened I press the button down for a while. and still nothing happened, so I decided that it was broken. So I went to look for somebody. So that's things in example system status. so that we know what's going on. I press them for helping you get light comes on. If the light bulbs not. so on. So another heuristic is match between the system and the real world design should speak to use language. Is words phrases and concepts related to user rather than internal jargon. So the only way that the user has. Access to the interface or to understand. The system is through the interface. And they do that in an ad hoc way. As opposed to the system designer or the people who are writing the code, they have a more complete and I hopefully an elegant. conceptual model of how things are put together. With the users don't have that need to build a model. Either interactions and so. Language is important. User control and freedoms number three users, often perform actions by mistake it clearly marked emergency exit three in one of the action without having to go through an extended process. So undo and redo our. Video he provide that. Consistency in stallions number four and users should not have to wonder whether different words situations of actions in the same thing well platform and industry conventions. error prevention. So good error messages, important that the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Right, so we can we can think of errors in terms of slips and mistakes. slips are unconscious errors caused by an attention mistakes are conscious errors, based on a mismatch between the mental model and the design. So, based on my interaction with the piece of software, with my history with your courses or moodle. I have a certain model of how things are working. So. And I use my mall to predict. actions. predict what to do in situations i'm unfamiliar with. So when I. was in that process when I click on something and it gives me an error. I mean that that's a mistake. And it's. can be addressed by reconsidering the design of that interface park. So using recognition, rather than recall. So, instead of having an obscure word command to delete files that say. expunge. it's your source out and find some obscure words to describe delete. And anyway, he picked. Before. You pick a command name. But then when you force people to recall that command need they're going to do less well with it, then. If you allow them to. recognize it so if we say type in expunge. nevermind have spell. But if you have a button that says expunge. Then, then people. Say Okay, I know, expand the math for deleting fine. flexibility and efficiency of these. So shortcuts may be hidden from novice users may speed up the interaction with expert user. So that. There are a couple. shortcuts and menu commands. are available for the experienced users and the novice users so. You can make a choice and. So. Looking visible. aesthetic and minimalist design their faces should not contain information which is irrelevant or leave it if we extra unit information in the interface could be relevant units of information and diminishes the relative visible. So he give options for everything. And it's not clear what. Which of the options are most important for. What you want to do at the moment. Now for users recognize diagnosis recover from there. There should be expressed in plain language, no error codes precisely indicate the problem with constructively suggested solution. So how about that attendance module air that I got. That help. me diagnose and recover from the air. YouTube. I would say not. Often documentation it's best that the system doesn't need any additional explanation, whoever it may be necessary to buy documentation to help users understand how it could be their tenants. So if you need documentation. If you need an extra support and it's there. If. If there's a. way to do the search. And it's focused on the tasks that people want to complete. So I had. Experience with support documentation weekend, so I made this lamp I was trying to install. And this instructions were not clear. So I had to ask, I called the store and asked for some clarification because well first I call the one 800 number that said. call this number first. So I call them and they said Oh, we don't really help with that. So without. Without any further discussion they transferred me to. A different phone voicemail true. And then, they said choose from the following list of options. So I didn't know which option to pick wasn't clear. Which option to pick their so I hung up. And they called the store.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;unintentional unmute.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;This these instructions, because there are a lot of. We want to provide the same part for lots of different outlets so. They said things in a way that we're not. there. that's that's very Jim. i'll show you a picture of the instructions. Well, post one next. picture online those instructions see him. So yes, I do have. We didn't talk about assignment when we talked about projects. and individual assignments little bit, so the experiment with your courses course that year now, teachers and. we're going to use that for the first assignment. So. Now i'll have. The description of the assignment out today. Sorry. Still, a few hiccups getting things out of that site. So the first assignment gonna ask you to. create a section for yourself. report that I had my second screen working today. And it turns out that I just needed to wait wait out the blinking. Black screen and then blinking. So I just put the video trying experimenting with putting the video window. on to my second screen now selected gallery. The gallery on had six people. What works. it's good. Now. Okay, anyway, so the idea is. me get this. So here we can edit the course settings so i'm not gonna ask you. To do to. be very careful that edit changing the course settings. Here is course format. of exploring that. So there are different ways to do this let's say topics. So the one i'm using in classes clubs topics. well. It should work as well let's do that will save a bit of screen space. Watch topics. number of sections. let's see if. I can prove myself. yeah how about we use that convention that same Convention have.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;zoom.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. You can claim, one of the sections. And then. we'll talk about. Because of what within the sections. On Friday okay. So i'm a boy. He wrote a time again, I apologize for not keeping a better eye on the clock. So i've got a video that I want to share with you for you to watch. So i'm going to put that into the. summary. it's David kelly's how to build your creative confidence. And I put a link to the Norman doors video in side the audio transcript from last meeting. at all. So it's there if you look this audio transcript also make it a little prettier as well. anyway. Okay, thanks again for today. And we'll see you on Friday, have a good rest of your week. And will also set office hours by me. Only on Friday so think about when you'd like me to schedule some availability for office hours. All right, thanks again take care. Stay safe.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Not crap man.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;I don't think we are able to claim a section, as of now, we don't have the permission or something like that doesn't give us the edit option.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so. experiment experiment plan and these can you see my.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;You can see it so turn editing on make sure turn editing on their food.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, I got it. Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're welcome. So I noticed that the border around my browser window is back now that I need some of the zoom stuff onto the second display. Go figure. feature. So i'll stick around for a minute, if there are questions. So now, I have video. Video window over here on my second display. So I find it hard. Of the corner of my eye see my picture. So when i'm looking at the camera on my laptop. I got not paying attention to this. figure, on the other end slate But then when they look at the picture than. giving you my profile.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, so what we're going to do in this section.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;i'm going to ask you to create a couple things. Your section, so the idea is to. Create your. create a section. And then I want you to then that section do some activities. You know. it's been posted. So that we can you have a chance to look at them before the Friday meeting, we can discuss them in.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Some detail okay.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So it's a it will be marked as our assignment right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;That won't be the first assignment yeah.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;and Do we do we have any tier four discussed Professor. here.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So. Can we ask for help to him or her, maybe to the cheer if we need any help our should we come to your office hours.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, you can talk to me for help. Okay i'm and approachable. I like it so anyway.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, no problem, thank you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Look approachable maybe not.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;sure if.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;you're if you're very much.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah but. Maybe sometime you can be busy there so.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah well, I hope to get that sorted out by Friday as well.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. and Professor like for the exam for the meat chairman, the final. uh I mean. What should we expect the topics from the book directly or. I mean, how should we prepare for the exams in future.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we're not gonna have a midterm exam.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay final.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so it'll be a final so. I am. i'm interested in engaging you your. help in designing the final exam so that the questions. They ask or. A fairly evaluation. Here our progress this semester.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;here. So.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;The details of what's on the exam will will. do that and. Encourage that done collaborative. And I. Think about. there being a few. theoretic theory related questions and then another question will be a. promise. deal with. Applying what we've done the Semester.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;We have 25% for the exam so it may be the final exam right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;20% and final. papers is Tony stilling need to pass it. i'm not saying it's gonna be. difficult to pass that won't be difficult to pass if you've been engaged and semester. excellence.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;And also, Professor like this is an online Semester and that's why I was worried about the project because project is a group project, so we should communicate with the TEAM members and do a group work. For the project so i'm like worried about how we're gonna manage to cooperate. As it is online.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;lots of good tools that are available. Well, yes, good tools. Maybe they're not all great and they're not all good at the same things.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;If you grew.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;up are we allowed to group make our own group.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Maximum for person right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well we'll shoot for four. or people in a group. With a professor will work out exactly. 49 does not it's not the physical form.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah there's true.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we'll. we'll figure it out. See. Then.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So professor, are you busy i'm taking your time more.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No i'm. i'm happy to talk. Thank you.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Professor when.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;It was him and Iraq, and I should. I should nation Ivy have things to contribute as well, you can put them in the chat or.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;For the purpose of. And when should we expect to a start or project in the Semester, I mean, in which time of this semester.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;well. So. I have, I have the idea. Maybe first you get together, so what kinds of groups. kind. kind of arrangement for groups are going to have. Then. start thinking about ideas of all. kinds of. website source applications as a group you're interested in exploring so maybe it's something which you're familiar with you use from time to time. But isn't. There some things.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;That are.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;difficult to user confusing. So here here's an example of. Something that was confusing for me today they started out. Saying do this by hand, I have to add everybody is teachers.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, so there was no tool to automatically add all of them.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, I couldn't. there's nothing to upload a spreadsheet.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So this is a, this is a I mean not user friendly. process right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;it's not too bad, so I had the live class list. of our 420 8% 24 courses on my second display. And then so copy the user ID from. Like before the Ad sign.ca a copy that and I dragged on my laptop, and so this is the interface. whoa.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, this is Daniel yeah. yeah so you have to add all of them one by one.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So yeah I said don't smoke everybody teacher and then. This is a little troubling at first. I didn't see that he get input focus on this box. So as i'm typing. well. There are two more things that I. hear, then I realized. yeah anyway. If I come up maybe I don't come up because. yeah because I. did notice. That so. It wasn't clear that I could do input there, so I would do a search. To new users to show. This lesson that comes up with us. by cutting and pasting. john's writings I could find them. see this one, so I can make the once once you're gonna make less. And then they added them all together.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;One day one.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So that was like. I mean. i'm kind of. What should I say it was kind of. boring like that, because you have to find everyone It cannot just put all of them at a time.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;It. says. Here are some cases, you are courses. Where it seems to. be available to do the things that I want. Like in forming groups. It says upload a spreadsheet of one. Anyway, so here, let me show you how to. Go back to.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, what does the sections mean in the experiment Professor like is it a different section for every topic, or like is it for I mean, is it like the section 1234 like we have a section one for a C section two for htc like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So in the experiment in that class it's called experiment with your courses. I just want you to clean section to the topic.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;I have already claimed one section.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So it's Just to give you a little bit of space. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;it's real that'll be for me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Everybody in class if they were feeling malicious. To change everybody else's stuff. So I can there there's a log changes, so I could track down people who were being nice but i've asked people to be nice. So in the experimental experiments your courses it's just the topics are there to give you the space to. within which to work.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;But in this class i've divided made the topics like resemble. syllabus.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah i've ever been in meetings here. meetings.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;You got it so you made a different session for different parts like for meeting for exam.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Individual assignments. Project assignments. exam should be exam not exams. and participation, and then the research. i've tried. The topics inside our name your courses course. link to how things are. The courses organize.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It was nice talking to you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, Nice to talk to you as well, so you're on campus I see i'm guessing. The core in your office.

    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah, thank you for so I love i'm interested and i'm enjoying this class and I will also want to do a good project. that's why i'm actually asking you lots of questions.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. If your. If your graduate studies work research. involves creating a soft piece of software that. and designing the interface from the.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;song yeah yeah yeah because.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Then you might. want to take away the option so. The option of you doing. A project related to your thesis work. By yourself. To win not to work in a group we just say. This. thesis. I don't want to say you have to do that if you're a Grad student.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;i'm a Grad student Professor.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, no, I know you are understood that, and you said you were in DR Davis off lab. But i'm just saying that might be an option for you to consider, but I don't want you to feel obligated.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah i'm interested in doing research so, but first I want to explore and then I will share my ideas with. Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;All right, anyway, so. I think, by the end of next week we we have. Project stuff sorted out and pitching.
