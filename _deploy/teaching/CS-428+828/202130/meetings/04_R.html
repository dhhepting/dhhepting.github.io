      The most important thing that I learned:
    </h5>


<ul><li>We discussed about how to discuss things over zoom and about first assignment.
    </li><li>David Kelley in his video discussed about his emotional stories. though, i think the lack of confidence has done many negative impacts to the people.  People can be the lack of confidence has done many negative impacts to the people.  People can be cured by step-by-step involvement to the activities of the particular phobia so they can gain confidence. Since, series of the lack of confidence creates  many negative impacts on individuals. morove ,we also saw 10 usability heuristics for user interface desig
    </li><li>In today’s course, I learned about the 10 principles of Jakob Nielsen’s interface design. These design principles are designed to allow people to have a better operation and understanding.
    </li><li>The ten design guidelines I thought was critically important. I am looking forward to learning how to implement these guidelines into real world interfaces.
    </li><li>In today&#039;s class we have learned about the Norman door and it&#039;s usability. Talked about Human center design. Learned it&#039;s types and what are the ways we find difficult to read and do that the same things. He gave his own example as sometimes it is difficult that what we are thinking and what we are doing.
    </li><li>We learned the 10 usable methods and functions when doing a good user interface design.
    </li><li>The principle of human computer interaction and heuristic
    </li><li>10 points on usabilty of an interface and its importance. How usability can affect a user and points on how to perfect an interface. For example, matching between system and the real world, error prevention, recognition rather than recall and aesthetic and minimalist design.
    </li><li>The gulf of user interaction. various concepts of how better user interface can be implemented.
    </li><li>The &amp;quot;10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design&amp;quot;. Some of these are aligned or similar with some principles in the course textbook.
    </li><li>Dr. Hepting today talked about Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design in an article in the nngroup. It had some concepts that an application should have to be human-friendly. Some of the points covered in the article were:- 1) the system status should be visible 2) The words in the application should be common which are used in everyday life. 3) Users should be able to control their presence on the platform have freedom. 4) The program should be consistent. 5) The error messages should be simple and
    </li><li>So today&#039;s discussion in class was mostly on one article from &amp;quot;nngroup&amp;quot;. Dr. Hepting explained usability heuristics for user interface design from that article. There are several points which I learned from the arcle which are: 1) Visibility of the system status. 2) Design should be matched between system and real world language. 3) The interface should provide user control and freedom so that user can leave the unwanted action anytime. 4) The interface should be consistent to maintain and many more points.
    </li><li>The most important thing that i have learned is about documentation and how documentation is need for others so that other can know about the functionality about the product.
    </li><li>the most important thing I learned was the usability heuristics. Even though they are not specific usuability guidelines, it is very important to keep in mind in design. The 10 usability Heuristics I learned are: Visibility of system status, Match between system and the real world, User control and freedom, consistency and standards, Error prevention, Recognition rather than recall, Flexibility and efficiency of use, Aesthetic and minimalist design, Help users recognize, diagnose, and Documentation
    </li><li>I got to know different ways to evaluate the interface design of any website with 10 usability criteria.
    </li><li>Professor explained how important the usability of a website is. It is very important for a good user experience.
    </li><li>We have learnt today 10 usability rules for user interface designs.
    </li><li>Usability Heuristics for UI design
    </li><li>the things which we understand most and learned about it is good for us and for others to whom we tell about it
    </li><li>Nielson&#039;s 10 general principles for interaction design
    </li><li>Experiments with urcourses sounds interesting and looking forward to it.
    </li><li>I leaned the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design. I think it could be a guideline for interface design
    </li><li>In class today, we discussed the 10 usability design heuristics from the Neilson Norman Group website.
    </li><li>I came to know about 10 Heuristic principles which are also called as usability Heuristic.
    </li><li>The most important thing I learned in today&#039;s meeting was about usability heuristics for interface design and how they pertain to nearly everything we have access to on the internet.
    </li><li>In this lecture, I learned the ten steps to design an effective design in terms of the factors that affect the dynamics of procedures in order to reach the maximum levels of efficiency and effectiveness for the user.  In the context of protocols, the design must have an ideology that is meaningful and meaningful to the user.
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The most difficult thing for me to understand:
    </h5>


<ul><li>Good day professor, I didn’t not understand the need or the use of an experiment ur course tan in my dashboard.
    </li></ul>
<h5>
      The thing about which I would most like to know more:
    </h5>


<ul><li>today, we saw 10 usability heuristics for user interface design. i found these steps really helpful in creating a attractive and interesting interface and would definitely like to know more about this as  how to sufficiently introduce them to our interface. also i saw the creative confidence video. there was an example of snake phobia cure by following baby steps,but tdh i did not get to know to boost your creative confidence as an practical approach.
    </li><li>I learned about (heuristic) usability in detail with some current example. In class we discussed about experiment UR courses page. I would really like to know about the course chapters (main topics) since it is not discussed in this class since first lecture - need to know what all topic will be covered for final exam.
    </li><li>Are the 10 general principles for interaction design, aka Heuristics. Throughout the 10 the one that intrigues me the most making a design that is intriguing, yet not too dull or simplistic. Something that is practical, yet catches the eye. Minimal by looks, yet full with function and depth when the user dives into it.
    </li><li>I think it is a great idea to evaluate the UR Courses interface and I am excited to work on it for the first assignment.
    </li></ul>
