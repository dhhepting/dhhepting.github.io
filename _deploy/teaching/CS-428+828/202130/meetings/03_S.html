<ul><li>REMINDER -- Please take a moment to rename yourself on Zoom. I will do the same. Remember the format to use is name-you-want-others-to-call-you (uregina-email-id) so for me you see "Daryl (heptingd)". You can still call me Dr. Hepting (or as it often appears in Zoom transcripts, Dr. Happening) if you want, but that is not required. I invite you to turn on your video if you are comfortable with that. Not to pressure anyone.

<ul><li>There will be 2 individual assignments. The first is going to be giving you instructor/teacher access to a course on UR Courses. You will have a task to complete in that course. Then you will be asked to reflect upon the way you completed the task and identify any opportunities to redesign the interface in UR Courses that supports completion of the task. The second individual assignment will be different between 428 and 828. The grad students will do a review of a recent research publication that deals with human computer interaction and the undergrad students have the opportunity to do some extra work on a topic of interest that is related to our class. 2 individual assignments each worth 10 marks for a total of 20 marks.
    </li><li>The project is likely done in a group (of 4) that you choose amongst yourselves. If there are grad students doing research that involves user interfaces and who would like to work on their own, that is a possibility. Please talk to me if you are considering doing the project individually. You can form your own groups of preferably 4 people, possibly 3, and I strongly discourage groups of 5. The project will be looking at an existing website or software where you have identified some issues with the interface, some opportunities for redesign. And then go through the human-centered design process with that interface and come up with a couple alternative interfaces that you will develop or pursue. You will do some low-fidelity prototypes and get some feedback from other members of the class. Then take that feedback and create one version of the interface in a higher fidelity prototype, that looks like an application with which people can interact. In the project, steps will be done sequentially, but there's also opportunity for iteration. If we're designing an interface, things may not flow from start to finish, we might have to move back a few times. We're going to explore the different steps in the design process and get some hands-on experience with it.

<ul><li><strong>SSS:</strong>&nbsp;How is this class different than 280, in terms of content?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;The focus of this class is interface design so we are looking for issues and becoming aware of the issues in interfaces that we encounter. When designing interfaces I think there are also opportunities to consider professional ethics. Is it ethical to design an interface that helps people to do something that they don't want to do but the company wants to users to do? There's also a lot of things that go into designing interfaces that are useful and which can provide a good experience to users. There's lots of issues and there's lots of theory related to this, and so we're talking about the theory related to interface design. That's really why we go through a project. Another difference is that we have the text book. The structure of the class in terms of having discussions is similar.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Will we be using. Any prototyping Apps like marvel and stuff.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Not.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;A few different ways to do prototypes. So. we're at one. So I think you can. You can. Get engaged in a discussion about. who owns that. That. Are. There three teams. it's no different criteria which we can. talk a little different tools that like use recorded. That there's a range of. Solutions I guess. So. You can do prototype with the high fidelity prototype but. javascript and html as well. So you can.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;See.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;The pictures of the screen or our design.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;So. Last bigger discussion, you asked the question that what is the difference between the user experience of the instability, so I had a confusion between this chart these two terms, could you please clarify what is the difference between these two terms.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. Think about.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;More.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;leads. Sufficient.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;visibility.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;that's usable be.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Effective just efficiency satisfaction.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well satisfaction is loving. experience. You can feel a certain way. motions wants to.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;What. We can also consider effectiveness and efficiency as performance.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I didn't quite catch that.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;We can also consider effectiveness and efficiency as performance right Professor. As the performance of danger purpose of the are the user.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, so. One way to quantify performance I guess is our views are able to complete. The task they want to do. We wanted to accomplish with the software, the interface. So that. So that that's harder performance and that's.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;If you if you feel. Happy or frustrated that's a little bit more like. Are you experiencing here.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so how i'm feeling about the interface like happy or sad of producing it that's my user experience.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. So. So you can. design. Like I can. Design your user your experience with interface. I can design. reflects that encourages. encourages you to have an experience that can make you have that kind of experience, you know things. So. your best to. They are. Once. The interface, do you have a positive experience. make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Have a good weekend. long weekend. yeah see one witness.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;i'm signing off.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good afternoon, everyone. afternoon so nice day today more or less. As long weekend coming up. The strange thing is that we usually don't start classes laughter long weekend. forgotten. jump on this semester. So I have to ask Smith about wave written your last name. I saw someone in the news using. These different. glyphs that. looks similar to the letters, but. Not quite. And I just wanted this is a thing now.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;So it's. Like pure more ideas engine.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;it's what sorry.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;My family name is Spencer like few more ideas and me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Oh no I wasn't. I wasn't trying to Smith patel. Had the last name with. characters that look like the letters in English, but not quite night seen that done somewhere else, and I just wanted to have that Sam. So all the cool kids are doing now. Was it just the way to sort of type your name but not give away too much information. or just a way to make me look older. anyway. So i've been. stymied by the publishing my website. So. I realized, I thought there was a syntax problem, but then I realized that was the deploy script and trying to use. travis ci. To put publish. To to run them. build and then publish the websites. And I realized that that. I couldn't make a connection the connection wasn't wasn't working to the server so I tried to manually and I follow the instructions in the tutorial that. That they provided some do using jackal to build a static website and then copied over to you will see us. The University of Regina website. When they said. Do this and I did that and I couldn't figure out what's going on, and then I realized there is taking instructions. So now I. have a copy over, but then I realized. We went to. Some of the links don't work because. I haven't compiled it. yeah compiled it for your giant website so. Please bear with me a little bit longer on this quest to get my technology updated with the summer. Let me share with you. So i'm. trying to get my second monitor working and now it's not working. Just blinking. Trying to bug that one. In class today. Let me go back and share with you my screen, so I can show you that. Share screen. Okay, so. The current semesters website out. it's not working well today. Okay, so I just wanted to show you. That done with summary of the meeting to. So. We can disregard this last one. But, so I have the zoom audio transcript. chat transcript. And then i've taken that. Raw material and made out some. broken out some issues upon this. subjects. So I don't know that I need to put like identify myself and speaker and beads. And I haven't done it all it's about. So i'm trying to collect the administrative issues. And I can probably do a little better. Responses to responses. Good core design. So, have a link to the textbook website here. And the comment about editing the wiki. So these are the issues we discussed and the questions I posed to you for the breakout room discussions. And then. Subsequent question is the interface to select your own breakout room musical. Why should. The organizers. Of the great discussion, right after this. Create it create a new section your book rustic evaluation. These are just pulled directly. From your responses. And, broken down by. The most important thing we discussed today. Was the most difficult thing for you to understand. And what was thing which you'd like to know more. So I. wanted to have. website functioning today but it's still not quite there. I apologize for that. So let me do that. Get the password for attendance going here. Okay, so i've given you the password for attendance. So, and I redid the. breakout groups. Based on registrations as of Wednesday afternoon. Thanks. jackal. jackal. copy the website is on my laptop. So. That makes sense, I need to get my deployment script. So i'm curious of those of you who have websites on the university. When. You. have them. On the cms website. So till the you're using. like mine is or do you have them on the Uri China that CA website. And are you are you able to do the original.ca. I think some students have been on. That journey.ca. nothing's my hand is sore today, so my typing is. problematic as well. Let me try again. So I Martin, I didn't mean that. You should have problems with the website it's just. The way that it gets built on my laptop so I can run it as. I can see it as local host. colon for four walls and is it it doesn't. Tell the happening in there.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;OK.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I have a different configuration for the original website. So if I build it on my laptop from the original website, then I will work. On my laptop. So I had this all working nicely but. There were some system upgrades over the summer and. I realized that. My scripts are broken now. So I apologize for.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;No, you don't have to go, just like it's old understand.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. anyway. still work in progress, which I will get sorted out. I will get things to be current as of today, by the end of today.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So do we have a topic to prepare for the next lecture or something right above.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;me.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;See well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;You didn't check. So I want, I want to say that, but the wiki that it's not just. event isn't just for me to put stuff and it's. it's available to everyone.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;i'm not sure that it's it gives. gives an update mountain. well. So somebody else's job so i'm not sure we're going to have. 49 students. let's see so. So let me. share. share the word document, which contains the updated version so let's. mature where it went I. made some changes but anyway, this is. yeah. Okay, so I think i'm sharing the syllabus so this will be up. I find an updated more the details. i've updated marks which correspond to the way we laid out in New York winces. So there's going to be two individual assignments. One loans it's going to be. giving you instructor access so we'll start out by giving an instructor access to our courses. You a task to complete. Your horses. And then, once you complete a task. leader, like the pond I read it. and Other teams opportunities to redesign. The. Issues. and opportunities for redesign. That you see in. Your courses. Based on that activity. The second individual assignment will be a little different between. The Grad students will be a review of. Recent. conference papers deals with human computer interaction. And for undergraduate students have. The opportunity to do some extra work on the topic of interest thats related class. So those each be 10 marks and then the project. So, mostly a group project. So if there are Grad students are doing. we're doing research or thesis or perhaps even a project. Where you're. doing something that involves user interfaces or as a user interface. And you'd like to work on your. Research, for your graduate degree. In the class is a class project, here we can do that, so you can do that individually. not sure if there's anyone. In that situation, but if you are please talk to me about it. And otherwise we'll let. You can form your own groups likely have four people. possibly have three. And I. really prefer to not have groups of five. let's try and aim for groups of four and see if that works out. So you can think about over the weekend. it's gonna be like to work on a project. So the project will be looking at. Existing website. software. Where we have. Some issues with the interface. and Looking for opportunities. to redesign so identifying problem. issues in the interface so let's. Think of them as opportunities for me design. And then go through the process, the human centered design process with that interface account with a couple alternative interfaces that will. develop or pursue. Your low fidelity prototype we get some feedback from other members of the class. Then, based on the feedback from class members and. Not not marketing group. Then. We take take that feedback and create one version of the interface. In the higher. more of a higher fidelity prototype. It runs it looks like people are interacting with the application. and So we'll stop after that that's that's kind of the arc of the project. Do the steps sequentially. there's also opportunity for iteration. We were doing this. If we're designing interface, you may not things may not flow from start to finish, you might have to move back a few times. we're going to. What are we going to run. we're going to explode. get some hands on experience with. With the process of the different steps in the process that's the idea. So i've talked about looking at Chapter one also say let's look at Chapter two as well in the textbook. So I noticed in. Some of the comments from last days breakout session. There was a group who talked about Norman doors. They weren't familiar with Norman doors, aside from the people who talked about them. So. That may be. The short video. minute or five minutes. We could watch together and then. Do something here. Digital ocean, we know that building deploying and managing your. I don't know how to cook but this pan seriously takes it to me to cook books, all of these 12345 thinks steamed vegetables charts broccoli kale spinach. dressy. sunny side up.

    It's not you. Bad doors are everywhere.

    </div><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;there's this door on the 10th floor of the vox media office that I hate so much.damage.You rate, this you're wrong pretty regularly have you seen people miss you that are.Constantly.me to kelsey but here's the thing as soon as you start looking for confusing doors, they are everywhere it's clash why.They like Roman Mars, but know that this is 99% invisible and those doors, you are called Norman door.what's the Norman door don Norman wrote the essential book about design, he is the Norman of the Norman door all right, and where is this guy you must go to San Diego okay.hey i'm done Norman i'm.sure you know it's hard to describe what I am well he's been a professor of psychology professor of cognitive science professor of computer science a Vice President of advanced technology at apple.But for our purposes, I was spending a year in England, I got so frustrated with my inability to use the light switches and the water taps and the dollars, even when I wrote this.If I continually get door wrong is it my fault.No, in fact, if you continually get it wrong as a good way of other people continue to get it wrong good sign that really they had.A Norman door is one with a design tells you to do the opposite of what you're actually supposed to do, or gives the wrong signal and needs assigned to correct it.instruction, that is, why do you have to have a sign that says push or.Why not make it obvious, it can be obvious if it's designed right there are a couple of really simple basic principles of design and one of them, oh cool discover ability.When I look at something I should be able to discover what operations, I can do the principle applies to a whole lot more than doors.And it's amazing with many of our computer systems, today you look at it there's no way of knowing what's possible should I tap it once or twice or even triple tap so discover ability when it's not there well you don't have to use something another is feedback.And somebody times there's no feedback, you have no idea what happened.why it happened, and these principles form the basis of how designers and engineers work today.commonly known as user or human centered design, I decided at one point, the word user was a bit degrading, why not call people people.And it's amazingly simple and amazingly seldom practice we call it critical circles around in a circle you go out and observe what is happening today with zero people doing.And from there, we say Oh, we have some ideas here's what we should perhaps propose to do, then you prototype your solution and test it.Quite often, these are wrong, first, but each time we go around the circle, we do a better job of making your advice.Until the point we're actually making something that really works and this process has spread all over the world and it turns out it's improving line from better everyday things like the ones that Donald about.To using the same process to solve huge problems in public health and developing countries, water, sanitation farming lots more so, what would be a better human Center door and ideal door.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;is one that is I woke up to it and walk through it i'm not even aware that I had open the door and shattered So if you had a door, which had a flat plate. Or could you do nothing, the only thing you can do is push see you wouldn't need to sign a flat plate you push this kind of push bar with the piece sticking out on one side works well, too, so you can see what side you're supposed to push them.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;A simple little hand thing, though sort of indicates, but we still have terrible terrible doors and.So many of them there are lots of things in life that are fairly standardized and, therefore, whether I buy this House or not, is not a function of whether it has good doors.And so, except for safety reasons doors tend not to be improved, but the tyranny of bad doors must, and I think that it really.wanted to.be a flat panel.andyou're right becky your God damn right, and if we all thought, like you, well, we might just design a better world.While our fun because it's a security door.So, as you can see, since I started making this video they have since changed the door a little bit.It gets it's a step in the right direction, thank you so much for watching into 99% invisible one of my favorite podcasts it was so much fun to collaborate with them, thank you and check them out on any podcast APP or 99 pm.feeling adrift in a sea of data wouldn't you rather be focused on steering your APP towards.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay well i'm looking at the time now it's 321 21. So we're out of time for today. So it's done like a Friday, before the. long weekend today for me and I apologize. For the hiccups we had in our meeting today. So what i'm going to say. Continue thinking about. The role that. interface issues played and. Like. That that. got it the way today and the mother. and keep looking for those examples your day to day lives now look at chapters one and two and we're going to. get it into things. On Wednesday, after the long weekend. Okay. thanks again for today have a great weekend take care. See you.
    </li><li><strong>S04:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you, Professor.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;So do.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;You prefer. parody again.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;My pleasure. So. If you have any questions. Okay, to answer them. If I didn't answer them during the meeting time. We can. Now.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;So, Professor I have, I did like class yesterday with you. in winter. And so, how is this class different than that. Well, in terms of content.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we're going to be talking exclusive well not exclusive, you get well. The focus of this class is interface. Design so looking for issues. near becoming aware of the issues and interfaces that we encounter. So we talked about this yesterday we calculated ethics. Ethical behavior so. when designing interfaces I think there are also opportunities. To consider. professional ethics. example of design an interface that helps people will. Do something they don't want to do. That makes needs to be. What the company wants. The user does what he wants to do. If he gets that have an ethical concern. So that's part of our behaviors so it's not like. it's professionals. ethics. very narrow way. In every class. example faces will. Consider professional ethics. So this, this is a plants will be there, but there's also a. lot of things that go into designing interfaces are. useful. and which can provide a good experience to the users. there's lots of issues there's lots of theory related to this, and so we're talking about. The theory related to interface design. that's really we go through a project. differences that we have the next book. The class. Online resources. This the structure of the clients in terms of. Having discussions. is simple.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Will we be using. Any prototyping Apps like marvel and stuff.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Not.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;A few different ways to do prototypes. So. we're at one. So I think you can. You can. Get engaged in a discussion about. who owns that. That. Are. There three teams. it's no different criteria which we can. talk a little different tools that like use recorded. That there's a range of. Solutions I guess. So. You can do prototype with the high fidelity prototype but. javascript and html as well. So you can.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;See.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;The pictures of the screen or our design.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;So. Last bigger discussion, you asked the question that what is the difference between the user experience of the instability, so I had a confusion between this chart these two terms, could you please clarify what is the difference between these two terms.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. Think about.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;More.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;leads. Sufficient.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;visibility.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;that's usable be.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Effective just efficiency satisfaction.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well satisfaction is loving. experience. You can feel a certain way. motions wants to.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;What. We can also consider effectiveness and efficiency as performance.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I didn't quite catch that.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;We can also consider effectiveness and efficiency as performance right Professor. As the performance of danger purpose of the are the user.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well, so. One way to quantify performance I guess is our views are able to complete. The task they want to do. We wanted to accomplish with the software, the interface. So that. So that that's harder performance and that's.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;If you if you feel. Happy or frustrated that's a little bit more like. Are you experiencing here.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so how i'm feeling about the interface like happy or sad of producing it that's my user experience.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. So. So you can. design. Like I can. Design your user your experience with interface. I can design. reflects that encourages. encourages you to have an experience that can make you have that kind of experience, you know things. So. your best to. They are. Once. The interface, do you have a positive experience. make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Have a good weekend. long weekend. yeah see one witness.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;i'm signing off.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thanks.
