<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Please take a moment to rename yourself on Zoom. I will do the same. Remember the format to use is name-you-want-others-to-call-you (uregina-email-id) so for me you see "Daryl (heptingd)". You can still call me Dr. Hepting (or as it often appears in Zoom transcripts, Dr. Happening) if you want, but that is not required. I invite you to turn on your video if you are comfortable with that. Not to pressure anyone!
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Wednesday has come a little too quickly for me. So I haven't quite got things finalized online, but they are better than they were on Monday. But that's not going to stop us from having a productive discussion today. Okay?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;The CS office reminded me to say that if any of you are planning to drop this course, please do it sooner rather than later because there are still people on the waitlist. Not that I want anyone to drop because I've grown attached to you already. The add/drop deadline is, I believe, September 13 (a week from Monday upcoming).
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;What I have done, and this will be published on my public CS website, is create a summary of what we talked about in the last meeting. From zoom, I got the audio transcript and the chat transcript of the meeting and I've condensed both of them but tried to consistently identify the contributors. DHH is me, ??? is unknown (to zoom), and Snn are students with nn being a number assigned in order of contribution (S01 is the first student contributor in a meeting). So, the summary starts with Zoom-Audio-Transcript and Zoom-Chat-Transcript blocks to which I will add other blocks to create a more coherent presentation of what happened in the meeting. In addition to the summary, I have also presented your (anonymous) responses to the meeting, organized by the descriptions that you chose for them
    </li><li>A reminder that under the Meetings section in UR Courses, we have an attendance activity. At some point during the meeting, I will post the password for it in the zoom chat.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Regarding reponses to the meeting, which are due @ 23:59 on the day of the meeting, I am expecting more of an immediate reaction to the meeting. Taking a few minutes to reflect on the meeting and write a response. Having the responses due at the end of the day of the meeting makes them more valuable for the next meeting.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;And the Responses Wiki is intended as a collaborative space for all of us (not just me) to contribute anything about the course.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Will this course cover accessibility and building human computer interfaces? Yes, we'll talk about accessibility, and it is even addressed in Chapter 1 of the textbook.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;We didn't cover anything today (Monday). So I think of it in terms of the example of the wallpaper patterns that I studied in that geometry class as an undergraduate. So, even as we're talking about the interface in UR Courses and how things are organized we are dealing with course content.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;We're going to talk about good and poor design today. This is in the textbook. We are using the fifth edition. Does anyone have a copy of it? I encourage you to get a copy of the fifth edition, and the fourth edition is probably not too far off if you can get your hands on one of those. I want to show you the website for the book. We can have a discussion about the usability of this website. I wanted you to know that you can get lots of materials from this site, if you're not able to get hold of the textbook.

    </li><li>One indication of the quality of a design is the number of calls to the HelpDesk that it generates, and the reason for those calls. I signed up for multi-factor authentication on campus using my MacBook and Chrome. After a call to the HelpDesk, I realized that Chrome was not supported and I was able to complete the process using FireFox.
    </li><li>The wiki in moodle (UR Courses) is a bit different than other wikis. To add a new page, type [[ name-of-new-page ]].  You can also use the double brackets to create a link to an existing page. I'm not sure if that syntax is documented anywhere in UR Courses - if anyone finds a good reference for it, please share. The help in moodle tends to be correct yet not very helpful.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;What makes an interface design good or poor? What is the difference between user experience and usability?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Is the interface to select your own breakout room usable?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;How to preserve your breakout discussions? I created the Breakout Group forums as a way to create some continuity between zoom breakout room discussions. How each group uses those forums is a matter for group discussion I think. I encourage you to copy and paste breakout chats into forum posts, or to summarize your discussions into a forum post. Let's have an ongoing discussion about how to make the most out of the breakout actvities. If you have had a very good discussion in your breakout room, please consider writing that up for our wiki, so that everybody can see them.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Heuristic evaluation is a particular kind of user interface evaluation. We don't necessarily need to have the interface working in front of us to make observations about the placement of things and the way things are organized in the interface. So we'll talk about those different kinds of evaluations. So if we have somebody who's not well-versed in the theory of interaction design and human computer communications. They still might be interested in using your interface, and so their experience of using the software is valuable. If you want novice or non-technical people to make use of your software it's very good to talk to them. Talk to your target group of users early on in the process so you're not going too far down design paths that aren't going to work for the people who you want to use your software. So that's another kind of evaluation and to be valuable, evaluation doesn't have to be very formal either.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you very much for today. Remember that whenever we are talking about and thinking about our use of technology to accomplish tasks (in zoom, UR Courses, and elsewhere), we are very much talking about course material. So. just keep that front and centre and have a good rest of your Wednesday and we'll see you on Friday.

<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I'll stick around a bit if anyone has questions. Otherwise, see you Friday and take care.
    </li><li><strong>SSS:</strong>&nbsp;When are we going to find out more details about the assignments?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;We'll talk about it on Friday, the 3rd, in detail but there are 2 individual assignments. One of them is going to get you set up as teachers in a UR Courses experimental course, give you something to do within that course, get you to complete the task, and then reflect on the process of completing that task. The other will be different for 428 and 828. For grad students it's going to be about summarizing a recent research paper related to human computer interaction and for undergrads it's going to be an opportunity to choose a topic of interest related to the class and do some work about it. For the project we're going to work in groups (for almost everyone) and you can pick your own group (of likely 4 people). The idea is to take an existing interface (on the web) and look for opportunities for redesign to take through the design process.
    </li><li><strong>SSS:</strong>&nbsp;Dr. Happening, I had a question about the website. Is it live? Are we able to see this semester yet?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Not yet. I'm still working on it, for Friday!
    </li><li><strong>SSS:</strong>&nbsp;I joined the class from the waitlist so I don't have a breakout group
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;If you don't have a breakout group, pick 5,6, or 7. I reviewed groups after Wednesday's meeting and everyone active in the class as of Wednesday is in a breakout group now.
    </li><li><strong>SSS:</strong>&nbsp;How is this class different than CS280 in terms of course materials?
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;This course has a textbook whereas we didn't have a textbook for CS280.

<ul><li><strong>S00:</strong>&nbsp;are not. alone.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Know everyone's quiet. Okay, so you can take a second to rename yourselves, please. i'm going to do the same.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Good morning, Professor.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;miley running. So Wednesday came a little too quickly for me. So I haven't quite got things. set things are better than they were on. Monday, but in need a bit of tweaking still. But that's not going to stop us from having a productive discussion today okay. So if you can. is to make it. A little more. approachable. Maybe just. first name or the name you'd like to be called tonight your full name but. first name like for me Darrell. You can still call me Dr happening, if you want, but. You don't have to. Your user ID for you Regina email system. will help me keep track of everybody, and if you can do your video turn your video on. That would that's also good. Not required I don't wanna. Pressure anybody loca. it's nice to see faces instead of. texture pictures. Okay. So what else. i'm impressed that Martin has the northern lights going on.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I see there's some video effects going on to the. Jeffrey, for example. there's a blurred out background, but. This is. His picture is sharp in front. People are doing that. I think if you can hear my fat but found on my poor little laptop from 2017 is going just running zoom so I don't think it would be. very happy if I tried to do some video effects as well.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;It doesn't really matter like you can just sit back on the visit.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;operated with a version.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;know, is it. just put some extra load on processor. Okay, so. i'm going to share my screen. This is my from my local web page. or another thing that. I got from the office and said if if you have. students who. are thinking of dropping. encourage them to do that, sooner than later because there's still people on the waitlist. So, not that I want anyway to drop burn attached to you already. If you think you're really not going to take follow this class this semester. Then please consider dropping sooner than later. Thanks we add drop date is September 13. So that's a week from Monday. Upcoming. I should mention Ashley in the aquarium. we're talking about backgrounds. let's see if I can get one going. Next time for next time i'll. See how badly my computer's. struggling under this loan. anyway.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So what I did, and this is going to be on my. Public CES website i'm going to expect later today but. So what I have here is a summary. What we talked about. it's really. I got from zoom the audio transcript of our meeting. And so the audio transcript pardon me and the chat transcript. So that kind of gives you a breakdown and. We see Can you see. This is the zoom audio transcript window. Yes, okay yeah okay. So the ah that's me. And then, so one. Is the first student first of you students to. make a comment. And then so i'm using that number throughout. Were the question markets that's unknown. So what i've done is i've. taken over all the times stamps that we explain how this. audio went with our video. It so I just made it to more. Reasonable blocks. And if you go through it there's probably some. Things have make you scratch your head and some things, maybe you think are inappropriate. And we didn't have an inappropriate session, but this is the artifacts of. Of the audio transcription service that's being used by Sue. I think it's powered by otter.ai which. I mean it does a pretty good job. There are some curious things that happen. anyway. So what I propose to do is have. The transcription zoom then also edit them into a more. Coherent presentation that goes with our. Class discussion so. And I was. So i'm feeling a little bit with the format still. But i'll get that sorted out, so you can see that, and the other thing you can see. Based on meetings. Is. collect collected responses from you. So I have three, there are three kinds of questions what was most what was the most important thing. From today's meeting. So I abbreviated it now. Oh. i'll have the full. Put the proper text them. So there is the most important thing, nobody had the most difficult thing to understand. And so, as the description of their. response and then want to know more. So a couple questions, just to the couple items here is a question to this course, cover accessibility and building human computer interfaces So yes, we'll talk about accessibility, leaving talk about it now, because some Chapter one of the text. Not not right now, but today. We will read broken broach that subject today. and not to single you out so it's. These are anonymous. So I don't believe you can unless I have some strange settings in your courses you can't see who wrote left. So I just want to say that we didn't cut this talk about we didn't cover anything today or on Monday. So I think of it in terms of. The example of wallpaper patents and mentioned my geometry class as an undergraduate. So. Even as you're talking about the interface in your courses and how things are organized. The views of these are the kinds of discussions. That we're going to have the Semester. And having these discussions, they seem like it. Not doing anything but there. was a big impact on how things are set up. I think so. In the first time I tried to do respond to meetings element last winter semester. To this time. I think it's. Improved the interface, is it has improved a lot. So our discussion. So in talking about how things are set up in your courses. Well we're already talking about the first time. So that make sense.
    </li><li><strong>S03:</strong>&nbsp;yep okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So my plan is to. highlight some of them in our. meetings that are coming up. Good see if it breaks anything. that's good.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So we're going to talk about good and poor design today. So. This is the textbook. let's. Encourage to define. So this is the fifth edition is anybody. copy of it. So I encourage you to. get a copy, and this is the fifth edition so. The fourth edition is probably not. too far off, you can get your hands on one of those. Who are. Well, there is probably getting a bit a bit older. So there's that. Well, so did anyone get caught in the hail yesterday. it's quite a storm. My wife was telling me earlier it's probably going to bypass surgery, and all the good stuff all the good storm activity, yes, so I think we've got a pretty big. Storm on the see last night. anyone's in the Northwest. and there's some property damage because of the hail. You think not other parts, though. Okay, so I want to show you the website for the buck. So we can make, we can have a discussion about what how usable this. website is. I just wanted you to know that you can get some materials from here, so if you're not able to get Ahold of the textbook. You might want to look through the website for some. Personal readings. Now. sign up for the. Multi factor authentication. website so. The instructions I got from information services were OK, but they. didn't work for for a MAC. Running chrome. So I call the night. got to help without so it's been good, so far, but. So if we have to call you if the software needs a lot of. calls to services as an indication of the quality of its design. So now I get a. push notification on my cell phone that says i'm trying and trying to login is that Okay, so I can just say yes and. You get logged in. Okay, so under meetings we have attendance for meeting, so let me give you the. password for that. Okay, so take a minute with that. Let me take a minute. Regarding the feedback. I wasn't expecting more than responses to the meeting sorry. i'm not expecting more than a few minutes. i'm spent on that so it's not a question of. carving half an hour of your day or something before midnight. So a couple minutes. Okay. And so I appreciate the question yesterday about that. Now it's. I think if we do things sooner. With. The cut off sooner after class then. Getting to the next class i'm already. it's more immediate and then I can do more things with it. So how's my volume in zoom here, and you hear me Okay, are you likely to speak a bit louder or.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Oh it's good.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;it's good here soon.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thanks. So I want to show you on it started with a couple things. Well, one thing anyway into the wiki. So it took me a little while.
    </li><li><strong>S07:</strong>&nbsp;I.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;recall something about writing. In a wiki in your courses. So another page here. So this is the key to remember. Although it's not documented anywhere. You want to create a new page. We do open double brackets, and then the name of the page and double close double brackets. I will close brackets. Meeting one. Before. We ready. So the first one administration i've added the page already. But then meetings 01 I haven't it's just a link to a page that hasn't been created, yet so if you click on meeting one. So the help on your courses is getting better and it's funny it's really the help on moodle because your courses and. customization of moodle. I always think of the joke about Microsoft. does not allow me to sit in one joke about like. Let me try and relate it and you can tell me whether it's junk or not. So someone was flying around Seattle and they've gotten some bad weather. Because this person is flying a helicopter. And some of his equipment was malfunction. So he was able to see somebody in a building in an office complex. and The pilot asked person. Where Am I. said you're in a helicopter above. Seattle. And this, the pilot understood exactly where he was and read the necessary despotism landed safely. Because the hell, the hell, he got Microsoft was correct, but not useful so he knew that he was at the Microsoft, in order to find his way back to the important. Okay, who thinks that was funny. who thinks that's qualified as a joke. Not a lot of straight faces here. Anyway, so the variation with the helicopter was told by somebody who was an early employee at Microsoft, so I thought I could do that. So anyway, the reason I brought it up is because I think that help in moodle is a bit like that. Because if I click on format. format. html format, the html editor is available. And just sort of saying what's what. Which doesn't give a lot of extra. context. To help resolve the issue. Okay. Well, for a dig myself into a deeper hole. My stellar job telling you that sounds. No thanks. I appreciate it. um let's let's do a breakout room so. Let me go back so I found. let's create the page here let's finish this thought. nice thing about working so that we can edit this. easily so. not have to be stuck with siri. Thanks holding next okay so anyway under administration. I wrote about the most every. request to rename yourself to ourselves, the format of maybe like to be called in your email ID in parentheses. So just the note also with the zoom client being up to date and there's an article a support article about being able to self select your breakout room. So i'm going to do another breakout room put in the chat first. Okay, a couple of things there that might. engage you in some discussion. which I should return hit return, so you can read them as well, what makes good is not what makes design good or for what is the difference between user experience and usability. Okay. So i'm going to start a breakout room. Question Professor sure.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Your questions is what makes design good so you're talking about the interface designs only or all kinds of.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay i'll chain. well. I think it extends broadly to design, but. Okay, so. slept choosing your own breakout rooms is being tied to the version of the client you're using maybe it wasn't always available. So. We. Okay, here we go i'm going to create the rooms and then you can. rooms, based on. breakout groups. Join oh. Okay, they still 17 people on the sign. So, can you please try and join the breakout group. The breakout room that's the same numbers your breakout group. down to 11. So rob.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Give me just one second.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, our pre. You have a. Very good group.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah i'm trying to search but. i'm not I don't have any link to get inside room. Okay, we are to search it where to find that particular link.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;well.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;it's it's breakout discussion.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;You know it's not very good discussion there should. You should be able to join a room. and Let me, let me with my shared screen need look at. So this gives you a list of the breakout groups.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah I saw that. Then next.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so you're in you're in. Your room two. Oh. Are you. Now pardon me one harpreet.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;she's had with God. I am in breakout Fo.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, okay.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;So then, what Next, I have to do from here.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;All right, I would say. Can you are you running zoom software in your computer lab.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yeah i'm running zoom.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;You do it. Go. check for updates on zoom.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;say you need to update. Murphy. Wilson. you hear me. So Wilson to gel. Sorry, oh badly i'm not sure. Can you let me know how you're doing with joining a breakout room. you're in chat or voice.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;I joined the breakout room, but there was not good at, playing on. So I just left a breakout room.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, but you had no problem joining the room you to which you sign.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;No problem.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Well, why don't you go back there and say let's discuss the questions we have blood makes design interface design good or poor and.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Go. into break. The contract, where the meeting. or so, then we have left the breakout room. Is any.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Time.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Well we'll wrap it up soon, but I just wanted to make sure that people. got a chance to get into the breakout room. To as a couple more minutes, no.
    </li><li><strong>S08:</strong>&nbsp;Okay okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay yeah. 321. Okay. how'd that go.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;is a pretty well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, very good.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;We we we kind of stuck up like do we just need to discuss it in the breakout room like verbally or do we need to go back into the breakout discussion and then add our comments in there, like it was a kind of confusion altogether, but we did get a. Say kind of good answers to those questions. Okay unsure of where to place it at this point.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. So we can talk about them now.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Professor when should we actually submit the discussion in the your courses and I was actually confused about that. And when I know, in the discussion we should discuss the whole scenario, but after the when the breakout room is over, then we should submit it right.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. I think there's. going to make it a. requirement to do certain things in certain ways for the discussion. So I think it's it's nice to record. Your group discussion so. If you can save the chat from your discussion right in the breakout room. That might be a good way to do it. So this is. Where we're experimenting. So. Before you. In future, what while you're having discussions, and you have the chat when the breakout room active. try and save it and then just copy and paste to them sessions. Or you.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Could.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;just give a summary email instead of writing everything, word for word. couple answers would be okay, you know just serve our group thought this. And so the breakout room discussions are just for your breakout groups. Or the breakout group discussions I just read a breakout groups. If you think you have some good answers. You can put them in the wiki. So everybody can see them.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;So I can I start to talk about you know these questions.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;sure.
    </li><li><strong>S11:</strong>&nbsp;yeah yeah but we were talking about this topic seen our meeting was about you know you have to allocate some user interfaces usability from to prospective like heuristic evaluation and cognitive work through if we give it to our like primary users, we can. See the feedback they how they can use the system, and we can measure the usability of our search interface in this way. For cognitive one too, but from a heuristic evaluation perspective if we want to examine the usability of our search interface, we can give it to some professionals and see the valuation about the our search interface you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah so. So heuristic evaluation is a particular kind of user interface evaluation. So we don't necessarily need to have the interface in front of a working in front of us. To make observations about. The placement of things and the way things are organized in the interface. So we'll talk about those different kinds of evaluations. So if we have somebody who's not well versed in the theory of interaction design and human computer communications. They still might be interested in searching doing some search. Using your interface, and so. Their experience of using the software. is valuable. If you want, if you want. novice. or non technical people to. Make use of your software. that's fair it's very good to talk to them. talk to your target group of users early on in the process so you're not. going too far down design paths. That aren't going to work for the people you want to use your software. So that's there's another kind of evaluation. and To be valuable. evaluation. doesn't have to be very formal either. mean there might be some things that are just. me we have. Such a fundamental assumption we're making about software and that fundamental assumption may be wrong, and so it's just the. You know. talking to other people, regardless of what kind of way we're doing it in. Gross of which were doing it. is valuable. So.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;sort of professing overtime three minutes.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, I know I was 19. And then I was 23 so I apologize for the extra three minutes.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;No it's fine I just just you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;know, thank you very much, and then trying to be mindful. Of the time and. serve getting things going in this new environment so. So the fact the way that we're interacting with technology in this remotely presented. course the Semester is also talking about the things very much talking about course material. So. just keep that front and Center and have a good rest of your Wednesday and we'll see you on Friday.
    </li><li><strong>S06:</strong>&nbsp;Friday.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;i'll stick around a bit if anyone has questions so. we'll see you then take care. bye. sure.
    </li><li><strong>S09:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. Everyone from the group members, like all of them are expected to. record a group discussion into the breakout rooms like take our transcripts of. The whole discussion and then post it into the breakout room or any one assigned person will need to do that. Or is it gonna be repetitive information over and over and over in the same discussion forum for that breakout room.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I. Say it's valuable for you, for you. To record. what's going on in the discussion. So the discussion forum is there to. give you a place. So keep a record of your discussions over the Semester. That might be useful.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Bristol can we do it like and why discussion, we can just born was one person, on behalf of the group.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah okay.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Because we will have a bit of a discussion so it's okay to we can just shuffle it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah. Okay. Fine.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;And what out or what should we put in the week is discussion because they are really there is one breakout discussion and there is one week is discussing. And we get response sorry.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah we look at what's there for the wiki and.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;What we have done in the meeting one there was something like that.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I I did that. Just as an example.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;i'm showing the interface of how to add a page to the wiki. You still see that, am I still sharing my screen.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;yo yo yo brother certainly don't see.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So wikis are nice and because we can. love to have the format clearly defined before him. So. This works that's great and if. say something like. So I think this is going to work. Like the link to the other page. yeah so we. can add to existing pages. So the structure can. Be fluid. work out the best way to do that.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Okay.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;So should we also submit we get response. Like is this only for you.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;No, no it's, not just for me. I will. If you have something you'd want to share with the class.
    </li><li><strong>S10:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, and you discuss from that, I think, interesting okay. yeah look at the person.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;man.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;I was wondering about the assignments and stuff Nikki was a little information about what the assignments, are all about, and when we can expect them. And what kind of material, we should like go through for the assignments and stuff because right now I know it's the first week of the Semester, but still I want to. Go to it well, we have time because you know every other subject, who have the same thing that same time so because, right now, we have some free time we can just go to the name. So.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;The material.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Sorry.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;The materials and stuff like what we need to study for that assignment stuff and what we expect.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;we'll talk about it.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;In the next day or two. I guess we're not having a meeting Monday so. we'll talk about it on Friday, the third detail but there's two individual assignments. So for one of them going to get you set up as teachers in your courses experimental course. and give you something to do and then. To to explore. do that and reflect on the process of doing that of completing that the task and giving you. And then the second one for Grad students it's going to be more. Present summarizing a recent research paper. related to human computer interaction and for undergraduates it's going to be. An opportunity choose a topic that's of interest and do some work about it. And then, for the project we're going to. Most everybody we're going to do a project that's done in a group, you can pick your own group. Say of about four people. think that works out right now we have 52 students, so that works in. To be. 13 groups. So the idea is. To take. Take an existing interface on the web and. look for opportunities for redesign.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;And then.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;say you know this is. Here, some problems with it there's some opportunities were redesigned might be helpful. So then go through the process of looking at these issues and then thinking about. How to design. interface in ways that. address those issues. Well, so we'll do some testing and we'll do some. So look with low fidelity and higher fidelity prototypes. Okay, so it's going to go through the process. So and we'll. be having discussions about theory throughout the Semester that support you in completing the project assignments.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, thank you that's all I know.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Does that sound good for today.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely. I don't want to say perfect again so you. Just don't wanna like.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;I didn't mean to you to. avoid the word with it, I just.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;Know i'll use it, maybe on like after one lecture i'll give it a gap.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Fair enough.
    </li><li><strong>S05:</strong>&nbsp;yeah.
