<ul><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good afternoon, everyone.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Happy Friday.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you. Oh, I see a new viewing option presume it says immersive I have try that. what's interesting. So I could. Do an art gallery which seats 525. boardroom that seat six. fireside chat that seems to. A CAFE that seeks to. classroom that seems 25. The kitchen that seeks to. or learning pods. Which seats. So we don't have enough. spots to do this with our class, you would even work so. Maybe for office hours we can. Have a fireside chat. or. Sit sit in the kitchen. or CAFE. So I mentioned about. office hours any thoughts about. Whether those times were good everyone see the discussion about it. did anyone see a.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;yard box for me.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So I can be flexible.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;as well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;When I want to know that i'm available to answer questions. So let me share. Okay that's better. So i'm just describing this. My interaction here, because you can see, this sounds like two strings. On my laptop and my Dell monitor. So I specifically put the zoom window. onto the second screen. And then, when I shared the screen. The. gallery condensed into. A call on that one beside my shared screen. So now i'm drag it back to the second monitor it's still a column. now going to try and drag it out. into this rectangle more of a square shape. Now, instead of the column it's a row. So. That a feeling this. Okay, I got my gallery back. Okay, so I think that maybe these didn't get. These links from in the outline Arc didn't get you. Until just recently. Because they didn't. publish them. So I giants for that. So was asked. From last day anyone look, many of you get a chance to look at the David Kelly video. So i'm typing away and I realized like. brush the trackpad on my eye on my macbook. Last input focus in the chat window. familiar with the term input focus. Okay, so chocolate. You want it. You want to use them. And then widget. Say like in chat. So you have to click on the chat messaging window. In order. So if you click on it, then you associate. keystrokes from the keyboard. With that. Is the interface. So if we don't click on something. Then it's. not miss the. Results of US typing. may very well be disappointing because it just kind of go somewhere which not. attended. So the input focus. keeping track of that and making sure that it's clear. it's important. it's an important piece of feedback for people using software. So it's also important. For people to. focus their attention. On the part of the display the part of the interface that's going to give them feedback about. Their comments. And their inputs part. Has anyone ever experienced. web page. We think you've done everything correctly and nothing happens. you expect to go to the next page. Nothing seems to happen. you're not seeing the whole. interface, you had to scroll down so you're filling a form. web form. You scroll down the page you hit submit. And then you. don't see immediately what the cause of the problem is, if you scroll up, then you see maybe read type you forgot, a field or. Something some something that. So I have to go track down the message. So, like we need to keep track of the input focus. It would be nice if the system. And some concept of where. Where our attention is after clicking submit. So that. The message the error message can be displayed. Where the person is looking. So it makes sense. So i'm gonna try it. So now i'm clicking to create a ball. it's not clear. what's going on. The window in the back, is the browser has switched to the zoom website. Creating the. Shared screen.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Yes.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So i'm talking about. The issues with the interfaces with dealing. With presenting material in class. So I. know you can't see all of it. And I realized that maybe I should have Cameron here. Well, I can. record some of these things. With the zoom interface. i'll try and. make it more clear and in the summary. anyway. The whole interface. So created this. So you can have the all open for. Say doing minutes and. 40 seconds left. Okay, so let's share the results. So. 30 640 people. In. In our zoom meeting replied. 10 of you 10 of those are responded said yes, the solid video. 26 said no.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;No.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Attendance and meetings. Attendance for today. Okay, so. When you see the assignments page.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, just took a look.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so I think that's being shared now. So this is on the website on my website, not the links to. sorted out. today. within your course itself. and submit button and so forth. So. This is individual assignment it's doing. Two weeks allows. So you've made it even better teacher in your courses, so let me. This link should work. Okay. So. here's the courses. i've created for you to experiment with its teachers. So I want you to think like a teacher and. Think about a lesson plan. With activity like students classes. so on. see that there are this choice of an activity or resource. So I want you to. And one of each. one. To. Make it so that. The activity. lousy to assign a grade. Then the resource. The zacks access is restricted, based on the greater on the activity. So then you're going. To think about how the interface support soon doing these things. So. First of all, think of think of how. These two pieces can be made. can be used to further. The goal of teaching something. between some of your students, so not. not going to get. The appears in the clouds to. experiment with result what i'm looking. To do is. Have. A plan in mind to describe. The plan in mind. For using an activity in your courses activity new our courses resource. To keep something that we're going to focus on. The teacher. Creating the. content in your courses not. Still students are. performing with the content that makes sense it doesn't make sense, we can discuss it further. So, think about how you want to set up. Your Watson. And then. So, in your courses interface Kramer section, we talked about that. More. A bit before noon on Wednesday. You can talk a bit more of a. supplier. So. So add years to your section in your for your courses course. When I couldn't see the deal assigned great and then one resource that's going to be available once students have completed the active. The crowd productivity your courses. now going to. use an empathy map to think about what's going on. For the user for the teacher who using new our courses to create. This material. Final part. is to describe opportunities you've seen with the benefits to make it. more usable of all. To create a better. To encourage a better user experience with the interface your courses. So to marks each for disperse describing the activity and then completing the activity. An activity is used in two different senses there. Explanations or edits are suggested edits are welcome. If required. Then, creating an empathy map and then looking at opportunities to read and sign, those are both remarks each. So the way. The grading. So visit. maximum value. REACH criteria criteria on. So the activity described and then. So. There are can and level senior. Actually, nine or. So there's three exemplary so can be exemplary plus. So, like use your phone marks, so in this case you get to that correct. If it's exemplary without modifier then it's. You get nine tenths of the mark. So that would be 1.8. let's choose that. Sufficient. Almost. Mostly done as requested. Just a few issues submission plus would be. What I didn't see, so we have. kind of 10. Nine out of 10 eight out of 10 with seven out of 10 seven. six. For me. Why. So if you. submitted something. You get one out of 10 anyway. One out of 10.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;For 2.2.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;then get. The marks and then get a count calculated grades, that the selection of comments. integrate of 6.5. Self instructions on followed. Give. You direction of 10% of your grade. If you submit late within within 48 hours it's a 10% deduction. And if you submit. More than 4048 hours late. what's. 50% of production. and If there's been some academic dishonesty. that's good as Europe. chat lately. So the question why we have. experiment your courses available to you as teachers so first. thing there's. This assignment and secondly. gives you an opportunity to explore. This, as we talked about things being semester. That make sense. Okay, a couple yeses. So I mentioned, drawing on the whiteboard here. i'm not going to attempt them.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;Before you. Start drying could you close sharing your screen, so we could focus on your camera.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;Please okay.Okay, thank you.well.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Good size for you to see.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;works, yes.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, so here's a diagram I promise so. we're gonna be user being here. fancy. laptop. So there was. There that goes this way, so the. User starts. With an idea of what they want to accomplish. And you know what commands they need to execute. On the computer it's something. This is about execution here. So this is the off of execution and then. Compare that music. So, then, we have. valuation. Doing for legibility here i'll take a picture of this and. post.
    </li><li><strong>S01:</strong>&nbsp;It.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;On the website as well. So you can think about this is another way of. Another label name of the interaction. So we think about the commands that were created for the interface. that's the interaction from user to the computer. Then we also need to define. What information is displayed.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;So we have.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Information design affecting. The feedback that we want the user to get to help them with the right there cash. So we start here with the goal. let's. see a collection of. pixels turned on. See what's. that's what shows up on the screen and then. This is. So we interpret the feedback, so we get a sense of what the current state of the interfaces. So make sense.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;yep.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;So. start out. By issuing commands my first look at the screen and say what do I need to do what's the current state of the system. and How can I reach achieve my goal, starting at this point. and say Okay, I need to do. X, Y and zed. So I do that. And then. I get feedback from the system. which I interpret. To give me an understanding of what state, the system is in. and present and then I can say well that's what I expected. So. After X, Y and zed I need to do a B and C. do that. And system status looks to be what I expected so that I can finish with PQ and our.
    </li><li><strong>???:</strong>&nbsp;And then.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;When i'm done. So, if this goes as well as described. How bigger the Gulf of execution and evaluation. Because the Gulf. We can be infinitesimally small or. Very large as well. So, in the case i've described is that are the gulf's smaller large. You ready.
    </li><li><strong>S02:</strong>&nbsp;For your exam well I think it's pretty much. Once again, we give a lot of like X, Y zed and ABC because the user. Already understand, for the first time Okay, I have done excited and the expected outcome is there, but if he didn't understand that offer giving X, Y zed Come on, and he said that this is not the outcome, then the Gulf of evolution would be bigger and we want to minimize that may be.
    </li><li><strong>DHH:</strong>&nbsp;Great So yes, small just, for example with small. When we can imagine examples where the goal, Sir large, so you look at the screen like in the case of the Web form that doesn't do anything. appears to not be doing anything. What. what's happening here might. So, then, we through with our experience. In our adaptability, then we can. Try some other things like. Looking elsewhere in the page for error messages and so on, but those. shouldn't rely on the. adaptability of people, the flexibility of people wonder designing interfaces. that's. that's good a big shortcut. not going to get us where we're going to go in general. So i've talked for 40 minutes extra. on a Friday afternoon I apologize for that. So is this helpful for me to draw things and talk about them on the whiteboard. You can think about that. So you see, see the assignment description, will have a discussion forum. For that assignment. opened up, I have to turn on some links, I guess. make them visible to you, so we can have a discussion about that so have a look. At David kelly's video and then also the video from Doug deets. he's mentioned in the David Kelly video. So then we'll talk about empathy mapping on Monday. Thank you very much for today. and have a great weekend.
