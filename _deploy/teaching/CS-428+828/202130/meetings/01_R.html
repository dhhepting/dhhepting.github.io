    </h5>


<ul><li>I would like to know more about the content that we are going to learn and discuss in these upcoming lectures. Because I it will be so interesting to learn how human and computer communicate.

Along with this I would also like to learn ab out the difficulties and problems that occur with Human Computer Communication, and the practicality of the developer mindfully integrating this.
    </li><li>about the course outline i.e. the topics related to designing and interaction .
    </li><li>today&#039;s meeting was really interesting as I was eager to know how the lecture will work in terms of attendance, assignments, projects, etc. the concept of submitting the lecture&#039;s response is quit new for me but I am very excited to submit the responses according to the lectures. lectures
