        : talk about creating groups through the project and having some time to work on that. Okay. Thank you for today. See you on Thursday. And I have an office hour, two to three today. Okay. Anything before we go? Okay. Looks like a nice day. I'm not sure if it was going to be as nice as yesterday, but sun shining anyway. So I hope you have a good day. And stay well and we'll see you next time.
