audio:
- desc: morning. how's everyone doing today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good thanks for asking.
  persid: S01
- desc: So let me go over a couple of things with a. With a course here. Okay, so.
    It doesn't show any activity for me in the recent activity but. attend some things
    so. i've arranged things like this, based on our discussion. So here's a link.
    today's meeting, although I realized that I didn't fill in all the details of
    are going to talk about because research. Continuing interfaces. and the impact
    they have. Anyway, here's here's the came up with with. It support for. Raw audio
    transcription. The video system in your course is called culture, and so, when
    I upload the audio files. To counter are due to be me on your courses, then it
    generates its own transcripts transcript audio transcripts so. If you click on
    captions. So by default it's off and i'm not sure what options, there are to turn
    them on. If you want to see the captions as you listen to the audio. Wait to.
    See you can also see the condensed version of the transcript so the time codes
    here. You have a sketch. read out of. everything that was said so you can search
    for it. spot on the video and the audio file. anyway. So there's a transcript
    is the culture of transcript. And then. The txt file is the chat transcript that
    you open another window. So you can all see. Saying good morning and then. The
    chat transcript from zoom. And here's the audio transcript from the zoom. So this
    is actually is a web tracks custom html standard for doing closed caption. that's
    useful. So you can let me know how that goes, and you can give me some feedback
    or suggestions about it as well. Okay. Any feelings about that setup. i'm trying
    I think i'm leaving this page I don't seem to go anywhere. Okay, so. attendance.
    today. Any questions or concerns about. Your courses set up. So if. An issue comes
    up, you can post them here. Okay, so. you're having problems with the browser.
    Maybe. Well, we can talk about that in just one of these discussions. Know try
    and find.
  persid: DHH
- desc: My headphone microphone went off let's see the second.
  persid: S02
- desc: Here we are not, but so let's have a discussion if people have discussions
    about the browser issues. Then. can go from there, and I can follow up with it
    service it support. there's one of these two different voices that I have. As
    well and sound like i'm on the international space station that's what I was told
    once when I had the. minutes talking through my headphones.
  persid: DHH
- desc: anyway.
  persid: S02
- desc: hear me mention one thing about. editing html. In your individual student
    blog area. You can get an editor. html. And I just want to point out that this
    first one. gives you more options in the editor So if you want to create a hyperlink
    or without writing html you can do this link. You can create a an ordered list
    and non ordered list and different. Different types of. Adding. All the talent.
    add an image video, and this is the counter. media. Managing files. You can like
    to file. If you want to look at the code and an html you can click on. This one
    here. So it doesn't always nicely space things, so the code itself can be hard
    to read. And this one gives you full screen view. Which is the SAVE button, so
    if you're doing stuff. click to regular screen view and then save changes. And
    if you'd like more information about that, let me know if you have more questions
    about the editor let me know okay. OK, so the Those are the two interface videos
    any thoughts about. The main ideas there, the one with don Norman. About happiness
    and then also the one with David Kelly about creative thinking.
  persid: DHH
- desc: interesting.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. So. Any thoughts about what kind of responsibilities, you might have.
    in designing interfaces. Let me say that away, is there a. If we're going to look
    out for the common for the public good. Do we. Do we need to. make people happy,
    do we need to take care of certain things in the interface.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I really liked don Norman kind of talked about the different types of. I guess
    how the brain interprets how to use something. Like visceral behavioral reflective
    I thought that was really fascinating, especially because you know a lot of the
    time when you're using something you don't think about why. you're enjoying using
    it, or why you're not enjoying using it. For me, I think intuition, is a really
    big thing like, if I can look at something and know how to use it that's really
    important to me, I don't think a lot of people like to read you know, a manual
    just to be able to use something. And that doesn't make it very accessible So
    for me, I think intuitive nervous. is a really big part of it, and I mean the
    bad doors video kind of exemplifies that. um.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay, any other anyone else, want to contribute anything thank.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Feedback the point about feedback was very important as well, when you. take
    some action you would want to have some feedback to let you know that you are
    actually successful so whenever you design, something I think it's very important
    to build that feedback into it.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah okay. So what about intuition so. The feedback that's one. Back in 1994
    I think don Norman. Class we Jakob Nielsen. capitalists have 10 years to X Ray
    interfaces. And the stand, they stood the test of time. well. So. You mentioned
    intuition Dane. I want to talk a little bit more about that. So how do we, how
    do we know if something's intuitive. Or how do we get intuition about something.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I mean, personally, I feel like intuitive ness is really like. You know what
    is your first like, if you look at something and, what is your first. I guess
    idea of how to use it. And so, like i've heard that the way that they test this
    stuff is to like you know they'll make software and then there'll be like hey
    you try this and see what they do. And if they immediately know how to use it,
    that means your software is very intuitive means you can look at it and know what
    to do, however, if people are like. clicking on the wrong stuff. Like, for example,
    I personally hate discord a lot of people really like it, I use it, I think it's
    one of the most intuitive pieces of software out there. So.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it's also worth mentioning that intuition can depend very much on
    a person's cultural background and, like their neurological makeup that you know
    there's people who have certain. Learning disorders or conditions that process
    information in a very different way, and so the cues that might make a human interface
    really intuitive to an average person may not be intuitive to them, so it very
    much depends on who's looking at the thing as well.
  persid: S05
- desc: We have to. Talk about designing something Designing an interface. For a particular
    group of people. it's not general generally it's not one size fits all.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think I think that link that you left to on like the the veil of ignorance,
    is also really helpful because it's like you know if I didn't know how to do this.
    How what would be the best way to make it obvious to do this, so I think you kind
    of do have to implement a sort of veil of ignorance when you're designing a product
    as well.
  persid: S03
- desc: As interesting. We do that in a different way. We can talk about having empathy
    for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I totally I totally know it's like an actually like an ethical you know
    standpoint but I mean you could also. apply it in lots of different ways, I think.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. As designers. In this is why we have London do some testing of interfaces.
    So that we don't have we don't rely on our own sense of. Just complete makes complete
    sense to me so therefore everyone will get it. And so, when we were testing as
    it responsibilities designers and just to. put something randomly together and
    then throw it out to the users and see whether they like it or they can understand
    how to deal with it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Now.
  persid: S02
- desc: There are some. techniques that we can use to. And then. The interface heuristics
    are a good starting point. So make our best effort. And then get feedback and
    then improve it. go further vote intuition so. We don't come. We don't have experience.
    turned off. I was a kind of a heavy handed approach can you see that, but I did.
    Participants window up and I said you'd all. I was waiting for the. box to have
    a ring around it. So they knew to see which one was active. didn't work as expected
    so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: anyway.
  persid: S02
- desc: So, even though i've muted everyone you're free to unmute yourselves when
    you have something to say.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: anyway. So we don't come with an understanding of interfaces necessarily built
    in so intuition comes from experience. So might be from another experience with
    software, I might be other experience with.
  persid: DHH
- desc: With.
  persid: S02
- desc: Doing tasks. So we transfer that. Experience to the interface, and if it's
    a good fit if we have a good idea of how it should work, then we can. make a smooth
    transition and then. we're just focused on the task we want to accomplish instead
    of having to fiddle with the interface, and so that way we can think of. interfaces
    being satisfying. It takes more work to figure it out, then. Maybe it's only comprehensible.
    So we have to go back and figure out. It might be logically make like make sense,
    logically, how to access functions. We certainly derivative work console is comprehensible,
    we like to say that. And then, if it's. If we know the interface can accomplish
    something but there's no clear path. From. From our our goal to the desired action.
    And we know the softer permits it then. You can say that maybe it's just an effective,
    so that we can do something. We don't get any help.
  persid: DHH
- desc: accessibility. This is an example, I used to work at SAS tell his technical
    support and there was a lot of customers that were to call in for a Max TV issues
    and they were always a lot older. And I think it's really important that when
    we're talking about accessibility to know who your target audiences when creating
    some sort of technology. For example, if you have really old people they're not
    as experienced with technology, you probably shouldn't have a really complicated
    setup if that makes sense.
  persid: S06
- desc: Yes, it does really old like 56 right. Not until April is why be 56 but anyway,
    so I can still talk about people coming 56 and really well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S06
- desc: No that's true, I mean even. I get frustrated now because I have these. I
    can't even think. I have my glasses are are not single focus there. what's the
    word they used to be bifocal or trifle but now it's some.
  persid: DHH
- desc: glasses.
  persid: S02
- desc: I guess that's the one yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah well. I think that that works yeah. So I have to look through different
    parts of the glasses to see for different purposes, and that makes looking at
    the screen. And and zoom likes very. tiny fonts. And that makes it more difficult
    for me and. And it's just so much harder to. I would like to be able to figure
    out how to get the. text to build bigger without having to go through five screens
    of settings and read some documentation about it. But I can still help right.
    anyway. And not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Enough of that but.
  persid: S07
- desc: certainly true that you need to understand the audience. And if you're similar
    to designing for senior citizens, you need to talk to the community of senior
    citizens who have. Who are going, who are going to be using your software or your
    product your technology it's not enough to say i'm doing is going to do this for
    senior citizens, but because they don't know any senior citizens i'm going to
    talk to you undergraduate computer science students.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, making sure that you're including your target demographics when you're
    actually doing the designing is important yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: So that's about. So emphasizing the. You know, taking on. Being able to identify
    with the feelings and. ideas of that the other group or the other people. So empathy
    is a much better approach, and you can also have sympathy, I suppose. for users
    and thank all go. So the idea, there might be. Oh. Poor so and so he has to do
    all this stuff and i'm going to. benevolent benevolently creates some soccer for
    him or her. crew for them. Because kind of sympathy and then. that's not that's
    not as good as emphasizing. And still versus maybe having an APP. Having apathy
    towards the user well okay here, I met. The functional requirements. So i'm done.
    I don't care what. You see, the user is unhappy or unable to use it. Because by
    the letter of the law. I followed the requirements as laid out. And so there we
    go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Let me see.
  persid: S02
- desc: New share. Christian. Technology, I have a plan. Something I want to accomplish.
    I started with a goal and then turn it into a plan, and then I. I convert the
    plan into commands. at the interface. So, then, the state of the computer after
    I execute those commands. And I get pixels and then I interpret them. Do the state
    is the interface of the system. After. My last.
  persid: DHH
- desc: command.
  persid: S02
- desc: I mean we might start out by interpreting we might look at the computer and
    decide what state it's then and then. And then execute then decide which commands
    to put into the system. But if it's easy to understand the state of the computer
    and understand what commands I need to use to achieve my desired state. So we
    can maybe we love this part is execution related to execution. And at the top
    of my screen here that's right. evaluation. conceptual distance between these
    during the interface between the person and the computer. So if it ends up being
    large distance you might it. might be unusable, so that we can talk about. In
    this case. A golf to chasm to cross between the person on the computer. One way
    to make it smaller. metaphors in the interface. People aren't. familiar with online
    shopping say well it's like going to a grocery store or. going to a store we walk
    through a physical bricks and mortar store. You grab a cart or basket and you
    go through the aisles you find what you need you put them in your basket and then
    you go to the checkout. So this is the idea that. We don't have. We don't need
    to take all the all those ideas to the interface, we can use some of them to convey
    essential qualities. that are important for the user to understand, so if they
    have the idea of a cart. And so the card. Something or you can look and see what
    you have there and take things out or adjusted. And when you go to checkout and
    you have to. Have a payment method and so on. So all those steps. So we don't
    want to make it the metaphor. We don't want to invoke too much of the bricks and
    mortar store experience, because that. might create unrealistic expectations for
    the user for the person. To say well. I want to make sure I get a card that doesn't.
    It has good that rolls nicely. doesn't jam up and. I can steer. So you don't want
    to convey you don't want to carry on that much level of detail, I think. That,
    if you don't give enough detail than that. Then it may not be. enough to get them.
    focused on the tasks that they need to do. So it's not enough information well.
    Maybe they want to go to a bookstore online, but you say well it's like going
    to a grocery store. So maybe just having going to stores. isn't enough to to convey.
    The things you need to be concerned about. That make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So we want to make it analogous to like the key points of the experience without
    fully stimulating them and.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah. I would say so. Because, if you have too much detail, then people like.
    can get some mind focus on. Things that aren't helpful for them to understand
    how to use the software. So. I was gonna ask you discovered, so why do you see
    it as. The world's worst.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Worst interface it's just. To me so like the first thing that happened when
    I got discord and this was a couple years ago, is it was like Oh, you have to
    start a server. And I was like what what is that I don't know I don't know what
    to do with that Okay, and so I started to server and then I didn't really know
    like. How to add friends or what servers were or when I finally did end up making
    my own servers I was like, how do you make these like what's important, what do
    I need. It to me it is really designed for people who. already have an idea of
    what this is supposed to look like when it's finished. And for me, I was just
    like I don't even know what the capabilities are I don't know what I can do, I
    don't know. And so it involve me doing a lot of researching and I was like God,
    I just wanted, you know, like, I remember back in the day with msn you just bit,
    but it but it's talking to a person right like it wasn't. wasn't hard, but this
    to me was like so different and, obviously, it has a lot more usability. In a
    lot of different ways than msn would but you know. For what most people are using
    it for it's not very intuitive, in my opinion.
  persid: S03
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: S02
- desc: I would say.
  persid: S08
- desc: I was gonna add to that you.
  persid: S09
- desc: Can you raise hands, please, so I can. Show on you. Austin.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, so I think that with discord I think compared to some of the irc clients
    that came before it like stuff like team speak. discord is very easy to use and
    it's really good but that's specifically for people who have used those previous
    irc clients, I think, for people who have never used something like that, before.
    it's super unintrusive but it's definitely way better than stuff that came before
    it like I don't know if anyone else has used to speak but it's terrible compared
    to the discussion.
  persid: S09
- desc: No, I haven't used it. anyone else. One person up or there's still me notice
    it for me for. anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I was saying, for most people like who use this call, just to communicate
    with others like without adding bots or anything it's pretty much I find it pretty
    much similar to just creating like a Facebook group or like a messenger group
    right, you went to add friends like you just search.
  persid: S08
- desc: yeah okay. So does that help if they say well it's like a Facebook group.
    So what's, the question is what's a good metaphor for discord I guess. So, nobody
    else can I get everybody wants to speak.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I mean, I think that's what I find so difficult about it is that I don't really
    know what to liken it to because when I initially signed up for it, I was like
    Oh, it must be kind of like msn or something like that. And then I was like no
    it's not and I don't know how to use this thing mm hmm.
  persid: S03
- desc: Alex.
  persid: S02
- desc: Well, just to put this point out there is, I have a lot of experience with
    not knowing what to do, and a lot of sense, and I will admit discourage the pain,
    but like. The problem with interfaces is that you can't assume another person
    knows how to use them, because if we do that, that anyone that doesn't know work
    is they can't do anything. And to kind of well i'm like i'm we if you use an interface
    and it's horrible enough times you'll eventually go now this isn't that bad because
    you use enough time you know to navigate it, you know learn the tricks of moving
    it. But at the end of the day it doesn't make you a good interface it just means
    you're used to the pain of using it.
  persid: S10
- desc: Right. And people are very good at. Adopt adapting to. interfaces so. I mean
    that's that's often a situation, you know that comes up that. People. Are because
    people can adapt, then the onus is on them to adapt instead of the onus on the
    designer to. design. helpful and. and good software David you had a hand.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh yeah I just want to add this, I think this is a really interesting case
    because, even though it has this really kind of crappy interface. For some reason
    everyone's still using it, so I think it shows that there's this balance between
    utility and ease of use and if it's useful enough. People are still going to use
    it like if you've seen, like, for example, Skype or as Dan said, Ms and stuff
    like that it adds so much more utility compared to those platforms that people
    are still using it, and I think I think it's really interesting to note that.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah that's right. Oh what's his name. Terry winograd. He talks about the
    threshold of indignation. So what point do you throw the TV or the window, or
    you know sort of easier, well, we don't know if he's using the word I wanna throw
    any new terms that you young people. Sorry that's that's the old person talking
    they're. realizing all my standard references are. outdated now. But. yeah absolutely
    that's a problem or that's that's an issue it's like. If I want to do this. What
    a combination, so I have to make. have to bite the bullet and. and go from there,
    so Michael first and then brandon.
  persid: DHH
- desc: so well, one thing that comes to mind for me about discord is this sort of
    trade off between the simplicity of the interface, and the simplicity of using
    it. I think a lot of the challenge with it comes from the fact that it has to
    be this relatively simple interface, but it has this whole complicated set of
    commands and things you can do with it, but. there's too many of them, for there
    to be a button on the interface that clearly explains what each one does. it's
    I guess it's not dissimilar to c++ or javascript that way and that those are both
    very simple you just type characters into a field of text but because it's that
    simple there's a lot more onus on the user to master it and to understand what's
    going on under the hood.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay that's that's true enough. Because that's awesome that might be also
    be a little bit of a cop out. in the sense that. You know we're not expecting
    enough of programmers. to design. To be thoughtful and design the interface.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That would help people.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay brandon. Thanks. i'm sorry. Can you turn up. your microphone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think.
  persid: S02
- desc: I can hear you say that. Okay stranded thanks for typing that in so can the
    user interface be to user friendly isn't going to be so simple that users, find
    it insulting in a way. So that's a possibility. mean. If there's a lot of command
    if there are a lot of commands available. And the interface only pre approved
    presents a few of them. And it doesn't let the user dude as much as they would
    like to do. Then, that could be an issue. So we can talk about user experience
    and usability. there's another distinction to make. So user experience might be
    good, very. helpful but there. they're not getting. What what the what's provided
    is a is a good experience but it's not. letting them do what they need to do with
    the interface. So that can be an issue, so I also heard this thing. You know,
    a tricycle is easy to ride for right off the BAT you can do you can go much further
    and faster at the bicycle.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You know so.
  persid: S02
- desc: The icicle might be a bit more. A good entry level. interface. But you're
    not gonna be able to go as far as you can as fast as you can the bicycle. That
    make sense. Okay Dania your hand up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, I think people are bringing up some good points in the chat about like
    also how you know, sometimes a product might initially start out with a particular
    target audience, but then due to say pandemic. That target audience become like
    the scope becomes larger and then all of a sudden, a bunch of people that weren't
    expected to be using the software are using it now. So, I guess, my question is
    is if that happens. say you have you know a thing like discord I mean there, it
    was for a very specific use, I think, at one time. But now a lot of people are
    using it to foster communities or teach classes, or whatever, so, is it the responsibility
    of discord to adapt to that or is the responsibility of the users to understand
    the initial I guess intent of the product.
  persid: S03
- desc: Oh that's a good question. So if I write the software and you don't want to
    use it, the way that I intended it or you, you find a new ways to use it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: mean.
  persid: S02
- desc: So we can talk about something like Meta design. You know, so that we designed,
    something that that it can take on unintended applications. Or, so that we can
    design it for. For people doing new things with it. But I would say that it's
    not. it's not my responsibility to. Make software that's going to. do everything
    that. That you that you see that should be doing. With the software. I mean that's
    why it's nice if we have something like an open source platform, or if I read
    some open source software, then you can then fork it and make your own version
    of it. You can use github to manage it talking about things that are designed
    well for users. anyone's ever experienced get up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The easiest thing in the software thing that now forget the question. I think
    it depends on what suffer or interface that's been news for example discord the
    prime purpose of discord is communicating I. don't know what the original purpose
    of it was, but its primary purpose its core purpose is communicating, which means
    that. Sure, most people use it to play video games with friends, but I use it
    to talk to people that i'm playing dungeons and dragons with. and set up other
    games people can use it for school it's it's the key putting all those is communication
    it's not hey we're gonna play video games on discord. If the design is allow that
    then returned change completely the key point of discord is communication with
    another person so like. If they need to make it better so communication can happen,
    then yes, I would say the designers it's their responsibility to make it more
    easier because of. Maybe they need to have a way, so you can click something else
    to tell you what things do better these last things and just start I started naughty
    Jerry and I just clicked around buttons now i've learned stuff and. i'm like okay
    that makes sense. So clicking on buttons but that's what I usually do like, for
    example. I think it depends on what it is kinda like. i'm you're not going to
    have. The apple store and they're going to step away for people communicate with
    each other, because people want to use it to communicate with each other. That
    would be silly that's that's not the designers purpose to meet the interface for
    the apple store so song continue to have another person it's i'm selling a product
    to you this is how you get it. If that makes sense.
