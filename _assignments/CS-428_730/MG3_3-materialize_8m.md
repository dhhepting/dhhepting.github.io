Based on your designs, test and refine.

Recall the diagram that [illustrated the article about Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) from the Nielsen Norman Group. We are now moving to the materialize phase.

The focus now shifts to testing your low-fidelity prototypes. Divide your group evenly into 2 sub-groups. Each sub-group will conduct 1 test with 1 of your 2 low-fidelity interface prototypes, so that you will have both of your low-fidelity prototypes tested.  Use UR Courses to coordinate a sub-group of a diffent project group focusing on a different aspect of UR Courses. Each sub-group should run a test and be the subjects for the other's test.

In your tests, you are asking someone to take on a role as your user and then complete the task for which you are redesigning the interface.  Explain the task and ask your participant to perform the task, without giving instructions about how to do it.  This information will be recorded in a script, that all group members will use to run their tests.  Writing and reviewing the script is a group effort. Once you start testing with your participants, do not make any changes to your script.

You may find the [downloads related to the ZipCar website test](http://sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html) useful.

During your tests, you will collect both quantitative and qualitative data and you will also make notes.

You should submit all of your raw data and submit a summary of how
it was collected: by whom, from whom, when, and where. Your group will collect data from 1 test of your Interface A and 1 test of your Interface B. Both tests will use the same script and other materials.

Provide a commentary on your data.  Did the data that you collected reveal any agreement or disagreement about your interface designs? Were the results surprising in any way?

Based on your experience with your project and your testing of your low-fidelity prototypes, create a single interface design that combines the best ideas from your two low-fidelity prototypes and any other sources.
