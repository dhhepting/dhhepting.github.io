### {{ page.title }}

In consultation with the members of your group,
select a single facet of groups within moodle (UR Courses) for which you will
identify opportunities for redesign and improvement. Use the ["Experiment with UR Courses"](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/user/index.php?id=31546t) course, where you have teacher-like access to gain experience with groups in UR Courses. Remember to choose just one use of or interface to groups: You will find groups under the Participants menu on the main course page where there are 3 choices for groups, groupings, and overview; in the settings page for Assignments; in the submissions page for Assignments; in the group members resource; in the enrolled users list, also under the Participants menu; and doubtless other places where their impact is felt. Dr. Hepting will be happy to provide stories about using groups in UR Courses. You may also check the moodle documentation and moodle forums for information. You might identify issues with consistency, efficiency, or missing functionality, to name a few.

This is the first of three parts to the project,
which mirror the 3 stages of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/" target="_blank">design thinking process</a> (as described by the Nielsen Norman Group): understand, explore, and materialize.

The understand stage, comprising empathize and define steps, is the focus of this assignment. Focus on a well-defined activity that a well-defined user is trying to perform.

1. describe: your group will describe, with sufficient detail to be relatable, an activity and a user wanting to complete that activity.
1. empathize: each member of your group will create an empathy map (1) for that activity.
1. define: together as a group, identify specific aspects of the current interface that cause problems for the users and look to examine the roots of those problems. Identify whatever user needs may be unmet.

Remember that this stage is concerned with understanding the opportunities for redesign of your selected aspect of groups within UR Courses.
Do not provide solutions or fixes now: that will come later.

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document (1 per group) on UR Courses that includes all three parts (describe, empathize, and define). Take care to demonstrate a good command of Standard English (correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation) so that your audience won't have trouble reading your work.
