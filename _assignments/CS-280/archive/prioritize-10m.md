### Description

This is a [GROUP]({{ "/teaching/groupwork.html" | relative_url }}) assignment. It cannot be done individually. With your input, 20 groups have been created, called "GW A" through "GW T". You may communicate with your group using the [Within-Group Discussion Forum](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/forum/view.php?id=908333)

Amongst your group members, decide on a particular application or website that currently exists and with which you have some familiarity through use and which may have some issues. Define a task to complete within this chosen software that illustrates one or more of these perceived issues

The goal of this assignment is to consider interaction with your chosen software from a user's perspective, by:
* describing the goal of your task, so that someone else could complete it. Focus on what the user is to accomplish and avoid details of how you think the task should be completed. For example:
"Use this website to find summer job opportunities for computer science students"
* identifying the type of user who would use the software to complete the task.
* creating an empathy map for your task (each group member will do an empathy map and then they will be combined for your group's submission).
  * [Empathy Mapping: The First Step in Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/) (includes template)
  * VIDEO: [How to Empathy Map](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/empathy-map/)
* identifying qualitative and quantitative measures that would indicate success with the task.
