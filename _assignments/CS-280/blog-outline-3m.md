### Description
{% assign curr_sem = "201910" %}
{% capture topic_url %}/teaching/CS-280/{{ curr_sem }}/topics.html{% endcapture %}

[Blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) (short for weblogs) have become an important means of expression in the information society. Personal blog posts are discrete, often informal, diary-style commentaries written by an individual.

Prepare and submit an outline (pdf, not more than 1 page) for a blog post that deals with a course-related topic that is currently, or was recently, in the news.

The list of topics also includes learning outcomes associated with the topics. If it is helpful, you may consider those learning outcomes as suggestions about how to approach your topic.

Find a personal connection to the topic. You may, for example, evaluate the (consideration of) ethical and social tradeoffs in a technical decision or analyse the role of computer professionals in a global computing issue.

Identify 2 reputable online sources to reference in support of your topic.

I have prepared [a sample]({{ "/assets/teaching/pdf/CS-280_blog-outline-sample.pdf" | relative_url }}) that you may use as a guide for preparing your submission.

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document on URcourses
