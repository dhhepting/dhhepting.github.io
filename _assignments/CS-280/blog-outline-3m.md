### Description

[Blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) (short for weblogs) have become an important means of expression in the information society. Personal blog posts are discrete, often informal, diary-style commentaries written by an individual.

Prepare and submit an outline (pdf, not more than 1 page) for a blog post that deals with a topic within a course-related [knowledge unit]({{ "/teaching/CS-280/202010" | relative_url }}) that is currently, or was recently, in the news.

The list of [knowledge units]({{ "/teaching/CS-280/202010" | relative_url }}) also includes learning outcomes associated with the topics. If it is helpful, you may consider those learning outcomes as suggestions about how to approach your topic.

Find a personal connection to the topic. You may, for example, evaluate the (consideration of) ethical and social tradeoffs in a technical decision or analyse the role of computer professionals in a global computing issue.

Identify 2 reputable online sources to reference in support of your topic.

I have prepared [a sample]({{ "/assets/teaching/pdf/CS-280_blog-outline-sample.pdf" | relative_url }}) that you may use as a guide for preparing your submission.
