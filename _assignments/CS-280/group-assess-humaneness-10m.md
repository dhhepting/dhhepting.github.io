This is a [GROUP]({{ "/teaching/groupwork.html" | relative_url }}) assignment. It cannot be done individually. Without your input, 26 groups have been created ("A" through "Z"). You may communicate with your group using the [Within-Group Discussion Forum](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/forum/view.php?id=908333). You are not required to use this forum for the whole assignment, but it may help to get you in touch with your fellow group members.

"An interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties."
