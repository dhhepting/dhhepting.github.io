This is a [GROUP]({{ "/teaching/groupwork.html" | relative_url }}) assignment. It cannot be done individually. With little input from you, 25 groups of 4 or 5 have been created. You may see who is in which group by checking this listYou may communicate with your group using the [Within-Group Discussion Forum](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/forum/view.php?id=908333). You are not required to use this forum for the whole assignment, but it may help to get you in touch with your fellow group members.

"An interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties."

As a group, you will assess the humaneness of the [Department of Computer Science website](http://cs.uregina.ca) by testing the website content as described in [this NN/group article by Hoa Loranger](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/testing-content-websites/) and [this NN/group article by Kara Pernice](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/intranet-content-strategy/) (more focused on intranets)

Look everywhere on the site, as organized by the main links down the left side navigation menu. [Search Performance data for the website has been posted on UR Courses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=1458#section-4). The main links are:
1. [What We Do](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/what_we_do.html)
1. [Future Students](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/FutureStudents/)
1. [People](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/People/)
1. [News & Events](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/News/)
1. [Undergraduate Program](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/UndergradProgram/)
1. [Graduate Program](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/GraduateProgram/)
1. [Classes & Labs](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/ClassesLabs/)
1. [Research](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/Research/)

1. [Student Assistants](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/StudentAssists/)
1. [Contact](http://www.cs.uregina.ca/contact.html)

Consider these questions:
* is the content valuable to you?
* is the content accurate, up-to-date, unique, and important?
* is the valuable content accessible to you?
* is there some way that you would like to use the content, but it is not clear how to do it?
* should the content be put elsewhere (UR Courses, Faculty of Science, and so on)?

After your group members have explored the content on the website, create a summary report organized according to the main navigation structure of the site detailed above.
You may use the headings below to organize your report either by each main link (so that there are 13 summaries) or as a whole (so that there is 1 summary with 13 parts).

### Exploration

In-depth exploration of pages on the website.

### Content Testing

Meaningful questions considered thoroughly.

### Observations

Summary of what your group found.

### Recommendations

Your ideas about how the website could be redesigned to make it more attractive and relevant and more humane to students and other visitors.

### Submission

* 1 document (pdf) -- only 1 group member needs to submit
* Target length: 1 or more pages per main navigation link
