### {{ page.title }}

An [infographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic){:target='_blank'} is a graphic visual representation of "information, data, or knowledge intended to present information quickly and clearly".

Individually, or in groups of up to 4, prepare and submit an infographic that deals with a topic that is course-related (related to course themes, course resources, and/or course discussions) timely (1 or more of your sources should be published within the last 6 months), and to which you have a personal connection.

The infographic will be submitted in the final part of the assignment. In this first part of the assignment, you will decide if you will work alone or in a group, choose a topic, indicate your sources, and provide a tentative plan for realizing your infographic. You must work with the group and the topic with which you submit this first part of the assignment for the final part of the assignment.

See [this link for a sample infographic](https://www.humanetech.com/infographic-dark-side-social-media){:target='_blank'}. The target medium for display of this infographic is the web, so design your infographic for vertical scrolling as required. For your reference, the dimensions (width x height) for the sample are 2190 × 12292. Other samples can be found [here](https://infographics.umwblogs.org/about/){:target='_blank'} and [here](https://andrealivismith.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Infographics-Syllabus.pdf){:target='_blank'}. Particular dimensions are not required but you are to create a single infographic, not a collection (of slides, for example).

You may use any of a variety of tools that you are able to access legitimately. These include, but are not limited to, [canva](https://www.canva.com/infographics/){:target='_blank'} and [piktochart](https://piktochart.com/){:target='_blank'}.

You are to create your infographic without the use of AI.

Your infographic should contain research from 3-5 excellent sources (as evaluated using the [SIFT](https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/){:target='_blank'} method). Individuals may use 3 sources, groups must use 5 sources.

When planning your infographic, you might consider (but not be limited by):

* starting with a resource that you've encountered in class
* addressing issues around Society, Ethics, and Professionalism that relate to and could be presented in one of your other CS classes
* finding a news story that illustrates issues or themes that are related to this class
* creating a guide that people can use to become aware of important course-related issues that impact their daily lives (and take some action)

### Submission

Create (and submit) a single pdf document that: 

* explains your topic, its relevance to the course, and your personal connection to it
* your list of sources and the results of the 4 moves (SIFT) for each source
* your plan for creating your infographic (including a division of labour for groups)
