### {{ page.title }}

An [infographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic){:target='_blank'} is a graphic visual representation of "information, data, or knowledge intended to present information quickly and clearly".

Individually, or in groups of up to 4, prepare and submit an infographic that deals with a topic that is course-related (related to course themes, course resources, and/or course discussions) timely (1 or more of your sources should be published within the last 6 months), and to which you have a personal connection.

The infographic will be submitted in this final part of the assignment. You must work with the group and the topic with which you submitted the first part of this assignment.

See [this link for a sample infographic](https://www.humanetech.com/infographic-dark-side-social-media){:target='_blank'}. The target medium for display of this infographic is the web, so design your infographic for vertical scrolling as required. For your reference, the dimensions (width x height) for the sample are 2190 × 12292. Other samples can be found [here](https://infographics.umwblogs.org/about/){:target='_blank'} and [here](https://andrealivismith.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Infographics-Syllabus.pdf){:target='_blank'}. Particular dimensions are not required but you are to create a single infographic, not a collection (of slides, for example).

You may use any of a variety of tools that you are able to access legitimately. These include, but are not limited to, [canva](https://www.canva.com/infographics/){:target='_blank'} and [piktochart](https://piktochart.com/){:target='_blank'}.

You are to create your infographic without the use of AI.

Your infographic should contain research from 3-5 excellent sources (as evaluated using the [SIFT](https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/){:target='_blank'} method). Individuals may use 3 sources, groups must use 5 sources. These sources are to appear on the final infographic.

### Submission

Submit your infographic as a single high-resolution image.
