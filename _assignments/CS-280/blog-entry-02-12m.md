[Blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) (short for weblogs) have become an important means of expression in the information society. Personal blog posts are discrete, often informal, diary-style commentaries written by an individual.

Prepare and submit a blog post that deals with
upholding or defending the public interest or public good and examines how to define it in a practical way. The [ACM Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) says that "the Code includes principles formulated as statements of responsibility, based on the understanding that the public good is always the primary consideration." [Defense Distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Distributed) has claimed to serve the public interest. Find an example of a claim that the public good is primary consideration and critically examine that claim.

Identify 2-4 reputable online sources to reference in support of your examination. References are to be included as hyperlinks within the post, close to the text that makes the reference.

From [Nielsen and Morkes](<https://www.nngroup.com/articles/concise-scannable-and-objective-how-to-write-for-the-web/>), here are some ways to write for the web:

##### Conventional Guidelines for Good Writing are Good

Conventional guidelines include carefully organizing the information, using words and categories that make sense to the audience, using topic sentences, limiting each paragraph to one main idea, and providing the right amount of information.

##### Text Should be [Scannable](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/layer-cake-pattern-scanning/)

Scanning can save users time. Most people are likely to approach unfamiliar Web text by trying to scan it before reading it. Elements that enhance scanning include headings, large type, bold text, highlighted text, bulleted lists, graphics, captions, and topic sentences.

##### Text Should be Concise

Consistent with users' desire to get information quickly is their preference for short text.

##### Users Like Summaries and the Inverted Pyramid Style

Web writing that presents news, summaries, and conclusions up front is useful and saves time. A news story written in the inverted pyramid style (in which news and conclusions are presented first, followed by details and background information), are well-received.

##### Hypertext is Well-Liked

"The incredible thing that's available on the Web is the ability to go deeper for more information." However, hypertext may be distracting if a site contains "too many" links.

[Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/weblog-usability-top-ten-mistakes/) also provides a list of mistakes to avoid, which include the following 3 that are most relevant to us:
* Nondescript Posting Titles: Users must be able to grasp the gist of an article by reading its headline. Avoid cute or humorous headlines that make no sense out of context.
* Links Don't Say Where They Go: Many weblog authors seem to think it's cool to write link anchors like: " some people think" or "there's more here and here ." Remember one of the basics of the Web: Life is too short to click on an unknown. Tell people where they're going and what they'll find at the other end of the link. Generally, you should provide predictive information in either the anchor text itself or the immediately surrounding words.
* Forgetting That You Write for Your Future Boss: Whenever you post anything to the Internet — whether on a weblog, in a discussion group, or even in an email — think about how it will look to a hiring manager in ten years. Once stuff's out, it's archived, cached, and indexed in many services that you might never be aware of.
