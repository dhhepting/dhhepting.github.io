An [infographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic){:target='_blank'} is a graphic visual representation of "information, data, or knowledge intended to present information quickly and clearly".

Individually, or in groups of up to 4, prepare and submit an infographic that deals with a topic that is course-related and timely. See [this link for a sample infographic](https://www.humanetech.com/infographic-dark-side-social-media){:target='_blank'}. The target medium for display of this infographic is the web, so design your infographic for vertical scrolling as required. For your reference, the dimensions (width x height) for the sample are 2190 × 12292.

You may use any of a variety of tools that you are able to access legitimately. These include, but are not limited to, [canva](https://www.canva.com/infographics/){:target='_blank'} and [piktochart](https://piktochart.com/){:target='_blank'}.

You are to create your infographic without the use of AI.

Your infographic should contain research from 3-5 excellent sources (as evaluated using the [SIFT](https://hapgood.us/2019/06/19/sift-the-four-moves/){:target='_blank'} method).
In terms of subject matter for your infographic, it should be timely (some of your sources published within the last 3 months) and related to class themes or class discussions.
