### Description

This is a GROUP assignment. It cannot be done individually.

The purpose of this part of the assignment is to run the test
that you developed during the 1st part of the assignment.

Have your group pair up with one other group, with the same number
of people ([list of groups and group members](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/page/view.php?id=923074)). Each member of your group should then be paired someone from the other, matched, group.

Each person will act as tester for his or her own study and participant for the other.

As a group: incorporate any feedback that you have received from Part 1 and print a script that everyone in your group will use to administer the test.

Individually: administer the test, complete an empathy map with the participant, and collect other data that have indicated. Make sure that you mark the name of the tester and the participant on each sheet of data (not the script). Scan all of your data sheets (including empathy map) When your group has finished all the tests, scan the sheets.

Returning to your group after all the tests are complete:
* Summarize all of your group's data
* Reflect on this process of usability testing and discuss any insights that you have gained.
