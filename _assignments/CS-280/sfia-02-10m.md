### Professional Skills Assessment Part 2

This part of the assignment is meant to have you think about your career possibilities in Information Technology.

#### The Skills You have: Review and Refine (edit)

After you completed the initial self-assessment of your skills, you have the opportunity to edit your profile to add skills or adjust levels so that your profile reflects your current situation as accurately as possible. Don't forget to include skills that you have gained in the classes that you have taken so far. When you are satisfied with your profile, choose to print a version from the planner view (appears to be working in Firefox now): this will create a pdf file that will form part of your submission.

#### The Skills You Need: Assign Current and Future Skill requirements

Select 2 job descriptions (use 'current' and 'future' for these) that you would like to pursue and generate a skill gap report for each by selecting your chosen job descriptions (using the 'Choose Requirement Type' dropdown) in turn. There does not seem to be a satisfactory way to get the skills gap report into pdf form without some sacrifices. Please use either of these 2 options: 1) zoom out in your browser window so that you can see the whole skills gap report and take a screenshot of that and convert it to a pdf 2) take a few screenshots of the report as you scroll through without zooming and assemble them in a Word (or similar) document which you can then convert to a pdf.

#### Career Development: Build your Action Plan

Create actions (using custom actions) to address your skill gaps. Here you can list the classes that you will be taking to complete your program, certifications that you want to complete, and so on. The action plan/list that will be generated won't distinguish between your 2 job description requirements.

#### Reflect

Reflect on the assessment process and the importance of ethics in your chosen job descriptions -- target length of 1 page (pdf)
