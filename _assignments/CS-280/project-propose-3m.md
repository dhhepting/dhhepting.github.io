The project can be done individually or in a small group. If you choose to work in a group, make clear how each group member will participate in the final deliverable.

* Research Paper (1000 - 1400 words)
* Wikipedia article (create new or add to existing)
* Create and promote some online content (video, blog)
* Picture Yourself as a Computing Professional
* Discuss your contributions to an open source project (on github, for example)
* Write some code to test an idea
