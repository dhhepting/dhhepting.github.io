#### Description

The project can be done individually or in a small group (of up to 4). If you choose to work in a group, list all the group members on the proposal near the top (so that you can be put into a project group together) -- only 1 copy of the proposal needs to be submitted. If your project changes after the proposal is submitted, please keep me informed (the goal of the proposal is for you to plan so that changes won't be necessary).

You may choose what you will do for the project and that will depend on whether you are working individually or in a group. It must deal with class themes in some way, and I am open to your ideas about how you will do it. Some possibilities include:

* Research Paper
* Book Review

Start with a careful and critical reading of your chosen book. Describe, analyze, and evaluate your book as well as provide evidence to support your conclusions. Identify the key arguments of the book and how well the author supports them. Some questions to consider:
* How and what does this work help us to understand about an issue?
* What types of evidence does the author draw on to support their argument?
* Does the book do what the author claims that it will do?
* Are there other types of evidence that the author fails to acknowledge or ignores?
* Is there a theoretical perspective from which the author writes?
* How is this book similar to or different from other books on the topic? Why are they similar or different?
* Are you convinced by the book? Why or why not?

An appropriate structure will include an introduction that provides: identification of the book, author, and any essential historical background needed for context; and a clear and concise evaluation of the book that includes
its main argument and its strengths and weaknesses. After the introduction, provide a brief summary or overview of the book. Identify the essential arguments of the book and briefly summarize them. Next will come the evaluation and analysis that contains the bulk of your review where you explain and develop the evaluation made in the introduction. Provide evidence. Finally, conclude with a concise summation of your review.

* Wikipedia article (create new or add to existing)
* Create and promote some online content (video [which could be a recording of a presentation with narration], podcast, blog)
* Picture Yourself as a Computing Professional

Identify and discuss role models for your life as a computing professional. Choose 3 computing professional role models (from the present or past) and write about each one. Include a picture of each, if possible. Reflect on how they inspire you with respect to the Codes of Ethics (including <https://ethics.acm.org/>) that we are examining in class.

* Discuss your contributions to an open source project (on github, for example)
* Write some code to test an idea


##### Contents and Format of the Proposal

To match the rubric below, use the following headings.

###### Topic

Describe your topic and how it relates to class. The [list of topics and learning outcomes]({{ "/teaching/CS-280/?type=tlo" | relative_url }}) for this semester may be of help. Choose a topic that is new to you (that you haven't done in your blog entry). If the general topic is similar, please indicate how you will treat it differently, such as from a different perspective.

###### Deliverable and Rationale

Choose the form in which you will deliver your project. Explain why you are choosing that particular deliverable and explain why it is appropriate for a group or an individual to realize it.

###### Tentative Plan

Provide a plan, with some milestones, for realizing your chosen deliverable. This plan may look like an outline of what you expect to include. If you are doing this with a group, make clear how each group member will participate in the final deliverable.

##### Submission

* submit a well-formatted [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document on UR Courses
* target length: 1-2 pages
