### {{ page.title }}

The project can be done individually or in a small group (of up to 5). If you choose to work in a group, list all the group members on the proposal near the top (so that you can be put into a project group together) -- only 1 copy of the proposal needs to be submitted. If your project changes after the proposal is submitted, please keep me informed (the goal of the proposal is for you to plan so that changes won't be necessary).

You may choose what you will do for the project. It must deal with class themes in some way, and I am open to your ideas about how you will do it.

#### Contents and Format of the Proposal

To match the rubric below, use the following headings.

##### Topic

Describe your topic and how it relates to class. The [list of topics and learning outcomes]({{ "/teaching/CS-280/?type=tlo" | relative_url }}) for this semester may be of help. Choose a topic that is new to you (that you haven't done in your blog entry). If the general topic is similar, please indicate how you will treat it differently, such as from a different perspective.

##### Deliverable and Rationale

Choose the form in which you will deliver your project. Your options include, but are not limited to:

* Research Paper (1000 - 1500 words)
* Book Review
* Wikipedia article (create new or add to existing)
* Create and promote some online content (video [which could be a recording of a presentation with narration], podcast, blog)
* Picture Yourself as a Computing Professional - identify and discuss role models for your life as a computing professional
* Discuss your contributions to an open source project (on github, for example)
* Write some code to test an idea

Also, explain why you are choosing that particular deliverable.

##### Tentative Plan

Provide a plan, with some milestones, for realizing your chosen deliverable. This plan may look like an outline of what you plan to include. If you are doing this with a group, make clear how each group member will participate in the final deliverable.

### Submission
* submit a well-formatted [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document on UR Courses
* target length: 1-2 pages
