### Description

This is a [GROUP]({{ "/teaching/groupwork.html" | relative_url }}) assignment. It cannot be done individually.

As of January 28, there are 78 students registered in this class: which means there will be 18 groups of 4 and 2 groups of 3.

Amongst your group members, decide on a particular application or website that currently exists and with which you have some familiarity through use and which may have some issues. Define a task to complete within this chosen software.

The goal of this assignment is to consider interaction with your chosen software from a user's perspective, by:
* describing the goal of your task, so that someone else could complete it. Focus on what the user is to accomplish and avoid details of how you think the task should be completed.
* identifying the type of user who would use the software to complete the task.
* creating an empathy map for your task (each group member may do an empathy map and then combine them for the group's submission).
* identifying qualitative and quantitative measures that would indicate success with the task.
