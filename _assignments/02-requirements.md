### Description

Establish requirements for your redesign effort by considering user issues around
one feature or activity that users may perform with the application or website.

Recall the diagram that [illustrated the article about Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) from the Nielsen Norman Group.
There are 3 phases depicted: understand, explore, and materialize. The understand phase,
comprising empathize and define steps, is the focus of this assignment. You should focus on
well-defined activities that well-defined users are trying to perform.

1. describe the activity/activities and the user(s) with sufficient detail to be relatable
1. empathize: do this by first creating one or more empathy maps for the activities
1. define: identify specific aspects of the current interface that cause problems for the users and create requirements (see the [Volere Snow Card](http://www.volere.co.uk/snowcard.pdf) and [notes](http://www.volere.co.uk/pdf%20files/06%20Atomic%20Requirements.pdf), illustrated in the textbook, for an idea about the kinds of details to capture)

Remember that this phase is still concerned with articulating the problem.
No solutions should appear here. That will come later.

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document (1 per group) on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084)
