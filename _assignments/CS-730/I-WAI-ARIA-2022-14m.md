This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment.

In this assignment, you'll create a new react + node + bootstrap app that allows to gain some practical experience with a modern development environment and with WAI-ARIA.

Begin with the Carousel component and add other pieces as you are able. This is an important [link](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#at_support) to look at.
