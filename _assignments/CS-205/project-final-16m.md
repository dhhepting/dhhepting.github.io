### {{ page.title }}

The project will be a web-based presentation on a topic of your choosing. You will decide on the mix of writing and coding (using p5.js) [or, research and implementation]. The project can be done either individually or in small
groups.

The deliverable will be the realization of your project proposal. Reflect, in your web-based text, about the journey this semester from proposal to this deliverable.

You may include elements that you have created during your labs, but the project must also include some elements in p5.js.
