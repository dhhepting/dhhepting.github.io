### Description

The project will be a web-based presentation on a topic of your choosing. You will decide on the mix of writing and coding (using p5.js) [or, research and implementation]. The project can be done either individually or in small
groups.

You may include elements that you have created during your labs, but the project must also include some elements in p5.js
