### {{ page.title }}

The project will be an interactive web-based multimedia presentation on a topic of your choosing, related to class. You will decide on the mix of writing/research and coding/implementation (using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)). The project can be done either individually or in a small group (in that case, only 1 submission is required from the members of that group).

#### Concept

What you want to accomplish with this project? What is your vision? What are your goals?

#### Ambition

Consider the scope of your project and look at the risks and the rewards. What can you accomplish in the time available? Does success depend on a high-risk technology or technique?

#### Content

Flesh out your vision and describe the content of your interactive multimedia project. Upon which media elements will you focus, and how will you do it?

#### Plan

How will you assess if you've met your goals? What is essential to the project and what could be removed to meet your deadlines?

### Submission

* submit a well-formatted [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document on URcourses
