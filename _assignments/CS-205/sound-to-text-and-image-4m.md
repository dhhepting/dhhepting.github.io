			Assignment 4 -  Sound to Text and Image
		</h1>

		<p>
			Take the sound that you created in the previous assignment
			(or a different sound, if you prefer)
			and use it as input for creation of an image and a text file.  
			Try different ways to performing the transformation from sound to image and to text.  
			The unix <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strings_(Unix)">strings command</a>
			may give you some ideas (for example, trying to interpret the data in the sound file
			in terms of different encodings). Describe the transformations that you used.
			Comment on the results.  Hand in the source sound file, the various outputs,
			and your reflection.
