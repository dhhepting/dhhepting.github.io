### Description

Use p5.js to implement the binary guessing game that was discussed in class.
See the [Start-BGG](https://editor.p5js.org/dhhepting/sketches/qx5Y7-W2V) sketch for a starting point. You may also like to see a version done in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/281439014/).

"Basic implementation" refers to asking the user for input (Yes or No) about whether their number appears on each card and then "guessing" their number based on their responses. Links to image assets for the cards are included below. You may use other representations of the cards if you like.

"Advanced feature" is an opportunity to do something beyond the basic implementation. You may consider showing the cards in random order, illustrating how the game works, or employing other features from p5.js.

"Comments" are important in all code, to convey a sense of why something was done the way it was.  You are encouraged to use the [pseudocode programming process](https://davidzych.com/writing-code-using-the-pseudocode-programming-process/) to help you comment your code. More detail from McConnell can be found in [Chapter 9 of Code Complete, 2nd edition](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/code-complete-second/0735619670/ch09.html)
