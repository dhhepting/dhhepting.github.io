### Project Proposal

The project will be a web-based presentation on a topic of your choosing. You will decide on the mix of writing and coding (using p5.js) [or, research and implementation]. The project can be done either individually or in small
groups. Identify how (and, optionally, with whom) you will complete the project in your submission.

Your proposal will begin with the title of your proposed project. You will then include each of the following headings, accompanied by some descriptive text.

#### Overview
A summary description of the project, in a couple of sentences.

#### Vision and Goals
What you want to accomplish with this project: what is your vision, what are your goals? How will you assess if you've met your goals?

#### Audience
Who do you see as your audience? It is hard to be all things to all people, so indicate some details of your intended audience. What is common amongst your audience members? What do you think that they will get out of your project? Why should they be interested?

#### Content
What you will be presenting and why: flesh out your vision and describe the content of your project.

#### Presentation
How you will present it: which media elements will you use to present your work, and how will you do it?

#### Scope
How you will finish: consider the scope of the project you are considering and look at the risks. Can you cover the content effectively in the development time available? Does success depend on a high-risk technology or technique? What is essential to the project and what could be removed to meet your deadlines?
