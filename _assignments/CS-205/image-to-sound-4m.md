		<h1>Assignment 3 - Image to Sound</h1>

		<p>
			Take an image that you created in the "Text to Image" assignment and use it as input for
			creation of a sound file using processing.  Use different variations of the parameters to
			create an output wave file.  Use different formats for the image as input
			(including <a href="http://www.freeformatter.com/base64-encoder.html">base64</a>).  
			Examine the results using audacity (or other program).  Comment on the results.
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of your submissions,
			please submit <em>all</em> the files required to run your code,
			as well as all input and output files.
