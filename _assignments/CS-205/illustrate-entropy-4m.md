### Description

Use p5.js to illustrate the idea of entropy.
Recall the [video about information entropy as a measure of surprise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s3aJfRr9gE). A basic sample sketch for this assignment is [available by clicking here](https://editor.p5js.org/dhhepting/sketches/Cg4XuXeR).

### Submission

You may submit your assignment on UR Courses as a link,
either to your <editor.p5js.org> sketch or to your own CS website page that runs your sketch.
