### Description

Use p5.js to read some text, analyse it in some way, and the display the text, using colour, size, and possibly other transformations,
to show the results of your analysis of the input text.

Use <https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/saveCanvas> to save your output to an image file.

Think of wordclouds as an example of this and see <https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/> to experiment. The following image is an edited version of one done in class.
