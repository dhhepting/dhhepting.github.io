### {{ page.title }}

Animate [figure.html](https://interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/09/figure.html). Here is a simple example with [roboticArm.html]({{ "/teaching/CS-733/202330/code/webgl/roboticArm.html" | absolute_url }}). 

Code which does not use WebGL 2.0 or Bootstrap will receive the lowest grade for that criterion.

Your comments should identify you, what you have added to the sample code to realize the requested functionality (and why), as well as explaining what is happening in the code (in both what you use from the sample code and what you have written). If you have used code from other sources, please make sure to identify and attribute it!

##### Submission

Submit a single zip file that contains code (html,js,css) that can be run in place. Use separate folders for each program and put a README file at the top level that explains the contents.
