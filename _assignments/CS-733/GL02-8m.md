### {{ page.title }}

Write 2 WebGL 2.0 programs (HTML and JavaScript) that improve and add functionality to code from the text:

* [squarem.html](https://www.interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/03/squarem.html) &mdash; allow for selection of colours; allow for input positions to be overwritten so that storage is not exhausted (the reference version's display goes blank after a while); and permit the mouse coordinate input to work correctly when the canvas is not at the top left of the browser window
* trackball ([trackball.html](https://www.interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/04/trackball.html) and [trackballQuaternion.html](
https://www.interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/04/trackballQuaterion.html)) &mdash; combine the code from the two samples into one with a toggle for quaternions and provide information and feedback about the trackball operation on the HTML page

Code which does not use WebGL 2.0 or Bootstrap will receive the lowest grade for that criterion.

Your comments should identify you, what you have added to the sample code to realize the requested functionality (and why), as well as explaining what is happening in the code (in both what you use from the sample code and what you have written). If you have used code from other sources, please make sure to identify and attribute it!

##### Submission

Submit a single zip file that contains code (html,js,css) that can be run in place. Use separate folders for each program and put a README file at the top level that explains the contents.
