### {{ page.title }}

Write a WebGL 2.0 program (HTML and JavaScript) that combines the 2 cube shaders that were presented in class (see [vertex.html]({{ "/teaching/CS-733/202330/code/webgl/8E06/vertex.html" | absolute_url }}) and [fragment.html]({{ "/teaching/CS-733/202330/code/webgl/8E06/fragment.html" | absolute_url }})) so that both versions of the cube are displayed at the same time and are controlled by a single set of interface elements (so the rotations are applied the same to both). Additionally, add controls to change other parameters affecting the shading (light position and so forth) and allow the projection to be toggled between parallel and perspective (no need to adjust those parameters).

This page may help with inspiration: [webgl2fundamentals.org](https://webgl2fundamentals.org/webgl/lessons/webgl-multiple-views.html). Alternatively, here is the [sample.html]({{ "/teaching/CS-733/202330/code/webgl/sample.html" | absolute_url }}) from Meeting 19.

Code which does not use WebGL 2.0 or Bootstrap will receive the lowest grade for that criterion.

Your comments should identify you, what you have added to the sample code to realize the requested functionality (and why), as well as explaining what is happening in the code (in both what you use from the sample code and what you have written). If you have used code from other sources, please make sure to identify and attribute it!

##### Submission

Submit a single zip file that contains code (html,js,css) that can be run in place. Use separate folders for each program and put a README file at the top level that explains the contents.
