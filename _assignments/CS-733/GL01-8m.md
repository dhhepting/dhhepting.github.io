Write 2 WebGL programs (HTML and JavaScript) to generate a Sierpi≈Ñski Gasket (as named by Benoit B Mandelbrot) in 2D. One of your programs will use the random algorithm (Chaos Game, introduced by Barnsley) and the other will use the recursive algorithm. You may use the sample code discussed in class as starting points for your work.

* your HTML should use Bootstrap, including some controls to adjust some parameters in your code (including but not limited to the number of points for the random algorithm and the number of subdivisions for the recursive algorithm)
* your code should use different colours when rendering (to highlight the different transformations used: 3 colours to distinguish the last transformation and 9 colours to distinguish the last 2 transformations)
* you should comment your code, explain the WebGL functions used, and discuss the how to determine the settings for the highest precision image that can be displayed without doing extra work
