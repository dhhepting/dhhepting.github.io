Based on your designs, test and refine!

Recall the diagram that [illustrated the article about Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) from the Nielsen Norman Group. We are now moving to the materialize phase.

The focus now shifts to testing your low-fidelity prototypes.
Each member of your Project group will conduct 1 test with each of your Project group's 2 low-fidelity interface prototypes.  The tests will be arranged from within your Testing groups, most of which will have 3 members. Use UR Courses to coordinate with your [Testing group members](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/page/view.php?id=). For illustrative purposes, consider a Testing group with Bob, Fanhua, and Premla as members. Each of them will arrange 2 meetings for testing:

* Bob and Fanhua arrange to meet:
  * Bob tests his Project group's Interface A with Fanhua
  * Fanhua tests his Project group's Interface B with Bob

* Bob and Premla arrange to meet:
  * Bob tests his Project group's Interface B with Premla
  * Premla tests her Project group's Interface A with Bob

* Fanhua and Premla arrange to meet:
  * Fanhua tests his Project group's Interface A with Premla
  * Premla tests her Project group's Interface B with Fanhua

IMPORTANT: Your Testing group should not have more than one member from any Project group

In your tests, you are asking someone to take on a role as your user and then complete the task for which you are redesigning the interface.  Explain the task and ask your participant to perform the task, without giving instructions about how to do it.  This information will be recorded in a script, that all group members will use to run their tests.  Writing and reviewing the script is a group effort. Once you start testing with your participants, do not make any changes to your script.

You may find the [downloads related to the ZipCar website test](http://sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html) useful.

During your tests, you will collect both quantitative and qualitative data and you will also make notes.

You should submit all of your raw data and submit a summary of how
it was collected: by whom, from whom, when, and where. Each of your group members will collect data from 1 test of your Interface A and 1 test of your Interface B. All tests will use the same script and other materials.

Provide an analysis of your data.  Did the data that you collected from your participants reveal any agreement or disagreement about your interface designs? Were the results surprising in any way?

Based on your experience with your project and your testing of your low-fidelity prototypes, create a single interface design that combines the best ideas from your two low-fidelity prototypes and any other sources.
