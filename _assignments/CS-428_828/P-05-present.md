* Identify your project and your opportunity for redesign
* Discuss your 2 low-fidelity designs (and metaphors)
* Describe what you learned from your evaluations

Although it would be preferable to have all group members involved in creating the presentation, this is not required.

You may choose the privacy setting for your youtube video [(public, unlisted, and private)](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/157177). If you choose private, please ensure that the instructor and marker are granted access.

### Submission
