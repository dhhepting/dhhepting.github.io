Based on your understanding, design!

Recall the diagram that [illustrated the article about Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) from the Nielsen Norman Group. We are now moving to the explore phase.

The focus now shifts from understanding the problems to proposing solutions for those problems. Using the results from the last project assignment (and considering the feedback that you will receive from your critique group), state the task that the user will perform. If you had many tasks in the last project assignment, please focus at this stage on 1 substantial task that accomplishes a meaningful goal for the user

Then consider how the user will do the task:
* which interface metaphors (see Sections 3.4 and 12.3 in textbook) would be suitable to help users understand the activities
* which interaction type(s) (see Section 3.5 in textbook) would best support the users' activities
* whether different interface types suggest alternative design insights or options

Choose 2 <strong>different</strong> metaphors and design an  interface for each of the metaphors that you choose. For both interfaces:
* Create a low-fidelity prototype (see Section 12.2 in textbook)
* Write a scenario (see Section 11.5 in textbook) that includes details of the information presented and interaction undertaken
* Analyze your scenario for positive and negative aspects and iterate your low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios to minimize the negative aspects and maximize the positive aspects

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document (1 per group)
