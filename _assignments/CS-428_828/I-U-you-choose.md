This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment for undergraduate students.

Consider the class themes that we have discussed and will consider.
Please see the page of
[Topics]({{ "/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/#collapse_OFF_TLO" | relative_url }})
for a guide.

Write approximately 1000 words (or equivalent)
about your chosen topic as an essay or
you are welcome to consider other forms of deliverable that are more meaningful to you &mdash; such an HTML/JavaScript implementation of some ideas discussed in class (perhaps extending something from <https://github.com/dhhepting/dhhepting.github.io>).

It must deal with class themes in some way,
and your ideas about that connection are important.
You might focus your efforts on researching smaller assessment questions (from [Topics]({{ "/teaching/CS-428+828/202030/#collapse_OFF_TLO" | relative_url }})),
examining the usability of software that you use,
writing some code to test an idea, and so forth.

Your submission should include between 2 and 4 external references (
[NOT wikipedia]({{ "/teaching/wikipedia.html" | relative_url }})).

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document
