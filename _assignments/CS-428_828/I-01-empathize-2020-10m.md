### {{ page.breadcrumb }}

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment.

You have been made a TEACHER in a [course on UR Courses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2168), so that you can gain a different perspective on UR Courses (because you are normally a STUDENT).

For this assignment, please define and describe an activity that meets the requirements below. As you complete your activity with the UR Courses interface, reflect on your experience.

Specifically, you are asked to:

1. Create an [empathy map](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/) while you complete your activity within
[your course on UR Courses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2168):
   1. claim 1 "Section" by changing the label to your own name (there are enough blank sections for everyone - so be nice and don't claim someone else's section!)
   1. add to your section:
      1. One "activity" that allows you to assign a grade upon completion
      1. One "resource" whose access is restricted based on the grade earned from your activity

1. Describe whatever opportunities for redesign that you find by relating it (or them) in terms of your personal experience of completing your activity.

### Submission

* submit a single [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document on UR Courses
* target: 1 page for a description of your activity with 1 page for a screen capture of your Section, 1 page for the empathy map and 1-2 pages for the opportunities for redesign
