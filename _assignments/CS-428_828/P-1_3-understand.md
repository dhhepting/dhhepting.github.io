### {{ page.title }}

In consultation with the members of your group,
select an existing website or software application,
with which you are all familiar and for which you can
identify some opportunities for redesign and improvement.
<strong>No group may choose this (Dr. Hepting's) website. We will use it for examples in our meetings</strong>.

This is the first of three parts to the project,
which mirror the 3 stages of the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/" target="_blank">design thinking process</a> (as described by the Nielsen Norman Group): understand, explore, and materialize.

The understand stage, comprising empathize and define steps, is the focus of this assignment. Focus on well-defined activities that well-defined users are trying to perform.

1. describe: each member of your group will describe an activity and a user wanting to complete that activity with sufficient detail to be relatable.
1. empathize: each member of your group will create an empathy map for each activity (and user).
1. define: together as a group, identify specific aspects of the current interface that cause problems for the users and look to examine the roots of those problems. Identify whatever user needs may be unmet.

Remember that this stage is concerned with understanding the opportunities for redesign with your selected website or software application.
Do not provide solutions or fixes now: that will come later.

### Submission
