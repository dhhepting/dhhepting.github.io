Based on your designs, test!

Recall the diagram that [illustrated the article about Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) from the Nielsen Norman Group. We are now moving to the materialize phase.

The focus now shifts to testing your low-fidelity prototypes.
Each member of your group will conduct 1 test with each of your
group's 2 low-fidelity interface prototypes).  The tests will be
arranged from within your evaluation (Eval) groups. Each Eval group has 3 members. Use URcourses to coordinate with your [Eval group members](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/forum/view.php?f=64408). For illustrative purposes, consider a group with Bob, Fanhua, and Premla. Each of them will arrange 2 meetings:

* Bob and Fanhua arrange to meet:
  * Bob tests his group's Interface A with Fanhua
  * Fanhua tests his group's Interface B with Bob

* Bob and Premla arrange to meet:
  * Bob tests his group's Interface B with Premla
  * Premla tests her group's Interface A with Bob

* Fanhua and Premla arrange to meet:
  * Fanhua tests his group's Interface A with Premla
  * Premla tests her group's Interface B with Fanhua

IMPORTANT: Your Eval group should not have any other members from your Project group

In your tests, you are asking someone to take on a role as your user and then complete the task for which you are redesigning the interface.  Explain the task and ask your participant to perform the task, without giving instructions about how to do it.  This information will be recorded in a script, that all group members will use to run their tests.  Writing, and testing, the script is a group effort. Once you start testing with your participants, do not make any changes to your script.

You may find the [downloads related to the ZipCar website test useful](http://sensible.com/downloads-rsme.html)

During your tests, you will collect both quantitative and qualitative data.  You will also have notes that you take during the test.

You should submit all of your raw data and submit a summary of how
it was collected: by whom, from whom, when, and where. Each of your group members will collect data from 1 test of your Interface A and 1 test of your Interface B. Both tests will use the same script and other materials.

Provide an analysis of your data.  Did the participants seeing your interfaces agree amongst themselves? Were the results surprising in
any way?

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document (1 per group)
