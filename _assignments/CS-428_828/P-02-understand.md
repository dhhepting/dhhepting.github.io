### Description

Understand the important issues in your redesign effort by identifying specific user issues with a feature or task that you have selected in your proposal.

Recall the diagram that illustrated the article about Design Thinking (from the Nielsen Norman Group):

<img src="https://media.nngroup.com/media/editor/2016/07/29/designthinking_illustration_final-01-01.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stages of Design Thinking" width="600" /> <br />
There are 3 phases depicted: understand, explore, and materialize. The understand phase,
comprising empathize and define steps, is the focus of this assignment. You should focus on
well-defined activities that well-defined users are trying to perform.

1. describe: describe the activity/activities and the user(s) with sufficient detail to be relatable
1. <mark>empathize: each member of your group will do this by creating one <del>or more</del> empathy map<del>s</del> for <del>the</del> <ins>each</ins> activit<del>ie(s)</del><ins>y</ins></mark>
1. define: identify specific aspects of the current interface that cause problems for the users and explore the roots of those problems. Identify whatever user needs may be unmet

Remember that this phase is still concerned with articulating the problem.
No solutions should appear here. That will come later.

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document (1 per group) on URcourses <mark><ins>that includes all three parts (describe, empathize, and define)</ins></mark>
* target: 6 - 10 problems or unmet needs (about 2 per group member)
