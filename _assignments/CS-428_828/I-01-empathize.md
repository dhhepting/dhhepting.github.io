### Description

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment.

You have been made a TEACHER in a [course on URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2168), so that you can gain a different perspective on URcourses (because you are normally a STUDENT).

For this assignment, please complete the task described below while  reflecting on your experience with the interface.

Specifically, you are asked to:

1. Create an [empathy map](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/empathy-mapping/) while you complete the following task within
[your course on URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2168):
  * claim 1 topic section by changing the label to your own name (there are enough blank topics for everyone - so be nice and don't claim someone else's topic!)
  * add to your topic: 1 resource and 1 activity that can both be assigned a grade

1. Describe whatever opportunities for redesign that you find by describing it (or them) in terms of your personal experience of completing the above task

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document on URcourses
* target: 1 page for the empathy map and 1-2 pages for the opportunities for redesign
