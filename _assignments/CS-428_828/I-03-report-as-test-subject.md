### Description

This is an INDIVIDUAL assignment.

You have been placed into an "Eval" group.
You are to coordinate, as has been discussed in class meetings, with the other members of your "Eval" group so that you will each conduct 1 test of your "A" interface and 1 test of your "B" interface (with 2 different people). In turn, you will be the test subject for 2 others from your "Eval" group.  You are to complete this assignment from the perspective of test subject.

1. What did you notice or observe about your 2 experiences as test subject?:
  * Was there anything different between them?
  * Was anything especially easy or hard about shifting between running the tests of your interfaces and being a test subject for someone else?
1. Do you have any comments or constructive criticisms for your peers who ran the tests when you were the subject?

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084)
