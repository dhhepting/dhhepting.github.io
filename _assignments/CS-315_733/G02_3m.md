Write a WebGL2 program (HTML and JavaScript) that places 9 cubes to create a representation of Sierpiński's Triangle. Use the 9 colours that you used in Assignment 1 to colour each cube. Rotate (around Y) and translate each cube a bit so that they are not stacked too neatly. Provide camera controls to make some adjustments to the position and parameters of the camera as well as allowing selection and adjustment of parallel and perspective projections.

* the [CS 315 lab](https://www.labs.cs.uregina.ca/315/WebGL2/Lab3/)may be useful as a starting point for your work. Remember to acknowledge your sources!
* your code should use a different colour for each different cube
* you should comment your code and explain the WebGL2 (and other) functions used
* you should submit a zip file that contains a README file that: explains how to use your program; provides a statement about how, with whom, and using which sources, you developed your solution; and includes your descriptions of tests that be used to determine:
  * that the 3 vertices of a triangle do not lie on the same line (are not co-linear)
  * that the 4 vertices of a quadrilateral are co-planar
