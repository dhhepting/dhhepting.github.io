### {{ page.title }}

Write a WebGL2 program (HTML and JavaScript) to generate a Sierpiński Triangle fractal in 2D based on the textbook code for the random algorithm (Chaos Game, introduced by Barnsley) -- see [https://interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/02/gasket1.html](https://interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/02/gasket1.html). Acknowledge your sources!

* your code should use 9 different colours when rendering to highlight the last 2 transformations applied and allow for rotations to be applied as part of the transformations that generate the fractal shapeSee the [chaos game](https://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/assets/teaching/img/sample-output-chaos.jpg) sample
* your HTML should include some controls to adjust some parameters in your code (including but not limited to the number of points for the random algorithm)
* you should comment your code, explain the WebGL2 functions used, and discuss the how to determine the settings for the highest precision image that can be displayed without doing extra work
* you should submit a zip file that contains a README file that: explains how to use your program; provides a statement about how, with whom, and using which sources, you developed your solution; and provides your answer to the question of how many points to use to generate a Sierpiński Triangle fractal onscreen into a square window
