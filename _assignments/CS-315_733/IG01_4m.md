Write 2 WebGL2 programs (HTML and JavaScript) to generate a Sierpiński Gasket (as named by Benoit B Mandelbrot) in 2D. One of your programs will use the random algorithm (Chaos Game, introduced by Barnsley) -- see [https://interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/02/gasket1.html](https://interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/02/gasket1.html) -- and the other will use the recursive algorithm  -- see [https://interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/02/gasket2.html](https://interactivecomputergraphics.com/8E/Code/02/gasket2.html). You may use the sample code discussed in class as starting points for your work but remember to acknowledge your sources!

* your HTML should include some controls to adjust some parameters in your code (including but not limited to the number of points for the random algorithm and the number of subdivisions for the recursive algorithm). Add the option to perturb the midpoint of each side of the triangle before
subdivision (a similar technique was used in the genesis sequence in [Star Trek The Wrath of Khan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tq_sSxDE32c)).
* your code should use 9 different colours when rendering to highlight the last 2 transformations applied. See the [chaos game](https://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/assets/teaching/img/sample-output-chaos.jpg) sample and the [recursive](https://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/assets/teaching/img/sample-output-subdivision.jpg) sample.
* you should comment your code, explain the WebGL2 functions used, and discuss the how to determine the settings for the highest precision image that can be displayed without doing extra work
