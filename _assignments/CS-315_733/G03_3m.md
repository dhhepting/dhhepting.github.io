Write a WebGL2 program (HTML and JavaScript) that builds on your code from Assignment2 to fly the camera and a light source in a circular path around your cube structure.

* remember to acknowledge your sources
* your code should allow the specification of some viewing parameters through an HTML interface
* your code should use a different colour and material for each different cube
* you should comment your code and explain the WebGL2 (and other) functions used
* you should submit a zip file that contains a README file that: explains how to use your program and provides a statement about how, with whom, and using which sources, you developed your solution
