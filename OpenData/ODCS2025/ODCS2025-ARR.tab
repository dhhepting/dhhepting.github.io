"	"There are lots of frameworks for creating metadata like DDI, but the implementation tools continue to be disparate and unclear. I'm happy to see more and more DDI tools being built in open-source software like R and Python, but I'd also like to see more open source hosting sites or data repositories that allow for functionality like the Colectica server option so that the full functionality of DDI can be applied. I'm sure technical people can use machine scripts to work with DDI in its XML format, but many researchers still want the human readable option, and yes there are static human-readable DDI formats, but the interactive kind that can also assist support staff with handling data access requests would be a huge help! E.g. the kinds of codebooks where someone can peruse all available variables, and then indicate which variables of a given dataset they wish to use and making a data access request based on those variables in question. Data access requests will continue to be of importance in my faculty simply because our data are rarely ever anonymous and need to be handled with some level of care."	"AI companies ignoring data licensing and copyright rules to just use data they aren't allowed to. They've already done it with tons of literature and information on YouTube against the copyright or terms of service rules. So I worry about data that is published openly with a non-commercial license being used anyways because AI companies break the rules and get away with it because there is no way to keep them in check."

Resources such as checklists, short and targeted tutorials on FAIR principles that are directly impacted or influenced by their decisions, and workflows to acquire and assign identifiers are valuable. Researchers are generally supportive of open data, but not at the expense of time-consuming workflows and requirements that are hard to implement on their part and reduce their available time to spend on their research. The right tools and processes at the right time in their research project are most likely to be used successfully to support their data being fully FAIR."	"Lack of useful, easy to use tools for ISO 19115-x metadata generation and validation is a HUGE problem in the research community. Researchers have to become experts in ISO metadata in order to produce it, and this is an enormous barrier to implementation. The ISO community has done little to prioritize this, and the standard is so obscure and complicated that it is nearly impossible to support. It's incredibly disappointing that the leadership of the standard have absolved themselves of the responsibility for supporting a pathway to actual implementation of the standard. The private sector is mostly unwilling to invest in a solution, and as a result, most ISO metadata generated in the research community is minimal in scope and extent, and therefore not FAIR. DCAT is a good standard and supports interoperability, but it is wholly incomplete in terms of addressing data quality and data provenance, which renders it incapable of fully supporting FAIR data. It would be great to see the DCAT community take on the inclusion of data quality and data provenance in a future DCAT 4 standard."

By aligning the data with established ontologies and open standards, we aimed to extend its usefulness beyond immediate application boundaries.\n\nAnother key motivation was to ensure the longevity and independence of the data models from the underlying IT systems. We designed them to remain valid and meaningful even after the original applications are decommissioned."	""	"Standards : SHACL, SHACL, SHACL... + ELI & ELI-DL ontologies + Dublin Core + DCAT + SKOS\nTools : SHACL Play (https://shacl-play.sparna.fr)"	"Start with the reusers in mind, both internal and external. Understanding their potential needs early on will help you model your data in a way that's meaningful beyond your immediate project. Invest in clear, well-documented metadata - reuse the existing ontologies or standards as much as possible. This will save you and future users time and headaches.\n\nDon’t treat open data as just a technical export—think of it as a long-term asset. Systems may change, but your data (if semantically structured) can outlive the applications that created it. Also, start small, but something that is very much wanted (\"high value datasets\"). Finally, engage with the community – others have likely solved similar problems and open data thrives on shared experience."	""	"One of the biggest threats to quality data on the web is the inconsistent use of standards and vocabularies, which leads to semantic fragmentation, limited interoperability, and ultimately, data that is difficult to reuse effectively.\n\nThis is not just a threat, but a symptom of deeper issues, such as:\n\n·       Short-term project thinking: When data initiatives are driven by quick wins or compliance checkboxes, long-term quality and reusability often suffer.\n·       Low data literacy among stakeholders involved in data production,\n·       And the classic \"garbage in, garbage out\" problem—where poor source data flows into open datasets, reducing their utility regardless of how well they're published.\n\n\nThese are root causes that, if left unaddressed, erode the overall quality and trustworthiness of data on the web.\n\nTo mitigate these challenges, several strategies are effective:\n\n·       Raising awareness across the organization about the long-term value of high-quality, semantically aligned data—not just at the open data publishing stage.\n·       Improving data literacy, especially among those involved in upstream data collection and modeling.\n·       Reusing existing vocabularies and standards consistently—not only in open data portals, but embedded throughout the data lifecycle, including internal source systems.\n\nIn addition, fostering collaboration across teams and departments, and investing in tooling that supports metadata validation and standardisation, can go a long way in maintaining data quality at scale."

"To increase support for new and existing climate-related policies and initiatives, and to ensure that the fundamental human right to public participation is protected; public and private actors are better involved when citizens are given opportunities to exercise their right to public participation. This would also promote transparency and accountability in the decision-making process and create a more engaged citizenry and inclusive society. At the heart of the problem is poor communication between citizens and state actors, which has resulted in a lack of support from the public for the state’s climate policy formulation and implementation processes. To ensure that the fundamental human right to public participation is protected, it is necessary a concerted effort to engage with the public during the policy formulation, introduction, application and monitoring phases. This would ensure that all actors are better informed about the concerns of the public and that, when promoting decision-making in climate-related policies, citizens are given opportunities to exercise their right to public participation. It would also promote transparency and accountability in the decision-making process and create a more engaged citizenry and inclusive society. However, it may be necessary to rethink and re-frame existing public participatory processes in order to encourage closer cooperation between all stakeholders involved in political, economic, social and cultural decision-making processes related to the serious effects of environmental crises and climate change in today's world. According the recommendations of the Earth System Governance Project, it is necessary to explore the following questions: How to assess the institutional, political and social context in view of comparative research and meta-analyses to reveal general patterns and trends that vary by context? What are the research topics and questions where the accumulation of knowledge would be particularly fruitful in terms of scientific progress and/or impact on policy and governance? What comparative research, systematic reviews and meta-analyses exist? Which research results are in fact (not) taken up by policy makers, and why (not)? How to develop and use a basic terminology that is widely shared, but nevertheless open to reinterpretations and new concepts? How to coordinate collaborations such as common dictionaries or shared databases? How might the Science-Policy Interface community influence the policies of journals and funding agencies ? How to deal with communication, advocacy, public policies, research and teaching programs in view of research integrity?"	"Yes, I confirm that I want to participate - please submit my responses"	""

Elle se construit au fur et à mesure du développement de l’individu dans ses différents milieux de vie et de socialisation et ce, en interrelation avec les caractéristiques dont il est porteur ou considéré comme porteur (Chevallier-Rodrigues et Courtinat-Camps, 2021). Si les travaux relatifs à l’estime de soi se centrent généralement sur la période de l’adolescence (Poussin et Sordes-Ader, 2005), cette contribution porte sur le début de sa construction entre 4 et 6 ans. L’environnement scolaire interagissant fortement avec le genre des élèves, en termes de socialisations (Duru-Bellat, 1994 ; Rouyer et al., 2014), et pouvant occasionner un effet dans le temps sur les compétences scolaires des filles et des garçons (Fischer et Thierry, 2022), prendre en compte cette variable dans ses combinaisons avec d’autres caractéristiques de l’environnement des enfants contribue à rendre compte de la complexité du développement. \nL’étude mobilise les données longitudinales collectées dans le cadre de la cohorte Elfe (Étude longitudinale française depuis l’enfance) qui suit, à intervalles réguliers depuis leur naissance en 2011 un échantillon national représentatif de 18000 enfants (Charles et al., 2019). Ce suivi pluridisciplinaire vise à mieux comprendre les effets de l'environnement sur le développement de l'enfant, sa santé, sa socialisation et son parcours scolaire. Dans notre étude, nous mobiliserons les enquêtes Elfe-école réalisées en milieu scolaire en 2016 et 2018, l’échantillon combiné des deux enquêtes concerne 4515 enfants (2259 filles et 2256 garçons). Le cahier d’épreuves adressé à l’enfant comprend au CP l'inventaire d'estime de soi (IMES). Le questionnaire rempli par l’enseignant de la classe de maternelle puis celui de CP intègre, en plus d’éléments sur l’environnement scolaire (REP, nombre d’élèves dans la classe…), des informations relatives aux aménagements scolaires ou à la perception de besoins particuliers de l’enfant par l’enseignant. Ces dernières sont complétées par des données collectées auprès des parents sur les entraves au quotidien vécues par leur enfant à différents âges ainsi que par des opérationnalisations administratives du handicap. Le genre est investigué à partir de la bi-catégorisation basée sur le sexe déclaré à la naissance et dans les enquêtes école. Cette mesure reste très largement opératoire en dépit des limites qu’elle présente.\nLes premiers résultats indiquent peu de différences au niveau global ou par sous-domaines entre filles et garçons quand la situation de handicap n’est pas prise en compte. Il y a un effet combiné du genre et du handicap : les vécus scolaires des filles en situation de handicap se distinguent à la fois de ceux de leurs homologues féminines sans besoin particulier mais aussi de ceux de leurs pairs masculins en situation de handicap. Notre ambition est de documenter et analyser de manière complexe le développement des enfants afin de pallier à la relative invisibilisation des effets croisés du handicap et du genre dans la littérature scientifique et professionnelle en psychologie et en éducation.\n"	"april 2024"	"ongoing"	"share informations, contribute to replicability"	""	"ddi"	"Time to read and understand the documentation; enough competencies to manipulate extraction with R ; pay enough attention to the respect of anonymat of participants and to variables which could contribute to social discriminations or to abusive reuse "	"Need of enough professionnals to maintain the knowledge and procedures about open data.

"	"Engage early with stakeholders"	"A key gap in open data policies and tools is the difficulty in discovering and understanding available datasets due to inconsistent metadata and poor data inventory management. Improved metadata standards, structured data classification, and better integration of data tools would enhance accessibility and usability. Additionally, clearer policies on data stewardship and governance are needed to ensure long-term data quality and relevance."	"The biggest threat to quality data on the web is data fragmentation and inconsistency, where datasets are poorly documented, lack standardization, or are scattered across different platforms, making them difficult to find, understand, and use. This fragmentation leads to reduced trust in data and limits its potential for analysis and decision-making. To mitigate this, adopting and enforcing common metadata standards, improving data governance frameworks, and ensuring better interoperability between data platforms would help create a more cohesive, reliable data ecosystem."	"I’m really interested in the results from this survey and would love for them to be shared. Understanding the insights gathered will be valuable in refining open data practices and policies, and I’m eager to see how they contribute to improving the overall open data landscape."

"We still have a long way to go, especially in convincing journals to apply to deposit their open data. In general, what we have advanced so far has been carried out good."	"In general we use the Dataverse model to structure the metadata we use for this data library. The schema we use is that of the SciELO guide: Research Data Curation Guide for Editorial Teams: https://wp.scielo.org/wp-content/uploads/Guia_curadoria_es.pdf"	"The most important advice for those considering a project using open data is to rigorously test the implementation of the standards required for open data publication. It is essential to have a clear understanding of the steps involved in structuring and curating data according to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). Furthermore, it is crucial to assess the technical capacities of the team to ensure they are adequately equipped to manage and deliver the services associated with open data initiatives effectively."	"At least in my country, Mexico, there is no clear governmental policy regarding the production and use of open data, either from a technical or ethical perspective. While there have been efforts to promote transparency through open data platforms, these initiatives often lack continuity, standardized practices, and sufficient legal or institutional support. Additionally, there is limited guidance on ethical considerations, such as data privacy, informed consent, or equitable access and use. This creates a gap between the potential of open data and its practical, responsible implementation."	"One of the biggest threats to quality data on the web is the lack of data literacy among authors, students, and researchers. Many users are unaware of how to assess, produce, or responsibly use open data. Additionally, there is a shortage of research that demonstrates the tangible, positive impact of the open data movement on society. Without this evidence, support and adoption remain limited.\n\nTo mitigate this, it is essential to launch awareness programs and implement practical applications of open data in professional fields. Integrating open data practices into education, journalism, public policy, and other sectors could help build a culture of responsible and meaningful data use."	"Open data represents a new and innovative way to communicate research findings and to make scientific processes more transparent, helping to combat bad research practices. To fully realize its potential, we need to build a strong, collaborative community and address these challenges on a global scale."

I'm persistently at the level of raising awareness that metadata matter and that the faculty/researchers with grants really could benefit from using a standard. These are one on one conversations. \n\nBecause I also work to teach a group of student workers about metadata, FAIR, CARE, Open Science, etc - from which a tiny minority would benefit from understanding how DDI fits into the larger environment of data management, I would benefit from having access to basic training that starts with explaining how DDI fits into the environment.
