The mark awarded for each group assignment is shared by all group members. However, you have the ability to communicate extra information about
your group members' performance to your group members,
to the marker, and to me.

For each group assignment,
you are encouraged to allocate 100 points amongst your group members
(including yourself).
The place to do this is a link in URcourses labelled something like
"Submit Group Rating",
just below the link for the assignment that you have just submitted.
If all group members contribute equally,
you would distribute the points equally to each group member.
If some group members contribute more or less than others,
you would reflect this in the amount of points allocated to each group member.
Please undertake this activity responsibly and explain why you have not
allocated points equally.
The total points that you allocate amongst your group members should equal 100.

If a group member does not providing a rating,
their allocation of points is taken as equal.
However, allocating points for each portion of
group work will provide evidence of your participation.

The points allocated to each group member are summed.  
The point sum for each group member is divided by the largest sum,
so the group member who was allocated the most points will receive
the full mark earned for the assignment.  If all group members were allocated
the same number of points, all will receive the full mark earned for the assignment.

The lowest rating allowed is 0.5, even if the calculated would be lower.

You can see your rating from the group in URcourses via the entry labelled
"See Your Rating From Group".  
The value available there corresponds to the
"Computed Rating from Group" in the examples below.
