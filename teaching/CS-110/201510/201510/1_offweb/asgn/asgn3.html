<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Modify <a href="http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/cpp3e/html/GuessNumber.html">Listing 5.3</a> so that the computer guesses a number that the user provides (switch the roles of user and computer from Listing 5.3).  Write the guesses from the program and the user's answers to a file.  Print a message if the computer detects that the user has not been trustworthy in her answers.  Use the technique that we discussed in class today.</li>
<li>Modify <a href="http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/cpp3e/html/SubtractionQuizLoop.html">Listing 5.4</a> so that the user must answer the question correctly before proceeding.  Also, your program should offer addition and multiplication questions (at random).  For each question, print out the number of attempts on the question and the time taken.  At the end of the quiz, print the average number of attempts and the average time taken.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the correct output, as specified above, a complete assignment will include your code in the style described and demonstrated in the textbook with header documentation (your name, your student number, assignment number, program name, date written, problem statement, input, output, algorithm, major variables, assumptions, and program limitations) and inline documentation.  Output will be assessed by the markers.
</p>
<p> You are not required to submit the assignments, but you are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to do so.  
You will receive feedback on your assignments in the areas of 
header documentation, inline documentation, code, and output, all according to the following rubric.
Although you will not receive a grade for the correctness of your work, you will receive credit towards your
participation in the class based on the effort you make to correctly complete the assignment.
That is why 'effort' is the 5th criterion in the rubric.
</p>
<h1>Submission</h1>
<p>By the due date, <a href="https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/assign/view.php?id=430549">upload 2 files</a>:
<ul><li>your C++ program source file (it likely has a .cpp extension) for each part</li>
</ul>
If you do not submit your C++ program source files, your effort will be rated as "Unacceptable."</p>
