<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>
Write a program to read up to 20 integers from a file and store the integers in an array of integer type.  
With the values in the array, compute and display the following:
<ul>
<li>minimum: smallest value in the array</li>
<li>maximum: largest value in the array</li>
<li>mean: average of all values in the array</li>
<li>median: the value in the middle of the array once all values have been sorted.  If there is no single index at the middle of the array, average the values in the 2 adjacent spots.  For example: if the array has 3 values (with indices 0,1,2), once the array is sorted the median will be at index 1.  If the array has 4 values (with indices 0,1,2,3), once the array is sorted the median will be the average of the values at indices 2 and 3.</li>
<li>mode: find the value in the array which occurs most often.  A straightforward approach is possible once the array is sorted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use a function for each computation/output specified above.  You will also need to include a sort function: see Listing 7.11 from the text.</p>

<p>
In addition to the correct output, as specified above, a complete assignment will include your code in the style described and demonstrated in the textbook with header documentation (your name, your student number, assignment number, program name, date written, problem statement, input, output, algorithm, major variables, assumptions, and program limitations) and inline documentation.  Output will be assessed by the markers.
</p>
<p> You are not required to submit the assignments, but you are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to do so.  
You will receive feedback on your assignments in the areas of 
header documentation, inline documentation, code, and output, all according to the following rubric.
Although you will not receive a grade for the correctness of your work, you will receive credit towards your
participation in the class based on the effort you make to correctly complete the assignment.
That is why 'effort' is the 5th criterion in the rubric.
</p>
<h1>Submission</h1>
<p>By the due date, <a href="https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/assign/view.php?id=430552">upload 1 file</a>:
<ul><li>your C++ program source file (it likely has a .cpp extension)</li>
</ul>
If you do not submit your C++ program source file, your effort will be rated as "Unacceptable."  In order for your effort to rated as "Satisfactory" or "Excellent", your source file must compile without errors.</p>
