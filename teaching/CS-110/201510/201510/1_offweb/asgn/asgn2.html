<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a telephone number in the format ddd-ddd-dddd, where d is digit.  This is the format for telephone numbers in North America.
Test that the input is in the correct format and further check if the phone number has a Canadian area code (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_Numbering_Plan_area_codes#Canada">list of Canadian area codes</a>).
The program will report if the input is valid or not. If the input includes a Canadian area code, the program will display the name of the province or territory with that area code.  The program will continue to process numbers until the user enters the letter <em>q</em>.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the correct output, as specified above, a complete assignment will include your code in the style described and demonstrated in the textbook with header documentation (your name, your student number, assignment number, program name, date written, problem statement, input, output, algorithm, major variables, assumptions, and program limitations) and inline documentation.  Output will be assessed by the markers.
</p>
<p> You are not required to submit the assignments, but you are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to do so.  
You will receive feedback on your assignments in the areas of 
header documentation, inline documentation, code, and output, all according to the following rubric.
Although you will not receive a grade for the correctness of your work, you will receive credit towards your
participation in the class based on the effort you make to correctly complete the assignment.
That is why 'effort' is the 5th criterion in the rubric.
</p>
<h1>Submission</h1>
<p>By the due date, <a href="https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/assign/view.php?id=430549">upload 1 file</a>:
<ul><li>your C++ program source file (it likely has a .cpp extension)</li>
</ul>
If you do not submit your C++ program source file, your effort will be rated as "Unacceptable."</p>
