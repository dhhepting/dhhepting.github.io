<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Modify Assignment 1 code so that the calculations it does are located within a function.  The main() function that calls this function should let the user input any desired about of numbers, until a negative number is input.</li>
<li>Modify Assignment 2 so that the validation of the telephone format is done in one function and the test to see if the area code is from Canada is done in another function.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
In addition to the correct output, as specified above, a complete assignment will include your code in the style described and demonstrated in the textbook with header documentation (your name, your student number, assignment number, program name, date written, problem statement, input, output, algorithm, major variables, assumptions, and program limitations) and inline documentation.  Output will be assessed by the markers.
</p>
<p> You are not required to submit the assignments, but you are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to do so.  
You will receive feedback on your assignments in the areas of 
header documentation, inline documentation, code, and output, all according to the following rubric.
Although you will not receive a grade for the correctness of your work, you will receive credit towards your
participation in the class based on the effort you make to correctly complete the assignment.
That is why 'effort' is the 5th criterion in the rubric.
</p>
