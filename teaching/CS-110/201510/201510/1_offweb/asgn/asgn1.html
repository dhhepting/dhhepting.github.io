<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>
Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 10000 and then calculates and displays (from the integer that has been read):
<ul>
<li>the number of digits</li>
<li>the sum of all the digits</li>
<li>the average of all the digits</li>
<li>the product of all of the digits</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: if the number 2468 is input then your program should generate the following output:
<ul>
<li>Number of digits: 4</li>
<li>Sum of digits: 20</li>
<li>Average of digits: 5</li>
<li>Product of digits: 384</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: if the number 5070 is input then your program should generate the following output:
<ul>
<li>Number of digits: 4</li>
<li>Sum of digits: 12</li>
<li>Average of digits: 3</li>
<li>Product of digits: 0</li>
</ul> 
</p>
<p>
In addition to the correct output, as specified above, a complete assignment will include your code in the style described and demonstrated in the textbook with header documentation (your name, your student number, assignment number, program name, date written, problem statement, input, output, algorithm, major variables, assumptions, and program limitations) and inline documentation.  It will also include a demonstration of the output produced by your program (from <a href="http://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/110/screenShot.html">Visual Studio</a> or <a href="http://www.cs.uregina.ca/Links/class-info/110/introduction/script.html">Hercules</a>).
</p>
<p> You are not required to submit the assignments, but you are <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> to do so.  
You will receive feedback on your assignments in the areas of 
header documentation, inline documentation, code, and output, all according to the following rubric.
Although you will not receive a grade for the correctness of your work, you will receive credit towards your
participation in the class based on the effort you make to correctly complete the assignment.
That is why 'effort' is the 5th criterion in the rubric.
</p>
<h1>Submission</h1>
<p>By the due date, <a href="https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/assign/view.php?id=430548">upload 2 files</a>:
<ul><li>your C++ program source file (likely .cpp extension)</li>
<li>your log file (hercules) or screenshot (Visual Studio) that demonstrates your program's output, using the following inputs:
<ul>
<li>2468</li>
<li>5070</li>
<li>42</li>
<li>23451</li>
</ul></li></ul></p>
