<br><b>Topics:</b> Students will choose a topic for presentation subject to the following guidelines:<br><p></p><p></p><ul style="list-style-type:disc;"><li><b>Honours students: </b>You should choose a topic in consultation with the Department’s Undergraduate Coordinator (or with their approval, in consultation with some other faculty member in the Department that has agreed to act in this capacity). The proposed presentation should describe material beyond that covered in any course that you have previously taken. The presentation may take the form of a survey, a description of a system or implementation, or a presentation of original research results.</li><li><b>Graduate students (first presentation in their program):</b> You should choose a topic that allows familiarity with relevant research literature to be demonstrated. Research papers from a minimum of three research groups must be cited. The presentation may take the form of a survey of existing research work, or a presentation of a new idea with a comparison to existing work. You must submit photocopies of the title page and abstract for three research papers.</li><li><b>Graduate students (second presentation in their program):</b> You should choose a topic related to your own research. The presentation must include some original research ideas and results.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><b>NOTE: The proposed presentation MUST be different from any of those given in other courses (i.e., recycled material is NOT allowed). However, with the approval of the coordinators, exceptions to this policy may be considered for presentations recently given, or soon to be given, at a relevant academic conference.</b><br></p><p><span><b>Presentation Format:</b> On your scheduled presentation date, you will be briefly introduced by one of the coordinators. The floor will then be yours and you will be given 18 to 20 minutes (no more, no less) to make your presentation. The next 5 minutes will be devoted to discussion, where the audience will be given the opportunity to ask you questions, and you will be given the opportunity to respond. To help facilitate the discussion, a group consisting of CS499 and CS900 students will be selected to ask questions following your presentation. Of course, other students and faculty members are also strongly encouraged to participate in the discussion. However, we do ask that all questions be held until the formal part of your presentation is complete.</span></p><p><span>Since the material that you are presenting will have been reviewed by both your supervisor and the coordinators, it is expected that this component of your presentation will be of high quality. However, if at any time during your presentation, it becomes clear to the coordinators that you are not prepared (e.g., you don’t seem to know the material, you failed to adequately rehearse) you will be notified. At this point, you, your supervisor, and the coordinators will discuss the remedial action required to address the problems with your presentation. Once these problems have been addressed to the satisfaction of your supervisor and the coordinators, you need to re-record your presentation (during online seminars). Whenever possible, it will be re-scheduled later in the Seminar Series of the current semester. If that is not possible, it will be scheduled in the Seminar Series of a subsequent semester.<br></span></p><p><b>Preparation Suggestions:</b> Preparation for your presentation is entirely your responsibility. You may find some helpful material regarding the preparation of technical material from your supervisors. Some guidelines and suggestions are described below.</p><p><span><b>Physical Presentation:<br></b></span><span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">Your presentation should utilize the PC and data projector provided in the classroom to display a series of PowerPoint/PDF (or equivalent) slides. If any other special equipment is required, please ensure that it is available on the date scheduled for your presentation and, prior to that date, check that it will work in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;"><span><b>Online Presentation:</b><br>You can record your presentation using OBS, Zoom, or similar methods. For a high quality presentation, record at least in 1080p 60fps or 4K 60fps (if you have a 4K monitor) and set up shortcuts for pausing the recording in OBS if you are interrupted. Upload the video to YouTube unlisted and submit the link of your presentation to the submission folder. Use an external microphone when possible (an external headset, high quality hands-free, or a Blue Snowball/Yeti or similar external microphones). Record a few videos and make sure the quality of sound and picture is satisfactory before recording your full presentation.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p></p><p>When preparing your presentation, aim for 10-15 slides as a rough guideline. Of course, the number of slides is contingent upon the style of your presentation and the content on each slide. However, if you have fewer than 10 slides, or more than 15, you will likely have some problems satisfying the 18 to 20 minute presentation length requirement. Also, use large font sizes and do not clutter your slides with too many points. Points should be clearly delineated, and the structure of your talk should be apparent by the heading and/or numbering scheme used. Use colour, whenever necessary or appropriate, to augment your presentation, but be sure to use colours that are easily differentiated when projected. Slides containing details that cannot be easily read by the audience are <b>NOT </b>acceptable.</p><p>The liberal use of pertinent diagrams, figures, and graphs is strongly encouraged. However, photocopying from research papers, textbooks, or other technical material is seldom appropriate. Be sure that pertinent details in your diagrams, figures, and graphs are obvious and easily read by the audience.</p><p>The method of presentation is important. For example, a blackboard lecture is <b>NOT </b>an acceptable substitute for a PowerPoint/PDF (or equivalent) presentation. It is okay if you need to provide additional details on the blackboard in response to a question from the audience or to clarify an important point. But if you find yourself making a blackboard lecture in parallel to your PowerPoint/PDF (or equivalent) presentation, it likely means that you needed additional content in your presentation.</p><p><b>Online Video: </b>If you would like to use a pen and touch screen to write something on screen, feel free to do so if needed considering the previous point.</p><p>The liberal use of <b>examples</b> is also strongly encouraged. When you introduce new terminology, provide a formal definition for a term, state a general condition/requirement, or state a theorem /axiom/principle/conjecture, it is often useful to provide an example, at an appropriate level of detail, describing the ideas in practical and concrete terms. Try to structure an example so that it builds upon previous examples by using the same base data/scenarios/context. In this way, the size, scope, and complexity of your examples increases as your audience becomes familiar with your material. But remember, most people in the audience will not have the same comfort with, or understanding of, your topic as you do.</p><p></p><p><span>And our objective is not to baffle the audience, but to transmit some knowledge, even if for some it’s just at the most fundamental or rudimentary level.</span></p><p></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The walk-through and discussion of an algorithm, without the support of a detailed example demonstrating its operation, is <b>NOT </b>acceptable. Consequently, you should not waste time during your presentation by walking through an algorithm line-by-line. If an algorithm merits discussion, you should plan on a general overview sufficient to describe the significant characteristics/nuances that make it unique/novel. The remainder of your discussion should then focus on a detailed example describing the operation of the algorithm as it is intended to be used in practice, again highlighting the significant characteristics/nuances, as required.</span></p><p><span>Finally, actually standing in front of an audience or recording an online presentation and knowing what to say is very different from going over your presentation in your mind while it is being prepared. If you have little or no public speaking experience, you may want to try rehearsing your presentation for time, content, and clarity. This could reveal weaknesses in how the presentation flows, deficiencies in the details, or errors.<br></span></p><p><b>Attendance:</b> The guidelines for attendance will be described at the first meeting. Please note that you must actually attend a presentation to receive credit. It is not sufficient to merely arrive at the end of a presentation and sign the attendance sheet.</p><p><b>Attendance Evaluation (<b>Online Delivery)&nbsp;</b>:</b>&nbsp;You will be provided with a template form to complete for each presentation video. This template may include the following: (1) Summary/Abstract of the presentation in your own words, (2) A full question and the answer based on the presentation (3) Three components of the presentation that you liked and (4) Three components of the presentation that could have been improved.&nbsp;<br></p><p><b>Participation:</b> At each Seminar Series presentation, a group consisting of CS499 and CS900 students will be appointed to a panel whose responsibility it is to ask the speaker pertinent questions (i.e., questions that have potential to stimulate some scientific discussion) regarding the presentation. To assist the coordinators in keeping track of the questions asked by the panel members, a <i>Seminar Panel Question Sheet </i>form will be provided to each panel member and must be submitted to the coordinators at the end of the presentation. Please note that you must actually ask the question to receive credit. It is not sufficient to merely complete and submit the form.</p><p><b>Participation (Online Delivery): </b>For each presentation, you are required to ask pertinent questions (i.e., questions that have potential to stimulate some scientific discussion) regarding the presentation in a Q &amp; A section in UR Courses. The presenter will then be required to reply and answer those questions.<br></p><p><b>Evaluation:</b> Your mark will be determined based upon four components, as follows: 10% for your abstract, 20% for attendance, 20% for participation, and 50% for the presentation. Your attendance and participation will be recorded after each presentation on the <i>Seminar Evaluation Sheet</i>. Presentations will be evaluated on the basis of organization, content, style, and delivery, as described on the <span><i>Presentation Evaluation Sheet</i></span>. You must receive a mark of at least 70% on the presentation component in order to receive credit for CS499 or CS900. If you do not receive a mark of at least 70% on the presentation component, you will be given the opportunity to undertake remedial work that focuses on resolving the particular deficiencies in your presentation. The nature of the remedial work is at the discretion of the coordinators, but will include, at a minimum, revisions to your presentation to address the particular deficiencies and another short presentation to your supervisor and the coordinators at a later date, where these will be discussed. You must also receive an overall average mark, based upon the four components, of at least 70% to receive credit for CS499 or CS900.</p><p></p><p><b>Evaluation (Online Delivery):</b>&nbsp;Your mark will be determined based upon four components, as follows: 10% for the abstract, 20% for attendance, 20% for participation, and 50% for the presentation.
