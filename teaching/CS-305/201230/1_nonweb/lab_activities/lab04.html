<h1>Lab Activity 4: Grounded Theory</h1>
<p>As a substitute for field studies in our class, we will examine
discussions in user forums as a means of understanding the issues that
users identify with software.</p>
<p>Grounded theory, described in the text in Section 8.6.1 (starting page 297),
can be used as a framework to guide this examination.  Grounded theory begins by
looking to the data first, then developing theory later -- therefore theory becomes
grounded in the data (hence the name!).</p>
Begin with "open coding"
of messages, looking for ideas that are explicitly and implicitly expressed in 
each message. (See Table 8.5 for an example.)  Then take the results of the open
coding for all messages considered and work to structure them and to 
organize them into themes ("axial coding").  Selective coding would follow as part of
developing a theory. For this activity, I ask that you write a (problem) <a href="../lecture_plans/scenarios.html">scenario</a> to
describe the results of your analysis (open and axial coding).
<ol>
<li>Choose a thread in the moodle (URCourses) user forum [<a href="http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=5">http://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=5</a>] with at least 10 entries.  If there are many more than 10, choose 10 substantive, representative messages from the thread.</li>
<li>Create a version of Table 8.5 with the messages from your selected discussion and your open coding</li>
<li>Perform axial coding to identify themes and relationships between them</li>
<li>Prepare 1 problem scenario based on your findings</li>
</ol>
