<h1>Design</h1>
<p>
Based on your requirements, design! Consider (see sec. 11.3.1)
which interface metaphors would be suitable to help users understand the product,
which interaction type(s) would best support the users' activities, and whether different
interface types suggest alternative design insights or options.
construct 2 (or more) alternative designs that fulfill your requirements.
Create low-fidelity prototypes (Sec. 11.2.3) and scenarios (Sec 11.5) to describe them.
Analyze each scenario for pros and cons.  Further iterations should seek to minimize the negatives
and accentuate the positives.
The goal is to engage in the iterative design process, therefore show some iterations of your
work.
