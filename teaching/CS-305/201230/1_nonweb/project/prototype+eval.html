Following our discussion in class November 13, 
the goal this portion of the project is to develop
two (2) of your designs into high-fidelity prototypes
that can evaluated.  At the end of this, please comment
on how which of your designs you would choose to develop
further, and with what modifications you see being desirable.</p>
<ul>
<li>In CogTool, model your tasks in both of your interface designs</li>
<li>use "Export to HTML" (see notes about how to activate it in CogTool), or other means, 
to a create high-fidelity prototype ("scenario machine") for your tasks.  The interface should
appear as very complete with respect to your task (but other details need not be present).  It
should handle all task-related input gracefully.</li>
<li>Conduct a usability test with a participant.  Everyone should do 1 test and be a participant for another [across groups].  I will be available to fill-in as necessary.  This was intended to follow from the last lab activity, which did not go off as planned due to the weather.</li>
<li>Analyse results, identify better interface (and why)</li>
</ul>

<p>This part of the project is worth 10 marks, with the following distribution.</p>
