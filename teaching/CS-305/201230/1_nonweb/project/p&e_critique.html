<h1>Prototyping & Evaluation Critique (Individual Assignment)</h1>
<p>
Critique the work of the other group.  Submit the single file containing your work.
The change in schedule has made the timing of this assignment difficult.  I propose
that you critique the material presented by the other group in their presentation, and
that group will get any feedback at the time of the presentation.  Your written critique
will be due a few days later.</p>
<p>Total marks: 3.33</p>
