		<h1>
			Marking Policies
		</h1>
		<p>
			In the usual case when I have marking support for a course,
			I endeavour to mark the exams myself and the markers focus
			on grading the course work, in consultation with me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have begun using
			<a href="https://gradescope.com/">
				gradescope.com
			</a>
			as a tool to grade exams more quickly and transparently.
			Two main advantages, as I see them, are:
			<ul>
				<li>
					students retain an electronic copy of their exams
				</li>
				<li>
					a grading rubric is created for each question 
					that permits typed comments
					(which are more legible for everyone)
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal for all grading during the semester is to have it complete 
			within 2 weeks of submission.
		</p>
		<p>
			When there is group work submitted, every student has the opportunity to rate
			all members of their group.  These ratings are due at the same as the assigned
			group work.  The calculations, described in the 
			<a href="groupwork.html">
				Group Work Policies
			</a>
			will be carried out by the marker once the time for submissions has passed
			and students will be notified when their ratings by the group are available.
		</p>
		<p>
			The marker will archive from URcourses all submissions for each assigned work			
			and will nominate some exemplars from those submissions. I will review the 
			selections and seek permission from the students who submitted the exemplars
			for some limited sharing of their work.
			Only the exemplars may be shared outside of the secure URcourses environment,
			but only if explicit permission has been obtained.
		</p>
