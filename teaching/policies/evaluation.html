		<h1>
			Teaching Evaluation Policies
		</h1>
		<p>
			I take my teaching seriously and I am always willing to hear from
			students about ways that I can improve.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a sign of this commitment, I have provided a link to 
			<a href="http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=34540">
				my reviews on <tt>ratemyprofessors.com</tt>
			</a>.
			If you are interested in my teaching, please look at all the sources
			described on this page.
		</p>
		<p>
			I request feedback from students in my classes at various times during the semester 
			(at the midterm exam(s) and at the final exam).  
			Midterm feedback is formative (I will look at these results 
			immediately and discuss them with my students) and final feedback 
			is summative (and I will not look at these until my grades have been submitted).
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="/~hepting/assets/pdfs/teaching/feedback-instrument.pdf">
					Feedback instrument
				</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The Faculty of Science also collects summative feedback about my teaching.  Whereas
			this was once done on paper during class time, 
			it is now done online during the students' own time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since 2016, I have been making all feedback data available on the web.
			This data resides in the feedback directory for each course, as follows:
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>
				/~hepting/teaching/<a href="../bycourse.html">&lt;course&gt;</a>/<a href="../bysemester.html">&lt;semester&gt;</a>/feedback/<br />
				<a href="/~hepting/teaching/cs428+828/201630/feedback/">/~hepting/teaching/cs428+828/201630/feedback/</a>
			</code> 
		</p>
		<p>
			The last directory above contains the feedback data regarding CS 428/828 
			that I taught in the Fall semester of 2016.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each feedback directory will be organized in the following way,
			if all data is available:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Formative feedback from my instrument, collected at or near the midterm exam(s)
			</li>
			<li>
				Summative feedback from my instrument and the Faculty of Science instrument
			</li>
			<li>
				Weighted Average of Quantitative Ratings from Summative Evaluations
			</li>
			<li>
				My Reflections after Semester
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I provide a numerical summary of each data set; 
			a box and whisker plot of the quantitative data; 
			and word cloud summaries of the answers to each of the open-ended questions 
			(unless there are very few written answers per question). 
			I understand why
			<a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/10/word-clouds-considered-harmful/">
				&ldquo;Word clouds considered harmful&rdquo;
			</a>
			by some, in some cases.
			I think that they are appropriate here because they are engaging and 
			allow a different way to look at the text.
			I use 
			<a href="https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/">
				<tt>
					https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/
				</tt>
			</a>
			to generate each word cloud and save it in SVG for the web.
		</p>
		<p>
			The input text is processed so that it has 1 lowercase (unless it is
			a proper noun or an abbreviation) word per line.  I remove whitespace
			and punctuation but leave apostrophes.  I otherwise leave the words as
			they are.  I don't change plural forms to singular forms, for example.
		</p>
		<p>
			My instrument and the one from the Faculty of Science have mostly different 
			questions and different scales.
			My scale has 5 points (Always &mdash; Never) and the Faculty of Science scale 
			has 4 points (Strongly Agree &mdash; Strongly Disagree). 
			I normalize both scores and multiply by the number of respondents
			to each to yield the weighted average.
		</p>

			Here is the list of my courses with feedback data available:
