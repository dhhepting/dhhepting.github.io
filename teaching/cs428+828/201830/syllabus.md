Promises:
“In short, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument with (other) enthusiasts for artificial
intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant future of cerebration to machines
alone. There will nevertheless be a fairly long interim during which the main intellectual
advances will be made by men and computers working together in intimate association. A
multidisciplinary study group, examining future research and development problems of
the Air Force, estimated that it would be 1980 before developments in artificial
intelligence make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving
of military significance. That would leave, say, five years to develop [hu]man-computer
symbiosis and 15 years to use it. The 15 may be 10 or 500, but those years should be
intellectually the most creative and exciting in the history of mankind.”
-- J. C. R. Licklider (head of DARPA), 1960
We are now living in those most creative and exciting years in the history of mankind and
this class will help you to engage in them fully.
You will come to know, through doing, that design is hard (yet worthwhile!): you need to
start somewhere, to jump in and get your hands dirty, to begin without judgment and
respond with reflection. You will glimpse what is exciting, empowering, and important
about interaction design. You will gain sensitivity to the impacts of interaction design on
real people. You will see the necessity of a multidisciplinary perspective. You will think
critically, creatively, and computationally about designs and design problems using the
foundational concepts of this discipline.
