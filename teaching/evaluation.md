I take my teaching seriously and I am always willing to hear from students about
ways that I can improve.
As a sign of this commitment, I provide a link to
[my reviews on]( http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=34540) <tt>ratemyprofessors.com</tt>.
If you are interested in my teaching,
please also look at the other sources described here.

I give my students the opportunity to provide their written feedback to me at exam times
(midterm and final).
Midterm feedback is formative (I will look at these results immediately and discuss them with my students) and final feedback is summative (I will not look at these until my grades have been submitted).

The Faculty of Science also collects summative feedback about my teaching.
Whereas this was once done on paper during class time,
it is now done online during the students' own time.

I am undertaking the posting to the web of the feedback that I receive.
I provide a numerical summary of each data set and word cloud summaries of the
responses to each of the open-ended questions on my feedback instrument.

I understand why [&ldquo;word clouds considered harmful&rdquo;]( http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/10/word-clouds-considered-harmful/) by some,
in some cases.
I think that they are appropriate here because they are engaging and allow a
different way to look at the text.
I use [<tt>https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/</tt>]( https://www.jasondavies.com/wordcloud/)
to generate the word clouds and save them in SVG for the web.
I don't do any processing on the text that I create while transcribing the responses.

My instrument and the one from the Faculty of Science have mostly different
questions and different scales.
My scale has 5 points (Always &mdash; Never) and the Faculty of Science scale
has 4 points (Strongly Agree &mdash; Strongly Disagree). For both,
higher scores are better.

I compute the Weighted Rating for a course offering by multiplying each of the two
summative scores by the number of respondents who determined that score, summing the
results and dividing by the total number of respondents.  The result is expressed
as a percentage.
