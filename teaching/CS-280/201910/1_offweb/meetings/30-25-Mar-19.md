  * Request for Comments:
  I've also prepared some questions which you could answer instead of (or in addition to) the open-ended request above.

    1. What positive aspects or implications of computing would you like to see receive more critical attention?
    1. What negative aspects or implications of computing would you like to see receive more critical attention?
    1. What consequences do you see if these aspects are neglected?
    1. What sorts of things could or should be done about the aspects or implications generally?
    1. What role do you see for professional organizations like the ACM in this regard?
