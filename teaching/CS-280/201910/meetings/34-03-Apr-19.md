* [Boeing details its fix for the 737 MAX, but defends the original design](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-details-its-fix-for-the-737-max-but-defends-the-original-design/)
> _Reporters asked whether increased cockpit automation, combined with pilots around the world becoming less familiar with manual flying techniques, is introducing new hazards that the industry needs to address. Boeing countered that the recent history of aviation safety has been stellar and does not indicate “any systemic failure in how the world designs, builds and tests airplanes and trains flight crews.”_
* [The emerging 737 Max scandal, explained](https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2019/3/29/18281270/737-max-faa-scandal-explained)
> _One emblem of the whole situation is that as the 737 Max engineering team piled kludge on top of kludge, they came up with a cockpit warning light that would alert the pilots if the plane’s two angle-of-attack sensors disagreed.
But then, as Jon Ostrower reported for the Air Current, Boeing’s team decided to make the warning light an optional add-on, like how car companies will upcharge you for a moon roof.
The light cost $80,000 extra per plane and neither Lion Air nor Ethiopian chose to buy it, perhaps figuring that Boeing would not sell a plane (nor would the FAA allow it to) that was not basically safe to fly. In the wake of the crashes, Boeing has decided to revisit this decision and make the light standard on all aircraft._
