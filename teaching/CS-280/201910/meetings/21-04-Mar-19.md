### Today
* continue our discussion of an oath for computer professionals

* "Information retrieval tools such as Google are extraordinarily democratizing"
  * [definition of "democratize" from Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=dictionary#dobs=democratize)

* From 2008: "Providing what most people want
creates a tyranny of the majority
and a bias against minority interests. When we searched for
“spears,” for example, we got back
three pages of results about Britney
Spears and her sister, with only
three exceptions: a link to Spears
Manufacturing, which produces
PVC piping; one to comedian Aries
Spears; and one to Prof. William M.
Spears of the University of
Wyoming. Ironically, Prof. Spears’s
web page ranked far below
“Britney Spears’ Guide to Semiconductor Physics,” a site maintained
by some light-hearted physicists at
the University of Essex in the UK.
That site has a distinctive URL,
britneyspears.ac — where “.ac”
stands not for “academic” but for
“Ascension Island” (which gets a
few pennies for use of the .ac URL,
wherever in the world the site may
be hosted). Whatever the precise
reason for this site’s high ranking,
the association with Britney probably didn’t hurt!"
