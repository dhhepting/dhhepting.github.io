  <dd>
    From the TED website:
    <blockquote>
    &ldquo;Is your school or workplace divided between the "creatives" versus the practical people? Yet surely, David Kelley suggests, creativity is not the domain of only a chosen few. Telling stories from his legendary design career and his own life, he offers ways to build the confidence to create.&rdquo;

    From the TED website:
    <blockquote>
    &ldquo;Carol Dweck researches &lsquo;growth mindset&rsquo; &mdash; the idea that we can grow our brain&rsquo;s capacity to learn and to solve problems. In this talk, she describes two ways to think about a problem thatâ€™s slightly too hard for you to solve. Are you not smart enough to solve it ... or have you just not solved it yet? A great introduction to this influential field.&rdquo;
