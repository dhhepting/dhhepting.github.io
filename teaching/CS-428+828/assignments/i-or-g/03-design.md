### Description

Based on your requirements, design!

Write a scenario, based on your requirements, that describes WHAT your new interactive activity will provide to the user. Then, work to create two different designs for HOW the interaction will be accomplished.

Recall the diagram that [illustrated the article about Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) from the Nielsen Norman Group. We are now moving to the explore phase.

The focus now shifts from understanding the problem to proposing solutions.
Using your requirements (and considering the feedback that you will receive), state what the user will do.

Then consider how the user will do it:
* which interface metaphors (see Sections 2.3, 2.4, and 11.3.1) would be suitable to help users understand the activities
* which interaction type(s) (see Section 2.5) would best support the users' activities
* whether different interface types suggest alternative design insights or options

Design 2 alternative interfaces from 2 different metaphors:
* Create a low-fidelity prototype (see Section 11.2.3)
* Write a scenario (see Section 11.5) that includes details of "HOW" (information design and interaction design)
* Analyze each scenario for positives and negatives
* Iterate your low-fidelity prototypes and scenarios to minimize the negatives and maximize the positives

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document (1 per group) on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084)
