### Description

Based on your designs, test!

Recall the diagram that [illustrated the article about Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) from the Nielsen Norman Group. We are in the materialize phase.

Based on your experience with your project and your testing of your low-fidelity prototypes, create a single high-fidelity design of your interface that combines the best features from your two low-fidelity prototypes.  This high-fidelity prototype should
be executable on a computer and create an interactive simulation of your interface to perform your task.

There are 2 parts to this assignment, as [discussed in class meeting 31](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/tqs9ysy2l5bi4hf/31%20-%201.jpg?dl=0):
* present the choices you made, along with your rationale, in deciding on the interface you designed following your low-fidelity prototypes A and B.
* provide the means for the instructor and marker to view and interact with your high-fidelity prototype.

Include directions for viewing your work in the document that describes your design choices.

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document (1 per group) on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084)
