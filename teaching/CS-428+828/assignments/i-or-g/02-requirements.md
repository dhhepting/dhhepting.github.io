### Description

Establish requirements for your redesign effort by considering user issues around
one feature or activity that users may perform with the application or website.

Recall the diagram that [illustrated the article about Design Thinking](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) from the Nielsen Norman Group.
There are 3 phases depicted: understand, explore, and materialize. The understand phase,
comprising empathize and define steps, is the focus of this assignment. You should focus on
well-defined activities that users are trying to perform.

1. empathize: do this by first creating one or more empathy maps for the activities
1. define: identify specific aspects of the current interface that cause problems for the users and create requirements (see the [Volere Snow Card](http://www.volere.co.uk/snowcard.pdf) [and notes](http://www.volere.co.uk/pdf%20files/06%20Atomic%20Requirements.pdf), illusrated in the textbook, for an idea about the kinds of details to capture)

Remember that this phase is still concerned with articulating the problem.
No solutions should appear here. That will come later.

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document (1 per group) on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084)

			Write <em>about 1 paragraph</em> for each of the following headings
			(template items 6-17 that deal with requirements will be treated separately).
			<ul>
				<li>
					Project Drivers (template items 1,2)
				</li>
				<li>
					Project Constraints (template items 3-5)
				</li>
				<li>
					Project Issues (template items 18-27)
				</li>
			</ul>

			"When you have a requirement that is measurable, testable, traceable and
			detailed enough to define all aspects of a need without further breakdown
			then you have an atomic requirement. You can think of the atomic
			requirements as the lowest level requirements. In fact the collection of
			atomic requirements specifies everything we require the solution to do."

			The specifics of each requirement should written using the general structure of the
