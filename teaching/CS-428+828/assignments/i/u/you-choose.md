Consider the class themes that we have discussed and will consider.

[Topic and Learning Outcomes]({{ "/teaching/CS-428+828/topics.html" | relative_url }})
for a guide.

Write approximately 1000 words (or equivalent)
about your chosen topic as an essay or
you are welcome to consider other forms of deliverable that are more meaningful to you &mdash; such as a book report or a wikipedia posting.
It must deal with class themes in some way,
and your idea about that connection are important.
You might focus your efforts on researching smaller assessment questions (from [Topic and Learning Outcomes]({{ "/teaching/CS-428+828/topics.html" | relative_url }})),

writing some code to test an idea, and so forth.

Your submission should include between 2 and 4 external references (
[NOT wikipedia]({{ "/teaching/wikipedia.html" | relative_url }})).
