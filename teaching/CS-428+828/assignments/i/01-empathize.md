### Description

You have been given instructor access to a [course on URcourses]( https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2168).
You are asked to complete a task as a means to experiencing the interface as an instructor, and then reflect on your experience with interface. You are asked to do 3 things in this assignment:

1. Perform a task within URcourses:
  * claim 1 topic by changing the label to your own name (there are enough blank topics for everyone - so be nice and don't claim someone else's topic!)
  * add to your topic:
    * 1 resource
    * 1 activity that can be assigned a grade

1. Create an empathy map as you complete this task.

1. Describe the opportunities for redesign, if any, that you find.

### Submission

* submit a [pdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF) document on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084)
