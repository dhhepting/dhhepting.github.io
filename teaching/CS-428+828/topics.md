		<h3>HCI/Foundations</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="card-body">
		<h5>Motivation</h5>
		<p>
		For end-users, the interface is the system. 
		So design in this domain must be interaction-focused and human-centered. 
		Students need a different repertoire of techniques to address this 
		than is provided elsewhere in the curriculum.
		</p>
		
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-6">
				<h5>Topics</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
					Contexts for HCI (anything with a user interface, 
							e.g., webpage, business applications, mobile applications, and games)
						</li>
						<li>
							Processes for user-centred development, 
							e.g., early focus on users, empirical testing, iterative design
						</li>
						<li>
							Different measures for evaluation, 
							e.g., utility, efficiency, learnability, user satisfaction
						</li>
						<li>
							Usability heuristics and the principles of usability testing
						</li>
						<li>
							Physical capabilities that inform interaction design, 
							e.g., colour perception, ergonomics

			<h3>HCI/Design-Oriented HCI</h3>
