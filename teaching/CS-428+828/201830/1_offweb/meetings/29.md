### Administration

* Group Assignment: Testing Lo-Fi

You are asked to coordinate your testing with other members of your Evaluation Group - who are not members of your Project
Group.

You will have created your script and other testing materials by working with members of your Project Group.

At the end of Meeting 28 (Friday), I used the example of Bob, Jim, and Sue being part of the same Evaluation Group but different Project Groups. In the following table and below, P1 is Pair 1, P2 is Pair 2, and P3 is Pair 3.

<div class="table-responsive">
  <table class="table table-bordered table-striped">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Tester
            </th>
            <th>
                Subject for Tester's Interface A
            </th>
            <th>
                Subject for Tester's Interface B
            </th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Bob (P1,P3)
            </td>
            <td>
                Jim (P1)
            </td>
            <td>
                Sue (P3)
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Jim (P1,P2)
            </td>
            <td>
                Bob (P1)
            </td>
            <td>
                Sue (P2)
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Sue (P2,P3)
            </td>
            <td>
                Bob (P3)
            </td>
            <td>
                Jim (P2)
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

This requires 3 meetings (to be done in person) of pairs of group members. From the table above, we have:

* P1 - Bob and Jim:
  * Bob tests his Interface A with Jim
  * Jim tests his Interface A with Bob
* P2 - Jim and Sue:
  * Jim tests his Interface B with Sue
  * Sue tests her Interface B with Jim
* P3 - Sue and Bob:
  * Sue tests her Interface A with Bob
  * Bob tests his Interface B with Sue

Meeting in pairs (and doing 2 tests per meeting) might be more flexible than meeting with the whole group (and doing all 6 tests at once).

In order to avoid penalties, please take care of these appointments so Project Groups can submit everything on-time. If you are having trouble making contact with your other Evaluation Group members, please let me know today.
