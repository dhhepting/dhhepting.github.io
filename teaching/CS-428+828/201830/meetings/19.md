### Administration

* Annotations:
  - you sign up for a meeting
  - you take notes and create annotation for meeting
  - you post your annotation to the "Annotation Blog" (with date of meeting AND meeting number as the subject of the post)
  - I will link to it from the meeting page and I will put a checkmark beside your name in the schedule
