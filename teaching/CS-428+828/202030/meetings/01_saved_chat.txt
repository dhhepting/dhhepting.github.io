11:35:45	 From Mitra : It shows for me
11:35:53	 From Daryl Hepting : I have the chat window uo, but please raise your hand if you would like to speak or have a question.
11:36:05	 From Farial Syed : right
11:44:04	 From Ezra Carter : I'm not aware of anyone, but I don't know anyone else in this class :|
11:44:40	 From Shawn Fernandes : there is a 0% complete bar on the dashboard
11:45:43	 From Shawn Fernandes : under the course
11:46:22	 From Daryl Hepting : https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084
11:46:23	 From Shawn Fernandes : it's fine I have access so I guess it doesn't matter.
11:46:56	 From Daryl Hepting : OK
11:47:11	 From Farial Syed : no
11:47:23	 From Urvish Rana : No
11:47:26	 From Jiawen Li : No
11:47:28	 From Mehak : No I think it is accessible
11:47:29	 From Nimishkumar Baldha : No
11:47:30	 From Justin Vincent : No
11:47:33	 From Rahila Dhuka : the course is under past courses fall 2019
11:47:35	 From Nikita : I see it under past courses
12:00:40	 From Rahila Dhuka : yes I agree with that
12:03:31	 From Daryl Hepting : Do you prefer Wikipedia’s use of chevrons (^, v) to mine (>,v)
12:04:28	 From Shawn Fernandes : Yours works
12:04:28	 From Jiawen Li : Im thinking this one is good enough...
12:04:38	 From Urvish Rana : Wikipedia 
12:04:46	 From Aneri Virani : I prefer yours
12:04:49	 From Shivam Amin to Daryl Hepting (Privately) : Because they are a bit confusing. So yours are better ones.
12:04:58	 From Hardik Trivedi : Yours
12:05:11	 From Mehak : Yours
12:05:18	 From Vishva Thummar : yours
12:05:26	 From Jiawen Li : Yours
12:05:32	 From Farial Syed : in my opinion as long as it is consistent in a group of chevrons and makes sense, users gets use to it. 
12:05:35	 From Ezra Carter : I would prefer to use a symbol like '-' for folded. and then use a down-arrow for unfolded. or '+' for folded, and '-' for unfolded.
12:06:38	 From Rahila Dhuka : - and + easy to understand 
12:08:36	 From Justin Vincent : To me, it's because it's like it's the "direction" that the relevant content is going to move, with the right arrow that direction doesn't match the arrow in that layout at least
12:09:16	 From Farial Syed : it works on mobile device
12:09:48	 From Mitra : To me its more intuitive, the v mean to drop down(expand) the content and then the ^ means the opposite to condense the content upwards
12:09:50	 From Mehak : https://www.wikipedia.org we can see chevrons here
12:09:56	 From Hardik Trivedi to Daryl Hepting (Privately) : https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_mouse
12:10:07	 From Hardik Trivedi to Daryl Hepting (Privately) : mobile site
12:10:22	 From Shawn Fernandes : I think Wikipedia way works is because it follows conventional logic. So does the + and - symbols.
12:10:50	 From Shawn Fernandes : by testing
12:11:11	 From Justin Vincent : Also, theoretically, up and down arrows are more universal, where a right arrow would be pointing "backwards" in right-to-left languages
12:11:16	 From Ezra Carter : I think intuitiveness in interface comes from the existence of real worldanalogues
12:11:18	 From Rahila Dhuka : users response or users understanding 
12:11:28	 From Sam Rodgers : Familiarity. 
12:11:40	 From Peter Oseghale : From experience over time
12:11:42	 From Urvish Rana : It is coming from the day to day life
12:11:46	 From Matthew Rupchan : Intuition comes from past experiences and what we expect from them?
12:11:48	 From Mitra : I think partly from past experiences.
12:12:04	 From Aneri Virani : I think intuition is developed from user knowledge, understanding and experience 
12:12:11	 From Farial Syed : general understanding
12:12:27	 From Nathan Slaney : maybe something like instinct, i.e. liking shiny things from once relating that to water
12:16:04	 From Farial Syed : exactly.
12:19:44	 From Urvish Rana : yes we can
12:19:47	 From Shawn Fernandes : it's on
12:19:47	 From Jon Sorensen : We can hear
12:19:47	 From Krishna Murthy S : I can hear her
12:19:54	 From Nathan Slaney : yeah I can hear you
12:19:58	 From Peter Oseghale : I can hear you
12:20:02	 From Jiawen Li : We can hear you
12:21:11	 From Ezra Carter : I like verbal discussions, but also I like chat discussions since you never miss your chance to reply to something you're interested. I remember especially during the classes, we would get some pretty heated discussions, but the conversation needed to be cutoff so class could continue. We had forums, but once we were out of class, we didn't necessarily maintain the same passion for it later. 
12:22:15	 From Farial Syed : thank you guys for the response
12:37:02	 From Shivam Amin to Daryl Hepting (Privately) : Can we choose group members or it will be chosen by you??
