### Administration
* [Attendance](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/attendance/manage.php?id=982198)
* [Calendar](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/calendar/view.php?view=month&time=1569909600&course=2084)

### Questions?
* Design assignment?
* Anyone surprised by the football game?, the attendance?

### Outline for Today

* More feedback:
  * documenting meetings (in addition to photos of board and audio recordings)?
  * should annotations have some structure? Be treated as assignments (not this semester)
* Assignments on course page redesign -- seems to be having some problems, so back to the drawing board for some fine-tuning.
* [Evaluating interfaces]({{ "/teaching/lod/" | relative_url }})
  * typing or clicking?
  * GOMS [KLM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke-level_model)
* Evaluating information: [Card Sorting](https://www.provenbyusers.com/cs_edit.php)
