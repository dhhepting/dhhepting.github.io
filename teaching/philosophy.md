### Short version

- Challenge my students to think deeply and behave ethically.<br /> ( [inspired by the story of Martina Fitzgerald's recollections about Gord Downey and their high school English teacher](

### Longer version

My objectives as a teacher are simple. I seek to:
- inspire students to see that the subject itself is worthy of study and critical reflection and not just for a good mark in the course.  To this end, I often share with students the following excerpt of a commencement speech given by David Foster Wallace: “There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, ‘Morning, boys, how's the water?’ And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, ‘What the hell is water?’”. I encourage students to ask “why?” as well as “how?”.

- provide students with application knowledge of the subject, that goes beyond rote knowledge. I seek to use current examples that we discuss and work through together.

- make a connection with every student. I know that in any class, there will be those who will pass or fail despite whatever I may do.  I also know that in each class there are people with whom I can make a difference and for them especially, I create a friendly atmosphere that is supportive of learning.

- provide a concrete structure for students in terms of well-defined expectations and within this structure; I work to find opportunities for innovation.

- encourage my students to take responsibility for their classroom experience

- respect and honour the perspective of each student
