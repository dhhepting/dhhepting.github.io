I encourage participation from all students in my courses and to that end I provide a variety of opportunities to participate, so that each student can find their own ways to be involved in my courses.

* Attending Meetings and contributing to in-class discussions

* Annotating Course Meetings: take notes from meetings, annotate them with links and other context, and share them on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/my/) (look for details in the Meetings section)
    + [Effective note taking in class (from UNC at Chapel Hill)](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/effective-note-taking-in-class/)
^

* Recording your Attendance at Meetings: on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/my/), available from 5 minutes before the meeting time until 5 minutes after the meeting is over (look for a link in the Meetings section)

* Contributing to Online Discussions: on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/my/), there are 2 discussion forums, one to which students must be subscribed and another from which students may unsubscribe (look for them both in the General Course Information section). In these forums, you may create your own discussion topic or reply to one that is previously existing.

* Visiting me during [Office Hours]({{ "/teaching/schedule/?type=current" | relative_url }}) (in-person or electronically)

* In the Participation section on [URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/my/), you may:
    + Report a "bug" in this course on URcourses (incorrect or outdated material)
    + Report a "bug" on my website
    + Suggest resources (links) that contribute to class
