I encourage participation from all students in my courses and to that end I provide a variety of opportunities to participate, so that each student can find their own ways to be involved in my courses.

### Annotation of Course Meetings

### Recording Attendance at Course Meetings

### Contributing to Online Discussions

### Visiting me during Office Hours (in-person or electronically)
