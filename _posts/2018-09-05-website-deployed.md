My new website, made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
with support from [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/dhhepting/dhhepting.github.io) and [github.com](https://github.com/dhhepting/dhhepting.github.io), is now live.

I have deployed the same website to 2 locations: <http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/> and
<https://dhhepting.github.io/>.
