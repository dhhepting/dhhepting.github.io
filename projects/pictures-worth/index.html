			A Picture's Worth
		</h1>
		<p>
			What does the phrase &ldquo;A picture is worth ten thousand words&rdquo; mean to you?
			Is it more or less meaningful to know that it was written by an 
			advertising executive, to attract clients to his firm?
		</p>
		<p>
			I embarked on this exploration into the origins of <em>this</em> phrase, in 1999, 
			because of my doctoral work in computer-aided visualization.  In an effort
			to use the phrase correctly, I wanted to know whether a picture was worth
			1,000 or 10,000 words. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			A lot has happened since 1999! There is now a wikipedia article entitled 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words">
				&ldquo;A picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo;
			</a>
			that is focused much more broadly than this page.
			Though there are many accounts of the origin of this phrase, agreement is hard to find.
		</p>
		<p>
			From 1999, I believed that Frederick R. Barnard had originated the phrase in 1927.
			Now, I find that current opinion would remove Mr. Barnard from the picture.
<!-- 			It seems clear that  -->
		<p>
			&ldquo;One picture is worth ten thousand words&rdquo; was seemingly coined by 
			Frederick R. Barnard, National Advertising Manager for the 
			Street Railways Advertising Company (offices then in New York, Chicago, and 
			San Francisco).
			The two advertisements which seem to have given rise to the popular phrase 
			appeared in the advertising trade journal called <em>Printers' Ink</em> 
			(now known as <em>Marketing/Communications</em>).
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="1921-dec-8.html">December 8, 1921 (pp. 96-97)</a>
				&ldquo;One Look is Worth A Thousand Words&rdquo;.  
				This ad talks generally about the benefits about advertising with
				pictures on street cars.<br />

				</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="1927-mar-10.html">March 10, 1927 (pp. 114-115)</a>
				&ldquo;One Picture is Worth Ten Thousand Words&rdquo;.  
				This ad uses the specific example of a baking soda ad 
				campaign seemingly done by Barnard's firm.  
				The basic message is the same as the earlier ad, 
				though perhaps Barnard hoped it would be more compelling
				as a Chinese proverb. <br />

				</a>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Various misattributions and misquotations of the phrase are in wide circulation.
			Despite early evidence to the contrary, 
			its continued attribution as a Chinese proverb is still quite prevalent.  
			The confusion between whether a picture is worth one thousand or ten thousand
			words may stem from a 1948 dictionary entry, which otherwise seems to be correct. 		
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>The MacMillan Book of Proverbs, Maxims and Famous Phrases</strong>
			( formerly known as the 
			<strong>The Home Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Familiar Phrases</strong> )
			from 1948 is an early and very informative source about the phrase.
			Editor Burton Egbert Stevenson made the following entry on page 2611 of that
			volume:
			<blockquote>
				One look is worth a thousand words.
				Fred R. Barnard, in <em>Printers' Ink</em>, 8 Dec., 1921, p. 96.
				He changed it to &ldquo;One picture is worth a thousand words&rdquo; 
				in <em>Printers' Ink</em>, 10 March 1927, p. 114, and called it 
				&ldquo;a Chinese proverb&rdquo;, so that people would take it seriously. 
				It was immediately credited to Confucious.
			</blockquote>
		</p>
		<p>
			This establishes the link between the two ads, but this source misquotes
			the 1927 advertisement by copying "a thousand" from 1921 advertisement 
			instead of replacing it by "ten thousand".
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Familiar Quotations: a collection of passages, 
			phrases, and proverbs traced to their sources 
			in ancient and modern literature</strong> by John Bartlett 
			also provides information.  
			Stevenson's error is repeated on page 782 of the 16th edition 
			(edited by Justin Kaplan and published by Little, Brown in 1992) where it 
			credits "One picture is worth a thousand words" as a misattributed 
			"Chinese proverb" and references part of the entry from the 1948 edition
			edited by Stevenson.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>"Nice guys finish seventh": false phrases, 
			spurious sayings, and familiar misquotations</strong> by Ralph Keyes and
			published in 1992 by HarperCollins has a similar account to that of
			Stephenson.  Keyes, however, adds his own twists to the story because
			the phrase "One picture is worth a thousand words" does not appear 
			anywhere in the 1921 ad:
			<blockquote>
				Calling an orphan saying a Chinese proverb gives it a cachet with very
				little risk that its actual source will be discovered.  A deliberate 
				exploitation of this syndrome involved the proverb `One picture is
				worth a thousand words.' 
				This saying first appeared in a 1921 ad in <EM>Printer's Ink</EM> [sic] which
				was written by publicist Frederick Barnard.  Barnard headlined his ad `One
				look is worth a thousand words.'  He attributed this maxim to `a famous
				Japanese philosopher.'  Six years later, Barnard revised the saying to read
				`One picture is worth ten thousand words,' and then republished it in the
				same magazine as a `Chinese proverb.'
				Barnard thought his ploy would give his words added weight.  He was right.
				For a time, <em>Bartlett's</em> identified Barnard's line as `a Chinese
				proverb.'  Other sources attributed his proverb to Confucius.  
				The <em>Macmillan Dictionary of Quotations</em> had it both ways.
				They cited Barnard as the maxim's author, adding `Ascribed to Chinese
				origin.'
			</blockquote>

		<p>
			In his book, 
			Keyes has identified several rules of misquotation and the one of which he
			and several others have been guilty he calls numbernesia: getting the
			words right but the numbers wrong.  
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase, Saying, and Quotation</strong>
			is one reference which has the correct attribution (but without any of 
			the story).
		</p>
		<p>
			The phrase has endured to become an American proverb, 
			appearing on page 465 of 
			<strong>A Dictionary of American Proverbs</strong>, 
			edited by Mieder, Kingsbury, and Harder and published by the 
			Oxford University Press in 1992.

			In updating this page, I came across a wonderful account of the
			history of this expression written by William Safire for his column
			<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/On+Language/since1851/allresults/1/bySafire/"><em>On Language</em></a>
			for the New York Times Magazine. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/07/magazine/on-language-worth-a-thousand-words.html">Worth a Thousand Words</a> was published on 7 April 1996.
