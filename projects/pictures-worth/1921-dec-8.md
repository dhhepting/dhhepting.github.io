		<h1>&ldquo;One Look is Worth a Thousand Words&rdquo;</h1>
		
		<p>
			So said a famous Japanese philosopher, and he was right &dash; nearly 
			everyone likes to &ldquo;read&rdquo; pictures.
		</p>
		<p>
			&ldquo;Buttersweet is Good to Eat&rdquo;
			is a very short phrase but it will sell more goods if presented, 
			with an appetizing picture of the product, 
			to many people morning, noon and night, 
			every day in the year than a thousand word advertisement placed 
			before the same number of people only a limited number of times during the year.
		</p>
		<p>
			Good advertising for a trade marked product is nothing more nor less 
			than the delivery of favorable impressions for it, 
			and it does not make any difference whether they are delivered through newspaper,
			magazine or street car advertising.
		</p>
		<p>
			No man or woman ever picks up a newspaper or magazine or enters a 
			street car wondering what Heinz, Postum, Campbell, or Cream of Wheat 
			is offering &dash; all the national advertiser can hope for is that 
			his advertisement will be bumped into accidentally.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is simply the preponderance of favorable impressions for a meritorious
			product that reminds the consumer to buy it again and again.
		</p>
		<p>
			We deliver many millions of advertising impressions every day.  The cars
			on our list carry more than 10,000,000,000 passengers a year.
