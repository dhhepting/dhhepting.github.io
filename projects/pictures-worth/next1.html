		"A strong picture is worth ten thousand words." &dash; Arthur Brisbane
		
		<p>
			Pages of words cannot make you see a thing like the Eastland disaster.
		</p>
		<p>
			The mechanical accuracy of one photograph drives it home. 
			You can <em>see for yourself</em>
			the way the fifteen hundred excursionists were
			drowned within a few feet of land.
		</p>
		<p>
			Words may be changed to fit the bias or emotion in the writer's mind, 
			or to fit some evolution in public taste and thought; 
			but the photograph must ever remain the most human, 
			complete and accurate method of making the public see for itself 
			the vital news of the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			For 3100 consecutive weeks Leslie's has brought to its readers 
			the news of the world through pictures; 
			and the close of its sixtieth year finds it still adding to and 
			speeding up a service already unmatched in the periodical field.

			Advertising men must surely know that Brisbane is right when he
			says "A strong picture is worth ten thousand words." 
			The daily newspapers that give their readers the most pictures have the 
			largest circulations.
			Leslie's Weekly would be successful if it never contained a page of type.
			Its illustrations make it. 
			Mr. Fernald goes so far as to use pictures in his letters to 
			prospective advertisers. You may love a Bruce Rogers type-page,
			but Molly Mulligan and Herman Grossman want pictures with life in them.
			That is why the movies are making millions for men who understand the
			desires of the multitude.
			It is better to be a ditchdigger and pay your way
			than to be a high-brow professor whose wife pays the grocer and butcher.
			Art, if it is to win the respect of people who are doing things, 
			must be self-supporting.
			The Atlantic Monthly, without a single illustration,
			has a circulation of 35,000.
			Leslie's, with pictures on every page, has ten times that
			number of buyers. 
			The advertiser who wants to reach the masses should
			use type when a picture cannot be found to do the workâ€”not otherwise.
			This may be heresy, but it is good business.
