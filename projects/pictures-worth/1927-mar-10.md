&mdash; that's what this car card said 
<em>every day</em> to many millions of women.  
It reminded all mothers <em >every day</em> 
of a sure way to give a treat to their own children.  
And hundreds of thousands got an extra thrill with their next cake making 
because of the happy expression of the boy on the car card.

<em><strong>The moral of the story is that the same influence could not be 
created even with the same picture in any other advertising medium.</strong></em>

In the magazines, 
the reminder would not be often enough to change the average housewife's 
baking habit.
In the newspapers, with no color, there would be no appetite appeal.  
On a twenty-four sheet poster, 
seen only for a few seconds at a time, 
the great appeal of the expression on the boy's face would be lost.
