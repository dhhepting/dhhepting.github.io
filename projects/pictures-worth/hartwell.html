		<h1>THE CLEVER USE OF IMAGERY IN ADVERTISING</h1>
		
		<p>
			PICTURING A THOUGHT TO SHOW A COMPARISON HELD TO BE THE STRONGEST METHOD OF PRESENTA TION â€”THE PRINCIPLE UNDERLY ING POWERFUL POETRY IS SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN COMMERCIAL ILLUSTRATION
		</p>
		
		By Hartwell Mason.
The best methods of those who illustrate and write the text of advertisements, are, after all, much akin to the best methods of the poets. Shelley's "To a Skylark" is universally acknowledged a masterpiece of literature and is read and admired by all ages and classes. Why? 
Chiefly because of its imagery.

Phrase after phrase, line after line, verse after verse is teeming with similes, comparisons, figures of speech, imagery. The poet likens the bird of the altitude 
to "a cloud of fire," 
to "an unbodied joy," 
to "a star of heaven," 
to "a thoughtful poet," 
to "a high-born maiden," 
to "a glow-worm golden," 
to a rose, 
and to "vernal showers."
He compares the song of the skylark with the far-reaching moonbeam 
and with the flood of rain that falls from "rain-bow clouds."

Then you would at once begin to seriously question the truth of your first decision and you'd say to me 'It's rock.' And drew picture of horse and wagon on top of you would undoubtedly assure me with alac rity that was some mighty bowl der. If drew picture of mighty waves, surf, dashing at its foot, then you would tell me with con viction that you had been wrong and that really was big cliff of stone."
One great secret of good writ ing, whether for literary or ad vertising purposes, lies in present ing one's "grain of sand" to the great reading public in such manner that there cannot be the least doubt whether really

The tendency always for the advertising manufacturer to know



"Use plenty of comparisons,"
is the best advice of Arthur Brisbane to writers of advertisements and few will dispute 
that he has found an "open sesame" to the mind of the masses of today. 
"Use a picture," says Mr. Brisbane. "It's worth a thousand words. Use a picture with five
words, and a comparison in thirty words."

Mr. Brisbane recently explained
at some length just why and how he believes comparisons are all-powerful in advertising. He
said : "I hold in my hand here a grain of sand. But suppose you did not know that fact; and sup pose, by means of a stereopticon, I projected an image of that grain of sand on an immense sheet at
