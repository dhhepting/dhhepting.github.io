For more information or to reserve seats at thelecture, call 291-5100.<OL><LI>An <A HREF=index.html><STRONG>exhibition</STRONG></A> of art based on mathematical principles and ideas.Fractals, more so than other areas of mathematics, are visually exciting ina very real way. Fractals are a language with which to describe thegeometry of nature. Images of fractals can be an important access tomathematics and surrounding philosophical questions. Noon - 5 pm in the TeckGallery (Room 1305).<p></p></li><LI>Interactive computer displays for visitorsto experiment with making their own fractal designs; investigate <A HREF=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/egems/home.html>E-Gems</A>, aproject to design math and science electronic games (<A HREF=http://www.enc.org/resources/records/0,1240,008723,00.shtm>Counting on Frank</A>, oneof their products, was chosen by <A HREF=http://www.pcmag.com/>PC Magazine</a>as one of the top 100 CD-ROMs for 1995); and check out the math education and art resources available onthe <A HREF=../../../research/web/math+art/index.html><STRONG>Internet</STRONG></A>. Noon - 5 pm in the Segal Centre (Room 1430).<P></p></li><LI>Ingenious mathematical amateurs. It is possible for someone withoutformal credentials to make contributions to mathematics. Well-known artistM.C. Escher and unknown homemaker Marjorie Rice both tackled mathematicalproblems, developing unorthodox notation that was essential to theirmethodical investigations. Each worked alone, essentially in secret,rewarded by the exhilaration of finding answers to a large puzzle.
