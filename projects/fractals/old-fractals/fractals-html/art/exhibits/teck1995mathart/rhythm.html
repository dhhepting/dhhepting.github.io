This image is based on a fractal which is similar to the one used to 
create <EM><A HREF=fiery.html>Fiery Dragon</A></EM> and <BR>
<EM><A HREF=infinity.html>Steps to Infinity</A></EM>.  This curve is also
defined by two transformations, but with slightly different parameters:

<PRE>
xform
        scale 0.618	    /* Dragon scales by approximately .7071 */
        rotate -137.5

xform
        scale -0.618
        rotate 137.5
        translate 1.0 0.0
</PRE>

<P>
This image is an interpretation of the process by which the points of the
plane are captured by the transformations in the description of the curve to
form the actual curve.
<P>
I've assigned an initial point to each of the two transformations and I apply
the transformations to their respective points and then to the results, over
and over again.  As I compose the transformations into longer and longer
strings, the contractivity of each composite transformation increases.  These
"stronger" transformations capture more and more of the plane.  I've 
illustrated this process in a <A HREF=../../../pix/exhibits/teck1995/rhythm_cones.qt>movie</A>, using cones
to show the effect of the transformations.  As the strength of a 
transformation increases, a cone under that transformation gets wider and 
shorter.

The upper black and white image above shows one possible colouring for the
image used to construct <EM>Captivating Rhythm</EM>.  Each band corresponds
to a different level of "capture", increasing away from the curve.
The reverse of "capture" (lower left above) is "escape" (lower right above).
Notice how the arrangement of disks differs between them.
<P>
The image below shows another way to view the same data, ultimately selected
for the final image.  Here, I have broken up what were solid bands in the 
earlier image by using information about which transformation was applied
at a particular time.  In creating the final image, I applied a fractional 
Brownian motion texture and added an outline of the fractal.
