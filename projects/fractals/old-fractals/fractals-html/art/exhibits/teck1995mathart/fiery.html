Martin Gardener tells the story of how this curve, 
first discovered by John E. Heighway, used by William G. Harter as a 
decoration symbolic of cryptic structure, and later analysed by them and
another colleague, Bruce A. Banks.  Though its final structure is complex, 
its description is not.  The following two transformations are required to 
generate this shape:

<PRE>
xform
        scale { sqrt(2)/2 }
        rotate -45

xform
        scale { sqrt(2)/2 }
        rotate 135
        translate 1.0 0.0
</PRE>

<P>
Beginning with a single point, the whole curve can be generated by repeated
application of these two transformations.  This specification of the shape
in terms of contractive, affine transformations is called an iterated function
system (IFS).  
<P>
This image of a dragon curve was created by covering with disks (spheres) the 
parts of the plane which do not include the fractal.  These parts are 
determined by computing the minimum distance from a point <EM>P</EM>
to the fractal.  
If this distance is <EM>d</EM>,  then a disk of radius <EM>d</EM> can be
drawn about the point <EM>P</EM> and all points inside that disk are known
not to belong to the fractal.  Click <A HREF="../../../pix/exhibits/teck1995/dragon_disks.qt">here</A> to
see a movie which illustrates this process at work.
<P>
Like many of my other works, I've used 
<A HREF=http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~cek/rayshade/rayshade.html>
<EM>rayshade</EM></A> 
to ray-trace this image.
This process creates the final image (which you see above) by simulating a
camera inside the computer.
