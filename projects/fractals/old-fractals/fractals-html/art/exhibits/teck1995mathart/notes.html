Introduction

<P>
Mandates of art galleries are many, but the mandate that immediately
defines a university gallery is the mandate that a gallery demonstrates the
aesthetic dimensions of academic disciplines.  It was to this end that
Simon Fraser Gallery mounted its first math art exhibition, 
<a href="../sfu1994imgwrld.html">EXPLORING THE IMAGE WORLD OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS</a> 
works by Daryl Hepting, in the W.A.C.
Bennett Gallery, March 30 to July 26, 1994.

<P>
Daryl Hepting, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Computing Science and one
of the four curators of this exhibition, knows the connections between
computers and aesthetics as few in Simon Fraser University can.  He takes
us on a short course on math art in the notes on these digital graphics.

<P>
Other members of Simon Fraser University who joined me in curating this
exhibition were Dr. Katherine Heinrich, Chair of Mathematics & Statistics
and 
Dr. Malgorzata Dubiel of the same department. 

<P>
These eighteen images were selected from scores of possible images so as to
represent the complexities and contrasts of visual aesthetics that are
possible in 
digital graphics.  They were also selected to represent the images that are
available from three sources on the WORLD WIDE WEB (internet): computer art
exhibits, pioneer publications, and computer images created by Daryl
Hepting of Simon Fraser University.

<P>
Simon Fraser Gallery is grateful for the assistance of Gallery staff, Daryl
Hepting and the other curators for making this exhibition possible.  It is
also grateful to the Graphics and Mulimedia Research Lab for production
assistance.  The Teck and Simon Fraser Galleries are honoured to support
the Department of Mathematics & Statistics in hosting the Canadian
Mathematical Society 1995 Winter Meeting.

<P>
Dr. Edward Gibson, Director, December 1995.

Notes On Exhibition
</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
The majority of works in this exhibition represent a collection 
which rely on the computer for their existence.  
And the computer involves mathematics
to describe, manipulate, and translate even the simplest scenes
into the forms we see here.  
The involvement of mathematics plays a greater role in these works --
it provides the inspiration and the foundation upon which they are constructed.

<P>
A prominent feature of the exhibit is its display of fractals, objects from
a non-Euclidean geometry. Fractals -- sharing a root with fracture and
fraction -- have been called the geometry of nature by Mandelbrot, who
discovered their capability to describe the non-smooth world in which we
live.  Fractal geometry, which is new to us, has shed light on old things
-- things like the historical record of water levels in the Nile river for
instance.  And in its turn the computer has shed light on fractals,
allowing the underlying beauty of what may seem to be dry-as-dust
mathematics to shine through. 
Works like 
<A HREF=blessed.html><STRONG>Blessed State</STRONG></A> 
or 
<A HREF=infinity.html><STRONG>Steps to Infinity</STRONG></A> 
provide evidence of the profound connection that 
seems to exist between fractals and the natural world.  

<P>
It is fitting that this collection of computer-related art comes to us
inlarge part through the internet (the World Wide Web). Although Daryl
Hepting is now at SFU, his works are distributed widely across the
internet. In addition to Hepting's collaborations with Musgrave (George
Washington University), Prusinkiewicz (University of Calgary), Saupe
(University of Freiburg), and Snider (University of Regina), the
computer-based works come from:

<P>
The other pieces in this exhibit remind the viewer that the computer is
responsible for only a portion of all mathematical art. The works of M. C.
Escher and Marjorie Rice offer a beautiful expression of this fact.
