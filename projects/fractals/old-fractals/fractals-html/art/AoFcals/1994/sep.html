Fractional Brownian motion, or fBm for short, is (loosely) defined as 
the integral through time of the increments of a random walk with 
Gaussian increments.  It is a random fractal function which 
resembles many things in Nature:  the flood levels of the Nile 
through time, stock and commodity price fluctuations, the 
transparency of a cloud along a line, and the skyline of mountains, to 
name a few.  Some years ago, Benoit Mandelbrot noted the latter 
resemblance and reasoned that fBm extended to 2-D to form a 
surface would resemble a mountain range.  Thus were born fractal 
mountains for computer graphics.  But the resemblance of fBm to 
mountains has no known causal basis; fBm simply looks like 
mountains.  A research area, then, has been to improve and augment 
the descriptive power of fBm-based terrain models.  Spirit Lake is 
an early illustration of a terrain model in which the fractal dimension 
and crossover scales varies with altitude.  Thus the mountain is 
smoother at the lake's edge, and rougher near the peak.  The 
triangles visible near the peak show the scale of the geometric detail; 
smaller details are visual effects generated by a procedural texture, 
which does not vary roughness with altitude.

<EM>Carolina</EM> [not shown] is a different use of the same 
heterogeneous terrain model, 
this time used to emulate ancient, heavily eroded mountains such as 
the Blue Ridge Mountains in the American Southeast.  
<EM>Medicine Lake</EM> [not shown] features the same mountain seen in 
<EM>Spirit Lake</EM>, but with a 
different procedural texture applied to the surface.  Both 
<EM>Spirit Lake</EM> and <EM>Medicine Lake</EM> [not shown] 
feature a model of the rainbow which, 
unlike the mountain models, is based on the laws and measurements 
of physics and geometric optics.  It was created by recreating with a 
computer, a simulation of the propagation of light through an 
idealized raindrop, first published by Rene Descartes in 1637.  This 
was coupled with a model of dispersion (discovered by Sir Isaac 
Newton a few decades later) to generate an accurate model of both 
the position and colors of the rainbow.
