<STRONG>Other State</STRONG><BR>

<P>
We can use the descriptive power of fractals to create visions of a 
Nature-that-never-was.  <EM>Other State</EM> is an example of such an 
image.  It was composed from the well-known image 
<EM>Blessed State</EM> [not shown], 
which appears below, and a fractal model of a Saturn-like ringed 
planet (also seen below).  The scene is rendered from fully three-
dimensional models, the likes of which we will be able explore in 
virtual reality, when the capability to render such scenes at 
interactive rates has been developed.  Currently, it takes about an 
hour of supercomputer time to synthesize such an image.

<P>
Here we see the components from which Other State was composed.  
The image <EM>Blessed State</EM> features an early fractal model of a moon:  
a simple grey bump-mapped sphere.  This moon has been replaced 
by the more sophisticated model of a Saturn-like planet, and a more 
complex model of atmospheric scattering has been employed..  The 
planet features a fractal model of the bands of clouds and a fractal 
ring structure.  The structure of the rings is simply fBm (fractional 
Brownian motion) applied as a transparency map to a disk around 
the planet.  No attempt to model features of Saturn's rings -- such as 
Cassini's division -- was made; they simply fall out of the fractal 
model.
