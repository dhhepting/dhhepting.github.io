<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Desert Ball</STRONG><BR>by F. Kenton Musgrave<BR><P>In all of the landscape images seen in this calendar, procedural textures  are used to color the surfaces and to add visual detail.  A procedural texture is a mathematical function which is defined throughout three-space, and evaluated at the points where the rays emanating from the eye (in the ray tracing rendering method for generating synthetic images) intersect surfaces in the scene.  In the course of development of one of these functions, it is generally rendered on the surface of a sphere, to see how it looks.  A sphere is used for two reasons:  it is one of the quickest objects to ray trace (ray tracing being a notoriously slow procedure), and it shows what the texture will look like at all angles of illumination.  While such images are simply tests along the way to a specific visual goal, sometimes they represent striking images in their own right.  <EM>Desert Ball</EM> came about while developing the texture used on the terrain in <EM>Slickrock</EM> (see <A HREF=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/jul.html>July</A>).  All that was added to the test image is the burgundy background and the faint light source coming from the right.<P><EM>Desert Ball</EM> and <EM>Earth Sequence</EM> [not shown]both employ two different uses of a vector-valued  fBm (fractional Brownian motion) function.  The vector-valued function simply returns three separate values for independent fBm functions.  This 3-vector can be interpreted however we please.  Interpreted as a spatial vector, it can be added to the surface normal (the vector sticking straight up from the surface) before calculating the lighting there, which of course depends on the surface's orientation to the light source.  This method is called bump-mapping.  Applied to the large burgundy sphere in the background of <EM>Desert Ball</EM>, it generates the rough-looking highlight to the left.  In <EM>Earth Sequence</EM> [not shown] it is used to generate oceans and continents.  Another interpretation of the fBm vector is as an rgb (red, green, blue) color value, which can be added to the basic surface color.  This perturbation gives rise to the subtle color variations in <EM>Desert Ball</EM> and in the last sphere of <EM>Earth Sequence</EM> [not shown].<EM>Fire Ball</EM> [not shown]is another test image from the development of an fBm-based fractal flame texture.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/aug.gif ALT="{aug.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
