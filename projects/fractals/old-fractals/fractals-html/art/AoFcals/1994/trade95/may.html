<HTML><BODY><STRONG>DLA </STRONG><BR>by F. Kenton Musgrave<BR>(with thanks to Lionel Woog and Benoit Mandelbrot)<BR><P>An area of current scientific research in fractals is the study by physicists of diffusion-limited aggregations or DLA's: the structures that result when particles moving about on random walks stick to one another when they make contact.  This image represents the use of state-of-the-art computer graphics effects in service of scientific visualization.  Today's powerful computers can generate such vast quantities of information that scientists can only deal with it visually.  (Of all our senses, vision provides by far the greatest bandwidth for getting information to the cerebral cortex.)  In this case, a computer simulation has generated a shape -- a three-dimensional DLA -- which is so complex that it is hard to render a way which clearly conveys its spatial structure.  An atmospheric function (the same one which surrounds the earth in Gaea & Selene) has been centered on the DLA, the shiny spheres of which reflect its glow.  The color of the spheres reflects the time at which they joined the cluster, telling us something about the growth history of the cluster.<P>Here we see the same scene rendered in a different way: the emphasis here is not on scientific visualization, but rather on aesthetics.  Again, the atmosphere function is used to disambiguate three-dimensional structure after projection to a two-dimensional image, and the atmosphere is modulated to emulate a range of incandescent black-body temperatures.  Understanding the growth of DLA's is a prerequisite to understanding phenomena as diverse as the efficient extraction of oil from porous rocks underground and the formation and structure of both soot and interstellar dust particles.  Below is a rendering of the Laplacian potential around a portion of a 2-D DLA cluster.  The grey scale represents the value of the potential, and each cycle of grey represents a drop by a factor of 10 in the value potential.  The source at the top is at potential 1.0 and the DLA boundary is at 0.0.  The arborescent structure of the fjords is still a matter of controversy among physicists:  it is not yet decided whether they are exactly self-similar, or whether the fjords are parallel, or wedge-shaped.  The green lines are field lines emanating from points on the DLA boundary,  ascending to the source, while the red lines start along a horizontal line and descend towards the boundary by steepest descent of the potential.  Note that ascent is convergent, but descent is unstable in the fashion of deterministic chaos:  it exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions (in this case the starting point of the path).<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/may.gif ALT="{may.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
