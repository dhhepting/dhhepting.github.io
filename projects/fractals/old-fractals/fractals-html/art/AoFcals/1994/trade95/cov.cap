cover caption (on inside cover, after essay):Both deterministic  and random fractals are represented in this whimsical image of an Earth-like planet floating in one of the infinitely-many circular spaces of the interior of the Mandelbrot set.  The image is intended to point out the connections between the familiar Euclidean geometry, the newer fractal geometry, Nature, and mathematical abstraction, all with an infusion of visual aesthetics.
