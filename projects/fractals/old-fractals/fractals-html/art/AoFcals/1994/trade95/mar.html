<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Anything but Blue</STRONG><BR>by F. Kenton Musgrave<BR><P>A problem with computer models of landscapes is that they are entirely abstract -- just a bunch of numbers -- and have no intrinsic scale.  If one simply projects them onto the image plane, the result will appear to be no bigger than the image itself.   Landscape painters have known for hundreds of years that a critical distance cue for large scales is aerial perspective, or the bluing and loss of contrast over large distances.  In Nature, this is due to complex effects of scattering of light by the atmosphere.  Simplified models of such atmospheric scattering can impart a sense scale to terrain renderings, as <EM>Anything but Blue</EM> demonstrates.<P>In the tradition of painters, we often render the same scene in different light, to evoke different moods and visual effects.  Both <EM>Lethe</EM> [not shown] and <EM>Cool Afternoon</EM> [not shown] are color studies of the mountain seen above, informed by the color use of both past and contemporary schools of landscape painting.  To achieve greatness in its own right, computer art will have to stand on the shoulders of the giants who have come before.  Interestingly, though, computer graphics reopens the artistic problem of representationalism, which has been regarded as a solved problem in the visual arts since the invention of the camera.  Setting out to synthesize images of arbitrary realism from first principles we face a whole new set of problems, most of which yet await satisfactory solution.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/mar.gif ALT="{mar.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
