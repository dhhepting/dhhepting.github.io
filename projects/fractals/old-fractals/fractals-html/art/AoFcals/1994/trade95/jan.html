<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Light Lace</STRONG><BR>by Kevin Suffern <BR><P>One of the most striking aspects of fractal geometry is the underlying simplicity which generates the visually-complex fractal forms.  In this case, an approximation of the Sierpinski Gasket (as seen on the title page of this calendar) is generated by the interreflection of light between four spheres!  The reflection model employed is not like the "real world":  the light gains energy in each reflection, as opposed to losing energy.<P>Here we see the four spheres from the outside.  The point of view for the main image is inside of the tetrahedron formed by the four spheres.  <EM>Blueglass</EM> [not shown] is formed by 100 interreflections of light from a shiny blue sphere placed inside a shiny chrome sphere.  The complexity here is also fractal (i.e., forms repeat over a variety of scales), but more subtly so.  It is remarkable that such simple systems can give rise to fractal complexity!<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/jan.gif ALT="{jan.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
