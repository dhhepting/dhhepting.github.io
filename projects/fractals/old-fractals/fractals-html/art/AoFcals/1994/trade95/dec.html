<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Orbit</STRONG><BR>by F. Kenton Musgrave<BR>(with thanks to John Amanatides)<BR><P>For the holiday season we return to the theme we started with in January:  ray tracing shiny spheres, which look like Christmas-tree ornaments.  Orbit uses the same subtle color and surface modulations seen in <EM>Desert Ball</EM> (see <A HREF=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/aug.html>August</A>).  The burgundy sphere is exactly the same one seen in the background of <EM>Desert Ball</EM>, while the two other spheres are a shiny and copper-colored version of the foreground sphere seen in that image.  Beneath is a very large sphere with a simple fBm texture modulating lightness -- close inspection of this texture will provide a good sense of the character of the fBm function which underlies most of the models of natural phenomena seen in this calendar.  The intent of <EM>Orbit</EM> was to tackle the artistic challenge of creating a "sense of place", using only four ray-traced spheres with sophisticated procedural textures.  (There is actually a fifth sphere in the scene, a white one representing the Sun, seen only in reflection.)  It, like <EM>Desert Ball</EM>, is a subtle color study, which will be lost if the printer doesn't get these images exactly right.<P>It is remarkable what we can do with ray-traced spheres which are perfectly smooth, geometrically.  <EM>Moonrise</EM> [not shown] demonstrates that two spheres -- one white and one chrome -- with two different fractal fBm bump-maps, can alone provide a model of a natural scene.  The cover image is composed of two spheres, one for the planet surface and one for the clouds just above it, an atmosphere function and a background image of the Mandelbrot set.  The visual complexity and fidelity to Nature of these images belies the conceptual simplicity behind their generation; therein lies the primary wonder of fractal geometry.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/dec.gif ALT="{dec.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
