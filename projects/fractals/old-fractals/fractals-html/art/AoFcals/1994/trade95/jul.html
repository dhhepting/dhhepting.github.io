<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Slickrock</STRONG><BR>by F. Kenton Musgrave<BR>(with thanks to <A HREF=http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/~cek>Craig Kolb</A>)<BR><P>One of the fundamental problems with making computer graphics pictures of fractals is that their high spatial-frequency content, when combined with the point-sampling techniques used in image synthesis, can lead to aliasing or "noisy" images.  Another problem with fractal landscapes is that a very detailed model requires a lot of storage space, yet it can have too little detail in the foreground, and too much in the distance (leading to visual noise there).  A solution to these problems is procedural modelling, in which the terrain model does not exist a priori, but rather is calculated the appropriate level of detail -- on-the-fly, as the image is made.  Slickrock is an example of such a landscape.  Note that it features sharp ridge lines, which would appear to have saw-teeth if the triangles tessellating the surface were much bigger than pixel-sized.  <EM>Slickrock</EM> uses the aerial perspective model first tested in <EM>Anything but Blue</EM> (see March) to impart a sense of very large scale.<P>The landscape seen in <EM>Slickrock</EM> is the destination in an animation currently under production, a short sort of "Powers of Ten" zoom from deep space.  The planets seen in <EM>Gaea & Selene</EM> will grow from points in the far distance, as we zoom up to it.  Then we will fly down through the atmosphere (as seen in the detail below) and up to the mountains seen in Slickrock.  The procedural approach allows the models to be generated with appropriate spatial frequency content for its distance from the eye point (i.e., without too many tiny details, which lead to aliasing or visual "noise" in the image). Furthermore, the nature of procedural fractal models allows us to investigate the scene as closely as we like -- the program just keeps adding as much detail as is required.  All features, both large and small, arise from the underlying randomness of the fractal functions,therefore the artist is not responsible for explicitly specifying any of them.  Thus the artist who creates the scene may be as surprised by what is to be found there, as anyone else!  When implemented in virtual reality, this promises exciting explorations of a "virtual" universe filled with such "virtual" planets.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/jul.gif ALT="{jul.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
