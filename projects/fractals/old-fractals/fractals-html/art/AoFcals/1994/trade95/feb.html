<HTML><BODY><STRONG>The Five Non-Platonic Non-Solids</STRONG><BR>by <A HREF=http://www.eecs.wsu.edu/IRL/summary/john.html>John C. Hart</A><BR><P>The five Platonic solids are the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron.  Here they are transformed into fractals by recursively removing polyhedron-volumes from every solid part, generating Sierpinski's tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron, Menger's sponge (in green), and the (reddish) von Koch snowflake-a-hedron.  As every solid portion has been reduced ad infinitum, the result has zero volume, and infinite surface area!  Thus the moniker "non-Platonic non-solids".<P>The non-Platonic non-solids and this fractal forest are modelled using iterated function systems  in which simple transformations are repeatedly applied, to place particles in space.  The sum of these particles is one of the many forms seen here.  Thus these forms are composed of vast numbers of very small particles.  In true fractal form, the shapes we see are repeated over a range of different scales or sizes.  The pulled-taffy shape of the quaternion Julia set is the result of a different type of simple iteration, performed in an extension of the complex numbers called the quaternions.  The result is a four-dimensional fractal, which is projected down into three dimensions, then to the two of the image plane.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade95/feb.gif></BODY></HTML>
