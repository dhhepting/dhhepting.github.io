This landscape, perhaps from some distant planet, illustrates a 
continuous escape-time function evaluation for an iterated function 
system (IFS) of the famous dragon curve.  This image may seem 
similar to some of the familiar  images created for Julia sets, and this 
is not by accident.  In fact, this picture was created as part of a study 
which developed rendering functions for iterated function systems 
analogous to those which had previously existed for Julia and 
Mandelbrot sets.  In seeking out similarities between Julia sets and 
those defined by iterated function systems, differences were 
observed as a product of the manner in which the fractals are 
defined (with quadratic or linear transformations, for example).  The 
IFS escape-time function does not have the same interpretation as 
does the function for Julia and Mandelbrot sets.  The values in the 
IFS case can interpreted as indications of membership in the fractal:  
the points with highest elevation are still candidates for membership 
in the attractor, whereas lower elevations have already been 
discounted.  The discrete escape-time function values indicate 
boundaries between successive transformation applications over 
some region of interest.

The left column of images [not shown] illustrate the continuous version of the 
escape-time function over a small initial region of interest, 
performing calculations with the Manhattan metric (top) and the 
more familiar Euclidean metric (bottom). The right column [not shown] shows a 
two-dimensional view of the continuous escape-time values used in 
the <EM>Dragon Mesa</EM> picture (top), an example of an image using the 
discrete escape-time function (middle), which is much simpler to 
compute.  The bottom right image shows an image of a height field 
derived from a distance function, and it serves to illustrate some of 
the differences between the two functions.
