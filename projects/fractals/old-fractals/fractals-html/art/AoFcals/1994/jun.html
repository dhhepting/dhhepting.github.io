<P>
A genetic algorithm developed by Karl Sims was used to generate 
this image on a massively parallel supercomputer   In the genetic 
algorithm, expressions which generate surface textures from the 
LISP programming language are randomly generated and "mutated" 
by the computer, and "selected" and cross-bred by the user.  This 
powerful random process rapidly creates striking images which are 
entirely procedural in nature; that is, they represent the unmodified 
output of the computer program.  <EM>Splash</EM> features a pattern 
"painted" on a fractal  surface.  The coloring, the pattern, and the 
fractal surface texture all arose spontaneously in the process of 
"aesthetic selection".  

<P>
Splash and these other fractal images were all created over the 
course of several hours of "work" by a previously-inexperienced 
user.  The power of the process which created these images lies in its 
automaticity:  in principle, and person using the system could have 
come up with these images (or better), as it is driven by simply 
choosing "what you like" and having the computer "evolve" that.  Its 
appeal lies in the parallel to Darwinian evolution which, presumably, 
created all life on Earth through a similarly arbitrary process of 
mutation and selection.
