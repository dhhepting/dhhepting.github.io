<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>
A basic tenet of Western science is that the behavior of systems in nature can 
be accurately described with mathematics.  In 1623 Galileo wrote:

Philosophy is written in this grand book -- I mean universe -- which stands 
continuously open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first 
learns to comprehend the language in which it is written.  It is written in the 
language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other 
geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a 
single word of it; without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.

<P>
Scientists today still regard this statement as essentially correct.  
However, Galileo's language of nature -- 
that attributed to Euclid of ancient Greece, and known today as 
Euclidean geometry -- was a bit short in vocabulary.  
Geometry is a language of shapes, 
but many of the shapes in nature lie in Galileo's vague category of 
"other geometrical figures", 
not within the scope of Euclid's shapes.  
They require another kind of geometry, 
one unimagined in Euclid's or Galileo's time.

<P>
Recently the mathematician and natural philosopher Benoit Mandelbrot observed:

Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, 
and bark is not smooth, 
nor does lightning travel in a straight line...

This observation heralded his introduction in 1975 of the new branch of mathematics 
known as fractal geometry.

<P>
Fractal geometry can be thought of as a new dialect of the mathematical 
language of shapes (geometry).  
Unlike Euclidean geometry, fractal geometry deals with the very 
complex shapes found in nature: things like trees, river networks, 
and billows of smoke.  
The difference between Euclidean shapes, such as planes, spheres and cones, and fractal 
shapes is that Euclidean shapes are all locally flat: if you look at them 
closely enough, they become flat, planar, and boring, 
while fractal shapes can be complex at every scale, that is, 
they may possess an infinite wealth of detail.

<P>
Where does this complexity come from?  It could come from two places: 
there could be a vast quantity of essentially independent information -- 
such as the nicks, scratches and 
stains on an old pair of tennis shoes -- 
or there could simply be a repetition of an 
underlying form, at a variety of scales.  The latter type of complexity 
is the secret of fractal geometry: self-similarity, 
or the repetition of form over a variety of scales.  Note that the 
former kind of complexity is hard to conceive of except as the result of an 
accumulated history of independent events over a substantial period of time, 
while the latter -- fractal complexity -- can often be succinctly described 
by a simple specification of the underlying shape, 
plus the relation of its manifestation to the scale at which it is manifest.

<P>
Many forms in nature are a combination of both types of complexity; the 
addition of the fractal vocabulary of shape to our scientific language of 
nature has revolutionized our ability to describe, 
in the internally-consistent, formal and deterministic language of 
mathematics, the forms and order we find in nature.  The images in 
this calendar -- particularly the fractal "forgeries" of natural scenes -- 
attest to the success of fractal 
geometry as a language of nature.  Even the wholly abstract fractal images 
have a "natural" feel to them;  
they echo the complexity of form so common in nature.

<P>
It is interesting to contrast the places where we find Euclidean versus 
fractal shapes: 
Except for the near-perfect spheres and ellipses of soap bubbles, 
astronomical bodies (planets and suns) and their orbits, 
it is a bit unusual to find Euclidean shapes in nature -- 
they generally appear in the domain of man-made objects, such as buildings and machines.  
Fractal objects are generally too complex to be explicitly constructed by man; nature, 
on the other hand is full of them: mountains, trees, clouds, and 
fractures (indeed, the word "fractal" intentionally shares the Latin root 
of "fracture"), to name but a few.  Hence it is 
appropriate to think of fractal geometry as a "geometry of nature".

<P>
Some artificially-generated fractal shapes appear to imitate phenomena in 
nature such as mountains, clouds and trees.  
Others appear regular and man-made, such as the Sierpinski 
Gasket and the von Koch Snowflake.  
Yet others, such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, 
appear to be entirely abstract in form.  Yet all fractals share the 
characteristic of self-similarity: they appear more or less the same at a 
variety of scales.  This self-similarity may be exact, 
as in the case of the Sierpinski Gasket and the Menger Sponge; it may be 
statistical, as in the case of fractal mountains; or it may be more 
difficult to characterize, as with the Mandelbrot set.  
Although the character of the self-similarity differs among 
fractals, 
they all have in common the fact that when you look at them ever more closely, 
you see more of the same, 
and they all have in common a potentially-unlimited complexity 
which is a result of this repetition of form over a potentially-unlimited range of scales.

<P>
Fractals also share a common mathematical characteristic: 
the fractal dimension.  
The fractal dimension is an analytic measure of the 
"wigglyness" of a fractal line or the "roughness" of a fractal surface.  
It is a number which agrees with our everyday sense of 
dimension (three dimensions define space, 
two dimensions a plane, one dimension a line, 
and zero dimensions a point) but which has non-integer values: 
for the Sierpinski Gasket it is ???; for the von Koch Snowflake it is ???; 
and for fractal mountains it is usually between 2.1 and 2.3.  
The larger the fractal dimension, 
the more wiggly the shape, and as the fractal dimension of, 
for instance, a line approaches the integer value of the next higher dimension 
(in this case, going from 1.0 to 2.0), the 
fractal curve becomes space-filling, that is, 
it fills the entirety of some part of the next 
higher dimension (in this case, a plane).  
Not an immediately intuitive notion, this idea of 
fractal dimension, but it becomes so surprisingly quickly -- 
one comes to think of the fractal dimension as simply a numerical measure 
of just how convoluted the curve or surface is, 
and with some practice one can estimate its value fairly accurately 
just by eye.  
Cumulus clouds, for instance, have a fractal dimension that's usually about 2.2 to 2.3.

<STRONG>A Bit of History</STRONG><BR>

<P>
Around the turn of the century, 
there occurred something of an upheaval in the world of 
mathematics.  
Mathematicians such as Weierstrass, Cantor and Peano conceived of bizarre 
constructions: strange "dusts" of unending complexity; functions with 
wildly unpredictable behavior; curves that could fill space or have 
no tangents.  
They boasted that these entities 
had no counterpart in nature and were somehow inherently intractable; 
having discerned 
what they could about them, 
the mathematicians labeled them "monsters", ill-begotten and 
unwanted children of mathematical speculations.  
Interestingly, while they had studied the beasts formally, 
they were never concerned by what they actually look like and pictured 
only the simplest among them.  
In general, the tedious and copious calculation required to 
make such a pictures would have to await the invention of the 
modern digital computer.

<P>
As a young man in the 1940's, Benoit Mandelbrot had an uncle (also of the name 
Mandelbrot) who was a well-known mathematician in his own right.  
One day he showed the young Benoit a mathematical paper by Fatou, 
telling him "there is a career to be made in this, for the person who can 
figure it out and pursue this work".  
Young Benoit had a look at the paper, and concluded 
"this is definitely not for me".  
Over the years, however, the ideas germinated in the back of his mind, 
and he came to be working on problems less far-removed than he himself 
realized, at the time.  
As is usually the case with scientific discovery, 
fractal geometry took form in his mind as if by a slow process of awakening, 
rather than an instantaneous "aha!"

<P>
Mandelbrot was employed by IBM as a research scientist in 1958.  
This gave him ready access, in the 1960's, 
to the then-exotic digital computer.  Armed with the requisite 
mathematical insight, the computer provided the tool he needed to 
explore the latter-day "monsters" of mathematics and discern something more 
of their true nature.  What he found is illustrated in the 
images in this calendar.

Fractals and the computer are inextricably intertwined.  
While ordinary mathematics often takes the form of equations such as 
which may be solved explicitly, fractals 
are generally specified in terms of recursive procedures such as, 
that is, the mathematical operation is applied repeatedly to its previous 
result.  This is a recipe for tedium, for a human calculator, 
but it is exactly the kind of thing a computer does best: vast 
quantities of relatively simple operations.  The fractal equation is then:

<BR>
[simple operations] times [a mind-numbing number of repetitions]
= [mind-boggling complexity].
<BR>

<P>
The "simple operations" term means that fractals are relatively easy to 
program into the computer.  
The "mind-numbing number of repetitions" term means that the computer will 
do it much faster, more accurately, and with less pain and complaint 
than a human.  
The result -- "mind-boggling complexity" -- was a complete surprise, 
and means that we need to invoke special measures to deal with the 
problem of making sense of the results of the computation.

<P>
It turns out that the way we human beings are wired up, of all our senses, 
vision provides by far the greatest bandwidth (amount of data per unit time) 
for getting information to the cerebral cortex, 
to the higher brain centers.  
Then, rather than looking at the results as a bunch of numbers (which is how 
the computer deals with them), we can make pictures out of them.  
The original fractal computer graphics mark one of the earliest 
uses of the computer for the purposes of scientific visualization.  
In fact, fractal computer graphics are being used even now in the service 
of making scientific discoveries: the images make possible the recognition 
of patterns and relationships which would otherwise be lost in floods of 
computational data.  Serendipitously, the complexity inherent in these 
synthetic fractal images often comes hand-in-hand with an 
astonishing beauty, making accessible to every person some of the 
much-touted abstract beauty of pure mathematics.  
Indeed, some fractal geometers would claim that the images provide a sort of 
intuitive, visual proof of the existence of such beauty.

<STRONG>Fractals in Science and Philosophy</STRONG><BR>

<P>
What, one might ask, are fractals good for? 
Well, obviously, they generate some 
convincing models of natural phenomena such as mountains and clouds for use in 
computer graphics imagery, and they provide some very compelling 
abstract pictures.  But recently, something like one third of all physics 
papers submitted to journals for publication at least mentioned fractals 
somewhere.  The fact is, fractal geometry is so new on the 
scientific scene that its uses are still being puzzled out.  
The modern philosopher Martin 
Heidegger argued that language itself allows for, even generates a world.  
If this is true, we can expect a fundamentally new language with a 
hitherto-untouched domain of expression 
to generate a new world view.  
Fractal geometry is in the process of doing just that.

<P>
Perhaps the most profound impact of fractal geometry to date is in the 
new science of chaos.  
Scientists have recently discovered order in natural systems, 
where previously there had seemed to be none; 
the language of fractals provides the vocabulary with which they can speak 
of this order; without it, that order probably would have 
remained unrecognized.  
The science of chaos deals with the behavior of nonlinear dynamical 
systems, that is to say, "equations that model natural systems well, 
and how they evolve through time".  
Scientists have long used linear approximations to nonlinear 
systems as a matter of mathematical expedience.  
The nonlinear mathematics models nature more accurately, 
but is intractable in comparison to the linear approximations.  
When computers made it possible for scientists to begin to cope with 
these previously-intractable nonlinear systems, they discovered something 
very surprising: they call it deterministic 
chaos or sensitivity to initial conditions; 
it means that any perturbation to the initial 
state of the system, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, 
will cause the system to diverge; i.e., to evolve into 
an arbitrarily different future state, within a finite period of time.

<P>
This is a counterintuitive notion: we would expect systems that 
started off in very nearly the same state to continue, 
forever, to evolve upon reasonably parallel paths.  Not 
so, we find, and this has profound philosophical consequences.  
In the 1600's Descartes and Newton, as natural philosophers, 
fleshed out a world view so compelling that, if the 
average educated person in our society today stops and thinks about it, 
it seems to be "the obvious way that things are".  
In the Cartesian universe with Newtonian dynamics, if 
we knew 1) the position and velocity of every particle in a closed system 
and 2) the rules for their interactions, 
and we had sufficient power to compute all those interactions, we would 
have the power to predict the future, forever, for that system.  
Obviously correct, right?  If 
our "closed system" were the entire universe, this would have profound 
philosophical implications: there could be no free will, 
it implies that we are all witless automatons, 
mere puppets in some sort of deterministic, 
already-written cosmic script.  
It would affirm the nihilistic philosophy of fatalism, 
and undermine the basis of human morality: that we 
have a choice in matters, 
and that what we choose to do -- and not to do -- 
makes some kind of a difference.

<P>
Perhaps fortunately, our century has seen a series of repudiations 
to this deterministic model of the universe.  
First, Einstein dealt a blow to Cartesian geometry with his theories 
of relativity: space/time is curved, and a line is straight or 
curved relative to the observer's frame of reference.  
Then came quantum mechanics, wherein the Heisenberg Uncertainty 
Principle states that, for particles on the subatomic scale, 
we can know their position or the velocity, but not both -- 
this torpedoes the first premise for computing the future in a 
deterministic universe.  
Very recently -- within the last 15 years or so -- the science of 
chaos has driven a second nail into the coffin of the deterministic universe: 
Suppose we did know the position, 
velocity and rules of interaction for all particles.  
Then any error, no matter how small, in the initial data, 
in its representation (or that of intermediate results), or 
in the computation, 
would lead our computation-of-the-future to be wrong by an arbitrary 
amount within a finite period of time.

<P>
We are left with a bizarre world view: The universe may indeed be deterministic 
(determinism means that the past absolutely determines the future, 
that there is no "choice" at any time, 
and therefore no true randomness and no free will) yet that observation is 
useless, it is meaningless, 
it does us no good whatsoever -- we may as well be living in a 
nondeterministic universe brimming over with free will! 
This is philosophically profound, and evidence that our fractal geometry has 
indeed "generated a new world", in the sense 
that it has fundamentally changed the way we see our universe, as well as 
the way we expect it to behave.  
Such is the character of scientific revolutions.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Fractals in Art and Music</STRONG><BR>

<P>
Back on the more prosaic plane of everyday life, 
we find that fractal geometry is beginning to influence the visual arts.  
As a language of shape and form of unprecedented richness, 
it is fairly easy to see that it can provide a new language for art.  
Fractals images are most readily generated with computer graphics, 
but computer graphics as a medium for the fine arts is nascent: 
the medium and process need to be developed and refined, 
and artists with madness (in Plato's sense of the word) and 
understanding must come to work with it.  
Fractals provide a visual dialect of natural forms, 
couched in the formalisms of mathematics.  
The latter makes it challenging -- even alienating -- to artists, 
while the scientists and mathematicians who are prepared to deal with 
that are rarely trained and practiced in the discipline of visual aesthetics.  
There is beauty to be found in deterministic fractals such as the 
Mandelbrot set and in random fractals such as fractal mountains; 
indeed, that beauty often has the character of seeming to exist a priori, 
somehow inherent in the (in fact always-deterministic) 
procedures used to calculate them.  The role of the artist is 
in exploring the fractal forms and interpreting them, 
visually, in a way that brings aesthetics to the forefront.

Another fascinating association of fractals with the arts is in music.  
It turns out that music from all cultures is fractal in an essential way: 
there is a repetition of form over a variety of scales, 
"scale" in this instance being over time.  
This fractal character is somehow so essential that a sequence of 
random notes sounds quite "musical", if it is only 
constrained to have fractal changes.  That is, 
if the random "score" is constrained, say, to look like the profile of a 
mountain range, we hear something that is tantalizingly close to a 
non-random, 
human-crafted musical score.  
Much as the fractional Brownian motion 
we use to create fractal mountains lacks some of the features of real 
mountains, yet nevertheless captures the essence of "mountainous", 
a random fractal musical score 
somehow has the essence of music, 
without the structure that a human composer would 
impart.
Musical composers such as Wuorinen and Legeti are (consciously) using 
fractals in their compositions, 
yet this area of exploration of the applicability of fractals has also barely 
begun.  An early synthesis of fractally-informed music and fractal 
imagery was the experimental performance by Mandelbrot and Wuorinen of 
"New York Notes" at the Guggenheim museum in the Spring of 1990, 
with a reprise performance at the Alice Tulley Hall of Lincoln Center 
in the Spring of 1991.  
This and other seminal fractal artworks make 
it clear that the association of fractals and the arts is a potentially rich field, with much 
exciting work yet to be done.

<BR><BR>
<STRONG>The Fractal Calendar</STRONG><BR>

<P>
This calendar of fractal images was designed with a 
combination of emphasis on 
aesthetics and on variety of imagery.  
Some attempt has been made to represent the major 
types of fractals: deterministic fractals such as the 
Mandelbrot set and its variations, as well as the whimsical 
"non-Platonic solids"; and 
random fractals as manifest in landscapes with their fractal mountains, 
clouds, waves, trees, and surface textures, as well 
as the diffusion-limited aggregation or DLA.  
I have also striven to represent a wide 
variety of fractal generation methods: 
iterations on the complex plane and in the quaternion 
numbers; 
iterated function systems; 
graph grammars or L-systems; midpoint-displacement 
and spectral synthesis methods for terrains; 
procedural textures for surface detail and artistic image processing; 
simulation of physical processes; 
and genetic algorithms for image synthesis.  
Some of the images are intrinsically two-dimensional, others are of three-
dimensional objects; some are abstract and some represent "fractal forgeries 
of nature" and are thus quite realistic.  
On the whole, they represent some the most interesting of recent 
fractal images, and I hope that they will offer both pleasure and stimulation, 
and perhaps even inspire some future fractalists.
