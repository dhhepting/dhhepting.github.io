<STRONG>Tea for 66,430</STRONG>

Let it never be said that fractalists are without a sense of humor!  
This ray-traced image was carefully constructed to contain as many 
computer graphics cliches as possible.  A swarm of 66,430 mirrored 
versions of the famous-to-computer-graphics Newell teapot floats in 
a fractal arrangement.  The large, central teapot is surrounded by 
nine smaller teapots, each of which is surrounded by nine smaller 
teapots, and so on, to five levels of recursion.  The sum total of 
teapots is composed of over half a billion triangles (ray tracing an 
awful lot of triangles is a common effort in computer graphics).  The 
teapot, shininess, shadows, fractal arrangement, the procedural 
fractal texture on the floor, even the scene itself are cast as cliches of 
computer graphics in this inside-joke-to-the-trade.  This image was 
created in response to the "call for teapots" for the 1989 SIGGRAPH 
computer graphics conference, which chose the venerable Newell 
teapot for it's logo.

The overall image is a send-up of image Sphereflake by Eric Haines.
That image was designed as a standard benchmark image for 
comparing the speed of various ray tracing algorithms and programs, 
thus it in itself it something of a cliches.  The 
<EM>Incandescent Teapot</EM> [not shown], 
by F. Kenton Musgrave, was created in collusion with Craig Kolb in 
response to the same "call for teapots"; both it and Kolb's image 
were rendered in stereo pairs to add a dimension of cheap 3-D 
horror.
