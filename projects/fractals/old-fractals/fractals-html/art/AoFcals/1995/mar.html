<STRONG>The Great Fern Dune</STRONG><BR>

<P>
This fern dune is one of the natural wonders on this distant world. 
The fern leaf is defined by a set of linear transformations, 
sometimes called an iterated function system. 
The sand dune which surrounds the leaf was created by evaluating a 
so-called escape-time function for the fern and subsequently interpreting the 
values as heights. 
The escape-time function works by determining whether a point escapes 
membership in the fern, 
and if so then how quickly. 
The fern shape at the top of the dune reveals the accuracy with which that 
question was answered here. 
More points are included than might otherwise be expected since it is 
easier to exclude points than verify their membership. 
The scene is made more believable by the use of fractal textures 
for the clouds, moon and sand. 
The technique for interpreting function values as heights is effective 
for adding a third dimension to two-dimensional data, 
and has been employed to great advantage in many earlier fractal images.

<P>
Shown below [not shown] are some other examples of natural landscapes created 
using this approach. 
The first shows an interpretation of the dragon curve. 
The bottom right image shows the interesting results when a distance 
function other than the usual Euclidean is used in computations. 
The bottom left image shows a view of the same fern dune, on a brighter day.
