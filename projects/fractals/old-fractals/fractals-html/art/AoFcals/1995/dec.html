<STRONG>Steps to Infinity</STRONG><BR>

<P>
Floating in space, 
this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity.
Each step in the staircase is both a small copy of the whole shape 
and a collection of many smaller copies of itself, 
which illustrates the key concept of self-similarity. 
The fractal, called a dragon curve, is formed by iteration of just two 
linear transformations. 
Each step in the staircase can be identified by a common sequence of 
transformation applications. 
By labeling the transformations with 0 and 1 and recording 
how they are applied, 
one can associate a binary number with each step -- used here to assign heights.
The staircase looks somehow natural but the shape is more regular than would 
be found in nature. 
Like many fractal objects, it possesses a sense of familiarity. 
The clouds in the sky are also fractal, 
but they represent an example of stochastic fractals -- in contrast to 
deterministic fractals like the staircase or the omnipresent Mandelbrot set.

<P>
Below [not shown] are two generations of the dragon curve, 
constructed in the same manner used to form the staircase. 
The left and right images show a low and medium number of divisions 
respectively. 
Further below is part of the Mandelbrot set, 
mapped onto a sphere which serves as the dome of the sky -- seen before 
other image elements are added.
