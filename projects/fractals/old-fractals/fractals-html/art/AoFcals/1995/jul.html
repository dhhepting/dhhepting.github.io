This image takes a portion of the standard Mandelbrot set as its starting point.
The portion chosen, shown at a relatively low magnification factor of 414
in Untitled #7 n-2 (top image below [not shown]), 
seems rather boring with little to recommend it.
However, at a magnification factor of about 40,000, as seen in 
Untitled #7 n-1 (bottom image below), 
this same location reveals the familiar shape of the Mandelbrot set and 
its lake. 
Even at relatively low magnifications, 
images of fractals can be made more interesting by bringing out other 
details and the main image is the result applying one such technique. 
Points outside the Mandelbrot set will "escape" to infinity after some 
number of iterations, 
and this number is usually called the escape time 
(points which have not escaped after the maximum allowed number of iterations 
are considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set). 
Traditionally in images of the Mandelbrot set each point represented
in the image is colored according to this value, 
but I have also experimented with several alternatives. 
One may determine the color by making use of the real component of the 
location at which the point was deemed to have escaped 
(the Mandelbrot set resides on the complex plane and so each point on the 
plane has both real and imaginary components). 
Another technique which can be used to determine color is based on the 
quadrant of the complex plane in which escaped points first land. 
The result is a sort of curved-space checkerboarding of color, 
as points belonging to a single contour may take on any one of four 
colors depending on the point of departure for the escaping point. 
To this, an additional logarithmic coloring algorithm is applied to 
produce smooth color transitions.
