<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Humble Aspirations</STRONG><BR>by <A HREF=http://fas.sfu.ca:80/1/cs/people/GradStudents/darylh>Daryl H. Hepting</A> <BR>(with thanks to F. David Fracchia)<BR><P>In the midst of the harsh surroundings, a lone tree struggles for life. Each element of the scene modeled here employs fractals to shift attention from the mathematical details of the model to the illusion which it creates. The terrain is created from instances of a height field derived from a planar linear fractal, [not] shown below. The density of the fog which covers this desolate land is modulated by a fractal function. The tree, though idealized, does incorporate some observations from nature which, along with a wood texture, add to its realism. Every branch in the tree is created by linearly transforming the trunk. Beginning with a very concise description, the model is expanded to include over 150,000 primitives for rendering. Further intuition about the connection between plants, trees and fractals is given by the other two images below -- shapes which look as if they may belong in nature, but come from a concise mathematical description.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade96/jun.gif ALT="{jun.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
