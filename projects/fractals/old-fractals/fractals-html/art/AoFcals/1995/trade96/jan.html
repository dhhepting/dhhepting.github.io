<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Snowflake in Winter</STRONG><BR>by <A HREF=http://fas.sfu.ca:80/1/cs/people/GradStudents/darylh>Daryl H. Hepting</A> <BR><P>von Koch's snowflake curve, an early mathematical monster, is depicted herein friendlier surroundings.  The blue visible amidst the spheres is what remainsafter an algorithm to cover the complement of the fractal is applied.  Itworks by finding the minimum distance of <EM>d</EM> of a point <EM>x</EM>from the fractal then drawing a disk of radius (maybe less than) <EM>d</EM> centered at <EM>x</EM>.  Since any point already inside a disk cannot be part of the fractal, the algorithm progresses quickly as the complementis covered by disks.  The spheres are the three-dimensional extensions of those disks. A fractal texture is applied to the spheres to createsnowballs -- the making of which is a common pastime during long Canadianwinters.  The snowflake curve is based on an equilateral triangle, of whicheach side is divided into three parts then replaced by four parts, of thethe same length, and so on.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade96/jan.gif ALT="{jan.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
