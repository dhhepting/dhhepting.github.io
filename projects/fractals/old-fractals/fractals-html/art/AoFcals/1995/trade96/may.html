<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Mandelbloom</STRONG><BR>by Lewis N. Siegel<BR>(with thanks to Randy Hudson and Daryl H. Hepting)<BR><P>It has been observed, by Mandelbrot and others,that fractal forms are found abundantly in nature. In this spirit, Mandelbloom shows natural forms occurring in a fractal. The image was created with a method used to show how the Mandelbrot set evolvesover time. To create an image of the Mandelbrot set, points in the complex plane are iterated according to the well known function Zn+1 = Zn2 + C. The structure in Mandelbloom comes from an attempt to capture the movement of these points at a particular moment in time. In traditional renderings of the Mandelbrot set, each point in the plane is iterated until it escapes from the neighborhood of the origin, or reaches an upper limit. The number of iterations is then utilized to generate a color for the pixel which represents that point. In Mandelbloom, each point is instead iterated exactlythe same number of times, and each point's location in the plane is used to color the pixel.<P>With this method, a procedural texture is used to associate a color with every point in the complex plane. The left column of the image below shows a Julia set rendered with a texture that uses a point's distance from the origin to generate a color for the pixel;white near the origin, and black toward infinity. It shows iterations zero (with the points in their original locations), one, two and four. The same set rendered with a more complex "basket weave" pattern is shown in the right column of the image below. Each point's locationin the pattern is used to calculate color values for the corresponding pixel. This same basket weave pattern was used to generate Mandelbloom, with an extra step at the end. Rather than calculating colors for the pattern, color values are read from bitmaps of either the stem or the rose.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade96/may.gif ALT="{may.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
