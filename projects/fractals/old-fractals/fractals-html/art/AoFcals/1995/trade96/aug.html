<HTML><BODY><STRONG>Fractal Quilt</STRONG><BR>by Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky<BR><P>Fractals can be created to mimic the real world and they can also be used as a source of pattern generation. Combining fractal methods with symmetry leads to a method for creating many kinds of repeating patterns. The seventeen different symmetry types of planar repeating patterns were classified formally by Federov in 1891 -- but their existence has been known for centuries. Indeed, each of these patterns appears in the Alhambra, a group of buildings overlooking the city of Granada that was constructed by the Moors in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Only more recently have mathematicians considered how many different ways there are to construct two-color planar repeating patterns -- there are forty-six possibilities. A two-color repeating pattern is one in whichhalf the symmetries of the figure preserve the colors while half the symmetries interchange colors. Fractal methods have been used to create the large two-color fractal quilt on the opposite page. It is amusing to check whether you can, in fact, identify all of the symmetries in this figure. (Besides the translations, there are eight symmetries -- four preserve colors and four interchange them.)<P>A quilt pattern can have more than one two-coloring. We illustrate this below [not shown] by showing three different ways to two-color the same fractal quilt. Here, another two-color fractal quilt pattern serves as background.<BR><BR><IMG SRC=http://fas.sfu.ca/I/cs/research/projects/FractalCal/trade96/aug.gif ALT="{aug.gif}"></BODY></HTML>
