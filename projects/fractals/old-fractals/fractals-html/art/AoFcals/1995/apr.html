<P>
This image is the result of a two-year metamorphosis from the image 
shown below [not shown], entitled 
Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing. 
The title of these images is a partial quote from Karen Blixen's
novel <EM>Out of Africa</EM>. 
From inspection, one may see that both pictures depict the same fractal 
and that they share virtually all the same coordinates and parameters.
The roles of color and black (or monotones) between the two images are reversed.
Areas black in Variation #1 were colored according to logarithmic function
in the original and monotone areas in the original received an 
algorithmic coloring. 
The form of the original is still visible in Variation #1, 
but it has been de-emphasized. 
The images are based on a variation of the usual formula describing Julia sets:
zn+1 = zn2 + c, 
where one may adjust the value of c (a complex number) as a parameter to 
obtain different images.
In the variation, a function is added to the mix and becomes another parameter 
for manipulation: 
zn+1 = f(zn) + zn2 + c. 
For these images, the conjugate of a cosine function was used. 
While I still prefer the original picture, as a parent might feel for a child,
it appears that almost everyone who has seen both of these pictures prefers 
Variation #1. I present them to you for your inspection.
