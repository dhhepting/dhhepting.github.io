<P>
A dragon curve is captured here in what may be its natural habitat. 
The brooding dragon curve remains after its complement has been covered 
by the blocks which form the walls which enclose it. 
The primitives are not spheres, as before, since the Manhattan distance 
function is used in place of the usual Euclidean. 
This means that distance is calculated — x— +— y—  rather than ÷x2+y2 and so 
diamonds in the Manhattan metric fill the same role as circles in the 
Euclidean metric. 
To create the third dimension in this image, 
boxes with height proportional to the size of the original diamonds were used. 
The sharpness of these boxes and their shadows provide an interesting 
contrast to the apparent roughness of the dragon curve, 
created with a fractal texture.

<P>
Shown immediately below [not shown] is the two-dimensional view of the 
computations that created the model which was ray-traced for the main image. 
Further below is an image similar to the main which instead uses as primitives 
the Manhattan metric's equivalent to spheres.
