<STRONG>Front cover</STRONG> (shown above): 
Floating in space, 
this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity. 
At once, it appears natural and yet somehow unnatural, 
perhaps a testament to the familiarity of fractals. 
Amidst the fractal clouds, the sky reveals part of the 
omnipresent Mandelbrot set.

<STRONG>Acknowledgements</STRONG>:
This calendar was completed with the assistance of the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics and the Graphics and Multimedia Research Laboratory
at Simon Fraser University. Earlier work was done at the University of Regina
and at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.  There are 
many to whom I am grateful, but especially B. Mandelbrot, K. Musgrave, 
P. Prusinkiewicz, D. Saupe, and R. Voss.
