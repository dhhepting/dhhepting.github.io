This image demonstrates recent advances in computer graphics at modeling 
supernatural phenomena. 
This crop circle, that might have otherwise been the result of a UFO encounter,
as actually created using a technique called procedural geometric instancing. 
It allows a new representation for procedural models, 
which are typically translated into simpler polygonal 
representations for rendering. 
The usual unorganized polygonal representations can be unmanageable due to size.
Procedural geometric instancing encapsulates procedural components into the 
geometric representation,
which are evaluated on demand during rendering. 
The crop circle, containing over 100 million primitives, 
was specified by a short description file which represents the field
of wheat with a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) hierarchy of instances
of a single wheat stalk (right image below) which may or may not bend over, 
depending on the location into which it is instanced. 
Given this position, a simple lookup in a low-resolution "crop map" of the 
Mandelbrot set determines whether the UFO should bend the stalk or not.

This technique can also trample a teapot into a field of cones 
(upper left image below [not shown]). 
Procedural geometric instancing can also be used to represent tropism in trees,
which models the effect of gravity, sunlight and wind on branching patterns. 
The left tree was modeled without any tropism whereas the right 
tree feels the effect of gravity (lower left image below [not shown]).
