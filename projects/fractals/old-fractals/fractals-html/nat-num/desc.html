Someexamples from history include:<UL><LI> musical scales (doubling frequency increases octave, also related to length of string)<LI> development of sunflower heads (Fibonacci numbers and Golden Angle describe placement of seeds)</UL><P>Can numbers describe coastlines or clouds?<UL><LI> how does one measure a coastline?  (It depends on the length of the measuring stick!)<LI> <A HREF=http://fas.sfu.ca/~dhepting/personal/images/present/math-of-art/fractals.html>fractals provide a solution</A><LI> <A HREF=../../../../../../webpage/personal/personal/images/present/nat-num/dimension.html>What number would you use to describe the following?</A><CENTER><P><IMG SRC=../../../../../../webpage/personal/personal/images/present/nat-num/snow-4.gif><P></CENTER></UL><P><HR>Back to <A HREF=../../../../../../webpage/personal/personal/images/present/nat-num/>Nature's Numbers</A></BODY></HTML>
