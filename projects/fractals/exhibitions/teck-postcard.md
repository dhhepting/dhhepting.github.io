<li>
An <strong>exhibition</strong>
   of art based on mathematical principles and ideas.
   Fractals, more so than other areas of mathematics,
   are visually exciting in a very real way. 
   Fractals are a language with which to describe the geometry of nature. 
   Images of fractals can be an important access to
   mathematics and surrounding philosophical questions. 
   Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Teck Gallery (Room 1305).
</li>
<li>
Interactive computer displays for visitors
   to experiment with making their own fractal designs; investigate 
   E-Gems, a project to design math and science electronic games 
   (<em>Counting on Frank</em>, one of their products, was chosen by 
   PC Magazine as one of the top 100 CD-ROMs for 1995); 
   and check out the math education and art resources available on
   the Internet. 
   Noon &dash; 5 pm in the Segal Centre (Room 1430).
</li>
<li>
Ingenious mathematical amateurs. It is possible for someone without
   formal credentials to make contributions to mathematics. Well-known artist
   M.C. Escher and unknown homemaker Marjorie Rice both tackled mathematical
   problems, developing unorthodox notation that was essential to their
   methodical investigations. Each worked alone, essentially in secret,
   rewarded by the exhilaration of finding answers to a large puzzle. Lecture
   by Dr. Doris Schattschneider, Professor (Emerita) of Mathematics, 
   Moravian College.
   5 &dash; 6 pm in the Fletcher Challenge Canada Theatre (Room 1900).
