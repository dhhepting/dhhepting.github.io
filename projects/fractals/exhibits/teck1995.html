			<h2>
				Introduction
			</h2>
			<p>
				Mandates of art galleries are many, but the mandate that immediately
				defines a university gallery is the mandate that a gallery demonstrates the
				aesthetic dimensions of academic disciplines.  It was to this end that
				Simon Fraser Gallery mounted its first math art exhibition, 
				<a href="eiw1994.html">EXPLORING THE IMAGE WORLD OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS</a> 
				works by Daryl Hepting <em>( and others from the Graphics and Multimedia Research Lab in 
				the School of Computing Science )</em>, in the W.A.C. Bennett Gallery, 
				May 30 to July 26, 1994.
			</p>
			<p>
				Daryl Hepting, a Ph.D. Candidate in the School of Computing Science and one
				of the four curators of this exhibition, knows the connections between
				computers and aesthetics as few in Simon Fraser University can.  He takes
				us on a short course on math art in the notes on these digital graphics.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other members of Simon Fraser University who joined me in curating this
				exhibition were Dr. Katherine Heinrich, Chair of Mathematics & Statistics
				and Dr. Malgorzata Dubiel of the same department. 
			</p>
			<p>
				These eighteen images were selected from scores of possible images so as to
				represent the complexities and contrasts of visual aesthetics that are
				possible in 
				digital graphics.  They were also selected to represent the images that are
				available from three sources on the WORLD WIDE WEB (internet): computer art
				exhibits, pioneer publications, and computer images created by Daryl
				Hepting of Simon Fraser University.
			</p>
			<p>
				Simon Fraser Gallery is grateful for the assistance of Gallery staff, Daryl
				Hepting and the other curators for making this exhibition possible.  It is
				also grateful to the Graphics and Mulimedia Research Lab for production
				assistance.  The Teck and Simon Fraser Galleries are honoured to support
				the Department of Mathematics & Statistics in hosting the Canadian
				Mathematical Society 1995 Winter Meeting.

			<h2>
				Notes on Exhibition
			</h2>
			<p>
				The majority of works in this exhibition represent a collection 
				which rely on the computer for their existence.  
				And the computer involves mathematics
				to describe, manipulate, and translate even the simplest scenes
				into the forms we see here.  
				The involvement of mathematics plays a greater role in these works &dash;
				it provides the inspiration and the foundation upon which they are constructed.
			</p>
			<p>
				A prominent feature of the exhibit is its display of fractals, objects from
				a non-Euclidean geometry. Fractals &dash; sharing a root with fracture and
				fraction &dash; have been called the geometry of nature by Mandelbrot, who
				discovered their capability to describe the non-smooth world in which we
				live.  Fractal geometry, which is new to us, has shed light on old things
				&dash; things like the historical record of water levels in the Nile river for
				instance.  And in its turn the computer has shed light on fractals,
				allowing the underlying beauty of what may seem to be dry-as-dust
				mathematics to shine through. 
				Works like 
				<a href="#blessed"><strong>Blessed State</strong></a> 
				or 
				<a href="#infinity"><strong>Steps to Infinity</strong></a> 
				provide evidence of the profound connection that 
				seems to exist between fractals and the natural world.
			</p> 
			<p>
				It is fitting that this collection of computer-related art comes to us
				in large part through the internet (the World Wide Web). Although Daryl
				Hepting is now at SFU, his works are distributed widely across the
				internet. In addition to Hepting's collaborations with Musgrave (George
				Washington University), Prusinkiewicz (University of Calgary), Saupe
				(University of Freiburg), and Snider (University of Regina), the
				computer-based works come from:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li> 
					<a href="http://sf.anu.edu.au/~sjr900/contours/catalogue.html">
						Contours of the Mind: A Celebration of Fractals, Feedback and Chaos
					</a>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<a href="http://www.sito.org/">SITO: the operative term is "stimulate"</a>
				</li>
				<li> 
					<a href="../calendars/">The Fractals Calendar</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				The other pieces in this exhibit remind the viewer that the computer is
				responsible for only a portion of all mathematical art. The works of M. C.
				Escher and Marjorie Rice offer a beautiful expression of this fact.
			</p>
			<p>
				Partial financial support for the exhibit at Harbour Centre was provided by the 
				<a href="http://www.gov.bc.ca/">BC Ministry for Employment and Investment</a>.

			<h2 id="fiery">Fiery Dragon</h2>
			
			<p>
				by Daryl H. Hepting
			</p>
			
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/dhh-fiery.gif" alt="Fiery Dragon"/>
			<p>
				Martin Gardener tells the story of how this curve, 
				first discovered by John E. Heighway, used by William G. Harter as a 
				decoration symbolic of cryptic structure, and later analysed by them and
				another colleague, Bruce A. Banks.  Though its final structure is complex, 
				its description is not.  The following two transformations are required to 
				generate this shape:
			</p>
			
			<pre>
			xform
			        scale { sqrt(2)/2 }
			        rotate -45
			
			xform
			        scale { sqrt(2)/2 }
			        rotate 135
			        translate 1.0 0.0
			</pre>
			
			<p>
				Beginning with a single point, the whole curve can be generated by repeated
				application of these two transformations.  This specification of the shape
				in terms of contractive, affine transformations is called an iterated function
				system (IFS). 
			</p> 
			<p>
				This image of a dragon curve was created by covering with disks (spheres) the 
				parts of the plane which do not include the fractal.  These parts are 
				determined by computing the minimum distance from a point <EM>P</EM>
				to the fractal.  
				If this distance is <EM>d</EM>,  then a disk of radius <EM>d</EM> can be
				drawn about the point <EM>P</EM> and all points inside that disk are known
				not to belong to the fractal.  
				Click <a href="/~hepting/assets/videos/fractals/ex/teck-dragondisks.mov">here</a> to
				see a movie which illustrates this process at work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like many of my other works, I've used 
				<a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/~cek/rayshade/info.html">
				<em>rayshade</em></a> 
				to ray-trace this image.
				This process creates the final image (which you see above) by simulating a
				camera inside the computer.

				Steps to Infinity (1994)
			</h2>
			<p>
				by Daryl H. Hepting and F. Kenton Musgrave
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/dhh-infinity.gif" />
	
			<p>
				The steps in this image come from a dragon curve, like the one seen on the 
				poster for this event (and described in the notes for 
				<a href="#fiery"><em>Fiery Dragon</em></a>.  
				Below, I show two different colourings for a dragon
				curve in the plane.  The curve is made up of smaller and smaller copies of
				itself, as the colourings indicate.   
			</p>
	
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/ex/teck-infinity_exp_d1.gif" />
	
			<p>
				There are two transformations which define the dragon curve each small dragon
				seen above can be described by a sequence of these two transformations.  To
				create the steps, I've assigned a unique height to each small dragon.  Below,
				I show the steps inside a white sphere, which represents the sky.  It doesn't
				look much like a very believable sky here, but I'll fix that.  The lighting
				I've used here is much simpler than in the final image and it shows.
			</p>
	
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/ex/teck-infinity_exp_h1.gif" />
	
			<p>
				If you look carefully at <strong>Steps to Infinity</strong>, 
				you will notice (part of) a Mandelbrot set in the sky, amongst the clouds.  
				I began with a portion of the Mandelbrot set, shown below.  
				It may be familiar
				to you from Ken Musgrave's image on the cover of the 1994/95 
				Fractals Calendar.  In this case, I've changed to colours more appropriate
				for a blue sky.
			</p>
			
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/ex/teck-infinity_exp_s1.gif" />
	
			<p>
				For the next step, I've mapped the square image onto the inside of a white
				sphere, which will represent the dome of the sky in the model of my scene.
				Notice that this image is considerably lighter than the first, and this is
				due only to the white colour of the original sphere.
			</p>
	
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/ex/teck-infinity_exp_s2.gif" />
			
			<p>
				I create some clouds for the sky by using a fractal texture function which
				selects blues and whites for each pixel based on something called fractional
				Brownian motion.
			</p>
	
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/ex/teck-infinity_exp_s3.gif" />

			<p>
				When the clouds are combined with the Mandelbrot set image, the final
				Mandelbrot sky image comes to life.
			</p>

			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/ex/teck-infinity_exp_s4.gif" />

			<p>
				And the final image once again...

				Captivating Rhythm (1995)
			</h2>
			<p>
				by Daryl H. Hepting
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/dhh-rhythm.gif" />
			<p>
				This image is based on a fractal which is similar to the one used to 
				create <em><a href="#fiery">Fiery Dragon</a></em> and
				<em><a href="#infinity">Steps to Infinity</a></em>.  This curve is also
				defined by two transformations, but with slightly different parameters:
			</p>
			<pre>
			xform
			        scale 0.618	    /* Dragon scales by approximately .7071 */
			        rotate -137.5
			
			xform
			        scale -0.618
			        rotate 137.5
			        translate 1.0 0.0
			</pre>
			<p>
				This image is an interpretation of the process by which the points of the
				plane are captured by the transformations in the description of the curve to
				form the actual curve.
			</p>
		<p>
			I've assigned an initial point to each of the two transformations and I apply
			the transformations to their respective points and then to the results, over
			and over again.  As I compose the transformations into longer and longer
			strings, the contractivity of each composite transformation increases.  These
			"stronger" transformations capture more and more of the plane.  I've 
			illustrated this process in a 
			<A HREF="/~hepting/assets/videos/fractals/ex/teck-rhythmcones.mov">movie</a>, using cones
			to show the effect of the transformations.  As the strength of a 
			transformation increases, a cone under that transformation gets wider and 
			shorter.
		</p>
		<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/ex/teck-rhythm_exp1.gif" />
		<p>
			The upper black and white image above shows one possible colouring for the
			image used to construct <EM>Captivating Rhythm</EM>.  Each band corresponds
			to a different level of "capture", increasing away from the curve.
			The reverse of "capture" (lower left above) is "escape" (lower right above).
			Notice how the arrangement of disks differs between them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The image below shows another way to view the same data, ultimately selected
			for the final image.  Here, I have broken up what were solid bands in the 
			earlier image by using information about which transformation was applied
			at a particular time.  In creating the final image, I applied a fractional 
			Brownian motion texture and added an outline of the fractal.
