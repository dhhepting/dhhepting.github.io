			<h2>Light Lace</h2>
			<p>
				by Kevin Suffern
			</p>		
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-jan.gif" alt="Light Lace" />
			<p>
				One of the most striking aspects of fractal geometry is the underlying 
				simplicity which generates the visually-complex fractal forms.  In 
				this case, an approximation of the Sierpinski Gasket (as seen on the 
				title page of this calendar) is generated by the interreflection of light 
				between four spheres!  The reflection model employed is not like the 
				&ldquo;real world&rdquo;:  
				the light gains energy in each reflection, as opposed to losing energy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here we see the four spheres from the outside.  The point of view for 
				the main image is inside of the tetrahedron formed by the four 
				spheres.  <em>Blueglass</em> [not shown] is formed by 100 interreflections 
				of light from a shiny blue sphere placed inside a shiny chrome sphere.  The 
				complexity here is also fractal (i.e., forms repeat over a variety of 
				scales), but more subtly so.  It is remarkable that such simple 
				systems can give rise to fractal complexity!

			<h2>
				The Five Non-Platonic Non-Solids
			</h2>
			<p>
				by John C. Hart
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-feb.gif" 
				alt="The Five Non-Platonic Non-Solids"/>
			<p>
				The five Platonic solids are the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, 
				dodecahedron, and icosahedron.  Here they are transformed into 
				fractals by recursively removing polyhedron-volumes from every 
				solid part, generating Sierpinski's tetrahedron, octahedron and 
				icosahedron, Menger's sponge (in green), and the (reddish) von Koch 
				snowflake-a-hedron.  As every solid portion has been reduced ad 
				infinitum, the result has zero volume, and infinite surface area!  Thus 
				the moniker "non-Platonic non-solids".
			</p>
			<p>
				The non-Platonic non-solids and this fractal forest are modelled 
				using iterated function systems  in which simple transformations are 
				repeatedly applied, to place particles in space.  The sum of these 
				particles is one of the many forms seen here.  Thus these forms are 
				composed of vast numbers of very small particles.  In true fractal 
				form, the shapes we see are repeated over a range of different scales 
				or sizes.  The pulled-taffy shape of the quaternion Julia set is the 
				result of a different type of simple iteration, performed in an 
				extension of the complex numbers called the quaternions.  The result 
				is a four-dimensional fractal, which is projected down into three 
				dimensions, then to the two of the image plane.

				Anything but Blue
			</h2>
			<p>
				by F. Kenton Musgrave
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-mar.gif" alt="Anything but Blue" />
			<p>
				A problem with computer models of landscapes is that they are 
				entirely abstract &dash; just a bunch of numbers &dash; and have no intrinsic 
				scale.  If one simply projects them onto the image plane, the result 
				will appear to be no bigger than the image itself.   Landscape 
				painters have known for hundreds of years that a critical distance 
				cue for large scales is aerial perspective, or the bluing and loss of 
				contrast over large distances.  In Nature, this is due to complex 
				effects of scattering of light by the atmosphere.  Simplified models of 
				such atmospheric scattering can impart a sense scale to terrain 
				renderings, as <em>Anything but Blue</em> demonstrates.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the tradition of painters, we often render the same scene in 
				different light, to evoke different moods and visual effects.  Both 
				<em>Lethe</em> [not shown] and <em>Cool Afternoon</em> [not shown] 
				are color studies of the mountain seen 
				above, informed by the color use of both past and contemporary 
				schools of landscape painting.  To achieve greatness in its own right, 
				computer art will have to stand on the shoulders of the giants who 
				have come before.  Interestingly, though, computer graphics reopens 
				the artistic problem of representationalism, which has been regarded 
				as a solved problem in the visual arts since the invention of the 
				camera.  Setting out to synthesize images of arbitrary realism from 
				first principles we face a whole new set of problems, most of which 
				yet await satisfactory solution.

				Tea for 66,430
			</h2>
			<p>
				by Craig Kolb (with thanks to Eric Haines)
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-apr.gif" alt="Tea for 66,430" />
			<p>
				Let it never be said that fractalists are without a sense of humor!  
				This ray-traced image was carefully constructed to contain as many 
				computer graphics cliches as possible.  A swarm of 66,430 mirrored 
				versions of the famous-to-computer-graphics Newell teapot floats in 
				a fractal arrangement.  The large, central teapot is surrounded by 
				nine smaller teapots, each of which is surrounded by nine smaller 
				teapots, and so on, to five levels of recursion.  The sum total of 
				teapots is composed of over half a billion triangles (ray tracing an 
				awful lot of triangles is a common effort in computer graphics).  The 
				teapot, shininess, shadows, fractal arrangement, the procedural 
				fractal texture on the floor, even the scene itself are cast as cliches of 
				computer graphics in this inside-joke-to-the-trade.  This image was 
				created in response to the "call for teapots" for the 1989 SIGGRAPH 
				computer graphics conference, which chose the venerable Newell 
				teapot for its logo.
			</p>
			<p>
				The overall image is a send-up of image <em>Sphereflake</em> by Eric Haines.
				That image was designed as a standard benchmark image for 
				comparing the speed of various ray tracing algorithms and programs, 
				thus it in itself it something of a cliches.  The 
				<em>Incandescent Teapot</em> [not shown], 
				by F. Kenton Musgrave, was created in collusion with Craig Kolb in 
				response to the same "call for teapots"; both it and Kolb's image 
				were rendered in stereo pairs to add a dimension of cheap 3-D 
				horror.

			<h2>
				DLA
			</h2>		
			<p>
				by F. Kenton Musgrave (with thanks to Lionel Woog and Benoit Mandelbrot)
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-may.gif" alt="DLA" />
			<p>
				An area of current scientific research in fractals is the study by 
				physicists of diffusion-limited aggregations or DLA's: the structures 
				that result when particles moving about on random walks stick to 
				one another when they make contact.  This image represents the use 
				of state-of-the-art computer graphics effects in service of scientific 
				visualization.  Today's powerful computers can generate such vast 
				quantities of information that scientists can only deal with it visually.  
				(Of all our senses, vision provides by far the greatest bandwidth for 
				getting information to the cerebral cortex.)  In this case, a computer 
				simulation has generated a shape &mdash; a three-dimensional DLA &mdash; 
				which is so complex that it is hard to render a way which clearly 
				conveys its spatial structure.  An atmospheric function (the same one 
				which surrounds the earth in Gaea & Selene) has been centered on 
				the DLA, the shiny spheres of which reflect its glow.  The color of the 
				spheres reflects the time at which they joined the cluster, telling us 
				something about the growth history of the cluster.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here we see the same scene rendered in a different way: the 
				emphasis here is not on scientific visualization, but rather on 
				aesthetics.  Again, the atmosphere function is used to disambiguate 
				three-dimensional structure after projection to a two-dimensional 
				image, and the atmosphere is modulated to emulate a range of 
				incandescent black-body temperatures.  Understanding the growth of 
				DLA's is a prerequisite to understanding phenomena as diverse as 
				the efficient extraction of oil from porous rocks underground and the 
				formation and structure of both soot and interstellar dust particles.  
				Below is a rendering of the Laplacian potential around a portion of a 
				2-D DLA cluster.  The grey scale represents the value of the potential, 
				and each cycle of grey represents a drop by a factor of 10 in the 
				value potential.  The source at the top is at potential 1.0 and the DLA 
				boundary is at 0.0.  The arborescent structure of the fjords is still a 
				matter of controversy among physicists:  it is not yet decided 
				whether they are exactly self-similar, or whether the fjords are 
				parallel, or wedge-shaped.  The green lines are field lines emanating 
				from points on the DLA boundary,  ascending to the source, while the 
				red lines start along a horizontal line and descend towards the 
				boundary by steepest descent of the potential.  Note that ascent is 
				convergent, but descent is unstable in the fashion of deterministic 
				chaos:  it exhibits sensitivity to initial conditions (in this case the 
				starting point of the path).

				Splash
			</h2>
			<p>
				by F. Kenton Musgrave (with thanks to Karl Sims and Robert Alec Cook)
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-jun.gif" alt="Splash" />
			<p>
				A genetic algorithm developed by Karl Sims was used to generate 
				this image on a massively parallel supercomputer   In the genetic 
				algorithm, expressions which generate surface textures from the 
				LISP programming language are randomly generated and "mutated" 
				by the computer, and "selected" and cross-bred by the user.  This 
				powerful random process rapidly creates striking images which are 
				entirely procedural in nature; that is, they represent the unmodified 
				output of the computer program.  <em>Splash</em> features a pattern 
				"painted" on a fractal  surface.  The coloring, the pattern, and the 
				fractal surface texture all arose spontaneously in the process of 
				"aesthetic selection".
			</p>
			<p> 
				Splash and these other fractal images were all created over the 
				course of several hours of "work" by a previously-inexperienced 
				user.  The power of the process which created these images lies in its 
				automaticity:  in principle, and person using the system could have 
				come up with these images (or better), as it is driven by simply 
				choosing "what you like" and having the computer "evolve" that.  Its 
				appeal lies in the parallel to Darwinian evolution which, presumably, 
				created all life on Earth through a similarly arbitrary process of 
				mutation and selection.

				Slickrock
			</h2>
			<p>
				by F. Kenton Musgrave (with thanks to Craig Kolb)
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-jul.gif" alt="Slickrock" />
			<p>
				One of the fundamental problems with making computer graphics 
				pictures of fractals is that their high spatial-frequency content, when 
				combined with the point-sampling techniques used in image 
				synthesis, can lead to aliasing or &ldquo;noisy&rdquo; images.  Another problem 
				with fractal landscapes is that a very detailed model requires a lot of 
				storage space, yet it can have too little detail in the foreground, and 
				too much in the distance (leading to visual noise there).  A solution to 
				these problems is procedural modelling, in which the terrain model 
				does not exist a priori, but rather is calculated the appropriate level 
				of detail &mdash; on-the-fly, as the image is made.  
				<em>
					Slickrock
				</em>
				is an 
				example of such a landscape.  Note that it features sharp ridge lines, 
				which would appear to have saw-teeth if the triangles tessellating 
				the surface were much bigger than pixel-sized.  
				<em>
					Slickrock
				</em>
				uses the 
				aerial perspective model first tested in 
				<em>
					Anything but Blue
				</em> 
				(see March) to impart a sense of very large scale.
			</p>
			<p>
				The landscape seen in 
				<em>
					Slickrock
				</em> 
				is the destination in an animation 
				currently under production, a short sort of "Powers of Ten" zoom 
				from deep space.  The planets seen in <em>Gaea & Selene</em> will grow 
				from points in the far distance, as we zoom up to it.  Then we will fly 
				down through the atmosphere (as seen in the detail below) and up to 
				the mountains seen in Slickrock.  The procedural approach allows 
				the models to be generated with appropriate spatial frequency 
				content for its distance from the eye point (i.e., without too many 
				tiny details, which lead to aliasing or visual "noise" in the image). 
				Furthermore, the nature of procedural fractal models allows us to 
				investigate the scene as closely as we like &mdash; the program just keeps 
				adding as much detail as is required.  All features, both large and 
				small, arise from the underlying randomness of the fractal functions,
				therefore the artist is not responsible for explicitly specifying any of 
				them.  Thus the artist who creates the scene may be as surprised by 
				what is to be found there, as anyone else!  When implemented in 
				virtual reality, this promises exciting explorations of a "virtual" 
				universe filled with such "virtual" planets.

				Desert Ball
			</h2>
			<p>
				by F. Kenton Musgrave
			</p>
			<img src="/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-aug.gif" alt="Desert Ball" />
			<p>
				In all of the landscape images seen in this calendar, procedural 
				textures  are used to color the surfaces and to add visual detail.  
				A procedural texture is a mathematical function which is defined 
				throughout three-space, and evaluated at the points where the rays 
				emanating from the eye (in the ray tracing rendering method for 
				generating synthetic images) intersect surfaces in the scene.  In the 
				course of development of one of these functions, it is generally 
				rendered on the surface of a sphere, to see how it looks.  A sphere is 
				used for two reasons:  it is one of the quickest objects to ray trace 
				(ray tracing being a notoriously slow procedure), and it shows what 
				the texture will look like at all angles of illumination.  While such 
				images are simply tests along the way to a specific visual goal, 
				sometimes they represent striking images in their own right.  
				<em>
					Desert Ball
				</em> 
				came about while developing the texture used on the terrain in 
				<em>
					Slickrock
				</em> (see 
				<a href="#jul">
					July
				</a>
				).  
				All that was added to the test image is the 
				burgundy background and the faint light source coming from the 
				right.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>
					Desert Ball
				</em> 
				and 
				<em>
					Earth Sequence
				</em>
				[not shown] both employ two different uses 
				of a vector-valued  fBm (fractional Brownian motion) function.  The 
				vector-valued function simply returns three separate values for 
				independent fBm functions.  This 3-vector can be interpreted 
				however we please.  Interpreted as a spatial vector, it can be added 
				to the surface normal (the vector sticking straight up from the 
				surface) before calculating the lighting there, which of course 
				depends on the surface's orientation to the light source.  This method 
				is called bump-mapping.  Applied to the large burgundy sphere in 
				the background of 
				<em>
					Desert Ball
				</em>, 
				it generates the rough-looking highlight to the left.  
				In 
				<em>
					Earth Sequence
				</em> 
				[not shown] it is used to generate 
				oceans and continents.  Another interpretation of the fBm vector is as 
				an rgb (red, green, blue) color value, which can be added to the basic 
				surface color.  This perturbation gives rise to the subtle color 
				variations in 
				<em>
					Desert Ball
				</em>
				and in the last sphere of 
				<em>
					Earth Sequence
				</em>
				[not shown].
				<em>
					Fire Ball
				</em> 
				[not shown] is another test image from the 
				development of an fBm-based fractal flame texture.

			<h2>
				Spirit Lake
			</h2>
			<p>
				by F. Kenton Musgrave
			</p>
			<img src=/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-sep.gif alt="Spirit Lake" />
			<p>
				Fractional Brownian motion, or fBm for short, is (loosely) defined as 
				the integral through time of the increments of a random walk with 
				Gaussian increments.  It is a random fractal function which 
				resembles many things in Nature:  the flood levels of the Nile 
				through time, stock and commodity price fluctuations, the 
				transparency of a cloud along a line, and the skyline of mountains, to 
				name a few.  Some years ago, Benoit Mandelbrot noted the latter 
				resemblance and reasoned that fBm extended to 2-D to form a 
				surface would resemble a mountain range.  Thus were born fractal 
				mountains for computer graphics.  But the resemblance of fBm to 
				mountains has no known causal basis; fBm simply looks like 
				mountains.  A research area, then, has been to improve and augment 
				the descriptive power of fBm-based terrain models.  Spirit Lake is 
				an early illustration of a terrain model in which the fractal dimension 
				and crossover scales varies with altitude.  Thus the mountain is 
				smoother at the lake's edge, and rougher near the peak.  The 
				triangles visible near the peak show the scale of the geometric detail; 
				smaller details are visual effects generated by a procedural texture, 
				which does not vary roughness with altitude.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Carolina</em> [not shown] is a different use of the same 
				heterogeneous terrain model, 
				this time used to emulate ancient, heavily eroded mountains such as 
				the Blue Ridge Mountains in the American Southeast.  
				<em>Medicine Lake</em> [not shown] features the same mountain seen in 
				<em>Spirit Lake</em>, but with a 
				different procedural texture applied to the surface.  Both 
				<em>Spirit Lake</em> and <em>Medicine Lake</em> [not shown] 
				feature a model of the rainbow which, 
				unlike the mountain models, is based on the laws and measurements 
				of physics and geometric optics.  It was created by recreating with a 
				computer, a simulation of the propagation of light through an 
				idealized raindrop, first published by Rene Descartes in 1637.  This 
				was coupled with a model of dispersion (discovered by Sir Isaac 
				Newton a few decades later) to generate an accurate model of both 
				the position and colors of the rainbow.

			<h2>Dragon Mesa</h2>

			</p>
			<img src=/~hepting/assets/images/fractals/cal/94-oct.gif alt="Dragon Mesa" />
			<p>
				This landscape, perhaps from some distant planet, illustrates a 
				continuous escape-time function evaluation for an iterated function 
				system (IFS) of the famous dragon curve.  This image may seem 
				similar to some of the familiar  images created for Julia sets, and this 
				is not by accident.  In fact, this picture was created as part of a study 
				which developed rendering functions for iterated function systems 
				analogous to those which had previously existed for Julia and 
				Mandelbrot sets.  In seeking out similarities between Julia sets and 
				those defined by iterated function systems, differences were 
				observed as a product of the manner in which the fractals are 
				defined (with quadratic or linear transformations, for example).  The 
				IFS escape-time function does not have the same interpretation as 
				does the function for Julia and Mandelbrot sets.  The values in the 
				IFS case can interpreted as indications of membership in the fractal:  
				the points with highest elevation are still candidates for membership 
				in the attractor, whereas lower elevations have already been 
				discounted.  The discrete escape-time function values indicate 
				boundaries between successive transformation applications over 
				some region of interest.
			</p>
			<p>
				The left column of images [not shown] illustrate the continuous version of the 
				escape-time function over a small initial region of interest, 
				performing calculations with the Manhattan metric (top) and the 
				more familiar Euclidean metric (bottom). The right column [not shown] shows a 
				two-dimensional view of the continuous escape-time values used in 
				the <em>Dragon Mesa</em> picture (top), an example of an image using the 
				discrete escape-time function (middle), which is much simpler to 
				compute.  The bottom right image shows an image of a height field 
				derived from a distance function, and it serves to illustrate some of 
				the differences between the two functions.

			<h2>Other State</h2>

			<p>
				We can use the descriptive power of fractals to create visions of a 
				Nature-that-never-was.  
				<em>
					Other State
				</em>
				is an example of such an image.  
				It was composed from the well-known image 
				<em>
					Blessed State
				</em>
				[not shown], 
				which appears below, and a fractal model of a Saturn-like ringed 
				planet (also seen below).  The scene is rendered from fully three-
				dimensional models, the likes of which we will be able explore in 
				virtual reality, when the capability to render such scenes at 
				interactive rates has been developed.  Currently, it takes about an 
				hour of supercomputer time to synthesize such an image.
			</p>
			<p>
				Here we see the components from which Other State was composed.  
				The image 
				<em>
					Blessed State
				</em>
				features an early fractal model of a moon:  
				a simple grey bump-mapped sphere.  This moon has been replaced 
				by the more sophisticated model of a Saturn-like planet, and a more 
				complex model of atmospheric scattering has been employed..  The 
				planet features a fractal model of the bands of clouds and a fractal 
				ring structure.  The structure of the rings is simply fBm (fractional 
				Brownian motion) applied as a transparency map to a disk around 
				the planet.  No attempt to model features of Saturn's rings &mdash; such as 
				Cassini's division &mdash; was made; they simply fall out of the fractal

				For the holiday season we return to the theme we started with in 
				January:  ray tracing shiny spheres, which look like Christmas-tree 
				ornaments.  Orbit uses the same subtle color and surface 
				modulations seen in <em>Desert Ball</em> (see 
				<A HREF="#aug">
				August</A>).  The burgundy sphere 
				is exactly the same one seen in the background of <em>Desert Ball</em>, 
				while 
				the two other spheres are a shiny and copper-colored version of the 
				foreground sphere seen in that image.  Beneath is a very large 
				sphere with a simple fBm texture modulating lightness &mdash; close 
				inspection of this texture will provide a good sense of the character 
				of the fBm function which underlies most of the models of natural 
				phenomena seen in this calendar.  The intent of <em>Orbit</em> was to tackle 
				the artistic challenge of creating a "sense of place", using only four 
				ray-traced spheres with sophisticated procedural textures.  (There is 
				actually a fifth sphere in the scene, a white one representing the Sun, 
				seen only in reflection.)  It, like <em>Desert Ball</em>, 
				is a subtle color study, 
				which will be lost if the printer doesn't get these images exactly 
				right.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is remarkable what we can do with ray-traced spheres which are 
				perfectly smooth, geometrically.  <em>Moonrise</em> [not shown] 
				demonstrates that two 
				spheres &mdash; one white and one chrome &mdash; with two different fractal 
				fBm bump-maps, can alone provide a model of a natural scene.  The 
				cover image is composed of two spheres, one for the planet surface 
				and one for the clouds just above it, an atmosphere function and a 
				background image of the Mandelbrot set.  The visual complexity and 
				fidelity to Nature of these images belies the conceptual simplicity 
				behind their generation; therein lies the primary wonder of fractal 
				geometry.

				Mathematics: The Language of Nature
			</h2>
			<p>
				F. Kenton Musgrave<br />
				Yale University<br />
				1993
			</p>
			<h3>
				Introduction
			</h3>

<P>
A basic tenet of Western science is that the behavior of systems in nature can 
be accurately described with mathematics.  In 1623 Galileo wrote:

Philosophy is written in this grand book &mdash; I mean universe &mdash; which stands 
continuously open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first 
learns to comprehend the language in which it is written.  It is written in the 
language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other 
geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a 
single word of it; without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth.

<P>
Scientists today still regard this statement as essentially correct.  
However, Galileo's language of nature &mdash; 
that attributed to Euclid of ancient Greece, and known today as 
Euclidean geometry &mdash; was a bit short in vocabulary.  
Geometry is a language of shapes, 
but many of the shapes in nature lie in Galileo's vague category of 
"other geometrical figures", 
not within the scope of Euclid's shapes.  
They require another kind of geometry, 
one unimagined in Euclid's or Galileo's time.

<P>
Recently the mathematician and natural philosopher Benoit Mandelbrot observed:

Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, 
and bark is not smooth, 
nor does lightning travel in a straight line...

This observation heralded his introduction in 1975 of the new branch of mathematics 
known as fractal geometry.

<P>
Fractal geometry can be thought of as a new dialect of the mathematical 
language of shapes (geometry).  
Unlike Euclidean geometry, fractal geometry deals with the very 
complex shapes found in nature: things like trees, river networks, 
and billows of smoke.  
The difference between Euclidean shapes, such as planes, spheres and cones, and fractal 
shapes is that Euclidean shapes are all locally flat: if you look at them 
closely enough, they become flat, planar, and boring, 
while fractal shapes can be complex at every scale, that is, 
they may possess an infinite wealth of detail.

<P>
Where does this complexity come from?  It could come from two places: 
there could be a vast quantity of essentially independent information &mdash; 
such as the nicks, scratches and 
stains on an old pair of tennis shoes &mdash; 
or there could simply be a repetition of an 
underlying form, at a variety of scales.  The latter type of complexity 
is the secret of fractal geometry: self-similarity, 
or the repetition of form over a variety of scales.  Note that the 
former kind of complexity is hard to conceive of except as the result of an 
accumulated history of independent events over a substantial period of time, 
while the latter &mdash; fractal complexity &mdash; can often be succinctly described 
by a simple specification of the underlying shape, 
plus the relation of its manifestation to the scale at which it is manifest.

<P>
Many forms in nature are a combination of both types of complexity; the 
addition of the fractal vocabulary of shape to our scientific language of 
nature has revolutionized our ability to describe, 
in the internally-consistent, formal and deterministic language of 
mathematics, the forms and order we find in nature.  The images in 
this calendar &mdash; particularly the fractal "forgeries" of natural scenes &mdash; 
attest to the success of fractal 
geometry as a language of nature.  Even the wholly abstract fractal images 
have a "natural" feel to them;  
they echo the complexity of form so common in nature.

<P>
It is interesting to contrast the places where we find Euclidean versus 
fractal shapes: 
Except for the near-perfect spheres and ellipses of soap bubbles, 
astronomical bodies (planets and suns) and their orbits, 
it is a bit unusual to find Euclidean shapes in nature &mdash; 
they generally appear in the domain of man-made objects, such as buildings and machines.  
Fractal objects are generally too complex to be explicitly constructed by man; nature, 
on the other hand is full of them: mountains, trees, clouds, and 
fractures (indeed, the word "fractal" intentionally shares the Latin root 
of "fracture"), to name but a few.  Hence it is 
appropriate to think of fractal geometry as a "geometry of nature".

<P>
Some artificially-generated fractal shapes appear to imitate phenomena in 
nature such as mountains, clouds and trees.  
Others appear regular and man-made, such as the Sierpinski 
Gasket and the von Koch Snowflake.  
Yet others, such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, 
appear to be entirely abstract in form.  Yet all fractals share the 
characteristic of self-similarity: they appear more or less the same at a 
variety of scales.  This self-similarity may be exact, 
as in the case of the Sierpinski Gasket and the Menger Sponge; it may be 
statistical, as in the case of fractal mountains; or it may be more 
difficult to characterize, as with the Mandelbrot set.  
Although the character of the self-similarity differs among 
fractals, 
they all have in common the fact that when you look at them ever more closely, 
you see more of the same, 
and they all have in common a potentially-unlimited complexity 
which is a result of this repetition of form over a potentially-unlimited range of scales.

<P>
Fractals also share a common mathematical characteristic: 
the fractal dimension.  
The fractal dimension is an analytic measure of the 
"wigglyness" of a fractal line or the "roughness" of a fractal surface.  
It is a number which agrees with our everyday sense of 
dimension (three dimensions define space, 
two dimensions a plane, one dimension a line, 
and zero dimensions a point) but which has non-integer values: 
for the Sierpinski Gasket it is ???; for the von Koch Snowflake it is ???; 
and for fractal mountains it is usually between 2.1 and 2.3.  
The larger the fractal dimension, 
the more wiggly the shape, and as the fractal dimension of, 
for instance, a line approaches the integer value of the next higher dimension 
(in this case, going from 1.0 to 2.0), the 
fractal curve becomes space-filling, that is, 
it fills the entirety of some part of the next 
higher dimension (in this case, a plane).  
Not an immediately intuitive notion, this idea of 
fractal dimension, but it becomes so surprisingly quickly &mdash; 
one comes to think of the fractal dimension as simply a numerical measure 
of just how convoluted the curve or surface is, 
and with some practice one can estimate its value fairly accurately 
just by eye.  
Cumulus clouds, for instance, have a fractal dimension that's usually about 2.2 to 2.3.

<STRONG>A Bit of History</STRONG><BR>

<P>
Around the turn of the century, 
there occurred something of an upheaval in the world of 
mathematics.  
Mathematicians such as Weierstrass, Cantor and Peano conceived of bizarre 
constructions: strange "dusts" of unending complexity; functions with 
wildly unpredictable behavior; curves that could fill space or have 
no tangents.  
They boasted that these entities 
had no counterpart in nature and were somehow inherently intractable; 
having discerned 
what they could about them, 
the mathematicians labeled them "monsters", ill-begotten and 
unwanted children of mathematical speculations.  
Interestingly, while they had studied the beasts formally, 
they were never concerned by what they actually look like and pictured 
only the simplest among them.  
In general, the tedious and copious calculation required to 
make such a pictures would have to await the invention of the 
modern digital computer.

<P>
As a young man in the 1940's, Benoit Mandelbrot had an uncle (also of the name 
Mandelbrot) who was a well-known mathematician in his own right.  
One day he showed the young Benoit a mathematical paper by Fatou, 
telling him "there is a career to be made in this, for the person who can 
figure it out and pursue this work".  
Young Benoit had a look at the paper, and concluded 
"this is definitely not for me".  
Over the years, however, the ideas germinated in the back of his mind, 
and he came to be working on problems less far-removed than he himself 
realized, at the time.  
As is usually the case with scientific discovery, 
fractal geometry took form in his mind as if by a slow process of awakening, 
rather than an instantaneous "aha!"

<P>
Mandelbrot was employed by IBM as a research scientist in 1958.  
This gave him ready access, in the 1960's, 
to the then-exotic digital computer.  Armed with the requisite 
mathematical insight, the computer provided the tool he needed to 
explore the latter-day "monsters" of mathematics and discern something more 
of their true nature.  What he found is illustrated in the 
images in this calendar.

Fractals and the computer are inextricably intertwined.  
While ordinary mathematics often takes the form of equations such as 
which may be solved explicitly, fractals 
are generally specified in terms of recursive procedures such as, 
that is, the mathematical operation is applied repeatedly to its previous 
result.  This is a recipe for tedium, for a human calculator, 
but it is exactly the kind of thing a computer does best: vast 
quantities of relatively simple operations.  The fractal equation is then:

<BR>
[simple operations] times [a mind-numbing number of repetitions]
= [mind-boggling complexity].
<BR>

<P>
The "simple operations" term means that fractals are relatively easy to 
program into the computer.  
The "mind-numbing number of repetitions" term means that the computer will 
do it much faster, more accurately, and with less pain and complaint 
than a human.  
The result &mdash; "mind-boggling complexity" &mdash; was a complete surprise, 
and means that we need to invoke special measures to deal with the 
problem of making sense of the results of the computation.

<P>
It turns out that the way we human beings are wired up, of all our senses, 
vision provides by far the greatest bandwidth (amount of data per unit time) 
for getting information to the cerebral cortex, 
to the higher brain centers.  
Then, rather than looking at the results as a bunch of numbers (which is how 
the computer deals with them), we can make pictures out of them.  
The original fractal computer graphics mark one of the earliest 
uses of the computer for the purposes of scientific visualization.  
In fact, fractal computer graphics are being used even now in the service 
of making scientific discoveries: the images make possible the recognition 
of patterns and relationships which would otherwise be lost in floods of 
computational data.  Serendipitously, the complexity inherent in these 
synthetic fractal images often comes hand-in-hand with an 
astonishing beauty, making accessible to every person some of the 
much-touted abstract beauty of pure mathematics.  
Indeed, some fractal geometers would claim that the images provide a sort of 
intuitive, visual proof of the existence of such beauty.

<STRONG>Fractals in Science and Philosophy</STRONG><BR>

<P>
What, one might ask, are fractals good for? 
Well, obviously, they generate some 
convincing models of natural phenomena such as mountains and clouds for use in 
computer graphics imagery, and they provide some very compelling 
abstract pictures.  But recently, something like one third of all physics 
papers submitted to journals for publication at least mentioned fractals 
somewhere.  The fact is, fractal geometry is so new on the 
scientific scene that its uses are still being puzzled out.  
The modern philosopher Martin 
Heidegger argued that language itself allows for, even generates a world.  
If this is true, we can expect a fundamentally new language with a 
hitherto-untouched domain of expression 
to generate a new world view.  
Fractal geometry is in the process of doing just that.

<P>
Perhaps the most profound impact of fractal geometry to date is in the 
new science of chaos.  
Scientists have recently discovered order in natural systems, 
where previously there had seemed to be none; 
the language of fractals provides the vocabulary with which they can speak 
of this order; without it, that order probably would have 
remained unrecognized.  
The science of chaos deals with the behavior of nonlinear dynamical 
systems, that is to say, "equations that model natural systems well, 
and how they evolve through time".  
Scientists have long used linear approximations to nonlinear 
systems as a matter of mathematical expedience.  
The nonlinear mathematics models nature more accurately, 
but is intractable in comparison to the linear approximations.  
When computers made it possible for scientists to begin to cope with 
these previously-intractable nonlinear systems, they discovered something 
very surprising: they call it deterministic 
chaos or sensitivity to initial conditions; 
it means that any perturbation to the initial 
state of the system, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, 
will cause the system to diverge; i.e., to evolve into 
an arbitrarily different future state, within a finite period of time.

<P>
This is a counterintuitive notion: we would expect systems that 
started off in very nearly the same state to continue, 
forever, to evolve upon reasonably parallel paths.  Not 
so, we find, and this has profound philosophical consequences.  
In the 1600's Descartes and Newton, as natural philosophers, 
fleshed out a world view so compelling that, if the 
average educated person in our society today stops and thinks about it, 
it seems to be "the obvious way that things are".  
In the Cartesian universe with Newtonian dynamics, if 
we knew 1) the position and velocity of every particle in a closed system 
and 2) the rules for their interactions, 
and we had sufficient power to compute all those interactions, we would 
have the power to predict the future, forever, for that system.  
Obviously correct, right?  If 
our "closed system" were the entire universe, this would have profound 
philosophical implications: there could be no free will, 
it implies that we are all witless automatons, 
mere puppets in some sort of deterministic, 
already-written cosmic script.  
It would affirm the nihilistic philosophy of fatalism, 
and undermine the basis of human morality: that we 
have a choice in matters, 
and that what we choose to do &mdash; and not to do &mdash; 
makes some kind of a difference.

<P>
Perhaps fortunately, our century has seen a series of repudiations 
to this deterministic model of the universe.  
First, Einstein dealt a blow to Cartesian geometry with his theories 
of relativity: space/time is curved, and a line is straight or 
curved relative to the observer's frame of reference.  
Then came quantum mechanics, wherein the Heisenberg Uncertainty 
Principle states that, for particles on the subatomic scale, 
we can know their position or the velocity, but not both &mdash; 
this torpedoes the first premise for computing the future in a 
deterministic universe.  
Very recently &mdash; within the last 15 years or so &mdash; the science of 
chaos has driven a second nail into the coffin of the deterministic universe: 
Suppose we did know the position, 
velocity and rules of interaction for all particles.  
Then any error, no matter how small, in the initial data, 
in its representation (or that of intermediate results), or 
in the computation, 
would lead our computation-of-the-future to be wrong by an arbitrary 
amount within a finite period of time.

<P>
We are left with a bizarre world view: The universe may indeed be deterministic 
(determinism means that the past absolutely determines the future, 
that there is no "choice" at any time, 
and therefore no true randomness and no free will) yet that observation is 
useless, it is meaningless, 
it does us no good whatsoever &mdash; we may as well be living in a 
nondeterministic universe brimming over with free will! 
This is philosophically profound, and evidence that our fractal geometry has 
indeed "generated a new world", in the sense 
that it has fundamentally changed the way we see our universe, as well as 
the way we expect it to behave.  
Such is the character of scientific revolutions.

<BR><BR><STRONG>Fractals in Art and Music</STRONG><BR>

<P>
Back on the more prosaic plane of everyday life, 
we find that fractal geometry is beginning to influence the visual arts.  
As a language of shape and form of unprecedented richness, 
it is fairly easy to see that it can provide a new language for art.  
Fractals images are most readily generated with computer graphics, 
but computer graphics as a medium for the fine arts is nascent: 
the medium and process need to be developed and refined, 
and artists with madness (in Plato's sense of the word) and 
understanding must come to work with it.  
Fractals provide a visual dialect of natural forms, 
couched in the formalisms of mathematics.  
The latter makes it challenging &mdash; even alienating &mdash; to artists, 
while the scientists and mathematicians who are prepared to deal with 
that are rarely trained and practiced in the discipline of visual aesthetics.  
There is beauty to be found in deterministic fractals such as the 
Mandelbrot set and in random fractals such as fractal mountains; 
indeed, that beauty often has the character of seeming to exist a priori, 
somehow inherent in the (in fact always-deterministic) 
procedures used to calculate them.  The role of the artist is 
in exploring the fractal forms and interpreting them, 
visually, in a way that brings aesthetics to the forefront.

Another fascinating association of fractals with the arts is in music.  
It turns out that music from all cultures is fractal in an essential way: 
there is a repetition of form over a variety of scales, 
"scale" in this instance being over time.  
This fractal character is somehow so essential that a sequence of 
random notes sounds quite "musical", if it is only 
constrained to have fractal changes.  That is, 
if the random "score" is constrained, say, to look like the profile of a 
mountain range, we hear something that is tantalizingly close to a 
non-random, 
human-crafted musical score.  
Much as the fractional Brownian motion 
we use to create fractal mountains lacks some of the features of real 
mountains, yet nevertheless captures the essence of "mountainous", 
a random fractal musical score 
somehow has the essence of music, 
without the structure that a human composer would 
impart.
Musical composers such as Wuorinen and Legeti are (consciously) using 
fractals in their compositions, 
yet this area of exploration of the applicability of fractals has also barely 
begun.  An early synthesis of fractally-informed music and fractal 
imagery was the experimental performance by Mandelbrot and Wuorinen of 
"New York Notes" at the Guggenheim museum in the Spring of 1990, 
with a reprise performance at the Alice Tulley Hall of Lincoln Center 
in the Spring of 1991.  
This and other seminal fractal artworks make 
it clear that the association of fractals and the arts is a potentially rich field, with much 
exciting work yet to be done.

<BR><BR>
<STRONG>The Fractal Calendar</STRONG><BR>

<P>
This calendar of fractal images was designed with a 
combination of emphasis on 
aesthetics and on variety of imagery.  
Some attempt has been made to represent the major 
types of fractals: deterministic fractals such as the 
Mandelbrot set and its variations, as well as the whimsical 
"non-Platonic solids"; and 
random fractals as manifest in landscapes with their fractal mountains, 
clouds, waves, trees, and surface textures, as well 
as the diffusion-limited aggregation or DLA.  
I have also striven to represent a wide 
variety of fractal generation methods: 
iterations on the complex plane and in the quaternion 
numbers; 
iterated function systems; 
graph grammars or L-systems; midpoint-displacement 
and spectral synthesis methods for terrains; 
procedural textures for surface detail and artistic image processing; 
simulation of physical processes; 
and genetic algorithms for image synthesis.  
Some of the images are intrinsically two-dimensional, others are of three-
dimensional objects; some are abstract and some represent "fractal forgeries 
of nature" and are thus quite realistic.  
On the whole, they represent some the most interesting of recent 
fractal images, and I hope that they will offer both pleasure and stimulation, 
and perhaps even inspire some future fractalists.
