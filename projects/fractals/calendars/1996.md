    <strong>About the cover:</strong>
    The thin, winding curve that dances in this image captivates its surroundings.
    The rhythm of the repeated transformations eventually pulls all points near the curve. The colors in this image are chosen to highlight this process of captivation and the texture, reminiscent of clouds, recalls the fractal geometry of nature.

I edited the
<em>1996 Fractals</em> calendar
as a Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University.  
The calendar featured images from:
Robby Alyn Berry,
Brian Evans,
Michael Field,
Martin Golubitsky,
Daryl H. Hepting,
F. Kenton Musgrave,
Kevin Suffern, and
Eric Tosan.
Thanks also to:
Joelle Thollot.

This calendar was completed with the assistance of
the Centre for Experimental and Constructive Mathematics and
the Graphics and Multimedia Research Laboratory
at Simon Fraser University.
Earlier work was done at the University of Regina
and at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center.  

There are many to whom I continue to be grateful,
but especially B. Mandelbrot, K. Musgrave, P. Prusinkiewicz, D. Saupe, and R. Voss.
