  name: Snowflake in Winter

    von Koch's snowflake curve, an early mathematical monster, is depicted here
    in friendlier surroundings.  The blue visible amidst the spheres is 
    what remains after an algorithm to cover the complement of the fractal 
    is applied.  It works by finding the minimum distance of <em>d</em> 
    of a point <em>x</em> from the fractal then drawing a disk of radius 
    (maybe less than) <em>d</em> centered at <em>x</em>. Since any point 
    already inside a disk cannot be part of the fractal, the algorithm 
    progresses quickly as the complement is covered by disks. The spheres 
    are the three-dimensional extensions of those disks. A fractal texture 
    is applied to the spheres to create snowballs &mdash; the making of which 
    is a common pastime during long Canadian winters. The snowflake curve is 
    based on an equilateral triangle, of which each side is divided into three 
    parts then replaced by four parts of the same length, and so on.

  name: Chaotic Quilt

  desc: >-
    Although chaos would seem to be the antithesis of symmetry, 
    it is possible to find elaborate symmetric patterns in chaotic processes. 
    Shown here is a hexagonal pattern similar to those that sometimes appear 
    on quilts. This image is produced by iterating a map with hexagonal 
    symmetry. Although the iteration possesses all the features of chaos, 
    a surprisingly detailed and intricate symmetric pattern appears when we 
    take a very large number of iterations &mdash; in this case about 
    six billion &mdash; and color each pixel according to the number of 
    times it is visited during iteration. 
    In this sense we are computing an averaged picture. 
    The colors themselves were chosen for their artistic effect. 
    Note that the detail inside each of the hexagons happens to resemble a 
    flower. The fractal quality of the picture is to some extent represented 
    by the reappearance of the hexagonal symmetry on ever-decreasing scales.

  name: The Great Fern Dune
  by: Daryl H. Hepting
  path: /assets/gallery/img/1994-Hep-The-Great-Fern-Dune.png
  desc: >-
    This fern dune is one of the natural wonders on this distant world. 
    The fern leaf is defined by a set of linear transformations, 
    sometimes called an iterated function system. 
    The sand dune which surrounds the leaf was created by evaluating a 
    so-called escape-time function for the fern and subsequently interpreting 
    the values as heights. 
    The escape-time function works by determining whether a point escapes 
    membership in the fern, and if so then how quickly. 
    The fern shape at the top of the dune reveals the accuracy with which that 
    question was answered here. 
    More points are included than might otherwise be expected since it is 
    easier to exclude points than verify their membership. 
    The scene is made more believable by the use of fractal textures 
    for the clouds, moon and sand. 
    The technique for interpreting function values as heights is effective 
    for adding a third dimension to two-dimensional data, 
    and has been employed to great advantage in many earlier fractal images.

  name: "Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing, Variation #1"
  by: Danielle Bercel
  path: /assets/projects/img/cal-1995-04.png
  desc: >-
    This image is the result of a two-year metamorphosis from the image 
    shown below [not shown], entitled 
    Rare, Long-Stemmed, Speckled Gigantic Flowers Slowly Advancing. 
    The title of these images is a partial quote from Karen Blixen's
    novel <em>Out of Africa</em>. 
    From inspection, one may see that both pictures depict the same fractal 
    and that they share virtually all the same coordinates and parameters.
    The roles of color and black (or monotones) between the two images are 
    reversed.
    Areas black in Variation #1 were colored according to logarithmic function
    in the original and monotone areas in the original received an 
    algorithmic coloring. 
    The form of the original is still visible in Variation #1, 
    but it has been de-emphasized. 
    The images are based on a variation of the usual formula describing Julia 
    sets: zn+1 = zn2 + c, 
    where one may adjust the value of c (a complex number) as a parameter to 
    obtain different images.
    In the variation, a function is added to the mix and becomes another 
    parameter for manipulation: zn+1 = f(zn) + zn2 + c. 
    For these images, the conjugate of a cosine function was used. 
    While I still prefer the original picture, 
    as a parent might feel for a child, 
    it appears that almost everyone who has seen both of these pictures 
    prefers Variation #1.

  name: Mandelbloom
  by: Lewis N. Siegel (with thanks to Randy Hudson and Daryl H. Hepting)
  path: /assets/projects/img/cal-1995-05.png
  desc: >-
    It has been observed, by Mandelbrot and others,that fractal forms are found 
    abundantly in nature. 
    In this spirit, Mandelbloom shows natural forms occurring in a fractal. 
    The image was created with a method used to show how the Mandelbrot set 
    evolves over time. 
    To create an image of the Mandelbrot set, points in the complex plane are 
    iterated according to the well known function Zn+1 = Zn2 + C. 
    The structure in Mandelbloom comes from an attempt to capture the 
    movement of these points at a particular moment in time. 
    In traditional renderings of the Mandelbrot set, 
    each point in the plane is iterated until it escapes from the 
    neighborhood of the origin, 
    or reaches an upper limit. The number of iterations is then utilized 
    to generate a color for the pixel which represents that point. 
    In Mandelbloom, each point is instead iterated exactly
    the same number of times, 
    and each point's location in the plane is used to color the pixel.
    With this method, a procedural texture is used to associate a color with 
    every point in the complex plane. 
    Rather than calculating colors for the pattern, 
    color values are read from bitmaps of either the stem or the rose.

    In the midst of the harsh surroundings, a lone tree struggles for life. 
    Each element of the scene modeled here employs fractals to shift 
    attention from the mathematical details of the model to the illusion 
    which it creates. 
    The terrain is created from instances of a height field derived from a 
    planar linear fractal, [not] shown below. 
    The density of the fog which covers this desolate land is modulated by a 
    fractal function. 
    The tree, though idealized, 
    does incorporate some observations from nature which, along with a 
    wood texture, add to its realism. 
    Every branch in the tree is created by linearly transforming the trunk. 
    Beginning with a very concise description, 
    the model is expanded to include over 150,000 primitives for rendering.

  name: "Untitled #7"
  by: Danielle Bercel
  path: /assets/projects/img/cal-1995-07.png
  desc: >-
    This image takes a portion of the standard Mandelbrot set as its 
    starting point.
    The portion chosen, shown at a relatively low magnification factor of 414
    in Untitled #7 n-2 (top image below [not shown]), 
    seems rather boring with little to recommend it.
    However, at a magnification factor of about 40,000, as seen in 
    Untitled #7 n-1 (bottom image below [not shown]), 
    this same location reveals the familiar shape of the Mandelbrot set and 
    its lake. 
    Even at relatively low magnifications, 
    images of fractals can be made more interesting by bringing out other 
    details and the main image is the result applying one such technique. 
    Points outside the Mandelbrot set will "escape" to infinity after some 
    number of iterations, 
    and this number is usually called the escape time 
    (points which have not escaped after the maximum allowed number of 
    iterations are considered to be part of the Mandelbrot set). 
    Traditionally in images of the Mandelbrot set each point represented
    in the image is colored according to this value, 
    but I have also experimented with several alternatives. 
    One may determine the color by making use of the real component of the 
    location at which the point was deemed to have escaped 
    (the Mandelbrot set resides on the complex plane and so each point on the 
    plane has both real and imaginary components). 
    Another technique which can be used to determine color is based on the 
    quadrant of the complex plane in which escaped points first land. 
    The result is a sort of curved-space checkerboarding of color, 
    as points belonging to a single contour may take on any one of four 
    colors depending on the point of departure for the escaping point. 
    To this, an additional logarithmic coloring algorithm is applied to 
    produce smooth color transitions.

  name: Fractal Quilt		
  by: Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky
  path: /assets/projects/img/cal-1995-08.png
  desc: >-
    Fractals can be created to mimic the real world and they can also be used 
    as a source of pattern generation. 
    Combining fractal methods with symmetry leads to a method for creating 
    many kinds of repeating patterns. 
    The seventeen different symmetry types of planar repeating patterns were 
    classified formally by Federov in 1891 &mdash; but their existence has been     known for centuries. 
    Indeed, each of these patterns appears in the Alhambra, 
    a group of buildings overlooking the city of Granada that was constructed 
    by the Moors in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. 
    Only more recently have mathematicians considered how many different ways 
    there are to construct two-color planar repeating patterns &mdash; 
    there are forty-six possibilities. 
    A two-color repeating pattern is one in which
    half the symmetries of the figure preserve the colors while 
    half the symmetries interchange colors. 
    Fractal methods have been used to create this large two-color fractal quilt.
    It is amusing to check whether you can, in fact, 
    identify all of the symmetries in this figure. 
    (Besides the translations, there are eight symmetries &mdash; 
    four preserve colors and four interchange them.)

  name: A Crop Circle on the Palouse
  by: John C. Hart (with thanks to Gordon Farrell and Philip Peterson)
  path: /assets/projects/img/cal-1995-09.png
  desc: >-
    This image demonstrates recent advances in computer graphics at modeling 
    supernatural phenomena. 
    This crop circle, that might have otherwise been the result of a UFO 
    encounter, as actually created using a technique called procedural 
    geometric instancing. 
    It allows a new representation for procedural models, 
    which are typically translated into simpler polygonal 
    representations for rendering. 
    The usual unorganized polygonal representations can be unmanageable due 
    to size.
    Procedural geometric instancing encapsulates procedural components into the 
    geometric representation,
    which are evaluated on demand during rendering. 
    The crop circle, containing over 100 million primitives, 
    was specified by a short description file which represents the field
    of wheat with a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) hierarchy of instances
    of a single wheat stalk which may or may not bend over, 
    depending on the location into which it is instanced. 
    Given this position, a simple lookup in a low-resolution "crop map" of the 
    Mandelbrot set determines whether the UFO should bend the stalk or not.

  name: Dragon's Lair
  by: Daryl H. Hepting
  path: /assets/gallery/img/1994-Hep-Dragons-Lair.png
  desc: >-
    A dragon curve is captured here in what may be its natural habitat. 
    The brooding dragon curve remains after its complement has been covered 
    by the blocks which form the walls which enclose it. 
    The primitives are not spheres, as before, since the Manhattan distance 
    function is used in place of the usual Euclidean. 
    This means that distance is calculated x+y rather than x2 + y2 and so 
    diamonds in the Manhattan metric fill the same role as circles in the 
    Euclidean metric. 
    To create the third dimension in this image, 
    boxes with height proportional to the size of the original diamonds were 
    used. The sharpness of these boxes and their shadows provide an 
    interesting contrast to the apparent roughness of the dragon curve, 
    created with a fractal texture.

  name: Barque
  by: F. Kenton Musgrave
  path: /assets/projects/img/cal-1995-11.png
  desc: >-
    A shortcoming of computer-generated images is often that they lack the 
    level of visual complexity of a photograph or a painting. 
    An impressionist painting, for instance, 
    can have a rich variety of color in each brush stroke; 
    furthermore, paintings always have a textured surface, and a painter is 
    likely to modulate the color of an otherwise flat field of color, 
    such as a blue sky. 
    In Barque a variety of fractal methods are used to obtain similar visual 
    complexity. 
    First, 
    we start with a fractal mountain and fractal water, as seen in the image 
    [not shown] below. 
    Then a fractal color perturbation, as seen in the second image below, 
    is applied to the mountain and to the sky. 
    Finally, a fractal post-processing filter is applied to the image to 
    create a pointillist effect. 
    This filter samples the color of the image at a particular location, 
    perturbs that color with a fractal distribution, 
    then replaces a small area with a spot of the perturbed color.

  name: Snowflake in Winter

  path: /assets/gallery/img/1994-HepMus-Steps-to-Infinity.png
  desc: >-
    Floating in space, 
    this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity.
    Each step in the staircase is both a small copy of the whole shape 
    and a collection of many smaller copies of itself, 
    which illustrates the key concept of self-similarity. 
    The fractal, called a dragon curve, is formed by iteration of just two 
    linear transformations. 
    Each step in the staircase can be identified by a common sequence of 
    transformation applications. 
    By labeling the transformations with 0 and 1 and recording 
    how they are applied, 
    one can associate a binary number with each step &mdash; used here to 
    assign heights.
    The staircase looks somehow natural but the shape is more regular 
    than would be found in nature. 
    Like many fractal objects, it possesses a sense of familiarity. 
    The clouds in the sky are also fractal, 
    but they represent an example of stochastic fractals &mdash; in contrast to 
    deterministic fractals like the staircase or the omnipresent Mandelbrot set.

About the cover: Floating in space, 
this fractal staircase leads toward a perception of infinity. 
At once, it appears natural and yet somehow unnatural, 
perhaps a testament to the familiarity of fractals. 
Amidst the fractal clouds, the sky reveals part of the 
omnipresent Mandelbrot set.
