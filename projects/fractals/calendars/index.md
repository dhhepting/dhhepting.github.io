Each year between 1991 and 1997,
a calendar of computer-generated images was published
by Universe Publishing,
based on the fractal geometry of Benoit B. Mandelbrot.

Before 1997, the calendar was first done as a
custom edition and then as a trade edition in the following year.
In 1997, the trade and custom editions were the same.

- Richard F. Voss edited the calendars for 1991 and 1992
- F. Kenton Musgrave edited the calendars for 1993 and 1994
- Daryl H. Hepting edited the calendars for [1995](1995.html) and [1996](1996.html), and both included the essay [A Path to Fractals](a-path-to-fractals.html)
- F. Kenton Musgrave edited the calendar for 1997: it featured his work alone
