My M.Sc. thesis, 
[Approximation and Visualization of Sets Defined by Iterated Function Systems]({{"/assets/works/pdf/1991-03-Hep.pdf" | relative_url }})
(from 1991) dealt with linear fractals.
That got me started and I am still hooked.

Supervisor for my Master of Science degree was 
[Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przemys%C5%82aw_Prusinkiewicz){:target="blank"}.
During my studies, Prusinkiewicz took a sabbatical and visited 
[Benoit Mandelbrot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benoit_Mandelbrot){:target="blank"}.
Upon completion of my studies, 
the Mandelbrot connection helped F. David Fracchia
(who had just completed his Ph.D. with Prusinkiewicz) 
and me 
to secure term employment with Mandelbrot's Fractals Project 
(Fracchia at Yale as a postdoc, me at IBM TJ Watson Research Centre), 
beginning in the summer of 1991.

During my contract with IBM, I lived in Ossining, New York 
(Home of the Grand Slammer: Sing Sing Prison [I once had the T-shirt]).
The New York Times printed a story about travelling to Ossining in 
[Going Up the River, for a Visit](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/21/travel/escapes/going-up-the-river-for-a-visit.html){:target="blank"}.
