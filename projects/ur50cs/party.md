The celebration was originally planned for November 3, close to the birthdate, but circumstances dictated a change in plans. Now we will celebrate the 50th birthday of the Computer Science Department along with the 112th birthday of Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, computer pioneer and Basterfield Lecturer from November 1974 by moving the date to Thursday, December 6, 2018 &mdash; part of CSEdWeek 2018, which was established to recognize Admiral Hopper's birthday (December 9).
