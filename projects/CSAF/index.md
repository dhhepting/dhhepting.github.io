      "The Secret History of Task Manager"
    </h5>
    <p>
      If you ask Google
      "who created Microsoft Windows Task Manager",
      David Plummer is the reply.
      David is an entrepreneur, programmer, and U of R
      alumnus. After graduation, he went on to work with
      Microsoft and create systems that we use to this day.
      David was born and raised in Regina and now lives in
      the Seattle area with his family.

      The Perseverance Mars rover landed in Jezero Crater,
      where we can see from orbit that a river flowed into
      the crater, which held a lake, and a delta formed at
      the mouth of the river.
      The mission of Perseverance is to explore around the
      delta to improve our understanding of the ancient
      climate and to examine the possibility that life
      or precursor molecules evolved there.
      The rover will also acquire a set of samples and
      leave them for a mission that the U.S. and Europe
      plan to send later this decade to bring the samples back to Earth.
      This sequence of missions is called the Mars Sample Return campaign.
      Perseverance also carries a small helicopter called Ingenuity, which is intended as a technology demonstration of the first heavier-than-air aircraft ever to attempt flight on another planet.
      This lecture will give a brief introduction to Mars exploration and these missions.

      Dr. Larry Matthies has 39 years of experience in
      computer vision R&D for autonomous navigation of
      robotic ground and air vehicles on Earth and in
      space. He has been with the Jet Propulsion Lab,
      California Institute of Technology since 1989, now
      as a Senior Research Scientist.
      He has pioneered
      development of many computer vision-related
      capabilities that had and will have high impact on
      robotic solar system exploration.
      Of all his experiences at NASA, he says that the
      most extraordinary was being at the 1997 landing of
      the first Mars rover (Sojourner).
      He was awarded the NASA Exceptional Achievement Medal in 2007.

      "Social Reinforcement Learning"
    </h5>
    <p>
      Social learning helps humans and animals rapidly
      adapt to new circumstances, and drives the emergence
      of complex learned behaviours.
      In this talk I will explore whether we can use
      insights from social learning to improve artificial
      intelligence (AI) algorithms.
      I will introduce Social Reinforcement Learning,
      which focuses on leveraging social learning to
      enhance AI learning and generalization, coordination
      with other AI agents, and human-AI interaction.
      For example, I propose new algorithms for enabling
      AI agents to learn from experts that are present in
      their environment, or learn how to have better
      conversations with humans by learning from their
      social cues.
      I also show how competition between agents can lead
      them to learn more complex behaviours, and
      generalize better to new tasks at test time.
      Overall, I argue that Social Reinforcement Learning
      is a valuable approach for developing more general,
      sophisticated, and human-compatible AI.

      Natasha Jaques holds a joint position as a Research
      Scientist at Google Brain and post-doc at UC
      Berkeley.
      Her research focuses on social reinforcement
      learning -- developing multi-agent RL algorithms t
      that can improve single-agent learning,
      generalization, coordination, and human-AI
      collaboration.
      Natasha received her PhD from MIT, where she focused
      on Affective Computing and new techniques for
      deep/reinforcement/machine learning.
      Natasha earned her Masters degree from the

      In this talk I will give a high-level overview of AI
      in healthcare, followed by a discussion of key
      trends that I think will impact developments in the
      area over the next several years.
      This will include examples from a "laundry list" of

      The space domain enables everyday life in commercial, civil and military industries. Today, technology development is driving lower cost launch and the proliferation of space assets. The intersection of government and commercial developments provide hybrid space architectures which accomplish missions with newfound speed and agility. As space matures, technology that was once hosted on the ground is moving to space. However, space is increasingly becoming contested, putting future developments at risk.
