1
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,600
Daryl Hepting: So Can everybody hear me all right?

2
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,940
Come on yeses. Okay. How's everyone doing today?

3
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:25,970
So just as we're getting people into the meeting,

4
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,930
me,

5
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:32,130
maybe didn't hear the notice about recording.

6
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,340
So, in my last

7
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,880
attempt to record the meeting,

8
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,960
Unknown: my recording didn't

9
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,710
cut out partway through

10
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,260
Daryl Hepting: and I've been experimenting with it. a transcript

11
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,100
Unknown: Is that returned to me to

12
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,260
audible

13
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,170
so the idea of Was I was trying.

14
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,160
So,

15
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,750
here's a message to begin with. I think you can see

16
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:29,520
beside my name, there's a little card with a.on it that says it's recording. So
the idea is that we can have an audio

17
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,450
recording and a transcript at the meeting.

18
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,490
I will

19
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,970
keep your name

20
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:40,680
All right, so lots of things going on here. So what I want to do first of all is
to start sharing my screen

21
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,570
and we can look at the website

22
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,090
All right, so here's the updated version.

23
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,850
That should be on the website

24
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,820
soon. And

25
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,030
this is from ours, our chat session on

26
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,430
on Thursday.

27
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,550
So I'm experimenting

28
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:55,920
with the display so you can let me know what you think so I

29
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,950
so DHH that's me

30
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,260
In case you're wondering.

31
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:11,400
So DHH Daryl H Hepting. You can call me Daryl R. Dr. Hepting.

32
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,880
I'd like you to pick one of those two.

33
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,680
So this is the way that I presented it. So anything that was sent to me
privately,

34
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,840
I have not included

35
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,100
so what I've done is I

36
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,990
What am I gonna say But

37
00:10:47,580 --> 00:11:02,580
so, the identifiers are consistent so every time the students student who said
hello as 1129 on Thursday rota write something they'll come in.

38
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:07,830
So

39
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,449
we can

40
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:15,449
keep track of people but not

41
00:11:16,169 --> 00:11:17,039
by names.

42
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,990
This is a good thing or

43
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,330
or not

44
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:21,600
Thanks to Sam who points out everyone should have gotten a note that the meeting
is recorded.

45
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,890
So I just wanted to

46
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,820
let you know that

47
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,880
why I'm recording it so that

48
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:38,370
we had so we're not going to share. I'm not going to share the video with you
but

49
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,830
I'll make the

50
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,010
audio recording available

51
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,360
to be accessible through the

52
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,320
through the

53
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,960
meeting blanks

54
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,940
and

55
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,359
Then I can also get a

56
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,069
transcript

57
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:09,690
which I'll

58
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,430
so am I sharing the

59
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,650
zoom chat for meeting

60
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:52,080
or not

61
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,570
Okay, what am I sharing

62
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:14,339
Okay, on the

63
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:24,690
Okay, I'm gonna try and

64
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,200
share the right window this time.

65
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:58,110
look better

66
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:58,680
Okay, so now I can make sense that I can ask a question again about any thoughts
about the display of the transcript

67
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,620
She can see now.

68
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,510
Okay, so I think we have everybody in the room now

69
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:36,420
and

70
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:11,280
Yeah, okay, so the couple of comments on the chat parents script.

71
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:48,150
Okay, so let me say a few things. So the comment about recording the screen so
I'm not interested in the video recording maybe I, I'll look at it to see if
it's if it's possibly helpful.

72
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,500
But that's not

73
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,530
my reason for recording. My reason for recording is the audio and the

74
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,740
automatic Transcript generation.

75
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:31,829
Although the documentation says the transcript will be ready shortly after the
video is ready, but in my case, the test I did on Thursday and Friday. It was a
long time hours. So maybe we can expect to see the track transcript of our of
the audio.

76
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,530
Tomorrow, sometime

77
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:46,560
so when we have the transcript of the audio,

78
00:21:48,210 --> 00:22:03,330
it might be helpful. It couldn't transcript on the transcript to the audio that
might help to give context to chat. So you can see when things are going on.

79
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,640
And so regarding

80
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:14,999
the

81
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,260
de identified

82
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,250
students

83
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:27,030
I was thinking of doing some editing on this.

84
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:29,760
But then

85
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:42,390
I thought just to let it go ahead and

86
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,210
be

87
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,590
be an accurate representation of what

88
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,270
happened.

89
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,460
For people said

90
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,570
three people said hello and one person said Good morning at 1130 on Thursday,
then

91
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,160
I would just

92
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:10,710
be fine to represent that.

93
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:17,369
So, I making the public version of this

94
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:23,310
transcript available

95
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,060
to help large class discussions.

96
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,090
But I still have the names

97
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:42,359
of people. So regarding missing the actual student names to me, that's a feature

98
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,900
Such a feature but I have them

99
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,630
okay

100
00:25:01,949 --> 00:25:03,569
So in terms of the length,

101
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,240
so

102
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,480
this is possibly a

103
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,199
helpful feature.

104
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,290
We can close parts as well.

105
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,740
And one of the times

106
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,770
is it better to represent

107
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:52,080
this is not, you don't have this is something to think about. Well, I could
increase the usefulness of this in terms of

108
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,130
the timestamps.

109
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,970
So would it be helpful to have

110
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,840
visual representation of the passage of time.

111
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,650
So 1129 3031 and then have a gap

112
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,709
between 31 and 35

113
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:32,610
and so on and then 4445 4647 and then there was a gap until noon.

114
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:08,010
So instead of suggestion is instead of time stamps

115
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,750
the question prompted the responses.

116
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,100
So

117
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,410
I think that's

118
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:30,840
a worthy, worthy goal, to be able to have that

119
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:32,009
connection.

120
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,210
It's a little bit hard to do.

121
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:07,229
So I'm going to gonna hope that the transcript will

122
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:08,549
help that

123
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,379
provide that context.

124
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,990
So the reason I didn't include seconds

125
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,300
in the

126
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:53,400
in the timestamp was to group

127
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,320
common sense Same time.

128
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,750
I didn't. I thought

129
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:18,750
it might be helpful to have some grouping of them rather than

130
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,150
just have each each

131
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:35,999
timestamp, comment or chat message

132
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,830
on its own

133
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,330
Okay, so

134
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,790
thank you think about

135
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,610
how to use this.

136
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:29,670
And

137
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,220
we can talk about somar

138
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,140
on Thursday,

139
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,380
but how can we use

140
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,490
Okay, how can this data be

141
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,580
as helpful as possible?

142
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,370
So, if you're going to say,

143
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:59,610
what do you think of that question? Think about for next day How could you
present the chat data so that it is helpful as possible.

144
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,880
Is that enough information?

145
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,470
So something that happens happening here is there's a delay in

146
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:24,870
the chat.

147
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,860
Now just coming up on

148
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,350
the chat are

149
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:50,520
chat is an asynchronous communication form here

150
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,950
because you can have that one

151
00:33:54,030 --> 00:34:03,120
and that's both a positive and a negative because we have to try and put things
back together in terms of a threat.

152
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,680
That's not unlike doing an

153
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,350
instant messaging

154
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,740
in some form or another,

155
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:23,760
say if somebody if the person you're talking to asks two different questions
before you can answer the first question.

156
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,130
And maybe you start to talk about the first question

157
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:35,160
before in more than one message before you get to

158
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:36,839
question two.

159
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,570
And so it seems to be not very hard to

160
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,770
to have things diverge a bit.

161
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:12,900
Yeah,

162
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,140
okay. So my hope is that

163
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,480
the

164
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,240
to present the transcripts of the audio, that to say

165
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,880
together in a similar format

166
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,560
with

167
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,650
the chat

168
00:35:43,019 --> 00:35:44,129
I have a feeling

169
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,770
Okay, so

170
00:36:03,659 --> 00:36:06,509
I'm gonna work on presenting

171
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:16,319
for Thursday my homework will be to format the audio transcript in,

172
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:19,350
in a way similar to the

173
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,270
to the chat transcript.

174
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,170
I have a suspicion though.

175
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,260
The timestamp in the

176
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:39,150
video is from the beginning of the recording notch. Not

177
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,180
not the time of day that

178
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:51,149
is being used in the chat. So, there might be an issue of synchronizing that

179
00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,119
although you think this is not a new problem, so

180
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,739
I wonder if

181
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,640
there's some ways to

182
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:09,960
put them together.

183
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,220
Anyway, I'll see what I get back. We could talk about this tomorrow on

184
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,660
Thursday.

185
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:59,910
So is everyone able to get to access your courses now? All the 40 people in the
zoom chat or the zoom meeting, can

186
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,880
access your courses.

187
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,150
Can you do a half a checkmark

188
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,349
or an x? For Yes or no?

189
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:35,730
See no if I try and add the question into the stream in the chat stream

190
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,620
What I noticed is

191
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,750
so we have 20 people voting yes

192
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,770
if you're not able to 2122 23

193
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,169
Sorry, I wasn't

194
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,010
I asked her

195
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:10,799
show, show check mark or

196
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,630
exes for yes or no.

197
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,140
So

198
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:25,440
I'm wondering should should we,

199
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:44,340
you? Okay, so 28 out of 40 of your courses access. So if you don't have your
courses x and a send me a note or an email, I'll get you sorted out. Okay.

200
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,060
So I'm going to clear that.

201
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,950
So the question next question is

202
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,030
All questions.

203
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:16,079
Yes.

204
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,330
No

205
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:21,719
the

206
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,880
gained one and then we lost two.

207
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:33,540
So here's the

208
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:39,719
here's an interesting question. So I'm asking

209
00:42:43,409 --> 00:42:46,079
whether we should put responses into the chat.

210
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:53,940
So when I asked her yes or no checkmarks

211
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:10,170
So last time I asked her yes or no checkmarks I got a stream stream of yeses in
the chat transcript when the chat window

212
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:12,300
but now

213
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:15,659
the people who are voting for

214
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,680
chat

215
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,620
holding it six to four

216
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:43,289
none of the people who said yes in the chat said

217
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,619
None of the positive responses

218
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:12,959
are in the chat window.

219
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:19,379
Okay, there's one.

220
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:31,979
I stand corrected. There's at least one positive response. And I agree with them
is a bit ambiguous even though we're just

221
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,719
although it seems like a no.

222
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:45,479
Okay.

223
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:51,869
Here's a question.

224
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,030
Who has seen the textbook?

225
00:44:58,949 --> 00:44:59,819
Yes or no

226
00:45:11,789 --> 00:45:14,219
Sorry I cleared the answer. So

227
00:45:51,659 --> 00:45:52,349
So

228
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:04,079
I think that's my cat.

229
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:12,299
anyone remembers from anyone who was here in

230
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,520
March

231
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:17,759
the cute looking one

232
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,150
on my lap

233
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:23,670
anyway

234
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:16,440
Okay,

235
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:45,180
okay, so that was me reporting the results Okay.

236
00:48:58,289 --> 00:48:59,039
Okay.

237
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:01,860
So

238
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,430
in the process of getting the textbook

239
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:15,209
Oh, so I didn't hit return there between my report of the results and

240
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:27,959
next class response to the question about online access, so

241
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:18,899
Here it is, and I've put in the links. I've updated the links on the webpage
there.

242
00:52:35,550 --> 00:52:36,300
So

243
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,190
there are

244
00:52:43,199 --> 00:52:44,039
slides

245
00:52:45,719 --> 00:52:47,849
available for each chapter.

246
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:52,410
So

247
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:20,789
chapters one and two Fisher's thing

248
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:21,929
I'm not sure whether the website is mobile friendly.

249
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:32,940
I can't look at it right now.

250
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,280
You can see whether

251
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:48,749
how it appeared. Whether you have a good experience with that website on your
mobile device

252
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:21,239
I like the enthusiasm in the chat room with all the exclamation points

253
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,159
flying around.

254
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:31,049
Okay, so

255
00:56:05,969 --> 00:56:12,359
So I'm getting some reports that the website is working on low file.

256
00:56:17,099 --> 00:56:19,199
I would say that there's more to

257
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,410
march working.

258
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,030
There's more to it than just working.

259
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:37,439
So working is the is the bottom rung

260
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:44,459
on the list. So first of all,

261
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:53,910
you can you're caught so that's the question is can you accomplish a given task
with a website? And if you can answer yes.

262
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:57,569
So then he might say that it's effective.

263
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:01,860
If it's a little

264
00:57:03,149 --> 00:57:04,919
bit better to

265
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:11,549
work with so that you can see

266
00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:22,920
how you might do other things, then things are well organized. And then the next
step up is maybe

267
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:26,280
comprehensible so that you can

268
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,840
you can decide what actions come next.

269
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:38,760
And then

270
00:57:41,219 --> 00:57:44,459
a step above that is whether it's satisfying.

271
00:57:47,429 --> 00:57:48,329
So

272
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,660
So what are some ways that we can think of being satisfying

273
00:58:12,570 --> 00:58:15,720
Don't have to think about what to do.

274
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:21,090
We want to do is

275
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,360
easily available.

276
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:44,759
What are some other ways that we can think about being satisfying? So let's
clear with what happens between

277
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,770
if we have a goal in mind

278
00:58:55,980 --> 00:59:28,440
commands to achieve the goal are clear. And when we look at the state of the
system, we can easily and correctly interpret the state and what needs to be
done to go from the current state to our goals state. So I'm going to try and
draw something

279
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,940
with my iPad here. Give me a second.

280
01:00:14,849 --> 01:00:16,679
Okay, let me see if I can.

281
01:00:56,489 --> 01:01:00,809
That's my son handiwork. Here

282
01:01:03,149 --> 01:01:04,859
we can see some UCF

283
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,750
All right, I'm ready to draw.

284
01:01:48,449 --> 01:01:49,499
Can you see that?

285
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:52,920
Give me a yes or no.

286
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,860
If you can see, okay.

287
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,080
So I have human computer

288
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:39,540
if I write

289
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:46,800
single words maybe they're not too illegible

290
01:03:04,319 --> 01:03:10,679
Okay, so clicking back to our discussion last day about

291
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:18,090
how to use those Chevron's to indicate

292
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,450
progressive discovery.

293
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:32,789
So I saw that that term was used in the Microsoft interface guidelines. And I've
got a few links that I'll

294
01:03:33,809 --> 01:03:35,189
put up about that.

295
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,940
So let's, let's see issue.

296
01:03:51,659 --> 01:03:54,599
So, if we point the arrow

297
01:03:54,599 --> 01:03:58,709
up or down, then can indicate the

298
01:04:05,879 --> 01:04:39,779
So we're either moving up or down to reveal more content than the question. So
that makes more sense. I can understand the argument that makes more sense than
having a sideways arrow and tip it down to display because of sideways because a
direction that we're going off the screen and maybe that's appropriate for when
for menus, and so on.

299
01:04:41,099 --> 01:04:42,989
But not necessarily from

300
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:48,240
the idea that there's

301
01:04:52,349 --> 01:04:55,559
content to be displayed within in place.

302
01:04:57,809 --> 01:04:59,009
Then the question is

303
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:21,659
keep them separate so the question is

304
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:29,759
so just an aside here I've got,

305
01:05:30,269 --> 01:05:31,979
I don't you can see this.

306
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:47,579
I've got to put a dialog box has come up and says, MP devices agent wants to use
your confidential information in your key chain. I just seen I've just seen an
ad from Apple about how

307
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:56,430
they're big on privacy. So

308
01:05:57,539 --> 01:06:09,179
good. Good for them, too. To ask for permission, but there's no indication of
what ANP devices agent

309
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:12,929
is, and if it's

310
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:19,259
what it wants to do with, like confidential information.

311
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:36,629
So I'm gonna say, I have an idea about that. I'm gonna deny it for now. And you
can still see it, I think, looks to me like you can.

312
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:40,440
Alright, so

313
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:51,330
So now the question is to use the app

314
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:57,030
to use this to indicate

315
01:07:01,289 --> 01:07:03,419
The state or the command.

316
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:06,449
So should we see it when

317
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,590
this content is an

318
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:16,289
extra content is displayed, indicating then that it's

319
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:24,390
commands that we can use to

320
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:32,970
to hide the content

321
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:35,760
or should we see it when

322
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:50,159
the content is closed and then that indicates the state of content hidden behind
or below the

323
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,880
or that can be revealed by clicking.

324
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,820
So the same thing here

325
01:08:21,750 --> 01:08:34,980
So, Commander state that's a question that we see and we work with or we're
dealing with and when we look at the computer and then

326
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:42,000
we tried to make sense of it, we say

327
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:46,589
I wonder what this

328
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:56,430
is. So this is an example of how the process of evaluation

329
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:07,770
And then you say, Well, I want to see more content.

330
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:10,169
But till I do

331
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,120
so I think I'm gonna press that

332
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,800
inverted v up.

333
01:09:37,289 --> 01:09:41,069
The Chevron is pointing up to reveal more content.

334
01:09:55,980 --> 01:10:20,430
So this is my goal is to do more content I

335
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:23,910
can decide, I think that this is the way to go about it

336
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:38,910
and then I can see whether or not what I've done is helping the situation
helping me to achieve my goal.

337
01:10:42,390 --> 01:10:44,970
So this is a pretty small example and

338
01:10:48,029 --> 01:10:49,109
so we can't get

339
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:54,089
into too much trouble here

340
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:01,770
if you think otherwise But

341
01:11:03,629 --> 01:11:07,379
so long as we have a representation. So let's see, the question is

342
01:11:09,719 --> 01:11:11,489
if we have these icons

343
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,730
giving the feedback,

344
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:29,070
then that's the question is really not as that command or is it representing the
state?

345
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,650
So we can't get

346
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:45,300
too far away. But if if we have such choices which are for our less clear,

347
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:48,300
let's say how do I

348
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:50,760
display in

349
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:57,480
the chat from Monday from Thursday's meeting

350
01:11:59,370 --> 01:12:00,960
related To

351
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:05,760
the question about Chevron's

352
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:09,720
and that's a little bit

353
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,650
more involved. And

354
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:26,460
if if we can

355
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:39,660
go to the record for meeting one and see the chat transcript and then look
through it, then that's a fairly strict and that seems like a reasonable thing
to do.

356
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:42,840
And we

357
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:47,970
we don't have up too much chance to make

358
01:12:50,610 --> 01:12:51,870
mistakes. So

359
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,470
yeah, as we're pointing at the screen

360
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,230
out of habit

361
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:22,410
Call from execution

362
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:29,280
Can anyone

363
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:35,730
fill in the blank here golf

364
01:13:41,190 --> 01:13:42,330
starts with any

365
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:58,230
you have a put your hand up if you want to answer

366
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,340
Okay, Richmond will turn your mic on

367
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,180
me

368
01:14:19,980 --> 01:14:22,020
stretching. I think

369
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,100
it's catching inflammation.

370
01:14:28,529 --> 01:14:34,379
That's right. The inflammation. Yes. So starting with the knee, so

371
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,750
it's our

372
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:39,690
dealing with evaluation.

373
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:43,320
Okay. Okay.

374
01:14:45,630 --> 01:15:00,900
Thanks. Sure. Sorry, I. So if I call on you there's also a way for you to think
it's the spacebar to turn your own microphone on

375
01:15:02,190 --> 01:15:03,870
thank you for the answer.

376
01:15:07,799 --> 01:15:08,909
So coffer

377
01:15:14,099 --> 01:15:14,999
ation.

378
01:15:21,029 --> 01:15:35,939
So if we have a satisfying experience these, these scoffs are small. And if we
have a frustrating experience, the costs are large.

379
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:38,940
Make sense?

380
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:49,110
Like if you have to, if you're scratching your head and thinking about how do I
accomplish my goal and then

381
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:52,920
a very large golf

382
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,880
well, golf that we're dealing with

383
01:16:01,709 --> 01:16:02,849
Okay, so it's

384
01:16:08,910 --> 01:16:13,770
two minutes left. Any questions or concerns that you want to

385
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,400
express?

386
01:16:32,819 --> 01:16:51,869
So a question or Discord. Yeah, I just I'm going to figure that out. And I'll
send an invitation. I'll put an invitation on your courses.

387
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:55,500
Chris Harris

388
01:17:00,989 --> 01:17:03,809
So for office hours, I was thinking,

389
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:07,860
I have a meeting at 3pm today so

390
01:17:12,389 --> 01:17:18,389
and it sir, it's quarter to one here. So about 130 to 230 today.

391
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:20,850
And then

392
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:29,280
11 to noon tomorrow

393
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:33,600
and

394
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,910
130 to 230 on Thursday.

395
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:43,860
And if you have questions outside of that you can

396
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:48,180
send me and you know how to get ahold of me.

397
01:17:49,680 --> 01:18:18,300
You can use the URL courses or send me email to Derek there Hepting at URI
gianna.ca. And I have a link on your courses page. Okay, so I'll post my
artist's rendering of the concept of gulf of execution evaluation.

398
01:18:20,940 --> 01:18:22,020
And we'll

399
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:26,400
so have a have a look at the

400
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:56,160
first two chapters of material from the textbook beyond interaction, primary
interaction design. And I didn't we didn't talk about my in plate, robot attack
video, all 13 seconds of it. So if you can have a look at that, and we'll talk
about that too, on Thursday. Okay, thanks very much for your time.

401
01:19:09,870 --> 01:19:11,340
See you on Thursday.
