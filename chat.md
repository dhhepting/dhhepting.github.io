11:30 S06 : Hello <br />
11:31 S07 : Good morning ! <br />
11:31 S08 : Hello All <br />
11:35 S02 : Just asking, CS428 is still not showing on my urcourse, am I the only one？ <br />
11:35 S09 : I also do not have it <br />
11:35 S10 : I have it <br />
11:35 S11 : might be. as I have it on mine. <br />
11:35 S12 : It shows for me <br />
11:35 DHH : I have the chat window uo, but please raise your hand if you would like to speak or have a question. <br />
11:36 S11 : right <br />
11:44 S10 : I'm not aware of anyone, but I don't know anyone else in this class :| <br />
11:44 S13 : there is a 0% complete bar on the dashboard <br />
11:45 S13 : under the course <br />
11:46 DHH : https://urcourses.uregina.ca/course/view.php?id=2084 <br />
11:46 S13 : it's fine I have access so I guess it doesn't matter. <br />
11:46 DHH : OK <br />
11:47 S11 : no <br />
11:47 S14 : No <br />
11:47 S02 : No <br />
11:47 S15 : No I think it is accessible <br />
11:47 S16 : No <br />
11:47 S17 : No <br />
11:47 S05 : the course is under past courses fall 2019 <br />
11:47 S18 : I see it under past courses <br />
12:00 S05 : yes I agree with that <br />
12:03 DHH : Do you prefer Wikipedia’s use of chevrons (^, v) to mine (>,v) <br />
12:04 S13 : Yours works <br />
12:04 S02 : Im thinking this one is good enough... <br />
12:04 S14 : Wikipedia <br />
12:04 S07 : I prefer yours <br />
12:04 S19 : Yours <br />
12:05 S15 : Yours <br />
12:05 S04 : yours <br />
12:05 S02 : Yours <br />
12:05 S11 : in my opinion as long as it is consistent in a group of chevrons and makes sense, users gets use to it. <br />
12:05 S10 : I would prefer to use a symbol like '-' for folded. and then use a down-arrow for unfolded. or '+' for folded, and '-' for unfolded. <br />
12:06 S05 : - and + easy to understand <br />
12:08 S17 : To me, it's because it's like it's the "direction" that the relevant content is going to move, with the right arrow that direction doesn't match the arrow in that layout at least <br />
12:09 S11 : it works on mobile device <br />
12:09 S12 : To me its more intuitive, the v mean to drop down(expand) the content and then the ^ means the opposite to condense the content upwards <br />
12:09 S15 : https://www.wikipedia.org we can see chevrons here <br />
12:10 S13 : I think Wikipedia way works is because it follows conventional logic. So does the + and - symbols. <br />
12:10 S13 : by testing <br />
12:11 S17 : Also, theoretically, up and down arrows are more universal, where a right arrow would be pointing "backwards" in right-to-left languages <br />
12:11 S10 : I think intuitiveness in interface comes from the existence of real worldanalogues <br />
12:11 S05 : users response or users understanding <br />
12:11 S20 : Familiarity. <br />
12:11 S21 : From experience over time <br />
12:11 S14 : It is coming from the day to day life <br />
12:11 S03 : Intuition comes from past experiences and what we expect from them? <br />
12:11 S12 : I think partly from past experiences. <br />
12:12 S07 : I think intuition is developed from user knowledge, understanding and experience <br />
12:12 S11 : general understanding <br />
12:12 S09 : maybe something like instinct, i.e. liking shiny things from once relating that to water <br />
12:16 S11 : exactly. <br />
12:19 S14 : yes we can <br />
12:19 S13 : it's on <br />
12:19 S22 : We can hear <br />
12:19 S23 : I can hear her <br />
12:19 S09 : yeah I can hear you <br />
12:19 S21 : I can hear you <br />
12:20 S02 : We can hear you <br />
12:21 S10 : I like verbal discussions, but also I like chat discussions since you never miss your chance to reply to something you're interested. I remember especially during the classes, we would get some pretty heated discussions, but the conversation needed to be cutoff so class could continue. We had forums, but once we were out of class, we didn't necessarily maintain the same passion for it later. <br />
