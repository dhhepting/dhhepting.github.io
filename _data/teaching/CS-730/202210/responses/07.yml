difficult:
- desc: Today I learned about the floorplan light switches that Don Norman designed
    back in 1988. He claims that his &amp;quot;natural mapping&amp;quot; between the
    controls and the lights removes the confusing element from the traditional array
    of switches mounted on a vertical wall. In my opinion, the inclusion of a floor
    plan is phenomenal. However, unlike him, I am not fully convinced that installing
    it on a horizontal or a sloping plane would be that helpful.
important:
- desc: A better interaction with zoom . Different and less strenuous ways one can
    chat and respond to direct messages on the zoom application.
- desc: hi .this section is about Design examples like Apollo13,chapter6 (industrial).also
    you  are  talking about chat with everyone and Direct message with..., and Floorplan
    light switches.

    existing things.
- desc: I understood a better way in which zoom can present their conversation interface
    between everyone and when its a direct message.

    zoom application.

    that we encounter on everyday basis.
know-more:
- desc: we discuss about the final exam first and then we how and came to know how
    to activate private message in the tab. it was an good day for learning.
- desc: It was a great learning session for me today. I would like to know about how
    somebody (designer) creates a perspective or view about user&#039;s requirements
    before introducing any product to users i.e. a game or any application which became
    successful or flop.
