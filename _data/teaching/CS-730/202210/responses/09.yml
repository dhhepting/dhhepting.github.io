important:
- desc: Sensations are physical , while perception is psychological. Our perceptions
    are built from sensations but not all out sensations are built from perceptions
    . Hence  perception and sensation have a role to play in interaction design.
- desc: hi sir. we also are talking about psychology.attention effects on sensation
    and perception.and talking about Lane correction system.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt is that our sensations help us in interaction
    with environment and helps users to  interpret things and understand them. The
    video on passing the basketball and gorilla passing was a good example of selective
    attention and how our brain tries to focus.
- desc: How perception has been linked to the design was explained clearly  in the
    meeting.
- desc: Whenever we are designing something, users perception helps in understanding
    the system.
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture is how term Psychology is connected to our life as well
    as how Psychology has a connection with designing. Apart from this i learn the
    difference between sensation and perception. The video also guide us to concentrate
    on only one thing if i distracted by any single thing then its hard to reach at
    appropriate output. Instead of forcing to customers for approval of our design
    , a designer should take key ideas of customers by some phycology principle.
- desc: Perception is one of the cognitive process. It helps users to understand and
    realize the content of a system. And it ensures that designer put every icon,
    metaphor and label exactly matching the content type.
- desc: In this meeting we discussed about sensation, perception and the selective
    attention test.
- desc: In this meeting I got familiarize with the concepts of Perception and how
    they are perceived.
- desc: Perception topic was covered very deeply. Very well video was played to make
    us understand
know-more:
- desc: Through the meeting, I learned more about our perceptions can be affected
    by our attention, motivation, beliefs, values, expectations, life experiences.
    However I&#039;m curious to know more on how to design user interfaces that are
    best for user perceptions.
- desc: "Today we were taught the Gestalt principles of form perception and why it\
    \ is essential to understand psychology and visual perception for good design.\
    \ I learned about the 5 Gestalt principles: Law of proximity, Law of similarity,\
    \ Law of Pr\xE4gnanz (figure-ground), Law of symmetry, and Law of closure. I would\
    \ like to know about these principles."
- desc: Sir! Are we combining science and art together in attractive designs? A common
    man can have different choices of colors/shape/diagrams. Why do we need perceptions
    rather than creating some simple and scientific designs?
