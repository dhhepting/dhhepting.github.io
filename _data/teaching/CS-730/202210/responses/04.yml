important:
- desc: This was a very insightful class, thank you. I learned a couple things from
    the video, &amp;quot;How to build creative confidence&amp;quot; which i will name
    a few ; 1. Let ideas fly &amp;amp; be bold, 2. Don&#039;t be afraid to be creative
- desc: hi sir .i lrearned about localhost .IN the  break out room I learned what
    were the big ideas in the videos.
- desc: The videos by David Kelle and Gladwell gives great new perspective in design
    and interaction, the reference of little girl with the MRI machine shows how a
    design can change the perception.
- desc: How to get the proper idea of designing and how to make a product which is
    customer centred.
- desc: From Kelly&#039;s presentation, I learned that people are not born creative,
    and anyone can be a creative person. Likewise, Gladwell&#039;s speech taught me
    how people can have different preferences and why it is essential to understand
    variability instead of looking for universals. I also learned how people do not
    always know what they really want.
- desc: As a designer you need to understand who you are designing for.
- desc: so today i learn many things but here i would like to talk about TED talk
    videos.
- desc: I talk in the breakout room with my group and discuss about the tge video
    that we seen on the previous meeting link. It was an nice discussion with all
    the group members.
- desc: I have learned about the importance of design and from videos I got the information
    on creative confidence.
- desc: 'Refering to the breakout room question : What were the big ideas in the videos?
    Everyone has a different levels of satisfaction from their perspective and to
    get out of  fear of being judged is more important.'
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about how the deal with the complicated interactive
    designs ( i.e. if it is taking much efforts and cost. as loading time and browsing
    will require more time for enhancing the User experience.)
