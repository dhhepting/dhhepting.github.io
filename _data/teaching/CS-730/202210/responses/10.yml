difficult:
- desc: It was a wonderful discussion on different types of models and its merits
    and demerits.
important:
- desc: the most important thing that I learned about mental models. we are talking
    about interface and design.in my idea mental models makes very well for understand
    system.
- desc: Interesting thing I learnt today was that a designer can give the user a point
    of view to adopt to his mental model and also that recently a Japanese professor
    develops lickable tv screen which can imitate food flavors.
- desc: I learned about mental models and their importance in human-computer interaction
    in today&#039;s meeting. It is interesting to see how users perceive the world
    around them. Moreover, their previous experience of using an interface can significantly
    influence how they interact with similar-looking interfaces. Therefore, designers
    should use mental models in their UI/UX designs.
- desc: i learnt about the Japanese researchers who invented lickable screen to display
    images with flavor.
- desc: We watch an video of a man invented licking TV and had an great discussion
    on this and as well as we also had an discussion on Zoom auto-correcting text.
- desc: We discussed the STEM Seminar Series about EDI and mental structures on how
    different people think on the same issue.
- desc: I have learned about the interface, behavior and the mental models.
know-more:
- desc: I learned about mental models in software and want to know more about this
    to apply in reality.
