know-more:
- desc: Anyone can indeed design, but it is a difficult question to answer whether
    they should or not. In today&#039;s class, I saw some compelling arguments for
    both sides. Having more people design things will undoubtedly increase the competition
    and benefit the consumers. However, it also makes some professional designers
    feel threatened for their jobs by these newcomers. On the other hand, products
    designed by these newbies may not have all the traits of good design principles.
    I would like to know more about this.

    life. Today we discussed about this topic in the breakout room and we share our
    own views on this.

    a close to perfect design as every one has a different taste or thoughts.

    different view on that. It was also a good discussion within breakout room but
    we were not able to achieve any conclusion because of some time limitations.
