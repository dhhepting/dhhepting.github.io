    most hard thing for me is about programming .it is very difficult for me.programming
    is very important for mthe main thing is that about web site  design .the hard
    thing is that about navigation .last part i would  learn about the differeces
    between good and poor interaction.I think  good design is very easy to navigate  and
    simple .

    find it little difficult to understand.

    ones in the meeting itself.

    Also, we discussed how inconsistency could result in poor interaction design.
    I would like to know more about the differences between good and poor interaction
    design in future meetings.
- desc: it was indeed a informative session. I am very engaged to designing part and
    was so curious at the last part when you introduced us with the interaction design
    and a book. it would be great for us if we have some extra session for the same
    .

    a few basics of it which will definitely help me improve my skills and knowledge
    towards wiki.
