important:
- desc: The most important I learnt today was about the Norman Doors , they are the
    doors that are confusing to operate, it is basically a flaw in the design process.
- desc: How design matters when it comes to usage and simplicity of it. Along with
    that , price and simplicity is dependent on each other.
- desc: 'In today&#039;s class, we watched a video that explained Norman Doors and
    how it translates to other everyday objects. I learned two fundamental principles
    of good design: discoverability and feedback. These principles vastly contributed
    to human-centered design. Designers nowadays achieve this via observation, idea
    generation, prototyping, and testing.'
- desc: Your design should be so simple and understandable that anyone can understand
    how to use the product by just looking at it.
- desc: The most important thing i learn that how a door problem can build a creative
    mind and how designing is important in day to day life.
- desc: I have learned about the human centered design which are used on daily purpose
    such as Doors design. How doors are designed for humans in a way that its good
    or bad for its utility.
- desc: In this meeting we discussed how google posts updates over information on
    covid-19 and why vaccine was not in the list of the primary precautions.
know-more:
- desc: Selective selection
- desc: Would like to know more about industrial design
- desc: hi sir we are talking about Chapter 5 of Psychology 2e .I think it is very
    subject to talking.
- desc: I&#039;m curious about how Google and other search engines get information
    from websites and how accurate they are, how to improve...
- desc: wee watch the video of It&#039;s not you. Bad doors are Everywhere video and
    had an great discussion regarding it.
- desc: How to think very deeply  like sir where he made us think what&#039;s changes
    can be done in Zoom UI . It was so interesting and very creative session as sir
    taught us who to think creative everytime
- desc: Sir! Now these days people don&#039;t have much time to look over any design
    for too much time. Do you think the design should be simple rather than creating
    any optical illusions (complex) in logo or similar designs?
