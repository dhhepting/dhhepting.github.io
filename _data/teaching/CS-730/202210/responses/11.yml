important:
- desc: Enjoyed and understand at lot of things
- desc: I learnt that how a small things can create a confusion or paint a clear picture
    in interface design and how important it is, we looked at the image of bluetooth
    settings from Windows 10 for reference.
- desc: The meeting was great,where it was discussed about the naming convention and
    the design of the components.
- desc: I learned that some big brands (like Microsoft) can have some poor design
    in their products and make confusions to users.
- desc: Today, I learned about the two UX gulfs, known as the gulf of execution and
    evaluation. They define the two challenges that the user must overcome to interact
    with a system successfully. We were shown some designs where the distance between
    these two was significant. Finally, I realized why it is essential to bridge these
    gaps with mental models.
- desc: the WINDOWS 11 turns on the Bluetooth when adding a new device if its off,
    and the old devices show bluetooth turned off, and they introduced these designs
    when they released Windows 8. Windows 8 was designed having touch screens in mind.
    In Windows 10 they kept some of these elements even though it&#039;s no longer
    a touch first UI.
- desc: Learn about interface through any website and guessing other way of design
    about that interface make people more creative.
- desc: We discussed the importance of User Experience (UX) and the process of evaluation
    and execution.
- desc: I have learned about the gulf of  evaluation and execution also with mental
    models.
- desc: There are a lot of things to be seen in different POV(Design) like tim Hortons
    system professor were showing
