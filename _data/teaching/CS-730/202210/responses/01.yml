important:
- desc: Most importantly I understood how to use the dashboard and activities on the
    UR Courses portal , mainly about the wiki and resources available.
- desc: Thank you so much for the first class meeting. I learned basic elements of
    UR courses such as attendance, class wiki, etc. Sometimes, I did not hear very
    clearly and I think it&#039;s my own problem in listening. I hope I can improve
    it in the next meetings and there are a lot of things ahead. Thank you again ^^
know-more:
- desc: I participated in a break-out session on Zoom in today&#039;s meeting with
    my fellow classmates. First, we introduced ourselves and discussed certain things
    related to the good and bad interfaces from our own experiences. The purpose of
    this session was to come up with answers to some interesting questions. One of
    the questions was to identify some features that are common to both good and bad
    interfaces. I found this question a bit tricky to answer. So, I would like to
    know more about this.
- desc: Today I faced trouble figuring out what to do after entering the classroom
    while we were assigned a task, which was given near the end of the class. Maybe
    this happened because I was overwhelmed as this was the very first class. I would
    like to know more about how to convey work in assigned classroom.
