- desc: Okay, so. anyway. What I noticed is that. When we spring ahead or never what
    else springs ahead and March. Then the shows that i'm interested in watching on
    TV. Come on an hour earlier, in general, so. I appreciate that, especially in
    my. it's my ears advance. Yes to four questions I can't tell which one you answer
    guest. I guess the idea is that we're saving daylight, the whole year around.
    Google is telling me. Japan, India and China are the only major industrialized
    countries that do not observe so far of daylight savings time. And i'm not sure
    about that. We have exhibits.org um. I don't know what that is. here's an interesting
    article titled Daylight Saving Time it's super unpopular. Washington Post. Here
    I should. share my screen. So it was very. i'm just reading this about. The time
    switch has been somewhat odd front page topic for years it's was. an odd front
    page topic here for years as well. But then person who. Newspaper sports editor
    who. kept, making it an issue. retired and and passed well. I don't know how much
    he passed away a few years ago. And it's been less less of a hot topic sense them.
    here's interesting tidbit the Russian scientists claim the risk of a heart attack
    jump 50% and the suicide rate climbed when the clocks changed. um. So I wanted
    to. First. they're actually. Let me go to our attendance piece and. Do that first.
    So there's lots of individual differences so. So, if you remember, I showed you
    this picture and I told you, the story about my. Warm coke. Zero from Thursday.
    So here's my call this number today. So. When I call the number. It seemed to
    be not. geared to consumers, but I persevered and they took my report of the warm
    coke zero. And what happened, so the first directing we do a website, I think.
    I remember it was my coke. So these Can you see the my coke.ca. And it redirects
    to this. My coke St aol.com. feels not sure. For customers with people who have
    vending machines or want to sell coke in their restaurant or. Somebody right away.
    Excuse me. Okay, so. i'm. Talking about accessibility. Any questions. Just Mike
    came on inadvertently. Diverse diversity equity inclusion and accessibility, important.
    So I want to. start off by looking at the Web consortiums web accessibility initiatives.
    and accessibility fundamentals. So here's a interesting. here's a quick video
    that introduces it. I think we can watch it together that's okay. Can you see
    that okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hi.My name is shadi.i'm the accessibility strategy and technology specialist
    at wpc the World Wide Web consortium, and today i'd like to tell you about web
    accessibility, the web is, for many people, an essential part of daily life at
    work.at home.And on the road.web accessibility means that people with disabilities
    can use the web, equally, for example, somebody who cannot use their arms and
    uses a mouse stick to type.or someone who cannot hear well and uses captions to
    watch videos or someone who cannot see well and uses a screen reader.To read aloud
    what's on the screen accessibility has many benefits for example captions benefit
    anyone in allowed or in a quiet environment.and good color contrast works better,
    when there's glare also people with age related impairments, such as reduced dexterity
    benefit.In fact, everyone has a better user experience with an improved layout
    and design a lot of accessibility can be built into the underlying code of websites
    and applications web technologies from wpc such as html provide support for many
    accessibility features.For example.features, to provide text alternatives for
    images which are read aloud by screen readers and also use by search engines.Also
    headings labels and other code supports accessibility and improves the quality
    overall.Good authoring tools such as wikis content management systems and code
    editors help create accessible code.Either automatically or with input from the
    author.Also web browsers media players and Apps need to support accessibility
    features.wcc provides standards to help make the Web accessible, which are internationally
    recognized by governments and businesses most well known, is the web content accessibility
    guidelines wc ag.
  persid: ???
- desc: WCs also ISO standard 4500 and adopted in the European standard called E n
    301549 it is built around four core principles first receivable, for example,
    so people can see the content or hear.
  persid: DHH
- desc: operable, for example, so people can use the computer by typing or by voice.understandable,
    for example, so people get clear and simple language and robust, so people can
    use different assistive technologies.Besides wc ag wcc also provides the authoring
    tool access vt guide at AG, which defines requirements for content management
    systems code editors and other software.And the user agent accessibility guidelines
    you a defined requirements for web browsers and media players, there are over
    1 billion people disabilities or around 15 to 20% of the population.
  persid: ???
- desc: The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines access
    to information, including the Web as a human rights.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Most countries around the world have ratified this UN Convention and several
    have adopted binding policies to.
  persid: ???
- desc: Get regardless of any laws and regulations for implementing accessibility
    standards is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. For more
    information on web accessibility and use it w.org slash w. Oh sorry about that
    I forgot my. wasn't plugged in. So this is a list of those principles. So there's
    one more. set of videos of it, maybe it's useful to watch it's only seven and
    a half minutes. So we'll try that and then we'll discuss. week, we have an ad
    you're working feel much smoother with monday.com work os this smooth.
  persid: DHH
- desc: web accessibility perspectives video captions video isn't just about pictures
    it's also about sound without the audio you'd have to guess what this film is
    about.frustrating isn't it not knowing what's going on.that's the situation for
    everyone who can't hear.captions make videos accessible.Which is also handy for
    people who want to watch video in loud environments.or where you need to be very,
    very quiet.colors with good contrast.there's something about great design that
    allows it to go practically unnoticed.
  persid: ???
- desc: But it doesn't take much to make things confusing and frustrating choosing
    colors with poor contrast makes navigating reading and interacting a real pain.
    Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors
    that's not just text and images, but links icons and buttons. If it's important
    enough to be seen, needs to be clear, and this is essential that people with low
    contrast sensitivity which becomes more common, as we age with good colors websites
    and applications can be easier to use in more situations.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like in different lighting conditions.voice recognition imagine if you could
    only communicate with your family by writing.Sometimes it's just easier to speak.One
    of the advances of technology is voice recognition, whether it's searching the
    Web 19th century architecture dictating emails email.or controlling your navigation
    APP.Many people with physical disabilities rely on voice recognition to use the
    computer both order, but for that to happen websites and Apps needs to be properly
    coded.To answer voice recognition can help lots of other people with temporary
    limitations to like an injured arm face order, it could also prevent injuries
    becoming worse like RSI repetitive stress injuries all for people simply for invoice.text
    to speech, some people can't see the text on the screen fortunately computers
    can convert text to speech it's technology that many people who are blind have
    been relying on for years.But it's also important for many people with dyslexia
    and very useful for people with difficulty reading text.As well as some people
    who, just like to multitask.But for this to work websites and Apps have to be
    properly coded which has the added benefit of helping search engines index websites
    contents better.Clear layout and design.Poor layout can be very frustrating.And
    the same applies to the web good design involves good layout and that means a
    better user experience this includes clear headings navigation bars and consistent
    styling.
  persid: ???
- desc: Any web user will get frustrated with bad layout and design.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Complex layouts also make finding information difficult or impossible for
    people with visual disabilities.And they are confusing for people with cognitive
    and learning disabilities who need clarity and consistency of the presentation
    by design also impacts, anyone who isn't particularly confident around computers.notifications
    and feedback.All the right gears can be put in motion the hands can be at the
    exact place, they need to be, but if you don't get the response that you're expecting
    you'll end up wondering if there's some sort of problem.it's the same on the web,
    without clear notifications and feedback people are quickly disoriented and confused.Especially
    error messages which are often complex and confusing.Yet, making them understandable
    is usually quite simple.Making websites and Apps predictable and understandable
    makes them accessible to people with cognitive and learning disabilities.And more
    usable for everyone, especially for people with lower computer skills.Large links
    buttons and controls trying to hit a small target requires lots of effort, many
    websites and applications try to thread the needle.But on the web, we can make
    areas for clicking and tapping larger and easier to use.Which is handy on mobile
    devices, especially when we might be moving around at the time.Which is critical
    for people with reduced dexterity.And customizable text what's right for you doesn't
    necessarily work for the next person.customization isn't always just a question
    of preference though sometimes it's a necessity.Being able to adjust the text
    is crucial for people with low vision and dyslexia.Properly coded websites and
    applications allow the text to be customized, for example, to change it sighs
    spacing font and colors without loss of functions or clarity.Understandable content,
    instead of saying to postulate a conceit more irksome the being addressed in sesquipedalian
    syntax is elemental and it is better to say being spoken to in unnecessarily long
    and complicated language is a pain.Yet many websites like structuring using headings
    lists and separation.or they use overly complex language jargon and unexplained
    acronyms.It makes them difficult and an appealing to us for many people, including
    non native speakers and makes them unusable for people with cognitive and learning
    disabilities.keyboard compatibility not being able to use your computer because
    your mouse doesn't work is frustrating.Many people use only the keyboard to navigate
    websites, either through preference or circumstance.
  persid: ???
- desc: Whether it's temporarily limited mobility, a permanent physical disability
    or simply a broken mouse, the result is the same.
  persid: DHH
- desc: websites and Apps need to be operable by keyboard.web accessibility, essential
    for some useful for all.visit w three.org slash w Ai slash perspectives.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so what I notice about, that is. perspectives will go. To the perspective
    videos like that we just started from. So that means that I posted. Just this
    part of it. So looking for standards. I came across. web experience toolkit it's
    done by the government of Canada. Okay, there we go I was gonna say I wasn't sure
    what the French acronym stood for, but there is what. You did experience. A oh.
    Look at. Those of you. Trying my French. Anyway, so you can go into the. So this
    is a github.io web page. And this seems to be quite up to date. it's lots of stuff
    here. No post, the link to that. Okay, so this is. Accessibility page. Construction
    strap which is. Mobile first. tool kit. framework. Was began at Twitter. But now
    it's. it's a solo project its own technology its own life here. So where w chg
    2.1 is the web content accessibility guidelines. And you'll see. Currently version
    three point O is in draft. I want to also show you this. So section five weight
    is related to. American or us. requirements and so. Looking at. Those same four
    things that we talked about earlier, but in a different order. Diversity equity
    inclusion and accessibility. Interesting links here collectively. So. team working
    on an interface. Anyway, so we should. regularly we assess interface against successfully
    standards support equitable access. So that we can remove potential barriers.
    So design and development festival products. course you all here. Testing baseline.
    So this gives this. specific criteria so let's look at contrast. visual presentation
    of text and images of text as a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 to one. So test
    contrast with web aim color contrast checker let's try that. Try. sure. says how
    did. I get my. color from. web page tested. For the appropriate contrast. So this
    is. i'd say similar problem to that. pizza ordering web page. You know the you
    can do something on the web page. I know that I can. measure the contrast. But
    I don't know how to. make it work. So let's say we have a foreground color of
    yellow. Which is. How do we make yellow. Anyone. red and green, I think. So let's
    read. background color is white. So. There was once a set of signs, I think it
    was a classroom building. that's not important.
  persid: DHH
- desc: well.
  persid: ???
- desc: done choosing to color codes. Information and no particular building one buildings
    color scheme was. Wait. On a yellow background, which. is really hard. To do so,
    you can see. 4.5 to one not close to that is 107. So we can do some market plus
    do structural markup. interactive components. and information about rules. And
    attributes. For screen readers and so on. So there's. preference for reduced motion.
    So with these additional resources. there's the web content accessibility guidelines
    2.1 is the current current version of the standard. A one one why project. So
    you understand that abbreviation. So it starts with accessibility starts with
    the day ends with why, and there are 11 letters in between so that's why the 11.
    So if i'm looking for a way to verify my validate my html. i'm. I clicked on this
    link. with high hopes of being able to find. A way to evaluate my website. it's
    not clear how to do that. Anyway, I see that we're two minutes over time. Let
    me post a. link from bootstrap. chat. Okay, well, thank you very much for today.
    Take care and see you on Thursday.
