Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning, good afternoon and good evening as. best to you. So I think
    we've got. Most people here today. So I checked. Are you our courses enrollment.
    And we have 15 students. So we have 13 have you. with us today. So hope you had
    a good weekend. And a good Monday. Now here we are, and my guess is some for some
    of you it's Wednesday already isn't it. Well, I should say. should change my greeting
    to not from happy Tuesday to happy. Well, no i'm it try and figure out something
    more inclusive. So let me share my screen with you. So I added a bit more detail.
    Let me know if you have any questions or concerns. So. here's our meetings. And
    there's the attendance. activity and we'll do that today, in a minute. So the
    class wiki. Which hasn't been a great success so far. So let's talk about that.
    and So, based on. enrollment today. I redid the group list. So i've. kept them
    almost. The same. and I think only vibe. Here, has been moved to group for. So
    we have 15 students so groups of 444 and three. Otherwise, I think. dress. right
    there and they were set out a region. let's see all right. Alright, so that's
    the group list and here's. The communication forum for that group. which you belong.
    And so we're meeting five today so i'm going to ask. And just go and. add this
    in. Okay, so that's the wiki. So that's one place.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Let me.
  persid: ???
- desc: Go back to the main page here. So. To clarify participation, so in the syllabus
    i've indicated 10% for participation 25% for assignments. And exams of the 65%
    complete overall. So 15% for a midterm and final exam were 50%. So, in terms of
    participation so i've tried to make an explanation here, and let me know if this
    is clear where you'd like some more clarification. And marks of your final grade
    will be rewarded based on your participation of glass ways to participate include
    recording your attendance writing responses to meetings contributing during zoom
    zoom meetings to the class wiki and to forums and activities and your courses.
    So, speaking of forums so there's a participation forum. and So you can eat, I
    suggest you use that form to participate in class by reporting a bug in this course,
    and you are courses there's some incorrect outdated material, for example. You
    can use it to report a bug on my website for the class or just generally for our
    website. Then you can also suggest resources or links that contribute to clients.
    So. Some things you might. contribute on the wiki page as well. For the different
    meetings so. i'll leave that as an option as well. So we'll talk about. assignments
    in more detail on Thursday. But for exam so i'm thinking of March 1 good day for
    a midterm exam. Any thoughts about that that's. The first day after the winter
    reading drink. And, coincidentally it's also the day that. Students in China will
    be resuming face to face or in person. attendance in different classes. That doesn't
    apply to you our classes online has always been intended to be online. But. Dealing
    with the on the chron variant. We started this semester off the most even in person
    learning was done remotely. So we're starting to move towards return in February.
    march 1 is the date that everybody is expected to. resume was originally scheduled
    to be in person, less running on campus. Anyway, that's more information, you
    need to know about march 1 but. That seem seem all right. So when to write on
    the wiki. it's possible to do it now as we're. As we're going through things.
    If you're editing the wiki page now. It will be locked for other people to use
    it. So maybe. As we get experience with it, but i'd say maybe make some periodic
    save your work periodically so it's up to date and then. Perhaps. kind of editing
    mode if you're not. If you know that you're not. going to edit. well. And if you
    find that if you're in the group whose group one who's been asked to lead the
    editing for the wiki today. And if editing is available now great or, if not just
    make some notes and other and another application or word or some text editor
    that you like. And then put them in to the wiki when it's available for editing
    later on. So i'll leave that to you how to coordinate. So that makes sense we're
    making it more difficult than needs to be. Okay. Can we. Go back to our discussion
    from last day a little bit. So we looked at those two videos and we also. started
    with Chapter one in the textbook. And then Chapter one in the design encyclopedia.
    Any thoughts about. The importance of interface design. Okay, so I on no I didn't
    say. We need to present in class from March 1. I just. was talking about march
    1 also being the day when some other classes will be referring to in person. Learning
    after a pause. For to deal with the AMI AMI Kron variant. But we were completely
    remotely. Were we've been set up for remote learning online, to begin with, so.
    there's no. that's not a concern for us as the switch to in person. I was just
    pointing out that that's the. that's the plan for other classes on campus. That
    were scheduled originally to be some form of in person. So it makes sense. Yes,
    that's right our Semester will stay online only. So from the material we've looked
    at so far. So Okay, I have to. You know. I need to. get a date scheduled for the
    US to do that, so I expect to be after April 11 some point, and I hope. I expect
    bye our next meeting, I can give you the date for that okay. And maybe. Because
    we're all online doesn't. doesn't require a lot of scheduling. But i'll just double
    check into i'll just check. With the administrative staff to make sure that i'm
    telling you the right thing and we'll deal with her on Thursday OK. OK. Okay well
    we'll get that sorted out. And we'll just we'll discuss the remaining issues on
    Thursday okay. All right. David Kelly, in his. presentation about. Design thinking,
    I guess, to. Put a. Design thinking and creative confidence. So the question i'd
    like to ask you, and we can have a bit of a breakout for this. Is design. Design
    for everyone, or. For professionals. Professional designers. So i'm going to type
    that into the chat so we have a record of our. Actually i'll do it on the whiteboard.
    Let me change that. squeezing okay. That makes sense. Okay, so. i'm going to suggest
    that we. Have a breakout session for 10 minutes to discuss and then. We can come
    back and. Can rate on here, if you want. Make that anonymous going to do annotations.
    Okay, very good so i'm gonna let you choose your breakout rooms and. Some based
    on your classwork groups. And via above i've met miss met pardon me i've. Put
    you into group for. So pick the breakout room that goes with your group number
    okay. Now do 10 minutes and then we'll go back to discuss. So when I say design
    to I mean the process or the design product and time with the process really.
    Okay everyone's in the in the main room still are you able to find your. grips
    okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, actually, my group is, for me, you added up to second that's why I had
    to leave it.
  persid: S02
- desc: i'm facing the same issue on the my side. Sorry, what is what's the issue
    you're facing. Actually, you don't need the diamond group fall but. There was
    an invitation and I just clicked and I was there in good too, so I left that.
  persid: S03
- desc: hmm so I. I thought Oh, did I okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: I thought I had said to cook. yeah I might have clicked too quickly, and I
    miss changing. rooms. So if you can rejoin our. Okay, let me. Just redo it again.
    Okay, so i'm gonna try that again sorry about that. Okay, so i'm gonna lie i've
    set it to allow you to choose your own room so choose a room based on your. classwork
    group numbers, please. So they should be groups 123 should have four people in
    them. And group for should have three people. Okay, I think we have everybody
    here now in zoom okay. If I if you have questions, let me know. Okay, so how is
    that. Jeff some good discussions in your Greg overs. Okay that's great to see.
    well. So. I think it's not. Complete. it's not objective but it's not. it's not
    just an opinion. But I think. put my foot in my mouth. So I think there are reasons
    to say. That designers design is for professional designers. That it's important
    to. For a successful project that we engage people who are. Who are well versed
    in. In that body of knowledge related to design. But at the same time. I don't
    think it helps to defer to them always and to not seek out input from. People
    who will be using the products. Of the design process. haha. Great I didn't share
    the password let me do that. Okay, so got that sorted out. So there's two sides,
    I guess, so if we think about the benefit of design thinking. and David Kelly
    was talking about, with his. focus on building creative confidence and. So so
    on. So that that's a much more. democratic process or democratizing are making.
    Some design. ideas. and Putting them in the hands of everyday people who might
    be familiar with using. Using things, but not necessarily designing them. So that's
    the one side, and then the other is. Talking about. The rule of designers in.
    In understanding. The questions to ask. The way to put together ideas and. No
    way to use different techniques. So in that way. Maybe there's too much for. People
    to. So. Good. So maybe it's a question of. Taking. Well let's say the backup to
    say that maybe people who do an undergraduate or a master's degree in design related
    field. They put a lot of effort in more effort than. People. The average person
    who uses products and has some ideas about them would want to put in. So it's
    not. The quote the question was not aimed at. Saying should we really need to
    have designers. I think we do need to have them but. there's a contribution that
    people can make, and I think they can make stronger contributions if they have.
    some idea of the process that it's undertaken to realize designs to go through
    that process. Now i've told you my perspective, i'm.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So a couple of good comments in the chat but. I don't need you to not let
    me monopolize the audio you can turn your MIC on, and if you want to talk about
    some new ideas you had in the breakout session with your group. And to make it.
    A little easier. If you raise your hand and I can call on you. Okay i'm not seeing
    a lot of hands going up so let's not it stuck on that and, but anyone I heard
    saw lots of yeses regarding the breakout room discussion so anything in the breakout
    room discussions that you'd like to share in the chat or on. or via audio. Yes,
    damn indeed.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir.
  persid: S04
- desc: hi.
  persid: ???
- desc: So we actually discuss in a breakout breakout room that to like design is
    like not for like everyone, because if, like everyone is going to understand the
    designs, it is actually we see a. Job perspective, like like the jobs market will
    crash for the professional designers as everyone is going to understand like design
    Center. So it actually looks like job market if we look at in that perspective.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah that's true, I think. it's maybe a matter of. Respect for design if people
    think that Oh, I can do this I don't need to hire somebody. don't need to have
    a designer on the staff on staff working on these issues. They think their way
    of without hiring because people say that it's not. it's anyone can do it. So,
    in the same way. Well, let me talk a little bit about the code Oregon the hour
    of code, if anyone has anyone heard about those initiatives in the past few years.
    Okay, so the idea is. There are. This this the motivation for the hour of code
    and and co.org is as a nonprofit organization. they're they're trying to introduce,
    as many people as possible to the idea of computer coding. So, on the one hand.
    And the reason why they're introducing. The skills to everybody, or as widely
    as possible. Is because there's a shortage of. Train programmers and designers.
    People who can. realize these ideas these innovative ideas in code. To run on
    computers and so on. So the more cynical view of this, these initiatives is that
    they're trying to put downward pressure on. salaries. Because there are you know.
    The alternative is these they say it's not really short of trained personnel.
    it's that. very proficient programmers and designers. Are commanding a lot of
    money, and if we. If we can illustrate that. You know, anyone can do this. Then.
    Then the professionals in the field will have a harder time being compensated
    and. so on and so forth, so it's a similar thing i'm not saying that that's necessarily.
    The case I mean there's certain. there's certain data points that might. be the
    case, I suppose. there's another fellow Douglas rushkoff. Has anyone heard of
    him. So he I think he. He wrote a book, which I believe is title entitled program
    or be programmed. So it's the idea, the analogy he uses. Is. So. say you don't
    need to program because not everyone knows how to fix their own car. So that.
    might be. A typical analogy, so if you're not writing code it's like you're not
    getting under the hood and fixing your vehicle or your other form of transportation
    you're not. you're not able to do what a mechanic does in servicing your vehicle.
    Your. scooter your bicycle your car whatever it is. So that's a common comparison.
    But the point he made was it's not. it's not a about whether you can fix your
    car or not so, whether you can drive the car or not. So if you're. If. You never
    get a license to drive. A car let's say or a motorbike or whatever else. That
    might require license. Or at least experience, so you don't crash it. If you never
    get that experience of that training or that certification. Then you always only
    be a passenger in the vehicle so somebody else is going to steer the course and.
    Take you where he or she. wants to go. So it's a little bit. So there's the idea
    of having some basic literacy. About design so not necessarily so much that. Were
    competing. So that the so that the lay people, so to speak. are competing or think
    that they can do the job designers. But they have enough. Understanding, so it
    helps them. frame their questions. To participate in the discussion. And maybe
    to have more respect for. People who are doing the design, but I love go ahead,
    please.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah. Actually, as you have mentioned here like what happens if more people.
    Like who are not designers become front of them family have a design, so I can
    see the many people, a lot of Members. Like my known numbers. Already design their
    own website, by using G sweet or any kind of that site builders and they don't
    have any kind of idea about ux ui design Okay, so in my previous organization,
    I was working. To create some design ui design and the software was totally based
    on NBC a form, so if, if I can say, if you have a. Get the time to watch spider
    man, far from home, so there was a scene in an aeroplane and spider man like Tom
    Holland was like creating his own suit by using some automated tools and. If if
    i'm not talking about designing any website design and talking about designing
    anything that or an object, so any Member who have like basic knowledge about.
    How to perform any operation like on a daily basis, we used to like use our cell
    phone and PC, so it is easy for them to create any kind of design by their own
    choice because they are multiple tools which are available on Internet by using
    them. Any simple person and common man can design anything as I can, like. He
    will not know he or she will not know like how the back end processes going on,
    but he can easily manage and like create. Any own design by his or her will. It
    is not like like you have already said that he's not competing competing in the
    market of like is not competing with any kind of software developers or soft a
    genius like who already designed or designing the. Any website or application
    and but he can. Simply achieved his own design so. I think design is for everyone
    that. Anyone can design anything if he has or she has an basic knowledge about
    that. Thank you.
  persid: S03
- desc: Oh you're welcome. So. So I suppose it's a question of whether people are.
    Whether people who are not as professional designers and maybe have an aptitude
    towards these things, maybe they're. They have other skills which are complimentary
    to the design and. They may. figure out issues in. layouts of. screens are the
    right do do things quite well, maybe better than some people who are. Have a more
    complete education in the in all the areas. So. And i'm thinking that just. Having
    some credentials isn't necessarily the. The answer, either because. You know I.
    I I sent a Christmas package my wife and I sent her or Santa package he's in he's
    living in lot via. And so I went to Canada post and they took my money they gave
    me a tracking number. And then they wouldn't tell me. For weeks, they wouldn't
    tell me. anything except stay tuned for updates and, finally, I went to see somebody
    and they said Oh, this is a fedex number, I mean sometimes they use fedex. And
    just going to see whether. So the Canada post APP still says my that's my son's
    package that we send them for Christmas. Is out for delivery. So. Now, who designed
    the Canada post out are they. What set of credentials do they have to get the
    opposite get into the position of developing. That APP that. has so many. usability
    issues. it's. yeah I don't know where to begin with. talking to anyone about it.
    You know, so if we have we have professional designers who are. Have the credentials,
    but maybe don't have. The aptitude for it. I might say it plainly, anyway. So
    for for me with my website. I figure that. I should be able to design. Something
    that is not just. providing basic functions, but can actually. do some things
    well. And i'm not sure what i'm showing you now. They can start on the whiteboard.
    So let me switch back to the screen. Does that make sense, am I am I responding
    to your comments, I thought I was starting to anyway. hi Bob I mean i'm talking
    I started responding to fly Bob but I maybe i'm a little bit off track. And Dan
    had a comment in the chat Why do I think they conduct initiatives like hour of
    code is it. So that everyone learns how to code or to to understand the effort
    that goes into software development. So I. Think, for the most part it's more
    about understanding that the. So Steve Jobs has this quote about. You know, once
    you realize that everything that's been built in the world has been. built by
    somebody who's maybe not any smarter than any of us. You know, we can change it,
    and we can improve it. So I think. that's the purpose of. that's the real benefit
    of those kinds of initiatives is to say that. is to give. Students or people.
    Who don't have prior experience with coding writing code or designing applications,
    they have. A sense that they can move. They can there's a process by which they
    can. articulate. Design ideas and concepts. And the. In the process of how to.
    initiate change for themselves so it's not just a matter of don't even bother
    you can't understand any of this. I can understand a little bit of a little bit
    of it, and maybe that little bit can help. The designers and the programmers and
    the professionals. To make a stronger case. To make better design choices. anyway.
    i'm open to any anyone else, having comments about that. So the thing that i've
    been doing with my. website so I upgraded to bootstrap five. which causes a few
    problems along the way, but. I think I got things in hand pretty well. So what
    I. here's what i'm going to illustrate was my challenge or last few days. is how
    to have a scrolling. div. So there's something in in bootstrap called scroll spy.
    So, as I go through. The scroll to the contents in a Dev. Then. keeps track of
    where I am. So. The question has been how to know what size of. A big to make
    the dim. So i'm doing some calculation and javascript. In this window that you
    see here. And it's. Reasonable it's not completely accurate, because things don't
    fit just the way that I want them to. I can get it very refreshing. way. So I
    welcome your comments about. My website design and some issues there. That come
    up. Okay, so adding icons to the website will make it better. What kind of icons
    would you like to see. Anyway, i'll leave that as a question, we can. can discuss
    offline or on your courses or. will take it up again, on Thursday, because we're
    out of time for today. Anyway, so i'm going to post, the link here. Something
    i'd like you to look at. And then also look at Chapter two, and in the interaction
    design book as well, in preparation for next phase discussion okay. And i'll put
    that link on our meeting page as well. Anyway, Okay, thank you very much for today.
    And we'll talk to you. On Thursday, take care, everyone have a good day stay well.
    And I have office hours stirring in 15 minutes for not for an hour, you have any
    questions that come up okay take care bye.
