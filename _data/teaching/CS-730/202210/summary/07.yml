- desc: Typical.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I muted everyone, because there are some mics open like when we started
    but. Because can unmute yourself and. participate vocally, if you like.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hi how are you doing.
  persid: S02
- desc: Good Thank you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Very good, thank you.
  persid: S02
- desc: So my health is fine thanks I hope everyone else's is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Also, good.
  persid: ???
- desc: there's been a lot of discussion in saskatchewan here about. Vaccination and.
    Public Health orders and how long are they going to be in place or not. So it's.
    interesting time certainly. Okay. So you see my note over the weekend I think
    was only the weekend, or maybe was yesterday. That I sent it about the final exam.
    Okay, so let's talk about it, so we can finish up that discussion finally. So
    our regular our scheduled time for an exam is. April 21. At 2pm. Central standard
    time so that would be. In about an hour from now. or three hours. So if. We can
    pick a different date. But the process, it would involve a memo and proof of everyone
    in class agreeing to the different date so we an unscheduled. final exam. So the
    April 21 at 2pm. Is the spot, that we would take. US use. Without any other agreements,
    but if we can all come to an agreement about another day. For example, April 19
    at 9am. Then we can make that change. So I want to. Make sure that you understand.
    Their needs some. I need. A letter from everybody. That says, you would like to
    have exam on April 19 at 9am. To noon. So. I don't see any replies to my announcement,
    can you reply. reply to the announcement so here, let me share the screen. So
    in this the page i'm showing you now for the announcements, can you reply to final
    exam scheduling. and say. Can you reply to my note and say. That April 19 at 9am.
    Is between 9am and noon is. acceptable to you. Does that make sense, so I have
    an email record that I can put together with a memo so that we can. Have it scheduled
    properly. Okay. Any issues and replying to that discussion or announcement. Can
    someone go ahead and do that now, while we're here just to make sure that processes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The reply button is not showing up saying.
  persid: S02
- desc: The reply button session yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah so I was wondering about that. because it shows it shows me replies here.
    And I was wondering whether or not it was. Okay, so let me. check the settings.
    yeah okay. So it's a special time. which I thought was correct, but then the fact
    that the interface displayed. replies made me think that replies are possible.
    Let me see if I can change this. I don't think so okay. So let me. make a new
    form. What is going on. Try the third time. Maybe third time's a charm. Let me
    see if I can move this just like that. Okay now reply should be possible. So i'll
    just write a sample here, please state. Okay, does that make sense. In the Zia
    reply button now appear for you, yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: hmm. So there are two people who have. appeared since last time. So need to
    get all 17 students to agree to this. date, so the check on. On those two new
    people. Okay. So if you know people who are. In class but not here today. But
    the know. it's let's see, so we have 14 of 17 year in our meeting. So if there's
    a problem with the date that we discussed last day. Please let me know. because
    everybody needs to agree to it. I suppose. In a. there's an alternative if there's
    maybe one or two people who are. we're not able to use when we're not able to
    gain a consensus, then. We could. make a second. time for the exam or maybe leave
    it for the 21st for those who can't make it on the. On the 19th at 9am. Okay.
    So. Okay. So let's do our. attendance. I forgot to say happy Tuesday February
    1. here's our attendance activity. So any thoughts about those examples we talked
    about last day those design examples. Apollo 13. So I just hope oh okay somebody
    sent me a direct message. So this is why it's good to not send me direct messages.
    Because you send me a direct message, then my chat is going to be set to message
    you. The last person who sent me a direct message. And so it ends up being just
    a private communication instead of everyone in our our meeting. So, is that a
    reasonable way to to think about messaging or chatting that. we're going to be.
    Having a private conversation. If you if you send me a message, then. by default.
    Then i'm entered into a private conversation with you. Is that. Sound makes sense
    that we think about chatting. or. is another option. we're consistent with your
    mental model of chatting. Anyone have some thoughts on that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is everything for zoo I don't know why it does that, for whatever is in darkness,
    which is someone just music like you want to keep up to that person. Well, I feel
    it should still go back to everyone, because then you have to cautiously go and
    change it, and then you can speak on send the message to a direct message, instead
    of everyone so.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So it would be. So maybe in in the list of options. Instead of. Having just
    everyone listed there. everyone's individual names. So I can. chat with everybody
    in the meeting. or me and then. Maybe it's. keeps track of who sent me direct
    messages. so that I can select them from the list, but I started out with everyone
    in meeting. Or, and then. The people who have sent me direct messages. come up
    as options in the menu. Okay. So it's maybe possible to automatically. set to
    everyone let's see. See if there's a way that I can do that. What if I change.
    If I change this to everyone, instead of everyone, and anyone directly. So now,
    for example, can you send me a direct message now. Well, yes, you can. Okay, so.
    And can you pick another. participant in class and send them a direct message.
    Okay. Okay, can you now now you i've reset it to. Let you do anyone directly so
    that's. There I can do. send an emoji. So I don't see, let me see if it's under
    more. meaning in. reactions Okay, let me see what. we're talking about emojis
    or some other setting for chat. yeah okay. Okay, so. who happened to this. discover
    how to. So i'm not sure about this. chat setting here, so if anyone has. comes
    across this in their travels let me know. No it's not a problem to bring it up.
    it's good to test these things. Because. It would be nice thing to have. option
    to reply to. switch to person sending direct messages or. Wherever keep your replying
    to everybody. Let me see if I can. let's do this in. On a whiteboard here. Okay.
    Leave that there and then. And then maybe. We have a list here. of others and
    then. We have direct messaged. US before. And then we can have. So. So we distinguish
    between. chatting and direct messages. turn on annotations yeah annotate on shared
    content so. If you want to make notes on this page go ahead. Nobody. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What does this mean that there will be like a separate storage for each other,
    because how is currently detach just keep going have an agency which is things
    previous not spoken. English I understand this particular and then I do the research
    good story for direct message you have to disperse on them.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. I don't think it necessarily has to. be about. Changing the storage of
    messages in the way that you can scroll through them. I was thinking about. Here,
    let me add. On the chat interface there's this. At the bottom of a warrior above
    where you type A message it says to and then everyone or and then it gives a list
    of. Participants in the meeting. So i'm suggesting that this box would be a reconfiguration
    of. Of the to drop down. And you can't see that, right now, can you. Let me take
    a picture of it and share it with you on. Okay i'm gonna share. Share when we
    share, we share my whole stream for a minute. Okay, can you see my screen now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: Now we're. There it is okay so here's what I captured from this plane so under
    the two. I get choice of everyone, and then individual names following that. So
    what i'm suggesting. lost my whiteboard or not here. My computer's arguing with
    me a little bit here. Okay, anyway, so seen them at the screenshot they want to
    show you. i'm going to go back to the whiteboard I hope. So instead. chat with
    everyone and then this venue original names, I propose that we say chat with everyone.
    Direct message with dot dot dot and then the names of. The people who have sent
    me to move started direct messages sent direct messages to me in this meeting.
    Or maybe. Maybe a. Direct message with. And here, maybe a better word is. Just
    to make it a little more. legible. And then. Okay how's that for. Better sketch
    and better design. So we can. So the nice thing about this is if it's tight I
    can type. So you don't have to deal with my. handwriting which is not always legible.
    My handwriting would go would suit me if I was a medical doctor writing prescriptions
    because they all seem to be legible and i'm not very. Good with writing notes
    that are super clear. I think I do okay in a whiteboard. In front of a class with.
    For a large enough. Anyway, I digress so The advantage of this approach is that
    it's easy to. make changes so this the same approach, we could do a sketching
    on with a pencil and paper, for example. So the advantage of. This is making.
    So some advantages, I see. That we had advantage of not of staying and chat with
    everyone mode. And then. But we make it easy to switch to people who have sent
    us direct messages already. Because they're highlighted in the second section.
    And then the last section, the other participants in class, to whom we could send
    a direct message. So. Maybe. Some other slight into iteration here. Excuse me.
    yeah so it could. We could reply to you or send. Okay, I mean. make one more change
    them. More change in two places. second place yeah I was gonna say send to. can
    understand when. Selecting. Okay it's not copying and pasting like I thought.
    there's two goes over there to. send to. So i'd like your help here justin what
    to call this. Is that label start messaging that work. So yeah I appreciate send
    chat to. And I thought, maybe it was an important distinction to make. That. People
    here have already. sent me a direct message. And then the these other ones haven't
    so we haven't there's no his. So the people in the third section here and send
    me a direct message. So, but i'd like to send them a message so to initiate a
    conversation. or initiate a message I use messaging. Because the direct message.
    label is attached to. things in the chat that aren't sent to everyone. So. So,
    the reason I said start was to say that. There isn't a previous history, and the
    reason I chose messaging was to. emphasize a connection with a direct message
    that appears in the chat window. So make sense. Do you agree with. So any other.
    Any other suggestions about. What i've sketched here. Okay, so. Because it's a
    bit of a hands on. So here's a. reference to an example in the design of everyday
    things. So. The design of light switches. Are you doing and getting. getting access
    to the resources for the class. Like the design of everyday things. So the link
    here, so the first link. Is no website for the textbook second like this on your
    already things is kind of an ad. For for the book. And then Nielsen Norman groups
    web page. And psychology. Is the link to the book. And then encyclopedia of human
    computer interaction so so the link to the book. Well it's an online book. Sorry.
    Okay. So interaction design is the website that I looked at before designer everyday
    things, this is a link on to the Nielsen Norman group website. This is the link
    to the textbook psychology textbook. And then. sacred PDF human interaction. Which
    is an online book. From the Internet interaction design.org community. Okay, so.
    he's talking about the scourge of these kinds of light switches. When you have
    a bank. switches with no indication of what they do. So if you flick a switch
    and nothing happens, then you. You don't know. The les Paul might be burnt out.
    Or, I mean there could be a number of things. going on. So, especially if we have.
    If we have it C three. So is eight switches and that bank of light switches. And
    here, they look like they're all turned on. So if you want to turn out. He was
    me he will turn out a particular like. You have. One in a chance of doing the
    getting. The right one. And what about. arranging the switches in the same configuration
    as the lights and then mount the switches. The same spatial plane, as the lights.
    So what does that mean. looks like something looks like something. like this,
    so. So the switches make. A better connection with. Her function so. If we see.
    The switch indicated here, we know that's going to. Are we have a good understanding,
    we can make it a good guess the turning that switch on. or off is going to impact
    lights in this part of the room. And so. so on and so forth, with the other switches
    on the diagram. So here's another example. Of. An implementation of the previous
    sketch, but a similar idea. So that. The floor plan is indicated. On the face
    of the switch and then you can touch in different areas to turn on the lights.
    So. This one's not quite as Nice as the. As the sketch. Because we still have
    to. orient ourselves. To our place on the map of the floor plan. ahead of time,
    so I wouldn't. want to keep you too long, especially since it's late at night
    or very early in the morning for some of you. So let's leave it there. and I have
    an office hour 230 to 330 so in about 10 minutes I have another office hour, if
    you want to talk about anything. Otherwise we'll see you on Thursday okay. i'm
    just going to set up the. response for today's meeting.
