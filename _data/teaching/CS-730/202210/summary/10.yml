- desc: Hello. event. that's coming up tomorrow. Around about 24 hours from now. Well,
    I don't know what's going on and trying to paste some text into the chat window.
    Lets. You see if I can. tap you then. Let me see if I can make a bigger piece.
    know you can hear that beeping I think. anyway. So i'm the EPI coordinator. For
    the department so. This is the third seminar in the series. So any. Any questions.
    To discuss. vdi. Is that abbreviation. That abbreviation familiar to you. So.
    i'm wondering if you're if you're familiar with the abbreviation. E di. So okay
    that's good to know. i'm. smashes into chat and. My representation. Oh no okay
    nice you. know. I spelled it wrong, initially, but now I have a correct reason.
    representation seems that. So that's an interface issue. Okay i'm typing representation
    again. I made a mistake it suggested a correction I accepted it. And it still.
    looks like it's got some kind of problem. So we should enter okay. hmm interesting.
    Maybe there are some rules if it's. A capital R to begin a word, for example.
    Then it's treated as a proper noun and. Maybe it's. The misspelling is. intentional.
    That could be. But about representation so. In terms of computer science, we should
    encourage people to. Do computer science. Okay, anyway. So I think it's interesting.
    Looking at the interface. For chat here, so if I take. There it was happy. So
    in our comments there about. A presentation and whether it's spelled correctly
    or not or. Or what have you. So. So the discussion in the chat turn to. Understanding
    the behavior and making a model about how the. spelling correction is. is implemented
    right so say well. If we write up the capital R doesn't come up with the media
    correction. And then we switch the our back to lower case it's fine so we're.
    Talking about and an explanation for the behavior. So. We might. So we might have
    an idea of the system, the system. Of this chat window as part of zoom. So we're
    users. And we're trying to. Think of a way to make sense. of it, so we have this
    mental model. That allows us to predict. The behavior the system. So. Is is there
    one correct mental model. That we may. adopt as users. As humans, using a computer.
    A computer tool. We use a song software. So that makes sense. My question to you
    here. Okay, so I have the gallery view open on my screen so. i'm going to ask
    everybody to user reaction. A motor car. emoji. In response to my question is
    there. Okay, so, first of all, does that make sense. who feels like choosing that
    emoji for reaction. So what is that reaction so i've been a coffee Cup. How do
    we, how do you interpret that just by looking at the screen. yeah so zoom said
    think that's i'm way. But it could be. I think quite reasonably school for a coffee
    or I need a coffee or. It could be. A request Oh yes, because it's. Because it's
    a status change, I guess. Then it doesn't just fade out a few seconds. So here's
    a comment post it to chat. To me, as a direct message. didn't. Use the thing that
    I thought. So here's a student's response to my question, what is your single.
    model that's correct. So it may not be that everyone. has their own mental model
    of an interface but. There might be some differences as well. So we can think
    of. With the way that zoom is really implemented. So we have this idea of. The
    system. And then the programmers. Or the designers. Different people involved
    in creating the software. will have a model of how everything fits together and
    works. And we hope to that model is elegant. And, and the way the different things
    fit together. creates a satisfying experience. For the users. So the people who
    are designing and building implementing the software, they have. A very fairly
    complete. model of the entire system. And they have. A lot to say about how. The
    model is. But how elegant the model is they. They can make. improvements. starting
    point. Is what we're thinking about. designers and builders well the designer
    of a system. What are some first steps. towards creating an elegant. model of
    the system. Okay. So when we first encounter system so comment here that says
    single user might have multiple mental models. So you might think of. As we. begin
    to interact with the system. Some function, or some behavior the system encourages.
    A certain mental model so. The user. In an ad hoc way, so they don't start out
    thinking, this is the way it works, but they're collecting evidence. about how
    the system, about how the interface works and what's going to happen when they
    do certain things. That they may. see that are not. A different request of the
    system. Might. elicit a second behavior. And that behavior. encourages. A different
    mental model so. The point. We might. still have these different models. The same
    one user might have. Two different theories without systems organized and with.
    So. Future or further interaction system might clarify things and. being created
    and mental model that. unifies both the earlier behave. It explains both the earlier
    behaviors. And so the ability. Of a user to. develop a practical. model of the
    system through interaction. So. If we. can encourage. and resign users can encourage
    users of the system. To develop. A unified mental model of the actions. that the
    system can perform. And how to access and and so forth. Then we get. Then we're
    helping the user. And maybe. For most people. If the interface design is. consistent.
    that a lot of people will get. To model that. We might encourage them to have.
    And, which seems to be helpful for their use of the system. We have an ad hoc.
    and complete mental model. And if it's hard. it's hard to decide if we seem to
    have competing models. how things are going to work. And our predictions don't.
    lead us to the same. And answers. Then we're in. A bit of trouble, and people
    are not going to be satisfied. That makes sense. So I mentioned about. designer
    having a. role to play in. Encouraging. A mental model for the user. To adopt.
    So can designers. dictate the model, the mental model that the easier. develops
    through this interaction. don't know why that always comes up is not found. Our
    attendance for today. let's get back to the question here. Excuse me, sorry. Okay,
    so that's interesting. that's an an apple feature. i'm not sure if it's. Okay,
    so let me go back to the. auto correcting and the zoom chat. it's not really even
    auto correcting it's strange the indicating.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm looking. I don't see a text. system preference. Oh keyword okay. yeah
    okay. So it wasn't the automatic correction. And I was concerned about it was.
    appearance. That a problem has been found. When it looked like it was fine to
    me. So maybe does. In that case, it is the line underneath the word. indicating.
    That a correction was made. So and i'm not sure whether. i'm not sure whether.
    that's completely dependent upon the apple setting here. So that's a nursing question.
    When. piece of code is being turned on is being activated. Is it. The MAC os system.
    And if it's part of the MAC os, why not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: let's try that as well. Trying to simulate a right click and hold control
    down. No i'm not having any luck. good suggestions and. So it's an example. We
    might have different models. So, from my years of fiddling with Microsoft word.
    and seeing a line under words highlighted highlighted in the interface. makes
    me think of. Their errors. Rising her. hair is being indicated. By a line under
    text. And my. color vision is not great. So. The subtlety of a blue or green or
    red line. may be lost on me. So when I see him a squiggle under a word like that
    I think there's a problem. And why can't I fix it, whereas. The model of the designers
    to say. i'm going to give feedback to the person that the sword has been corrected.
    So the question would be. Our question would be. Does anyone. Has anyone requesting
    information but we're corrections are made. Could we think of. The desires of
    that feature thinking that people will appreciate. When we indicate to them that
    they've made a mistake. But we've gone ahead and fixed it for them. So they're
    better off with. A MAC. will do these things for them and. and point out. The
    mistakes, they made just so. They can feel. Most capable of your own abilities.
    So i'm making a bit of a story there, but that I don't think that's too far. misses
    the mark by too much. Okay, so let's get back to the idea of the mental model.
    That users developed through their interaction with a system. So. We made very
    well. might very well have in mind. A mental model that helps to under stand system,
    and we want. To reinforce that in our design. So we can encourage a mental model,
    but we can't. say this is the mental model, you will use that you will have while
    using the system, the software. In depends on the user. So this is similar. To
    talk about user experience. and
  persid: DHH
- desc: well.
  persid: ???
- desc: As we talk about user experience we can't say people will be happy when they
    use the software. They will have fun. Where they will be miserable. You might
    attend them to be happy. But it's not guaranteed, because people are going to
    experience things in the way they are going to experience them. So I think I talked
    about my. Mental model of Twitter. The other day and got me into trouble. So some
    you anyway. I had a mental model of Twitter that was closer to email. Then. Then
    the SMS sending SMS messages. or microblogging or. Whatever else. So I. I was
    clearly. Not. I clearly did not get what. Twitter was encouraging me to. The understanding
    of the system that Twitter was encouraging me to develop. So I suspect, though,
    that i'm. I was in the minority. That after that experience, I decided that I
    didn't need to use Twitter. I mean, I could use Twitter if. I was required to
    do it again. But I. But to me. Two way of sending messages on Twitter. So I might
    I can figure it out. And maybe over time, I could. develop some ease with the
    platform. But I decided that. I have enough things going on, that I don't need
    to. deal with Twitter as well. So, if my opinion was in the majority. Twitter
    would not be the popular. Service than it is today. So going on with the idea.
    of understanding that designers aren't users. So the thing. As designers, we need
    to understand. What users, want to accomplish. And how they think about the things
    that they want to accomplish. and A good way to do that is to. empathize with
    the users. and Try to. walk in their shoes. So the way. way to. Understand users
    in. more detail. to embrace. issues around equity diversity and inclusion. so
    that the people on the teams. We could we assemble to design interfaces and software.
    If those teams are representative and they understand the issues.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Of.
  persid: ???
- desc: getting people from different perhaps marginalized communities. engaged and
    understanding what barriers, there are. towards engagement of those communities.
    Those people then. And we can begin to really make some progress. And the fact
    that we have. represent the teams, we assemble are representative of the diversity
    that exists in society. That helps. In a number of ways, I guess, one way is that
    if people from marginalized. Communities or underrepresented communities. See.
    themselves. In the teams that are creating the software and the interfaces. Then
    there may be. Some. Some additional trust. and buy in, so to speak, so. don't.
    don't take on. will participate in. The process of designing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: In.
  persid: ???
- desc: The conversations about design. designing the software and the interface.
    Because. Two people who are creating the technology are representative of. Their
    own communities so. Okay, so i've been talking for a long time, if I made sense
    to the questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thanks. Alright, so. we're getting close to the end here, I, I want to share
    with you. From December. This is kind of this is not a. Well, I guess it's sort
    of a commentary on technical tech news going going. it's a blogging site. I think
    i'm not describing it incorrectly that with that. I had this in mind, the other
    day we're talking about. perception. interfaces based on perception. Researchers
    event likeable screen to display you mentioned flavor. Seen video yet so. Why
    don't we. Let me. encourage it to work properly. Video.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Japanese university professor, or has invented a machine that could change
    the way we eat or maybe not the Professor invented this machine that can create
    the flavor of any food that you then.lick off the screen was as Greg.He calls
    it, the T T T T TV or the taste the TV, he says any flavor can be broken down
    into 10 basic tastes like salty sweet sour bitter spicy and savory.The machine
    uses a carousel of 10 flavor canisters and has programmed recipes to recreate
    the flavor of 20 different food yeah good luck on that one folks.I think more
    than that, the question is, is why, why would you want wait why, why would you
    need this, why would you want this Okay, you know it's one of those things i'm
    creating it because I can just can't Oh, you know.Oh OK OK sorry last paragraph,
    Professor says it can be used for distance learning for Somali a's so like if
    you're teaching a chef or a cook right and you're having to do you know virtual
    stuff yeah.or tasting game.taste test Tuesday.Hope it's a day that Dave is back
    you're all here.screen.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well i'm. Anyway, I don't want to go too far with this. that's a remark that
    I remember about personal computers saying well. No one's ever going to need more
    than 640 kilobytes of memory. Anyway, so we're at the end of our meeting today
    so. Have a good weekend and. See you on Tuesday. Take care everyone. stay well.
    Okay. bye. Okay, thanks again. to Tuesday.

  persid: DHH
- desc: Could you please repeat that?
  persid: S02
- desc: Are you familiar with the abbreviation EDI?
  persid: DHH
- desc: No Sir haven't heard about EDI
  persid: S02
- desc: no sir
  persid: S04
- desc: No Sir
  persid: S05
- desc: EDI in this case is the abbreviation for Equity Diversity and Inclusion.
  persid: DHH
- desc: okk sir
  persid: S06
- desc: Oh yes, it was included in GRSt 800
  persid: S07
- desc: yes sir
  persid: S02
- desc: yes sir
  persid: S04
- desc: In 800AA
  persid: S02
- desc: yes sir
  persid: S08
- desc: I think about it terms of representation
  persid: DHH
- desc: the interface was giving me the indication that representation was misspelled
    but I van
  persid: DHH
- desc: "*can\u2019t see any problems with it."
  persid: DHH
- desc: Same issue here
  persid: S07
- desc: "It doesn\u2019t correct it if R is written in capslock"
  persid: S07
- desc: "If you correct and return it  back to small \u2018r\u2019  from \u2018 R\
    \ \u2019it doesn\u2019t show a correction line"
  persid: S07
- desc: "Anyway representation \u2014 in the sense that we should encourage people\
    \ to enter computing science studies so that the makeup of computer scientists\
    \ is the same as the entire population."
  persid: DHH
- desc: representation
  persid: DHH
- desc: Representation
  persid: DHH
- desc: our explanations for the behaviour we observe become part of our mental model
    of that thing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is there just one mental model for users?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Drinking coffee?
  persid: S07
- desc: It is stating I'm away
  persid: S02

  persid: S11
- desc: repres
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Not sure if there\u2019s one mental model for users."
  persid: S10
- desc: I think different users have different thoughts so each has their own mental
    model
  persid: DHH
- desc: It can be multiple models
  persid: S11
- desc: i think a mental model one for each user
  persid: S04
- desc: I think single user can have multiple mental model
  persid: S11
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S06
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can a designer dictate the mental model that a user will adopt?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S02
- desc: I don't think Zoom is auto-correcting these texts but system-wide spell correction
    feature implemented by Apple on macOS. It can be disabled from System Preference
    > Text > (Uncheck) Correct spelling automatically
  persid: S10
- desc: I don't think that a designer can predict
  persid: S12
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S04
- desc: text tab
  persid: S10
- desc: System Preference > Keyboard > Text (tab)
  persid: S10
- desc: Designer can give the user a point of view to adopt to his model
  persid: S02
- desc: Yes , the possibility of a user adopting a mental model from a designer is
    high.
  persid: S07
- desc: "you\u2019ll see a blue line if it gets changed automatically"
  persid: S10
- desc: "Also this auto correct can also be disabled for the current prompt by right\
    \ clicking on the chat window and then unchecking \u201CCorrect Spelling Automatically\u201D\
    \ under Spelling and Grammar settings."
  persid: S10

  persid: S10
- desc: tap with two fingers
  persid: S10
- desc: no sir
  persid: S06
- desc: makes sense
  persid: S10
- desc: no sir
  persid: S04
- desc: I remember I read about this
  persid: S02
- desc: Yea! I heard about it
  persid: S12
- desc: yes definitely
  persid: S06
- desc: I watched the news about it on republic TV
  persid: S12
- desc: interesting
  persid: S10
- desc: "I\u2019m surprised by that video clip being included here!"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "they said the same thing with personal computers \U0001F604"
  persid: S10
- desc: who would ever need more than 640K!
  persid: DHH
- desc: haha
  persid: S02
- desc: "I think that invention is very innovative, the people in that video don\u2019\
    t seem open-minded. In my opinion."
  persid: S07
