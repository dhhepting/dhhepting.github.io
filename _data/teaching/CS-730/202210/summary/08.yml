- desc: Good afternoon or good morning depending where you are. I left my office our
    running. So I had to say goodbye to people who are starting to collect. collect
    their. how's everyone today. I should say happy Thursday or Friday depending.
    where you are. and So I think we have a couple new students in class. Oh wait
    Oh, we don't. They were there, the other day, another gone again. Okay, so that.
    That makes it easier. Let me just. Go to our attendance activity first. Let me
    share my screen. Okay, so here. Is our password for the attendance. which will
    paste into the chat. Okay, so let me go back to our. Well, to type it in going
    to say for any football fans. excitement is growing in Canada, because the men's
    team. or first place after call game 12 out of the norm to 12. and So they have
    12 games they've done nine of the 12. No, this memory. And 14 games to play and
    they've done. 11 of them so okay anyway. Not now that i'm doing. math on the board,
    so to speak here, figuratively. anyway. So they they won their last three qualifying
    games and they're in first place and they're in concacaf. And they haven't been
    to the World Cup since 1986 which I remember watching on TV and thinking what
    a great thing, but they haven't been back since. So. Anyway, that that's kind
    of. Some good news going on in Canada. lots of other news isn't quite so good,
    but that that would be one piece, that would be worthy of a happy Thursday comment.
    anyway. So I hope news and other details are. My positive where you are as well.
    Okay, so I put in the. Class discussions link here. So i'm still missing one reply
    to this. So I don't know who exactly is not replied yet. missed the last trip
    by their. Okay. So it looks like we can proceed with. rescheduling of the exam.
    So they'll still be online so it's just in terms of procedure that. it's properly
    scheduled. Okay, so i'll take care of that today. Any. thoughts about our discussion
    from last day where we it's in redesigning of. The message. So i'm sorry I. have
    some screenshots from last day that I meant to post, but I haven't yet. So. If
    it's all right. Here, let me first post something in the chat here. So this is
    something for next period have a look at over the weekend. And we'll talk about
    it in some detail, then. i'll get the. I have. I have it on the plan for today,
    but I haven't published the plan from my laptop yet so i'll take care of that
    today as well, but just so you have. Access to it so that's the chapter five of
    the psychology second edition open stacks book online book that. Is posted in
    the links. Sorry i've gotten a couple phone calls here and I. didn't think that.
    They should have been blessing me. So no soccer fan say. This. This probably this
    question won't. help matters, maybe. There aren't any fans it won't. i'm just
    trying to get some interaction going. So one soccer fan no football fans. Okay.
    football fan, not a soccer fan. So. I understand the most people. Okay i'm glad
    that I got a little bit of activity going on chat. So i'm a fan of Canadian football
    but i'm also a fan of. soccer Chai call it here. To avoid confusion with the Canadian
    football. anyway. Okay. Let me just.
  persid: DHH
- desc: check.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so glad everybody then. Okay, very good. So does everyone have access
    to a copy of design of everyday things. All right, okay yeah i'll do it. Oh didn't
    I do that already I did, I think, so I should be able to. find it here. OK. OK
    so i'm just curious about whether you have access to a copy of does Zine of everyday
    things from 2013 that's the revised and expanded edition. that's by Donald Norman
    and it's got a picture of a teapot to handle go in, not the. not the best way.
    Let me. Show you a page for let's see. yeah so here's a picture of it. Anyway,
    so. She can, if you have a copy or you can get access to a copy. that's great.
    So i'll try and. find other sources. of things that are online for you to look
    at. So okay yeah so we talked about light switches the other day. And Norman doors.
    Alright, our doors that don't give a good indication of how to open them. there's
    a funny video. i'll post today. Okay well. So there's a copy i'm not sure if that's
    a. Legitimate copy or not. But it's available on the web so. i'd encourage you
    to get a copy at some point, because it's. there's lots of neat stories in there.
    Anyway, so there's a. There, let me find they'll give you the link right away
    in here, instead of. Now. Maybe let's do that so short one. And if you don't make
    sure that I got my I have my video. Sound enabled here. New option. zoom. Okay
    let's see if that works.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Lucy.there's this door on the 10th floor of the vox media office that I hate
    so much.damn it.you read this you're wrong pretty regularly have you seen people
    misuse it all the time.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay we'll continue. With it, then it's five minutes long so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Constantly it.me to kelsey but here's the thing as soon as you start looking
    for confusing doors, they are everywhere it's push why.They like Roman Mars, but
    know that this is 99% invisible and those doors you hate are called Norman door.what's
    a Norman door don Norman wrote the essential book about design, he is the Norman
    of the Norman door all right, and where is this guy you must go to San Diego okay.hey
    i'm done Norman i'm.sure you know it's hard to describe, but I am well he's been
    a professor of psychology professor of cognitive science professor of computer
    science a Vice President of advanced technology at apple.But for our purposes,
    I was spending a year in England, I got so frustrated with my inability to use
    the light switches and the water taps and the dollars, even when I wrote this
    book.If I continually get a door wrong is it my fault.No, in fact, if you continually
    get it wrong as a good way of other people continue to get a.good sign that really.A
    Norman door is one with a design tells you to do the opposite of what you're actually
    supposed to do, or gives the wrong signal and needs assigned to correct it.instruction,
    that is, why do you have to have a sign that says push or pull.Why not make it
    obvious, it can be obvious if it's designed right there are a couple of really
    simple basic principles of design and one of them, oh cool discover ability.When
    I look at something I should be able to discover what operations, I can the principle
    applies to a whole lot more than doors.And it's amazing with many of our computer
    systems, today you look at it there's no way of knowing what's possible should
    I tap it once or twice or even triple tap so discover ability when it's not there
    well you don't have to use another is feedback.And somebody comes there's no feedback,
    you have no idea what happened.why it happened, and these principles form the
    basis of how designers and engineers work today.commonly known as user or human
    centered design, I decided at one point, the word user was a bit degrading, why
    not call people people.And it's amazingly simple and amazingly seldom practice
    we called inner circle circles around in a circle, we go out we observe what is
    happening today with zero people doing tasks.And from there, we say Oh, we have
    some ideas here's what we should perhaps propose to do, then you prototype their
    solution and test it.Quite often, these are wrong at first, but each time they
    go around the circle, we do a better job of making the device.Until the point
    we're actually making something that really works and this process has spread
    all over the world and it turns out it's improving line from better everyday things
    like the ones that Donald about.To using the same process to solve huge problems
    in public health and developing countries, water, sanitation farming lots more
    so, what would be a better human centered door and ideal door.is one that is I
    woke up to it and walk through it i'm not even aware that I had open the door
    and shattered So if you had a door, which had a flat plate.Oh, could you do nothing,
    the only thing you can do is push see you wouldn't need to sign a flat plate you
    put this kind of pushed bar with the piece sticking out on one side works well,
    too, so you can see what side you're supposed to push them.A simple little hand
    thing, though sort of indicates, but we still have terrible terrible doors in
    the world.So many there are lots of things in life that are fairly standardized
    and, therefore, whether I buy this House or not, is not a function of whether
    it has good doors, and so, except for safety reasons doors tend not to be improved,
    but the tyranny of bad doors must, and I think that it really.wanted to push.andyou're
    right becky your God damn right, and if we all thought, like you, well, we might
    just design a better world.One on one because it's a security door.hey so as you
    can see, since I started making this video they have since changed the door a
    little bit.It gets it's a step in the right direction, thank you so much for watching
    and to 99% invisible one of my favorite podcasts was so much fun to collaborate
    with them, thank you and check them out on any podcast APP or 99 pm.So let's say
    you have to read an incredibly long email from your boss, that you have to finish
    before the meeting starts.
  persid: ???
- desc: So is that. Was that fun to watch for five minutes. The link in the chat.
    message to do. So another word that we can use. For discover ability and. so forth,
    is an affordable. So a door that has a plot played on it. Before it's pushing.
    provides that capability. So we understand that that's what's going on. So the
    feedback was the door. Is. going straight forward, whether it opens or not. So
    sometimes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: there.
  persid: ???
- desc: I close the wrong thing. So there's talking about bad doors or. are often
    doors I find here they're double doors so that you can have an entrance and an
    exit door. So in. In North America, we keep right. We have reality of keeping
    right and in England and other parts of the world. and keep left. there. So we
    don't have keep right signs. As there are keep left signs in England and other
    parts of the world. And so I think that. That. custom. is becoming less important.
    people choose whichever. Whichever. side they don't keep right they don't think
    about right or left, they just. Think about approaching doors, from whichever
    way is more. more expedient. And so I find that. If I if I try and use the right.
    The right hand door to go out to or to go in depending which direction i'm going.
    It might be that one of them is locked. So that's. And and, furthermore, there
    are ways. There are. handles attached sometimes push handles which afford pushing
    but they don't respect the key bright. intent that was present. When lot of these
    things were designed. So that's another aspect of. design. And the foreign service.
    So don Norman made another important point in that video about. You know it's
    doors aren't a huge priority unless it's for safety concerns so doors don't get
    a lot of attention for redesign. So i'd say maybe that's true for. Some parts
    of software interfaces that. don't get improved or. We can identify issues. You
    know so it's not a matter of just going through the door. without being aware
    that you're going through a door. So, ideally we'd like to have these artifacts
    that we interact with like doors and. interfaces. be somewhat invisible to us.
    The artifacts or tools that we use. should be invisible, so we don't think about.
    Using the tool or the artifact we only think about completing the task we want
    to complete. So maybe another example is if you're. doing some carpentry if you
    have a hammer and nails and some wood. And you're going to build a birdhouse let's
    say. In preparation for spring. We had come sooner than later. Things are going
    along you're building the birdhouse until maybe you hit. He missed the nail, and
    you hit your thumb with a hammer. Then it's. The activities switching much let
    far away from. Building the birdhouse to. swearing at the hammer perhaps or. The
    tools were using are no longer visible in that case. don't have an example for
    that. Can anyone relate to my story about hitting your thumb with a hammer.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I wanted to talk about another. interface it's a spin so I talked about
    Sunday news it's going on around here locally. So there's a lot of discussion
    about whether we should whether vaccines against covert are effective and whether.
    Pro vaccine should be any longer required. As a public health measure in saskatchewan.
    So, in response to that are. realizing there's lots of confusion about that. elected
    officials are helping to spread confusion, not to mitigate it, it seems. But,
    so what I did was I asked. A question of Google. Let me bring it up here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I can find.
  persid: ???
- desc: took a screenshot so I can share it with. So i'm going to share that instead
    just one second. Okay, so I typed into Google, how can I minimize my risk of contracting
    and transmitting pokemon. So this is. What comes up first for me. So this is clickable
    the coven 19. Actually, let me just do the query live for again here. that's better
    than showing screenshots. me switch back my share. So i'm. i'm interested in.
    In the quality of information I can get from the Internet. and And thinking about
    whether this is a gives me better information or. Good information or could it
    be improved, and so I noticed, first of all. Well it's about two over 2 million
    results available, so I noticed that crystal this coven 19. button is there and
    I can click on it, so let me do that first show you. So this gives a top stories
    about progress. So it's a little bit hard to. there's so much stuff going on with
    corvette it's hard to. It may be hard to make sense of it. So I was asking about
    how to prevent or minimize my risk. And there's also treatments button. let's
    see what it says under prevention. So this is. It looks like a Canadian flag there.
    let's see what more information comes up. advice for mask use. Now it is public
    service announcement. Okay, so. there's a little process that Google goes through.
    Okay, so that's a public service announcement that's what comes up by a public
    service announcement. So it's a little bit unclear how. Information is derived
    get gotten getting from who. I empty. To the page, it seems so Canadian flag on
    it, but I don't know where that. comes from. So get vaccinated when it's your
    turn is part of. The preventative measures, I can take to reduce my risk. So I
    wanted to. So I don't know. So this is a question for you. And i'd appreciate
    your comments so looking at this result screen, would you be inclined to click
    on the coven 19 button here above just below the results. And then, it says common
    question what are some preventive measures recorded 19. Preventive measures include
    physical or social distancing goes on. So what I notice, and please tell me what
    your sense of this is. Open the Wikipedia page here. So I was looking at. The
    quality of the answer from Google. And so I notice that. They have. cited their
    source of as Wikipedia but the sentence. they've included starts now the beginning
    of the sentence so. Preventive measures include visit so Wikipedia says other
    preventive measures include. And then the list. But it ignores the vaccines. So
    now, the question is. Is is Google within. Is Google providing accurate information
    by the quote here. they've done. Or should the Wikipedia. Page be improved to
    give Google, better information to work with. Would you like to share your screen.
    will stop my share. sure. anyone else have. Experience looking for information
    on the web and. If you found it to be. Good information or somewhat questionable.
    Okay, so, since I have you here, oh no i'm sorry. that's fine you don't have to
    do that i'm just i'll start i'll just re share my screen, since I have your screenshot.
    Showing now. Where did my soon go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So, so I see that it's a little bit different order i'm curious. If you click
    on the question what are some corrective measures recorded 19. Do you see something
    similar to what I had. So that's. yeah okay. So maybe there's an opportunity here
    to have a quick discussion about this in groups. So is does the Google information
    need to be corrected. i've already sent them some feedback about asking asking
    on in that direction. Because they they've totally. The miss the idea of vaccination
    as a preventative measure. So is it up to Google, or is it up to. Wikipedia to
    write things more clearly for. public consumption. So let's say that vaccination
    is. is an important preventive measure well, which has been demonstrated. So the
    most important one might be listed under preventive measures. So is that an issue
    with Google and the way they're extracting information from Wikipedia. Or is it.
    A cue for Wikipedia to. Or the Wikipedia is to rewrite. The entry so that it's
    more easily consumed by Google and other search engines. So that makes sense as
    a question. yeah interesting. But if i'm talking to somebody who gets her facts
    from social media, and I say look let's just ask Google, the Internet knows. And
    then, Google comes up with this, the answer that's shown here in the screen. And
    then I would then the person gets their news from. questionable sources says to
    me. i'll see vaccination is even recommended for as a preventive measure. Anyway,
    for the rest, for the other. 10 of you. who've been silent and so i'm not does
    that question make sense, where do you. Where where is. or where are the opportunities
    to improve the information that's available on Google. or other search engines.
    So that makes sense as a question. Okay, so. Let me open breakout rooms and you
    can discuss her. Okay, so is that. Is that enough time to have a couple. Ideas
    tossed around. Anything you'd like to share with everyone. If you can raise your
    hand, maybe, and then. I can call on you, or just put into the chat. Anyone. Well,
    I guess, if you have some ideas about this, you can put them on the wiki page
    under the breakout room for today. But we're out of time for today, so thank you
    very much for your attention. and have a good weekend and. we'll. we'll get into
    a discussion about that Chapter five from the psychology reference next week okay
    take care and have a good weekend. Okay, so there's a comment. So we should get
    information from who the World Health Organization. I think that's. that's. that's
    a good approach as far as i'm concerned. But then maybe also needs to be written
    in a way that. It can be easily consumed by search engines and. Because I know
    on that who who website that i've. The pages i've looked at on the website. I
    start with the idea of. Clear task in mind and then, when I get to the click on
    the link, then it becomes less clear because there's no. Immediate place for me
    to follow follow up on the. place. To find the information that I thought was
    gonna be on the page, so I get a bit lost in the transfer between one page and
    another. So we can talk about that. as well, I think that falls under the heading,
    maybe of information sent. Maybe that relates to discover ability in accordance
    in physical objects, like the doors were talking about earlier. Anyway, we'll
    talk about that some more in. days in our meetings to come. Okay, take care, everyone
    stay well. See you on Tuesday. bye. My pleasure thanks again for today. we'll
    see you on Tuesday bye.
