- desc: Hello. How you doing today. When the here going in the room, I men, and it
    was just a little bit too much. not sure where that is the noise i'm not sure
    what's coming from one of you. or. From something i'm doing here anyway. Okay,
    so. we're a Tuesday again or. There abouts. So let's do our attendance. First
    of all. I realized not sharing my screen yet. So. So we talked a little bit of
    mental models last day. So this is a figure it's on page 126 of. sharp at all.
    So I thought this was. A good example. of how we might get the wrong. Mental model
    of. An interface. So, first in the article, the person is. Here, actually, let
    me. send to our chat. So the figure on the left. is the one that. cause problems
    for the person so it's the windows. 10 I believe. So they've been talking about.
    How everything seemed to be. Fine, and the interface so looking at the screen
    on the left. What can you observe about. display there. Or how do you understand
    the display on the left. Can you understand that this plan left as. Being. is
    indicating everything's fine that should should be set up to work. So question
    makes sense. So is this is. This is the way the screen looks now and. If you're
    using windows 10 or even windows 11. yeah that's interesting. So the common the
    chat I wish I could remember how I felt when I first. encountered this. user.
    Let me try it, let me not try. Because service. There is no try. or. As you would
    it says do or do not, there is no try. Let me share my whiteboard with you. i'm
    doing this as my trackpad so. it's either going to be better or worse, and I did
    it on the whiteboard it's a pen. Thank you. Much. So, at the moment i'm. I have
    the floating menu at the bottom of the screen and it doesn't. leave me enough
    space to see all the options here. just go. Okay, so. We can think of. The user,
    on one hand, giving commands to the computer. On the other hand. perceiving what's
    going on in the computer. and making sense of the current current state. Of the
    system. So you might also think about. This direction. we're talking about how.
    You might design the interaction. What kinds of things people will. You yeah people
    will do when using the computer to achieve their goals. And then. To facilitate.
    Examination of the computer screen. and evaluating it so we understand them present
    state. Then we can be concerned with the information design of the display. Let
    me see if I can switch back to. You know their screen, but so when I went. The
    purpose of storing this diagram was to. Think about how. We feel using an interface.
    If we run into problems and we're not having luck configuring. The software to
    do. To do what's required. So when we're having problems we're not often. we're
    not encouraged to think about this is. A bad piece of software, this is a bad
    design. We think of the problem being with us. So I mean the basis of. The of
    our interfaces. Why way we talk about. Human centered design. Is we're not. interested
    in. Somebody has your MIC on that's. that's okay. comments are welcome. i'm just
    gonna. Get everyone's MIC off. You can. turn it back on when, if you want to say
    something, but. seemed like that was on inadvertently. So you're let me okay.
    So, then, the idea of. Human centered design of interfaces. is to get around.
    Well it's the focus on how people are using it. So when people have problems.
    they're not for no reason. So we need to understand that and overcome. That even
    still there are lots of examples of interfaces that. are not well designed. So
    let's look at. let's focus again on the left one. So this is the displaying the
    settings. So. prone to add a bluetooth or other device. And click the plus sign
    that seems to be clear. So the label on on the plus sign indicates. What will
    happen if we activate the control. Okay, so here's an example of how so we're
    displaying the system status so. So what is going. So we interpret this label
    as. What will happen. So if we come down to the next item. there's a switch for
    bluetooth and it says off. The front interpret the label the same way. We realize
    to interpret the bluetooth or other device label. Then. flicking the switch. will
    turn it off. So. If. The interface is. Consistent between these two labels here.
    If I move into switch i'll turn bluetooth off. So that must mean that bluetooth
    is on. So one thing I observe now. Excuse me. Is what happened. If the bluetooth
    is off. Should I be able to add. A bluetooth or other device. So to me the plus
    sign looks active. So. My behavior isn't being constrained. So maybe we can think
    of. The interface well. Maybe that would help to put it up put the bluetooth above
    the other one. But what's another way, we could. enforce that if that. If we could
    enforce the constraint. That the bluetooth has to be turned on. In order to add
    the device. So oh try and do a live example with my computer, which is a MAC.
    macbook air. With. fairly recent version of MAC os. So the question is. As bluetooth
    needs to be turned on to add a bluetooth device. And if it's not turned on could
    we disable it as a selection. yeah so that. So from reading the problem. To get
    the person writing the author of this article. has gone to this screen situation
    and they're interpreting it as a bluetooth is on. So if they click. bluetooth
    to add a device and that enabled bluetooth. That seems like that would have solved
    the problem, maybe, maybe the automatic. If it automatically enables bluetooth.
    that's a.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: A refinement or an improvement since this example was published. In 2018.
    So if. If we think about things in terms of. These controllers being abstract.
    elements. individual elements that can be. configured differently. Then again,
    situation where the display is. Presenting some. Some strange combinations. So
    we might even think about. settings okay. So does it make sense in windows here
    to. To group bluetooth with other kinds of devices. So in on the left hand screen.
    We might. may have a heading for bluetooth. And then maybe we have. Believe instead
    of most keyboard and pen. Have wired devices. So it's it seems a little bit more
    involved. To me. And just saying that the the label for the button. is not accurate.
    Because. On the right hand picture we see. The change if we slide. The switch
    from bluetooth to from. from left to right. You can see the change. In the color.
    And the change in the label So then, it makes sense. That that the switch is now
    in the on position in the right hand. side of the picture. So, then, the question
    is. So now discoverable it's desktop is Fr cl. So that that's, then the computer
    that's. discoverable s. Is that. Is that name. So it still doesn't say anything
    about the headphones that start out on this journey. Okay, so now i'm gonna. switch
    to sharing my desktop and then we'll go look to take a look at. What options,
    I have for bluetooth. Do I have a bluetooth device, it is impaired. just a minute
    i'll get a device, I think I know we're one is close by. that's not paired with.
    Well, I was mistaken I don't have on this. super handy but let's go through the.
    So those of you with windows 11 can you. Can you create a screenshot that looks
    like. The one in this post. Okay, anyway, so you should be able to see my whole
    screen now. So my bluetooth is on. So. users. ED three is a robot. So, like a
    robot jpl go to is the one that I was. looking for. I didn't think it was still
    connected here. And so speaker. And i'm not sure what the other one is the first
    one is headphones yeah okay. So if I turn bluetooth off. Okay. So when I click
    bluetooth preferences, it opens this. Okay, so I turn bluetooth on. The button
    says turn bluetooth off. i'm now discoverable is this is now my computer. Now.
    So in the window here doesn't say anything about the status. In in the. Systems
    preference menu here. So when I have both things open here they're not showing
    the same thing. So I might be a little. confusing. So switching bluetooth on or
    off. In the system preferences. doesn't seem to have as big an effect, as I would
    expect.
  persid: DHH
- desc: let's try that again.
  persid: ???
- desc: So i'm getting an air. Trying to access that the. So this is windows 11 okay.
    yeah so that's. So here my screen is similar to yours, except for the dark theme.
    I know where those headphones are they're not in here so just give me a minute
    i'll try and. see if they have some power we can try to connect them and see what
    happens okay just give me a man. Okay. Here I am back again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And I have my headphones.So i'm turning them on now.
  persid: ???
- desc: connected.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh no it's disconnected.
  persid: ???
- desc: me i'm gonna say London client. I wouldn't say that. it's clearly connected.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To me.anyway.
  persid: ???
- desc: So does somebody have. You have a windows 11 computer and if you can. send
    a screenshot that would be nice as well. Whatever flavor of windows or Linux Sir.
    What else is there. Between MAC windows and Linux. booties and devices still.
    Have a broken it down a bit more. Most appears. Are the settings that i'm setting
    for the mouse.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The.
  persid: ???
- desc: mouse is listed up here under devices and again. Down below. Anyway, so a
    son, do you find that this is a better setup these now. i'm not sure what version
    of. i'm going to show you another picture or not another picture sure. I didn't.
    Put the link to it. i'll put this up. No more public place in the. Later today.
    that's not. Okay, here it is. So this is taken seven years ago. I think it's.
    Well, was that zachary last time I was there, but this is the cafeteria in one
    of the buildings at the university. So. This is the self serve coffee station.
    Okay, I don't need to have the headphone on. Better again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So you can imagine, on the right. there's some comps. So you can see step
    one if you want to. add some sugar. step to add creamer milk step three is poor
    and enjoy, so the coffee for step three coffee or tea or whatever it is. Is is
    over to the left. They put the step three and to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: have them close by, I gather.that's what I understand this.
  persid: ???
- desc: Is anyone seen something like just before. So please put your cup underneath.
    And let's say I want to get. So in Canada, we say often order from TIM hortons
    a double double.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Which means.
  persid: ???
- desc: To sugar into to cream. So what. what's done here is the very the amount of
    suspense, based on the size of the Cup.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: If I have a large cups and I, and I want to double doubles and i'm going to
    press. This button the button under l. know me do I press him more than once,
    do you think. So in double sugar for a large cup then i'm going to press this
    button twice. Okay, so that seems straightforward. Now I move over here now, how
    do I. get to dispense two shots of cream, for a large Cup. So is it this kind
    of do the same thing is with the sugar. yeah so there's a button called double.
    Or you can even do triple. So I can select the coffee's the cup size in the first
    line, the second line, I can say. I want double or triple or single. And then
    i'm gonna have to select cream or milk. And then, it says press dispense. or cancel
    the start over. So you can't read dispense very much anymore, because people.
    No matter what kind of. order you have you're going to press that dispense button.
    And step four. So the other thing about the sugar that's not like the. Like the
    cream dispenser is. there's no label and extra small. So you're not getting creamer
    milk at the stage when you press cream or milk you're getting it you're just.
    Setting up the the system machine. And then it stopped for when you press the
    spence that's when something's being dispensed. Now, if you haven't had any coffee
    for the day. what's the chances of putting your cup under milk and pressing cream.
    And, and having selected cream. purchase a couple hundred cream and then set up
    to dispense milk. And in either case, you might end up with. A tray full. Day
    dairy. And I know it's this has happened to me and it's happened to other people
    and people working there when I asked about this it's it does happen fairly frequently.
    So is the sugar control, because only got one row buttons. That.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is up.
  persid: ???
- desc: Possibly a better interface, then the cream cream walk to Spencer here. So
    I understand why they're under. They have to separate tabs because. This is likely,
    a big bag of. ice cream, the big bag of milk that's in the cooler behind this
    panel. And the electronics here are centralized they don't have to duplicate so
    that makes it less expensive. Perhaps. So these are issues of. This is my mental
    model of how it. works. So I. Part i'm not sure about is what the mechanism. To
    do the dispensing. If there's a lot of wear and tear on the system. Maybe, as
    indicated by the press. dispenser Council. So don't think you're going to cancel.
    You can do steps 123 until you're satisfied. And then just press the buttons and
    stuff for. But I wonder whether. The Spencer for the cream in the milk is. more
    complicated or as some requirements.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We.
  persid: ???
- desc: The goal is to only other. dispense once per Cup. So that's Why can set these
    different things about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah so.
  persid: ???
- desc: need to make it more clear. was in this configuration. Maybe step four could
    be. removed, so you press cream or milk. That does the dispensing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And then, if you.
  persid: ???
- desc: Left cream on the left hand side. and milk, as you move it over to the right
    hand side. That would be close to. be much closer to the things so if you're pressing
    the cream button. If you less likely to hold your cup under the milks about. If
    you press the milk button. In that case. you'd be less likely to be holding your
    cup under the cream spot.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think.
  persid: ???
- desc: they'll alternative would be if you make it like the sugar.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We have these buttons dispensing.
  persid: ???
- desc: You have you don't need the display save some money there. just have a wrong
    buttons over cream or rural buttons over milk. And then it's pretty clear that
    if you press. These if you set up the labels, just like sugar the cup size underneath.
    That you that you're going to be even more clear about what happens. You can see
    how you have the consistency from the sugar dispenser to the milk and cream dispenser.
    And then you know much less electronics here to worry work. And maybe inserting
    a square you can just have a rectangle.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So these could be connected in the buttons.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well i'm just i'm not sure what what the reason would be but. He needed to
    just make this one piece, you could just have a long strip here somewhere. And
    then the cup sizes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For each milk and cream.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I think the question being sure of a longer cream is difficult.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And so trips up some people.
  persid: ???
- desc: Anyway, to me, this seems a bit like the on off switch for bluetooth.
  persid: DHH
- desc: let's see wrote a time.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay. So, was that a productive discussion today. i'll share the pictures
    well I guess the link, so you could see them directly, will.
  persid: DHH
- desc: try and put them under our media for today.And then.there's they will talk
    about the second more detail and.we'll go over some.
  persid: ???
- desc: Some housekeeping things before we have our break so next week, we will have
    meetings.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So our next Tuesday meeting is march 1.So in two weeks from today.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, thank you for your attention, take care stay well have a good day we'll
    see you on Thursday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: All the best.
  persid: ???
- desc: office hour coming up in 10 minutes.
  persid: DHH

  persid: S04
- desc: Nice
  persid: S07
- desc: i like Apple
  persid: S04
- desc: "i like Apple\u2019s implementation of this toggle radio button. it doesn\u2019\
    t say on or off. They use the color green to represent \u201Con\u201D status rather\
    \ than putting a label next to it."
  persid: S04
- desc: Guess it will make more sense , If the on and off button is above the plus
    sign.

    what if this option is available only if Bluetooth is turned ON
  persid: S07
- desc: Rather than providing 2 different options, It should be in single thread..
  persid: S07
- desc: The WINDOWS 11 turns on the Bluetooth when adding a new device if its off,
    and the old devices show bluetooth turned off, this change is more clear now
  persid: S03
- desc: There are a label for state and a button for Bluetooth, In System Preferences
    on Mac OS.
  persid: S05

- desc: They introduced these designs when they released Windows 8. Windows 8 was
    designed having touch screens in mind. In Windows 10 they kept some of these elements
    even though it's no longer a touch first UI. Not sure how it looks on Windows
    11 though.
  persid: S04

    than the previous versions. Windows 11
