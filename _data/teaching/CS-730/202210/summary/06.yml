- desc: Hello. how's everyone today. Okay. Let me share my screen here. Okay, so this
    is our. Page for our course. This is actually on my laptop still I haven't put
    to the website. And that had some the link section. To the resources that. Are
    on the syllabus. Okay i'm. Sorry meeting today. Well, happy Thursday or Friday
    depending where you are. let's do the attendance next. Okay there's a password
    for tenants. and So just request again if you're going to. In the chat please
    don't send me a direct message, because then I get. I have to reset my. chat to.
    send to everybody. So there's a question about the final exam so I said we're
    going to. I was going to look into that and so. I think. We have a lot of flexibility.
    So I know that the 700 final exam. Is on April 14. between nine and 12. Right.
    So my thought originally. Was that we could have the exam either on. So our last
    meetings on the seventh of April. So we can have it either on the 12th through
    the 14th. Because now i've learned about the other exam being scheduled on the
    14th. Maybe the 12th is a better day. So we could typically exams are scheduled
    from in the morning nine to 12. or in the afternoon two to five. So that's close
    to our time now, but. i'd appreciate your thoughts on this. either in either in
    the chat or with your. microphone. If you're if you want to speak, I guess it's.
    Even better, to have put your hat raise your hand raise your virtual and then
    I can keep track of you that way calling you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, so why don't I do a poll. Everybody is here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay morning of the 12th.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: S01
- desc: he's breaking up yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah and also, I have one more.
  persid: S01
- desc: One more which.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: How I think what's the pattern of. How you're going to pick her.
  persid: S01
- desc: Well we'll talk about the exam so we can agree on what would be.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A.
  persid: ???
- desc: The appropriate or the best choice for a day, and we can agree on there's
    some consensus. Okay, so I thought I named the poll, but I don't have a question
    here. I didn't. get a name for the question, so it says i'm kind of question.
    So the question is where. Let me put the title on the question. Okay i'm just
    going to launch this instead of try and go back and Edit that. Okay So here we
    go with the times for the exam final exam. Okay, so if everyone can reply that
    would be great. still missing for people. To people are we had to reply. So the
    Tuesday morning looks like the preferred time. So Tuesday morning here would be.
    four hours earlier basically four hours earlier in the day than what we're meeting
    right now. And the two to 5pm would be. we'll be starting in 45 minutes. give
    you an idea, so there are two people. In the meeting, who haven't replied yet
    can. I can, I encourage you to reply. If you haven't done so already. Okay, so
    I all I know is that okay one one more appliances one left. Give a few more seconds
    for the last person to her by to answer the poll about the final exam date.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So everyone's reply now. So three people indicated. So 12 people like the
    idea of Tuesday morning. To for Tuesday afternoon and one for Thursday afternoon.
    Is anyone. not able to do it Tuesday morning on the 12th. we're Tuesday the 19th
    be a better option. So you can send me a direct or. Okay, so i'm sorry I don't
    know what the. The yes, Sir, as a response to taryn. So. I don't hear any objections
    i'll i'll see about getting. Okay. Let me try a new. Okay, so let me. i'll do
    two. So i'm going to ask which one of those two tuesday's you prefer, and then
    i'm gonna there's two more questions. Go for. them. Okay. Okay i'm going to launch
    this new poll now. So three questions to answer which date do you prefer. And
    then, are you available free either both dates. Even if it's not your preference.
    So i'm going to wait for everybody to reply to this one as well. So six more people
    to go right now. Okay, so we're waiting on two more people. Okay, waiting for
    one more person. Okay, just waiting for one more person. Okay. So it's not as
    clear cut as I hoped here and i'm going to end the poll now. Okay, I can change
    the size of the window alright. So it's fairly evenly split 60 6044. preferred
    preference for the 19th compared to the 12. and 13 out of 15 are available on
    either day, so the two people. Two people say they're not available for one or
    the other. So I don't know if that sounds very. If that is carved in stone stone,
    so to speak, or whether there's still some chances to. To find a better solution.
    What about a different time on the 12th through the 19th. committed a good later.
    I think we would have the option to to make it. At a time. of our own choosing.
    Okay, make it 10 or 11. And then go for. Presumably three hours. That help. So
    i'd really appreciate your input here. So, to me it seems like the 12th might
    be a better option for people who want to be done with the Semester. earlier.
    The 19th would be. may be better if you think about preparing for the 700 exam
    and then. prepare for the 730 exam. Whereas if it's on the 12th then. You need
    to organize your time. A little bit differently, perhaps. We don't have to make
    it. So with April 18. be any better for. The people who said they couldn't make
    it on the 19th. Okay i'm gonna do one more poll. just give me a second here. Okay,
    let me do it this way. So i'm gonna give you. A choice of dates. And times and
    i'm gonna let you say preferred. It it's okay or not available. Okay, so i'm going
    to. Okay, so. Now i've added six. Between the between April 18 and 19th so it's
    Monday and Tuesday. i've added options for three different times so i'm going
    to ask you to give me your rating for each of them, whether you prefer that time.
    it's Okay, so not the best for you, but not terrible you could still make it.
    or whether you be not available for that time. And please don't select not available,
    unless you're really not available. Okay, so i'm going to launch it and wait for
    everybody to reply. So that makes sense. Turn did you have some questions. Okay,
    so we're still looking for one person. To reply. Okay, so there's no time that's
    showing up as everybody's available. So is there anyone for whom no time on April
    18 or 19th. is feasible so none, neither of those days works at all I didn't ask
    for that. Well, I asked for it, but I can't tell if anyone replied not available
    to all the options. Okay. So we have. and say it looks like the best day is. Is
    Tuesday at 9am. Right. slight preference over. Over Monday at 9am. Okay, so. I
    know people have bad Internet connections and. This isn't the quickest moving.
    process here. But if you're not available for one to two days that we're talking
    about so either the eighth Monday the 18th or Tuesday the 19th. reply to my question
    and say. So it can be there. Yes, no, no, yes or yes, yes, so. uh yes, would mean
    you're not available. So if if you're available for both days you don't have to
    answer. So some people have. that's fine. But I was really interested to see if
    there are people who. Who just couldn't possibly make it on one of those two days.
    That makes sense. So for a on and harpreet. I understand that you're available
    for both Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th. So I understand your response okay.
    So yes, would be yes i'm not available. On that day, so Darren has replied no
    yes, so no i'm not available, no i'm not unavailable on Monday, yes i'm not available
    on Tuesday so don't schedule it on Tuesday. at all. Okay, so. you're the one who
    seems to have the problem with Tuesday, not to single you out but i'm just trying
    to be clear, so we have we don't have everybody available on the 19th. Maybe Sharon
    magical whiteboard here, and then we can. see if we can come to an agreement.
    Okay. So why don't we. annotate here with. suggestions. Can everybody use text.
    will be harder, if you have to draw it in. Okay. I thought there was a problem
    Tuesday the 19th, but it seems like there's not a problem with Tuesday the 19th.
    So I will. Ask about getting that scheduled for us on Tuesday. Okay. Okay, so
    we're getting close to the end of time today. If you have questions for me. i've
    got an office hour from starting at 230 and 20 minutes for an hour. he likes like
    to discuss things so. Sorry, or any of you familiar with to the Apollo 13 design
    issue. So this was the. The mission that had the explosion on a trip to the moon.
    And so they had to. They couldn't go to the moon, but they had to figure out how
    to get back to earth. And so, one of the problems, was that the carbon. carbon
    monoxide. scrubber filter. In the Lunar lander was a different shape than the
    one in the command module. So the people on the ground there had to figure out
    how to get. How to make use of the. One from the Lunar lander. Inside the command
    module so that they could still have. Clean air to breathe, so they wouldn't die
    of. carbon monoxide poisoning. Does that ring a bell for anyone. Okay. Can so
    that was a radiotherapy device built by atomic energy of Canada limited. I think
    in the 80s. So it was the latest model in a series. of devices, but. In the preceding.
    Models they had a mechanical interlock system. They would not, they would prevent.
    dangerous levels of radiation being given to patients. So in the. In the therapy
    25 they removed those mechanical safety features. And they they thought that they
    had test they had. So, with, in the absence of mechanical safety features they
    relied on software only they thought. Their software was correct because they
    didn't encounter any problems before and earlier models, but the idea was. That
    the mechanical safeties were being engaged. And not reported so. The mechanical
    safety features and the previous models. He had. The software errors that were
    apparent. In earlier versions. So, have you heard about Norman doors before. was
    their doors which. don't give a clear signal, but which way to open them. Or how
    to open them whether it's push or pull. Okay, so because we're at the end of our
    class today. i'm going. To leave you with. To think about okay. So I have some
    links. here that I didn't. yeah that's right so. Because no lives are lost on
    Apollo 13. So I had some links for those. idea for those things for you to look
    at over the weekend. And you can reflect on our experience of using zoom to in
    some consensus about. Our exam time. Okay, anyway, thank you for today. Take care
    everyone have a good weekend and we'll see you Tuesday. bye everyone take care.
