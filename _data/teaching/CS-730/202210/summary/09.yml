- desc: Hello. Sorry i'm late starting today and i'm also on my phone because my computer's
    acting up. So when you think of the chapter five in that psychology. Reference.
    frustrating. Can you hear me okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay that's good. nice to know that's working. So what's the reason for. Understanding
    a bit about perception. or reasons for understanding, a bit about perception.
    I don't know what the. problem is with my computer here. I left it to do a bit
    of. A shelf the driveway. because someone came by with. caterpillar no not a CAP
    or a bobcat. and scrapes our Bay, which was nice, but then left a few pieces of
    snow that were blocking our vehicles. So I got some exercise but anyway between
    the time I left and everything was happy I computer is happy and I came back was
    i'm happy I haven't been able to make it. Happy again. For after 20 minutes of
    trying here so. be able to show you something. anyone have any answers to my question.
    Why is it useful to. have an understanding of perceptual systems and perception.
    And sensations. Okay. So the differences in way people perceive things is important.
    So we might look at perception or think about perception to. better understand.
    individual differences. Excuse me to. enter code here. he's locked out it's something.
    Oh i'm sorry. found the direct message trap. But it's different. On my iPhone
    here. Because so replying to a ons comment. It turned it into a direct message,
    even though I didn't ask it to. yeah so. sensation and perception. Are impacted
    by attention. And I have in mind to show you a video. and ask you some questions
    about it. yeah so i'm not screen sharing because i'm on my phone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Her.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so i'm not sure about the comment. The perception ensures that the designer
    puts every icon metaphor and label exactly matching the content.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm making some progress here, I think I hope. So I have Microsoft excel.
    Microsoft word running and they're not responding and i'm trying to kill them.
    making some progress here. Okay, so when we're designing something easier his
    perception helps them to understand the system. that's a good start. Now, how
    do we. How do we encourage people to. receive the system and the way in which
    we've designed it. So understanding attention. Different. sensations which we
    can interpret. And perceive or which we which we can perceive and interpret. So
    that. Every. US perception. to inform our design. Then we have a way to. reinforce
    people's present perception of. An interface. and make it. make it more accessible.
    To people because we're not. Fighting with people's. Personal. Sir basic understanding.
    yeah so. So we have the idea of. Designing well if we design things to. reinforce.
    people's perception of an interface. So we would put, for example, similar similar
    items together. So we can create. sense of, say, all the. All the meeting functions
    are. In one place. Okay, let me see if I can actually attempt. to share my screen
    with you. OK, so now i'm going to try and join on my computer. You don't need
    to see my face. Recording. Thanks. ronda Ben. Can you hear me now okay. So i'm
    not sure rather the chat is going to be preserved as part of the recording so
    if. Somebody can copy and paste their chat. That would be great just to be on
    the safe side. So that dish that are a URL. Is that an image or is that the actual
    text. Okay, thanks. So, before I forget let's do our attendance. Okay, there we
    go. Okay. So i'm going to. show the video. This first video. I don't think there's
    sound, but let me just. pretend there is. Okay, so please watch the video and
    then we'll discuss it. it's not very long. Oh. should be all set, I think. Karen
    see that okay. Can you see it all right. Okay, so let's give it a try and. see
    what happens, this is a test of selective attention. count how many times the
    players wearing white pass the basketball okay so white shirts passing the basketball.
  persid: DHH
- desc: How many passes, did you count.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so. So I was close as many of you are close I kind of 14. I did this
    earlier and I also kind of 14 so i'm. wondering if i'm missing one the beginning.
    Excuse me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The correct answer is passes.But, did you see the gorilla.
  persid: ???
- desc: The screen, I think, is your chat box and mission. Was. said. Okay it's going.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah, I think, maybe. Well, I don't know. it's good that it's gone. Okay,
    so. i'm wondering, so a on. You said you didn't see the gorilla did you were able
    to get the correct number of passes. And for those who did see that. Those who
    didn't see the gorilla. Did you. count the proper, not the did you get 15 or not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A nice girl.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. I think there. is an indication that. We may not be able to. For focused
    on one thing you may not be able to see the other things going on. So. A related
    aspect is. An idea performed by Jeff raskin. well. he's maybe not going dead,
    but he wrote about it in a nice way. In the book called the human interface. So
    talking about the locus of attention, so we don't we're not able to. attend to
    more than one thing at once. So. Our ability to multitask. is maybe. it's maybe
    like the way a computer doesn't. So you're. After so many clock cycles we're switching
    between processes and the computer, so it seems like we're doing all these different
    things at once. But really what's going on is. doing one thing for a bit and switching
    doing the next thing for event and switching. But it's switch so quickly in a
    computer that we generally don't perceive the switching taking place. The fact
    that my computer was out of commission for. 20 minutes. That was an indication
    of. Core multitasking so that might also be. How we how we do multitasking on
    a regular basis is that can be tough to manage all the things going on. Anyway,
    but so the local so attention idea is that you can focus your attention. In one
    spot so if you're looking at a screen. And you see. Okay here here's an example
    that gets me a lot. So let's say you filled in a form on the website. And you
    scroll down and click submit. there's a problem with what you've done. something's
    incorrect. Where do you. Present that information to the. person using. The website,
    the web page or for completing the form. Okay, so you. Put it the error messages
    error message, or the offending text presented. That seems reasonable. But let's
    say it's a long form, and so we after you scroll down to hit submit you no longer
    see the text field. That has the air. So i'm not sure what's the second part also
    all the errors on the top of the page. So I. My inclination would be to put the
    message. near the submit button. Okay. So. let's say there are five areas and
    five different pieces of five different fields. So if we identify each field with
    an ID. And we have a list says these fields. be corrected. But what. Was the submit
    button isn't at the top of the page. So what if, as a question how do what if
    we put the messages. Where the submit button was clicked. And then. clicking on
    each message could bring us back to the. The field that needs some attention from
    the input. What do you think about that. So what are some ways that we can. Make
    use of. Our perception. So switching a little bit. So attention being aware of
    how. We can deal with attention or. have trouble. giving attention to the right
    thing. How can we. Use perception. In an interface. How can we leverage that.
    system. That works so well for people in other cases. How can we use it to make
    a better interface. So one example. I think about is. Okay, so. And there's a
    post here in the chat about using a wizard instead of a forum. So. I would say,
    a concern with that idea might be. Just the level of transparency. Do people understood
    people using the wizard to understand what they're doing. And is it. purely a
    help for them, or is it. or do they understand it like a black box and say this
    is too complicated for me so. i'm just going to. Do what the the wizard says and
    be done with it. So is is that. said a practical or viable approach. So. The thing.
    That came to my comes to mind when I think about. using different modes of perception.
    it's when i'm driving. My vehicle from 2019 yes lots of bells and whistles, so
    to speak. And one thing is, I can turn on lean assist. So it judges. So. I think
    it's. Judging where the lane is. And i'm not sure where the cameras are that let's
    do that. But if i'm. If it feels that i'm. getting out of my lane and I haven't
    signaled to make a turn and so forth, then. It sends some feedback the steering
    wheel so. it's like. The sensation I get is like. Driving over a rumble strip.
    So it makes sense. So a rumble strip on the roads. Is a pattern and impressed
    on the pavement. That will will cause the car to shake. A little bit. If you so
    that you're on the shoulder of the road, for example. Okay. So this is linked
    from. psychology Chapter five believe. Oh no part of me, it was linked from. The
    video that's recommended in Chapter five and psychology sauce. So. Help us in
    designing an interface. splay. So these are. principles. The law of proximity
    so. grouping things together. indicates. So in. proximity. place. So the spatial
    relationship of things in the interface. influences our perception of. How they
    fit together. So in. The picture here room circles triangles circles and triangles.
    So we could. predominantly received these as. rose. We don't necessarily think
    it's five columns. that's not the first thing go to We might say. These are four
    rows two rows of circles and two rows and triangles. So this limit similarity
    is. Important Q4 organization. So there's also the figure ground. So we might.
    In this logo of Norway, you might see water mountains. And forests. That we might
    also see the person. In the middle here. So here we see. The. logo, we see a footprint.
    Four paws. Sorry, with four. digits I guess. But we can also make out a G here.
    And the MAC. logo, we can see it as a single face. We can also perceive it as
    two different faces. Looking at a single face friend. Add on. or two faces and
    profile. cemetery symmetry is also important. closure. So instead of perceiving
    the IBM logo. As. a bunch of lines. bunch of horizontal lines. We want to make
    sense of them as letters so. You first group of lines makes the letter I. The
    second group. makes letter b and the third group makes the letter M. So. In five
    see here see a circle. We don't see a smaller circles, we receive one larger circle.
    I would think let's think about it. mentioned. So. As far as I know, we're set
    to do the final on 19th of April. I had mentioned about doing the midterm. On
    march 1 I wonder if, maybe march 3 isn't a better day since there was a break.
    there's no meetings, the week of. The 22nd and 24th February. So. On the first
    we could. do a bit of review. And then. Connecting Sam on the third. Was that
    we just give us a bit of the opportunity for video review for you, who wanted
    to. Take that. And the assignments. So. view the reappearance of a couple extra
    students last week. And a few me off a little bit. that's been sorted out now.
    So we'll. Have a number of small assignments so looking at having. roughly five
    assignments that are going to be worth five marks each. And we'll do one before
    the midterm and then. The rest after the midterm. that's my plan. So. I would
    like to discuss with you about. What kind of format will. enable us enable you.
    and enable me to see this. So ultimately really i'm interested in. will be a fair
    assessment of your learning. And so. i'm open to suggestions for questions. So,
    together, we can have a conversation about what the exam will look like. So, since
    we're completely remote here. will be using an e proc during. solution. that's
    been used, you have are for a few semesters now. But in terms of what. gets onto
    the exam. i'd like to leave that open for discussion. And we can. reach some consensus
    about. What the exam will look like. That same OK. So the midterm. It might say
    as a formative evaluation. Because we're trying to understand. you're learning
    to date in the class. And so, if there are areas of concern that can be identified.
    And we can. So then there's the opportunity to focus on on those. areas have been
    identified as. needing more attention. In the second part of this semester, and
    then, finally, we with our final exam we have. summative evaluation of your learning.
    So i'm going to correct spelling in. In the chat. So it comes up and it gives
    me. A suggestion i'd like to accept, so I click on it and it doesn't do anything.
    So that's more than a bit frustrating. Okay, so we're at the end of class today
    I apologize for the technical difficulties that we had. With my. Computer from.
    2018 Thank goodness. Anyway, it's not it's not the latest and greatest model.
    So I neglected oh. I neglected to tell you about this. I had neglected to put.
    out a response activity for. Our meeting eight. So I did. I did that. And I made
    it available to Monday night. But I didn't in case there are people who wanted
    to. Complete that activity, let me adjust the date. Susan. eight and nine can
    be both do today. Okay, so, if you would like to. apply write something in response
    to last week's last thursday's meeting you're able to do that till midnight today.
    And then the other one is. open. So now. we're over time. Anyway, thank you again
    for today. Take care. And let me know if you have any questions and we'll talk
    again on Thursday okay.

- desc: "Different people can perceive things differently. Also, many design elements\
    \ can influence people\u2019s perception."
  persid: S04
- desc: one factor effects sensation and perception is attention
  persid: S08
- desc: Anything else?
  persid: DHH
- desc: i can not see your screen
  persid: S08
- desc: our perceptions are built from sensations, not all sensations result in perception.
  persid: S03
- desc: Our perceptions can also  be affected by motivation, our belief, values, prejudices,
    expectations, and life experiences.
  persid: S07
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Perception is one of the cognitive process. It helps users to understand and
    realize the content of a system. And it ensures that designer put every icon,
    metaphor and label exactly matching the content type.
  persid: S04

    the system.
  persid: S04

  persid: S03
- desc: No. I counted 16
  persid: S04
- desc: Time & resource sharing
  persid: S04
- desc: Under the text field
  persid: S04
- desc: Also, all the errors on the top of the page
  persid: S04
- desc: Maybe there are 5 errors in total. And we show all 5 errors in a list and
    display them in the beginning of the page.
  persid: S04
- desc: Then the problem remains I think. Because we can take the user to one field
    at a time.
  persid: S04
- desc: "Another thing we could do, let\u2019s not put that many inputs in a page\
    \ and rather introduce a wizard."
  persid: S04

  persid: S04

  persid: S04
- desc: Sure
  persid: DHH

  persid: S04
- desc: Multiple choice? Or theoretical
  persid: S03
- desc: both
  persid: DHH
