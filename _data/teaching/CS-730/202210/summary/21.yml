- desc: Tuesday Last Tuesday of March. So I. I didn't learn French and Regina well
    I did, I guess, a little bit. When I was growing up. I had French class in grade,
    seven and eight that was required. And then I took it in high school because I
    was interested in. And then I went to spend three centers and Quebec. The Federal
    Government had summer language bursary program that's what they call it. Let me
    they sent me to. live with the francophone family for six weeks take some classes
    and. Be immersed in French language. Which is quite quite fun so that was. 8384
    85 I did that. And so I can still say stuff I began. and So, other things so.
    it's good to have another language. reminds me of. When I went. In the past, and
    i've gone to conferences and other countries like Denmark and so on. I get a phrase
    book can try and. say a few things to the locals in their language. So I did that,
    until I went to Prague. And even saying hello, was a real challenge. And the locals
    just expected. Visitors speak English so. So I guess for the check languages,
    I guess it's a bit like Russian. Maybe has a high barrier of entry, at least for
    me as an English speaker, it was a high barrier of entry. So. Speaking of languages.
    I was doing some things in Ruby this week, well, I didn't do too much Ruby but
    the things I was working on were written in Ruby are written in Ruby. So I think
    for me to make some more contributions to. The development of these tools i'll
    have to do some writing and Ruby. So my feeling is that. Python and Ruby. So.
    Do similar things but different. Different approaches, I guess, so. Python there's.
    Some many people are familiar with Python and Ruby. So my laptop seems good now.
    I was able to update my website. and Building my website with jackal has not crashed
    my computer since there's day. So, good news all around. Let me get to the page
    here. know something went wrong here. Trying to send. just give me a second. Okay,
    see. You first share my screen, so you can see. What i'm up to here. i'll just
    share my desktop. site on my local computer. something extra. OK so. The Clean
    was to clean up intermediate stuff. Now, building from scratch. Okay. So I should.
    show it to you locally. can transfer, let me try and get publish it to the main
    site. I think. it's. made it over successful yeah. Okay, so happy Tuesday or happy
    Wednesday depending where you are. let's look at the attendance. So Terry count
    my. My journey from broken compared to one that's not broken. So I began by. doing
    a brew update so homebrew is the package manager for the MAC or they say the missing
    package manager for the MAC. So it's not the only one. there's MAC ports and.
    I think homebrew is one is taking. The most. biggest share now. So when I checked.
    The homebrew version 3.4 point three. and Last commit the project so it's it's
    linked to the. That tells me that i'm up to date. Go fix that in your courses.
    Which one's the need that I need to fix. So I should. expect it. This upcoming.
    See if we could add. coming in events so. snaps. So, meaning cause today. But
    22 1820. What happened in 19. should be there. let's check the calendar. yeah
    so here this. I don't know why. The order is to what it is, but. it's done. Okay.
    here. So I was. going to take you on a tour of what I went through. So I got to
    the point where I was down to one. message, so I cleaned up. My directory on.
    That i'm using to. build the website so I had some things collected in the vendor
    folder or directory. That we're not. Current so I cleaned it all out. You add
    that left us one problem still. So here's the question I asked. stack overflow.
    yeah so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The.
  persid: ???
- desc: doctor says. So my system is ready to prove that took a long time to. deal
    with all the error messages. Not error messages, but there are lots of warnings.
    in particular. There were some things some node related items in. In user local.
    live. And then. Related to node so. I found a way to clean clean those all up.
    And then I did. My installed version manager. I removed it. installed it using
    brew. Which. version manager people don't support but seemed to work fine. This
    is just a script. Okay, so I have 16. Which is the long term support. version.
    And i've used Ruby environment also part of group to get the language. So 3.0
    Point two wasn't latest Ruby, but when I tried to build the latest Ruby I got
    an error so. Unless. i'm happy with that for now. yeah so. Ruby minus p. So the
    version through last July. So I did. Follow the story of the setup for using Jackals
    bundler. And I did bundle exec serve and then minus T is retrace. And then I got
    to this point. Where is giving me a permission air. On this directory created
    by my collection. So I check. jacqueline's their. path, where it says couldn't
    open it. To the minus T give me this extra air about the bundler failing to load
    the. This is. The page that was built today. Well, we were talking while we've
    been talking. So that works all right. i've simplified, since I wrote the question
    of supply this little bit. So I don't have collections as a list and then as.
    it's it's called. escapes me now but I don't think this is causing problems but
    i've heard this first version. And i've also simplified the gem file. So, really,
    I just have jackal and web wreck. And i've taken up the other three because I
    don't use them. kept these three plugins. So I have the bundle config to say put.
    The gems. For this project into that. directory inside. The main directory. So,
    because i've simplified things now i'm down to 32. gems. So all agrees so i've
    gotten rid of. The mini port file. So the Mitch mismatch between the list of things
    that gem file and what was being installed was due to the gem file dot lock not
    being up to date, so I remove that and we ran it. So, finally, it came down, so
    it wasn't the redirects. We should. So there. are a number of other URLs that
    aren't on the new site, but using this jam to redirect from. I can create pages
    that will. catch the references to the those outdated pages and redirect to something.
    more promising. So I thought, maybe this was what was going on with the this might
    have been the problem but. My. My test so far. don't indicate that this is the
    problem. So I had a subdirectory inside my. works collection. So I took all the
    contents of the sub directory and put it into the main works collection directory.
    And that seemed to work. So things are building more quickly. and behaving just
    a little better all around. I think. I can be so bold as to say that. Question
    on it. I just. wanted to ask. question of jackal to see whether or not they agree
    with my analysis of. Sub directories inside a collection directory that's. That
    was the problem. So I don't think i've gotten any. Any comments on this yet. Anyway,
    so i've made that post as well. seems to me that it's useful to have sub directories
    inside. Just. Just for organization. Well i'll see what I can a response to that.
    So, then, I. need a pull request on the jackal repository. For. This really simple
    change the documentation. Which amounts so Michelle you. So this is the works
    collection. I had some doubts about. But what if I made an error and specifying
    this. perma link path. So there is a discussion elsewhere on the jackal side of
    of. Title being. The name of the file. Replacing spaces with hyphens and so forth.
    The title. preserves the case, so the file name has upper and lowercase in it.
    Then. The perma link will have upper and lowercase lowercase in it. I may maybe
    should have gone further, to say that title is not. The title from the front matter
    of the post, but its title case. Of the file name.
  persid: DHH
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ???
- desc: So that's that's what i've done. Over the past few days so think of on a better
    track now with things. caught up. With transcripts. So. Switching gears. So the
    question so. title is to title. Is the case sensitive file name slugger fide.
    As they say that's just substituting spaces with hyphens basically. So anyway.
    Switching. To the assignment that we talked about last week. So I just thought
    i'd go through it. from scratch, so I created a new directory. package manager.
    So this is. So react and node js. Are. presented as an easy way to get up and
    running. But then. We get messages like these, and. Very. Not. Not very helpful,
    I would say. let's just look at one of these. So. hey anyway. So the idea is.
    To get the react bootstrap. Environment setup. Then i'd like you to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Could.
  persid: ???
- desc: create a repository on github. and give some explanation about how to get
    things. going. In. Some introduction to the web accessibility initiative. The
    aria. labels and so on with. can be used in. In react. bootstrap application,
    the sample application that demonstrates. uses the accessibility features. As
    we've talked about. So. kind of at the end of the day today. I have an office
    hour, starting at 230 to 330 if. you'd like to discuss anything further with me.
    So, now that i've got two web issues resolved i'll get the details of the assignments
    on the webpage. And we'll go from there. And we'll talk about exam stuff on Thursday.
    As we're. get to the end of getting close to the end of the Semester. So I hope
    you have a good day thanks for your engagement today. And we'll see you Thursday
    okay.
