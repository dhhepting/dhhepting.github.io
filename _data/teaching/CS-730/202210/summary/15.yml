- desc: Okay, so. I made some. edits to the data on the. website. So. i'll do a mix
    of both.
  persid: DHH
- desc: let's see.
  persid: ???
- desc: So about the data. We have versus catch one gardening covered. Last week,
    my first. attempt at this was to comment about. The update schedule changing from
    daily to weekly. So in links own data night. Some new things. number of new cases.
    recorded deaths. And then I added a comments when next report was out. So I. This
    was done before the. thing until the 26th. This data was added to the display
    which you can see now, if you look at that page. two pages see that the cases
    went down to zero. For a week. The same with deaths. That I would be happy to
    make a pull request, if I could get a bit of direction. about it. So. This issue
    is close. there's a column made. About they've updated the review to reflect the
    schedule so. They addressed. It should, I pointed out. Brian did weekly updates.
    So realizing that. correction of the data pointed out. it's likely something like
    this better position to do then. They were. So I cloned the repository and made
    the changes. So I looked at all four parts. And they realized. So I realized that
    I needed to do was go into the. daily reports folder directory and change. I changed
    my file so let's. See. here. I started on february's second in February. If they're
    six. files to show. show the. or not. Go back to the code here. reports. So this
    is February. six. So. Each day. These two numbers here. Which is the total number
    of confirmed cases, since the start of the pandemic. On number of deaths attributed
    to cope with. So I made changes to each of the files. February 6 to. March. seven.
    So that's one set of changes. And then. The time series. So then there's two files,
    the global cases confirmed. and global deaths confirm. attributed so. Show me
    that file. Let me open. My computer and i'll show you the false. Shared screen.
    On your services was turned my laptop so every day is. These are all days I changed.
    Well, now it's excel. we're trying to open excel. A good idea. Little computer
    that's going. off again. Will screen. Okay, so. This is. This is the time series
    for confirmed cases. So it has country. This column is province or state so some
    of the. Countries have a broken down by provinces. States so Australia is Canada
    is. China is. Not all the other ones are. Anyway, so. 956 Scotch one. So they
    start recording dates. January 22 20. And then. For each one which dates. Anyone.
    And then there's some strange formatting here, it goes from June 30 21. And then
    the sides take. seven as the year 2007. and makes it into January. January 21
    2007. So. I could suggest an edit for that, but that's not. anyway. So dash six
    dash 22. looks like June 22nd 2002. But I believe it's February 6 2022. So it
    makes sense from context. So. started on that date. Go back to the line. or sketch
    one here. So. i've updated. updated cases there. So is anyone familiar with github.
    Okay, so i'm just looking to see if there any instructions about making changes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm just. Thinking about another possible change suggest. There is a table
    of contents so. You think so far. Yes, let's do that. want to let you know that
    I extended formative feedback until Friday. and quickly here. So I don't have
    to reset it. Any suggestions for. Do you think this is a good thing to add. Okay.

  persid: S07

  persid: DHH
- desc: for first time ,my proctrack has issue .i can connect it
  persid: S05
- desc: yes! I would say highly advanced in security but lagging far behind in designing
  persid: S03
- desc: Designed was poor and the security was of advanced level
  persid: S06
- desc: in terms of security it was up to the mark but in terms of design still it
    could be more user friendly
  persid: S08
- desc: Did anyone have anxiety about completing the exam?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Onboarding was quite smooth but at the starting of mid term the proctor track
    app was open but the exam tab was not showing any questions
  persid: S09
- desc: Noticed some errors on the proctotrack with the security
  persid: S10
- desc: I know from my experience of trying to understand the dashboard that I had
    that it was not clear
  persid: DHH
- desc: I couldn't see the time on my dashboard
  persid: S11

    with proctortrack
  persid: DHH

  persid: S05

  persid: DHH
- desc: '?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Any questions about the assignment?
  persid: DHH
- desc: No anxiety
  persid: S10
- desc: OK
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just want to ask if the assignment could be extended a little bit?
  persid: S12
- desc: i wasn't anxious
  persid: S11
- desc: yes questions not loading at the very beginning of the test gave a little
    anxiety.
  persid: S09
- desc: yes ,me.because I can not see the exam,
  persid: S05
- desc: What do you think about an extension for the assignment. Until Thursday or
    Friday?
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Yes, please \U0001F600"
  persid: S10
- desc: I like the idea of the extension, it would be helpful
  persid: S11
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S05
- desc: it's all upto you! I can't decide between Thursday and Friday
  persid: S03
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S13
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S06
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S09
- desc: "OK. I\u2019ll make it Friday."
  persid: DHH
- desc: "What about them, who has submitted in a hurry!!! \U0001F61F"
  persid: S03

  persid: S06
- desc: thank you sir
  persid: S11
- desc: thank you
  persid: S13
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S12
- desc: thank you sir
  persid: S09
- desc: 'This video came to mind when talking about proctortrack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jajduxPD6H4'
  persid: DHH
- desc: "If you\u2019ve submitted the assignment, I will let you submit a new version\
    \ if you would like"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you sir
  persid: S03
- desc: thank you sir
  persid: S14
- desc: In the exam I couldn't see the time remaining on UR Courses as I was using
    a dark theme. The contrast was off. Proctortrack had also put this bar on the
    top blocking the clock on my system.
  persid: S15
- desc: As a result I rushed through the exam and could not utilize the full time.
    Also realized the time was extended after completing the exam. :(
  persid: S15
- desc: I will get the exams marked this week. Some of the questions were auto-marked
    incorrectly and I will fix up those issues.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I also thought time extension was some sort of bug as it changed while giving
    exam.
  persid: S04
- desc: Did the questions on the exam seem to fairly assess your learning so far?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I was anxious. Felt like added pressure. Couldn't move or stretch the legs.
  persid: S15
- desc: Yes, it did fairly access current learnings
  persid: S10
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S04
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S09
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S14
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S06
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S05
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S11
- desc: I wrote an email about the extension to 100 minutes. There was no clear way
    (in my opinion) to message each of you inside proctortrack.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir! we should look towards any alternative of proctortrack. because I don't
    think it is the only option for online exam.
  persid: S03
- desc: Proctortrack is what we are using at the University of Regina. That is fairly
    well settled I believe
  persid: DHH
- desc: I will do a better job of setting it up for the final exam. :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: If the exam will be conducted without proctortrack, there are plethora of
    reasons to do good in exams as many of us were feeling an extra pressure about
    uncertainties.
  persid: S03
- desc: I want to show you something that I have been working on this past week (off
    and on).
  persid: DHH
- desc: Ok
  persid: S10
- desc: I didn't have properly working webcam in my system, So I went to University
    for appearing in exam from there. But I got to know that we should book our exam
    cabin before a day.
  persid: S03
- desc: Is it better or worse if I type instead of speaking?
  persid: DHH
- desc: It's ok sir... in both of cases.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yes sir
  persid: S03
- desc: Anyone familiar with GitHub?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S06
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S04
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S12
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S15
- desc: We use it in CS700
  persid: S03
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S05
- desc: Ok, do you find it usable?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S06
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S09
- desc: Yes sir .. extremely
  persid: S03
- desc: Of course!
  persid: S15
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S05
- desc: How would you describe your experience with it?
  persid: DHH
- desc: "\u201Cextremely\u201D  \u201COf course!\u201D wow!"
  persid: DHH
- desc: In starting, It was tough to understand the functionality...but in few days,
    after having some practices I learnt many useful things there.
  persid: S03
- desc: I love it. Recently I became a fan of its codespaces features.
  persid: S15
- desc: how much time did it take to understand a pull request ? :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: Extremely
  persid: S15
- desc: At the time of developing projects, I was using TFS which was irregular in
    many cases.
  persid: S03
- desc: it take less than one day to understand pull request
  persid: S07
- desc: It was very simple to understand the pull/push and commit... It took few minutes
  persid: S03
- desc: "\u201Ct is  still confusing to me !!\u201D \u2014 I empathize with this view"
  persid: DHH
- desc: I can also understand it can be confusing to someone who doesn't have any
    prior knowledge of Git.
  persid: S15
- desc: git knowledge is not required if u used desktop or any ide
  persid: S07
- desc: Also features such as Fork as exclusive to GitHub. Not part of Git. I have
    seen many people confuse Git and GitHub.
  persid: S15
- desc: ide do git commands for us
  persid: S07
- desc: Is exclusive*
  persid: S15
- desc: "Let\u2019s propose an addition to the README file that explains how to modify\
    \ the data."
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK.  Can you still see my desktop?
