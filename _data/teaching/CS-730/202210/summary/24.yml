- desc: Hello. Okay, so. Last class meeting but. I will still be available, between
    now. And the exam on the 19th. So we can see how that works out. If you want to
    schedule particular. Meeting times. or just. To have me available for office.
    office hours and. so on. So let's get going here. So, first of all happy Thursday
    everyone. So here's our attendance. Excuse me. Please. So I think the problem
    was because. I have. I have the list of meetings as index. file in. Meetings directory.
    And they also. Reference it. For my side of the meetings directory. So that's
    why I think. I ran into problems there. So I just want to. highlight a few things
    here so. We talked about sharp at all. The chapters there. And the don Norman
    book design of everyday things. So these are the links. For this specific chapters
    selected chapters in the interaction design encyclopedia. That can be. helped
    helpful for some more context. And then the psychology reference book, there are
    two chapters 10. And then. add a couple. A few interesting links, so one is. The
    first one is about the palm pilot. Remember the palm pilot. or heard about it.
    vidyo video maybe we can. Have a peek at that. it's. Okay, let me make sure that
    I. optimized for sound and video.

- desc: I think we should explore new solutions grammarly suggestions catch when your
    tone might undermine your message and it offers.undergraduate research team in
    Guatemala just checking in.Robert Jordan, a second semester junior requesting
    a second extension on this term paper.and your mother reminding you about your
    father surprise birthday party next Sunday.Today you have a faculty lunch at 12
    o'clock you need to take Kathy to the airport by to.You have a lecture at 415
    on deforestation and the Amazon rainforest right.The lecture notes from last semester.No
    that's not enough, I need to review more recent literature pull up all the new
    articles I haven't read yet journal articles only.Fine, your friend Joel Gilbert
    has published an article about deforestation in the Amazon.and its effects on
    rainfall in the sub Sahara, it also covers droughts effect on food production
    in Africa and increasing importance of food contact Joe.i'm sorry she's not available
    right now I left a message that you would call.Okay.let's say there's an article
    about five years ago, Dr clemson or something he really disagreed with the direction
    of jails research.john Fleming of absolute university he published in the journal
    of earth science of July 20 of 2006 yes that's it.He was challenging jill's projection
    and amount of carbon dioxide being released to the atmosphere through deforestation
    i'd like to recheck is figures here's the rate of deforestation, he predicted.What
    happened.He was really off give me the university research network.Show only universities
    with geography notes.Brazil.copy the last 30 years at this location at one month
    intervals.Excuse me, Joe gilder is calling back great put her through hi Mike
    what's up Jill thanks for getting back to me.I guess that new grant of yours,
    as in depth and your literary abilities rumor has it that you've just put out
    the definitive article on deforestation haha is this one of your typical last
    minute panics for lecture material, no, no that's not until i'm.For 15 it's about
    the effects that reducing the size of the Amazon rainforest can have outside of
    Brazil, I was wondering um it's not really necessary, but.Yes.It would be great
    if you were available to make a few comments nothing formal after my talk, you
    will come up on the big screen discuss your article and then answer some questions
    from the class and bail you out again.Well, I think I could squeeze that in you
    know, I have a simulation that shows the spread of the Sahara over the last 20
    years here, let me show you.Nice very nice and good some maps of the Amazon area
    during the same time let's put these together.Great i'd like to have a copy of
    that for myself.What happens.If we bring down the logging rate 200,000 acres per
    year.Interesting I can definitely use this.thanks for your time, Joe I really
    appreciate it no problem, but next time i'm in Berkeley you're buying the dinner
    dinner right.away.While you were busy your mother called again to remind you,
    to pick up the birthday cake.Now printing.Okay i'm going to lunch down.Because
    i'll be there at two o'clock also find out if I can set up a meeting tomorrow
    morning with.family.enjoy your lunch.hello, Professor Bradford is away at the
    moment, would you like to leave a message Michael this is your mother, I know
    that you're.Just calling to remind you.You can easily train yourself to listen
    fast.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I think what's interesting there is. That we. create an imagined future
    where. This technology is working. and In this way. I presented these design fictions,
    so to speak. And it gives us a way to. explore ideas more or completely. struggling
    keyboard here. So. I was thinking butter discussion last day. And I wanted to
    bring up. So many tabs open here. right because I want to show you another class.
    So this goes to our discussion about. Sorry. goes to conceptual models and. Sunday
    ideas and metaphors are talking about last day. So instead of looking at. Another
    class let's set up an assignment here. Okay. activity. assignment. So let's say.
    let's say, these are all okay don't need to remind me to great it needs some law
    submissions from. And that's imagines a file submission that's okay. So this is
    an interesting one. So selecting offline grading worksheet is important. If one
    wants to. Work in a spreadsheet and then fill in the spreadsheet at home off the
    campus network and then uploaded and register the marks. Feedback comments just
    happened to be a column in the spreadsheet that we get downloaded. But in order
    for the column to appear, you have to select this just doesn't appear by itself.
    Okay let's check submission settings. require us to submit the but click the submit
    button, no. required require that students, except the summit save some mission
    statement. During an additional temps are set to never. So now let's make us a
    group assignment by saying yes submit in groups. Quiet group make submission.
    Yes. require all group Smith know. grouping for students. skews that classwork
    grouping.
  persid: DHH
- desc: well.
  persid: ???
- desc: can set how students are notified. And then. Create is set to summit mount.
    tam. Simple direct grading okay doesn't matter. So if you want to use marking
    allocation. You have to use the workflow. So then, when you said yes to workflow
    you can see us to marketing allocation. Now here's. An interesting point here.
    So, remember, we said. Use the classwork group in student groups okay. So what
    is this group setting doing let's find out if we can. So. I feel like this is.
    A bit confusing. I. Think. Separate groups, is what we need. But the hell doesn't
    really clarify so let's say. Separate groups. check on the classwork group. So
    i'm not sure of a case where. It would make sense to not have. The grouping set
    in both areas. Okay, so don't need to restrict access. Okay. OK. OK OK OK. So
    now we have the sample group assignment. want to do is. Sign markers. So, can
    you see my screen okay. So you've set it up to be a group assignment. So. conceptually
    you want to. Think about. Signing markers to groups. So we have a list of everyone
    in class. So here's the groups. For groups. But there's no way to sort on the
    groups, so it can't just say. class work one was. The five people in class. Work
    one, and then the five people in class work. Two then three then four. So you
    can do is select. Group. So you see. four people in that group. So we can select.
    The selection. You can set allocated mark. Then why isn't doing anything. And
    you are courses, you are courses that you thought you were a child at CAA says
    set marketing allocation for all selected submissions. So it's not really a submission
    yet because we're just setting up ahead of time. So that wording is misleading.
    Yes, you want to set. So now we have a marker assigned. classwork one. To do the
    next assignment, let me. This at myself as a marker for this one. So. select the
    group members of the group. allocated marker. She will do this, yes i'm sure.
    And set myself as the marker. see changes. Okay, so let's take a few minutes to
    think about. That interface. So in the other class where I had 24 groups, instead
    of four groups. It took me a little, a. setup. To marker assignments per group.
    So how could we. conceptualize. Of them of signing markers. For group assignments.
    That would give us a bit. work more satisfactory, we have a way of making those
    allocations for markers. The question makes sense. Would you say that. The process
    I just went through wasn't so bad or process through which to which i'm halfway
    through. i'm halfway through yeah that's right. Am I lucky to just be able to
    do this. Oh, be obeyed, in a convoluted way. What. What changes can make in the
    interface. That would make. My. Allocation of markers to the assignment. simpler.
    and less time consuming. Because it's a lot of clicking. In when I have it for
    the 24 groups. It did not. I couldn't say that I was having a great user experience
    with them. So. let's talk about the features of this interface, so what. What
    would happen if. If I could sort the list of participants. So if I looked at all
    the participants again. What would happen if I could sort by group. That. Give
    me some relief from my tedious process. clicking. So if somehow we could make.
    Use of the concept of a group assignment. But it seems to me like it would be
    a big help. So if it's not yet clear. With the things that i've made this is a
    group assignment. Maybe. Maybe there's a way to add that make that information
    explicit, so I can say this is a group assignment. So even if we couldn't. Make
    selections. Make to them embark if we had the concept. That we just need to assign
    the market to a group. Instead of all the individuals in a group. That will be
    making. Some substantial progress, I think. So this could be a possible interface.
    So it can imagine. Instead of groups and Members of. Your face like marker one
    marker two. And then the list of groups here. So the idea. would be to make marking
    marker allocations or assignments. Using. concepts that are already present in
    the interface. and The Auto create groups. may be an interesting. way to. allow
    this feature. So instead of naming scheme further. So we'd indicate. Here first
    step would be who, who are the markers who are going to be marking. This assignment.
    And then. i'm not sure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: How.
  persid: ???
- desc: To do a bit more taking about this, but. I have two markers saying that in
    my other classes 24 groups. So, I imagine, I could use an interface click one
    call. here's. To this marker i'm going to assign the following groups and then
    make a selection from the right column. So we have. away some ways to think about
    the interface. So we can think about. The the concepts involve the conceptual
    models. and So we can do some evaluation. More from an analytic perspective or
    from an empirical perspective. So if we. are doing an empirical evaluation. Then
    we get. people to use the interface and collect data. So we may collect. subjective.
    impressions both the interface might collect. times to complete tasks or errors
    made the interface, and so on. So we can. So we're good we can work with data.
    To make. empirical evaluation. If we don't have data we don't have people. Who
    could test the interface for us. Then. We could do an analytic. We might. Do.
    A walkthrough. We can have an expert look at the interface. and highlight some
    issues. problem. With looking at an interface so actually using it. Is that things.
    aspects of the information design and the interface. May. seem more prominent.
    Someone observing the whole interface rather than. That to someone who's using
    it to complete a task. So we might flag some issues. which seemed to be there
    in theory but in practice. not really. Such a big concern. So another way to do
    analysis. or one other way to do analysis is to think about. Different. keystrokes
    and mouse presses, and so forth. That are involved in completing a task in the
    interface. So when I was setting up. Okay. markers two groups. Are there as a
    lot of clicking so. I might be doing some typing. Actually I wasn't doing typing
    so it's just a matter of. navigating with the most to different parts of the screen
    clicking. Making selections and so on. So there's something called the guns goals
    operators methods and selections. A keystroke level mom. provides a way for us
    to describe. ways to describe different actions we perform. Like if if we're always
    on the mouse the track that so we're not incurring a penalty. Switching between
    the keyboard and the monks. But there's. still some. Well, there you can. Live
    last minute amount of time it takes. For a person to go between to click where
    they need to click. into those different operations. soon. So then, if we have
    let's say two different interfaces we can compare. The two interfaces. To get
    an idea of how much time each would take or how much an average person might take.
    to complete a task, and both interfaces. So. From my perspective, it's not so
    important, the numbers. Say forget a result of two seconds one interface and 10
    seconds for another interface design. The actual values of the number of those
    numbers. are less important than. The magnitude of the difference between them.
    Just because one is five times faster than the other doesn't mean. That that will
    hold up and practice. Because the very quick interface might. be very error prone
    if somebody is not good at the keyboard let's say. So two very different data
    points that we can get. We can help to understand. And all those data points help
    us to understand. The interface. Issues.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Work lately.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thanks. Getting back to the car courses interface. So it's not. so much about.
    Making. Well, one could save us make some some minor improvements. To the marker.
    assignment. interface. To me it seems like. The way to make a real improvement
    there is. To make central the concept of a group assignment. So any thoughts about.
    How we might approach that. So I got a direct message so i'm replying to the direct
    message about assignment, but the assignment. So getting back to our discussion
    about. The. map Apps. And the differences between well, so the maps on your smartphone
    and on a piece of paper. How do they impact our understanding of. The world around
    us. Because the paper map. Encourage. An understanding of. special relationship
    with different parts of the city. More so than an APP. That says here i'll give
    you directions turn. Turn left in 500 meters then go one kilometer. and turn right.
    So direction by distances is not. A useful. a useful way to go about. Making your
    way in in a city. Or is it better to say. directions like. At the next stop light
    turn right. So i've been encouraged to hear some of those kinds of directions.
    And Google maps or. not always the other discouraging thing is. street names that
    get mispronounced when giving directions. So it's not a matter of. The computer
    generated voice. Having good pronunciation and. To local residents, having. A
    poor pronunciation. Syria, for example. doesn't say Regina saskatchewan. It says
    Regina. which never fails to upset me. And there are other examples of. mispronounced.
    So. Getting another direct message. Can I decrease material for the final exam.
    I would say. To focus on. What. we've done in class in our discussions. As I said
    before, I. am looking forward to your suggestions for exam questions and answers.
    That will. be a fair assessment of learning. This semester. So between. The sharp
    at all book. chapters one through seven and don Norman book chapters one through
    six. Take those. and fine. Fine, questions. With particular wording and the answers
    you. would expect to give. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: ???
- desc: you're welcome. Okay, so I have to run to some other things. At this time
    and it's probably also fairly late for some of you. So i'm serious. About. The
    final exam being a collaborative effort. And so let's. make some progress towards
    that every day, between now and the 19th. and And i'd be very happy if everyone
    does very well. Okay. Thanks for today. I appreciate your engagement. and talk
    to you again soon. Whether in zoom or new our courses. Take care see you soon.
