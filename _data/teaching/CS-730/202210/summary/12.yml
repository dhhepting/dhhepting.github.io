Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Has anyone been watching the Olympics. So I watched the women's hockey game,
    the gold medal match yesterday. Now it's Nice. anyway. So the CBC Canadian Broadcasting
    Corporation. As coverage of almost everything and so it's easy to. spend more
    time than. You might first one to spend watching the Olympics, because it's. an
    exciting time. that's it it's almost over. anyway. it's not the most important
    thing, the good some so good distraction. anyway. So let me. Okay. So. Let me
    share the screen with you. And then we can do our attendance for today. Okay,
    so. i'm going to share a link with you for this that tearing your course it's
    a. bit more setting up to do for this. You can see it's going to be from. Thursday
    march 3 at 1pm. So a regular meeting time. And i'll be online and your courses.
    and i'll have the zoom meeting. Open as well, fair questions. Sorry for what.
    I didn't see any. Oh OK. So the midterm is going to be two weeks from today on
    march 3. So you'll do the the quiz in your courses. But i'll be have the zoom.
    Our regular zoom meeting open. If there any questions during the exam okay. That
    makes sense. Okay. So I. I would appreciate your input. your suggestions of questions
    that are. That would allow fair assessment of learning to date in the Semester
    in this course. If you don't if you don't give me any questions doesn't mean you
    won't have a mentor exam. that's my little my standard instructor joke. But will
    use. Please proctor track. For the exam. And I was. trying to get that setup today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But.
  persid: ???
- desc: There are some issues. So it's not. I will send a note. By the end of the
    week. describing what needs to be done. In order to. You know there's a little
    bit of setup needs to be done before the midterm. um. I think you have, are you
    have your ID card is preferable, but I think there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'll have to check. What the requirements are. Now check. On that by the end
    of tomorrow. i'll give you more details, by the end of tomorrow for the exam.
    Okay, thanks. here's the. Student information. Okay. So it's Thursday so to be
    on top of things. The government in. saskatchewan where we are here in Canada.
    has stopped providing daily updates to covert statistics. So they're supposed
    to release an update day. So i'm keeping an eye on that. But what I wanted to.
    Show you and and think about from a. not interested in. The motivations behind
    the strategy and so on. Or the approach that's being taken by this government
    or any other i'm interested in how the information is displayed on the web. So,
    if we look at statistics for saskatchewan. let's look at the last two weeks. When
    you see this. what's your impression about. The state of the pandemic here in
    saskatchewan. So question makes sense. yeah So these are very impressive numbers.
    So what's not indicated here is that there's no data. Beyond February six. So
    we're 10 days we're missing 10 days of data now. So if you went to. This page
    to see the. status of the. Of the pandemic here in saskatchewan. What what impression
    when we get. to scotch one is doing really well. So, how does this play into the.
    Discussion from Tuesday about the Gulf some evaluation and execution. So. So they're
    not providing daily data anymore. So they're providing. weekly reports so they
    provided a weekly report on February 10. Last week, so we go as the first one
    that didn't go up until the ninth went up until. Well, different ending days.
    And they haven't provided the data from this week's update yet. So. i'm not. I
    can't speak to the reasoning behind it. But I don't. indicated that it's the government
    is indicated that it's. Time to treat it or start living with covert as. As a.
    Respiratory infection, like other ones. So they're trying to normalize cool good.
    And so they're. making changes to the way the reporting. Okay. So if i'm interested.
    in finding out. The current statistics over the last two weeks and saskatchewan.
    Then I can. For Anna plan that i'm going to go this web page look at statistics.
    click on that. And I get the new cases and then I can also say. I could choose
    deaths as well. And then I can choose a timeframe. So if i'm interested in the
    last two weeks. I can select that or here's a 30 days. So this graph that results
    is the one that. i'm going to interpret. To decide whether or not, or to determine
    announced by question. So when. So you can say that there is a golf evaluation.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Right so there's two issues that. Number just so the interface to to plot,
    the data. seems fairly straightforward and so you get to this page if I said.
    I wanted to look for. Statistics in saskatchewan. I would have a Google cruiser
    Scott from coronavirus stats. And I would see this page, and I could tailor it
    so that's fairly clear of how to. What commands to execute and then I can interpret
    the data. But, as you say. This data doesn't look right. And so it's not so much
    about. it's not just about the interface. it's about the data that's being made
    available in the interface. Right so there's not. So there is no indication here
    that. The data hasn't been. applauded or hasn't been submitted. So i'm going to
    be some ways to refer to. Thinking about the Gulf of valuation. How we design
    the information display. To show that. There is data missing from. February 6
    or. or data missing pasture every six in this case. So. I get the idea that there's
    no deaths. And haven't been any recent deaths. never been a just for 10 days.
    So. yeah so. I don't know what format, the data is in that. Whether they're they're
    actually our zeros in the data when it's not reported and our elder. Lack of data
    is indicated in the. In the data set. let's click on about the state and see if
    we can. dig into that a little bit. Okay, so if i'm not reading the newspaper
    if i'm using. If i'm using the Web here and i'm trusting Google to give me the
    information. So i'm not sure was gone about. All the information. Because the
    Informations maybe. spread around a few different articles. So this is. So it's.
    This article about the data provides okay via says a change the data changes rapidly
    and may differ by location. So it might not reflect some cases still being a part
    in some areas may not have data, because they haven't published through data or
    haven't done so recently because data built that the difference by location data
    rate date ranges for 14 day data and we start on different dates. So that that
    covers. The issue, but we don't know what the. didn't know what the case is here.
    So what are some other ways to improve this display. That other way, so we might
    say. If there's if there is actually no data. That we get. We don't have a line
    here, maybe don't show anything where that. Because this moving seven day average
    trend line implies that there's data here. When there isn't so that's one possibility.
    What are some other possibilities to. convey to the person looking at this graph
    that there's a problem. Or the deaths might be higher debt deaths in cases, maybe,
    maybe higher. You want to take. Should we do our breakout groups and talk about
    that in groups and do 10 minutes and we'll come back. That sound okay. Okay, so
    breakout rooms are open, so please go into your. breakout rooms, based on your
    classwork groups. We haven't done this a few times so. Good. Okay. Well, I sat
    there for a second there we go. So how is that discussion. Okay, so. Instead of
    having a vague statement about data. There might be data differences in the data.
    If we can have some. some indication about. The data has stopped. So yeah let's
    see. So, my impression is that for the most part. jurisdictions are reporting.
    Daily so. It might be. Confusing to change the display between daily and weekly.
    Okay, so. let's see. You can see the whiteboard now right. You go back to. switch
    back to our course here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: either.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. A comment about the combine the blue and the red combine the active cases
    and deaths on the same plot. i'm just concerned about the scale. So the scale
    of new cases goes up to 1500. And the scale for deaths goes up to. 10 eight. So
    if they were will be hard to read. numbers in the so the highest. This two week
    period was six. reported on. Sunday. Six of February. So that might be the reason
    for keeping them separate. yeah so we can say there's no there's no data after
    this. Is it the same date for both of them. yeah it's the same date for both of
    them. So. So. What can I do with that line. Should we. Should it be stopped.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Let me.
  persid: ???
- desc: get my whiteboard i'll try and do a sketch here. it's not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: neck.
  persid: ???
- desc: So her graph. Imagine music straight lines. looks like this. She stopped the
    line there. or what's another alternative let's see. dotted line. And so the implication
    of having a dotted line that maybe. keeps. The numbers not. To be non zero but.
    continues on with the last average last seven, the average perhaps. That would
    indicate that. problem hasn't gone away. So is it possible. To pseudo for me is
    that sorry for my. poor pronunciation and you can help me. To better job with
    your name. Alright, welcome your help, but anyway. Can you do a select a two week
    period, or you saying that that's what we'd like to be able to select a date range.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, a circle, so you can just call me GT So what is just to forming ready
    okay me, yes, I was just thinking that like if there's a place on the side that
    you can. toggle do weeks, and then, if you pick two more weeks and they know that
    there's no no longer taking the data for the cases it could just be written on
    top of it. That the the range of the time that the previous or the data looking
    at has been taking that this is during, if you like, i'll give more information.
  persid: S02
- desc: To people, so how can use. So it's selecting two weeks, at a time.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah i'm just giving an example of two weeks.
  persid: S02
- desc: Oh, so you if we could have a date range yeah to specify.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay. So what about. What if we looked at manitoba let's see mantle is comparable
    to scotch and a lot of ways. So let's see how they're doing with their numbers.
    Okay, so they're not reporting everyday either. In this case, they missed Saturday,
    they don't report on the weekend. Saturday and Sunday and then Monday gets. is
    higher, because it's accounting for the weekend as well. So that makes sense.
    So what if we. What if we could select a competitor. Here so it's not just decided
    for us but say. Some other Google things like Google trends. The trends right.
    Thinking of the right name for where you could look for. All right. yeah so here's.
    here's what i'm thinking and then there's a way to compare. With. Cut off here
    and sign. It gets a little bit more interest here. let's try mass mandates. So
    i'm not sure. How good those search terms are. We might if we could compare. regions,
    we might compare saskatchewan to. Canada. That might give us some more context,
    so we could. Well, without doing further investigation see. The scattering numbers
    are off or the sketch or numbers are due to an absence of data, instead of. Decreasing
    cases. some thoughts there. So it makes sense and we're kind of out of time here,
    so I apologize for keeping you late. jt is that okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: S02
- desc: Alright, so let's we'll end for today and then. So I have an officer coming
    up in 10 minutes. And also sending us i'll be sending you some details. about
    the proctor track stuff by the end of the week or the end of tomorrow Okay, thank
    you take care stay well.

  persid: S06
- desc: "Yeah, that\u2019d be my first impression if I didn\u2019t know about it."
  persid: S06
- desc: Might be possible they haven't uploaded the data.
  persid: S07
- desc: "But why is that? Why aren\u2019t they providing the data? Just out of curiosity."
  persid: S06
- desc: how do gulfs of execution and evaluation relate to this?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, when the user sees this number then they will probably start looking
    into other articles and sources. Cause the result is not at all what the user
    expected.
  persid: S06
- desc: "The system is not giving proper \u201Cfeedback\u201D that the data is missing\
    \ or incomplete."
  persid: S06
- desc: There should be some indication/notification about not providing data on daily
    basis
  persid: S07
- desc: In the stats.. "Feb 8-14"... should be listed as single unit
  persid: S07
- desc: All the user  in Saskatchewan  have all information about that.they see in
    news ,article,
  persid: S03
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S07
- desc: 'Breakout: What are some ways to improve the context of this graph so that
    citizens might know that there still might be active cases and deaths due to COVID?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Did you have a good discussion?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 1.) There should be some information regarding 'no daily data' when user hover
    on the specific date on the graph.
  persid: S07
- desc: Any ideas to share? Feel free to use the whiteboard :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: 2.) There should be a single unit of dates (of the week)If data will be provided
    by weekly
  persid: S07
- desc: They could put a disclaimer on how to read/use this data. And for details
    they can refer to that page.
  persid: S06
- desc: The graph should be added a blue line for number of active cases and a red
    line for the deaths.
  persid: S09
- desc: Pie chart can be more relevant for this.
  persid: S07
- desc: They can put information that data is no longer being taken. Right on top
    of the grab. e.g The displayed Data was last taken.. 8th feb 2022..
  persid: S10
