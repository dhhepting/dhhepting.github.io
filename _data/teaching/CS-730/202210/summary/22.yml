- desc: hi can you hear my voice now. that's good to good to know. Okay, so. What
    me share my screen. So i'm. let's let's do our attendance first. Anyone happy
    that's the end of March today. I suppose it's already Friday, for some of us.
    Many of you. were taking practical jokes for April fool's day. side of things.
    So what I will say is. would turn. So I noticed that some people. Salter. Thanks,
    so much the posting links, so I would I brought that up here. On my shared screen.
    So any comments on my last post there but. Whether there are some issues with
    the technology and reading the exam. material that. made it difficult to clarify
    some questions I have given you. So i'm looking at the participation forum. And
    I believe that I have it set. incorrectly, from my perspective. So here's a strange
    thing about the forum that I realized from my other class. So it's a subscription
    mode but doesn't indicate which of the subscription modes. is currently in force.
    So there's no feedback, here, about which ones. which ones are active which one
    is active part me. Little little message here about. Aaron is not subscribed.
    doesn't. Do much now there's for subscription. So feedback in an interface is
    useful. But. Even better, if it's feedback that's comprehensible. it's using the
    same terms that we. expect. And we're consistent. So it says everyone's now subscribe,
    going back to that screen. Oh that's the wrong one sorry. subscription mode. Again,
    so there's no indication here. what's that So if I do this. Then it doesn't give
    you the message that everyone's now subscribed. So it must have been that it wasn't
    set up properly begin with. And the other thing is that. Everyone is not subscribed
    doesn't mean doesn't connect with one of those for subscription options either.
    So. Good on many fronts. Was. here. So fair enough to have more theoretical questions.
    So don Norman said two two most important features of good design our discover
    ability and understanding. So discover ability comes to mind when I look at this
    URL for the discussion. I know that some of you are courses because that's the
    first part, and I know it's a forum post. Because that's also. clearly visible,
    but the rest of it i'm not so sure don't know which class I don't know. Anything
    else about it. And said uh. Is that a good way to do things or could it be improved.
    i'll type it out here. So that's interesting comment about that I could change
    the Premier League settings. I don't know that I have that ability, let me check
    if I can. see what I can, what I can do here. see if I can edit settings. Like
    what gives me. moodle documentation. So it seems to be not available. So let me
    spend a couple minutes talking about the assignment. again. So I wanted to. give
    you this meeting page is an example for inspiration for the assignment. Because
    I want you to think about image carousel. And then. So, if you look at this page,
    you can. See there's a number of images here. You can access. Because you in a
    loop. So there are some options are dealing with image carousels. You can explore
    that. So what I. say for the assignment. it's free to use this page as inspiration
    and start with the carousel an add on some other things, if you like, as you're
    able. Using the react bootstrap. The react and node and react bootstrap environment
    that we looked at last week. just finishing up. Revision of the assignment here
    but. over to the call. there's a preliminary version here that i'm working on.
    We can make it. Maybe do after you find other final exam what have you said, maybe.
    16th is Friday, so your exams on Thursday 14. We can say, make it due on Friday,
    the 15th okay so i'll do that. And so the idea is. To doing the APP. The eight
    marks and then doing the report setting up your repository and your github account.
    marks and then. Really. So that others might have a great ux user experience.
    So reflecting on what you went through to do the assignment and then making it.
    smoothing out the rough spots for other people. Your descriptions. So let me change
    that right. Now. help me get to where I want to go. When we duplicate the other
    ones. i'm quite pleased with myself about innovation. took me a long time to.
    Have a design way of doing things that. The links didn't break between semesters.
    it's also Good Friday. So universities closed. Whether that's that's neither here
    nor there. For our purposes. Make sure I hit return. Okay, so. Let me show you
    my screen. Well, that was the answer I talked to them discover ability. and understanding.
    here's the answer here's a bit of tech said inspired the question to most important
    characteristic good designer discover goulding understanding. discover ability
    asks what actions are possible, the product, where and how to perform them understanding
    asks how the products supposed to be used. Okay. But. We can measure usability
    and user experience, even on. That designs. yeah okay so. I would rephrase. That
    question I would say. Why our discover ability and understanding. The two most
    important characteristics of good design according to john Martin. Despite my
    best intentions, I end up with questions. make sense to me that are hard to decipher
    a guarantee exam. So that's an issue of of testing. So I can't really test the
    exam questions with you. Because that would. defeat the purpose of writing the
    exam in some ways. I can test them with other people, and I can. it's it's weighing.
    issues about designing interfaces we can't. We. can't take on the role of the
    user as a designer because we understand. things about the design the user may
    not. So that makes sense. Anyway, so just to finish the thought about usability
    user experience so. Even that designs of. You can rate, we can rate the usability
    and user experience. Of that design so it's not just. One just characteristics
    of a good design. The characteristics of design. Users will be able to use it
    to some degree on their have some kind of user experience. That makes sense. Okay
    anything else, before we go see what I see ran out of time.

    almost finished marking it.'
  persid: DHH
- desc: That is not a good answer :-(
  persid: DHH
- desc: What I will say is that the midterm is formative feedback for you (just as
    I asked you for formative feedback about my teaching). If you do not receive the
    mark you would have liked, there is still the opportunity to do well on the final
    exam and with that to do well in the course!
  persid: DHH
- desc: and what is the date of final exam sir?
  persid: S09
- desc: Thanks for that question. The exam has been confirmed to be on April 19 @
    9am - noon CST (online in UR Courses with proctortrack)
  persid: DHH

  persid: S06
- desc: Yes Thank you sir
  persid: S09
- desc: I noticed that some people left questions unanswered on the midterm - was
    that a result of being unable to ask me questions during the exam or other problems
    with the technology?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Any other comments or concerns about writing the midterm?
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Things to be aware of \u2014 or change \u2014 for the final?"
  persid: DHH
- desc: When is your other exam?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 14th April
  persid: S05
- desc: "I didn\u2019t notice the marks assigned for each questions. If I had seen\
    \ it during the exam, I could have prepared my answers better. Also experienced\
    \ some issues as I was using the dark theme. So next time I am not taking any\
    \ chances. Switched back to the light one."
  persid: S06

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: S02

  persid: S01

  persid: DHH

  persid: S04

  persid: DHH
- desc: review session
  persid: S04
- desc: And what about feedforward (Norman)? :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: Do we have to read chapter 2 for our final exam? We skipped that one for the
    mid.
  persid: S06
- desc: Yes and also are we expecting anything on bootstrap and the likes?
  persid: S02
- desc: "Yes\u2026 I will give you a list of sources before Tuesday."
  persid: DHH
- desc: yes, it would be great if we know what can we expect for final exam
  persid: S05
- desc: That would be great, thank you
  persid: S02
- desc: 'Bootstrap: in the assignment, not so much on the exam I would say. Perhaps
    something in general about the benefits of responsive design?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Again, I would like to engage you in shaping the final exam so that it is\
    \ a fair assessment of what we\u2019ve done over the semester."
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir! our exam should have more theoretical questions. Because if it would
    not be there then, it has more chances to hit wrong button in MCQs
  persid: S07
- desc: "Fair enough to have theoretical questions. I challenge you to each write\
    \ a question (with an answer) that would be an example of a fair evaluation of\
    \ the material we\u2019ve covered and what we\u2019ve learned over the semester\
    \ :-) OK?"

  persid: S06
- desc: The link to the post that I just posted is clearly for a forum post on UR
    Courses - is anything else discoverable about it from the link? What else might
    be beneficial for users deciding whether to click on it?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe change the permalink settings and include the title
  persid: S06
- desc: "I am not sure if it\u2019s available on Moodle"
  persid: S06

  persid: S06

  persid: S09
- desc: "What are the 2 most important characteristics of good design? \u2014 It\u2019\
    s one of questions from our mid term. Could you please tell me what\u2019s the\
    \ correct answer? I didn\u2019t get it right."
  persid: S06

  persid: S06

  persid: S05
