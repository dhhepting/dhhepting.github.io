- desc: Good day. So, today I went to a vending machine together drink. And enough,
    is a feature of bug but. The bottle came out and it was warm to the touch. I don't
    know if that's a selling point. Warm soft drinks. dispensed here. that's why they
    charge extra for that I guess. Hello everyone how are you today. Oh, thank you,
    I got this in Hawaii some years ago. i'd like to go back and get another one I
    guess. Oh, not just through the. Election to go back the shirt is but another
    matter. anyway. Post a picture. Okay. I was looking how long i've. been. posting
    just around Ben. Ben. So I did take a picture of the machine, because it has a
    phone number i'm going to call and ask her my. money back or equivalent thereof.
    But that's not. me that's not part of the interface, so I guess it is part the
    interface. in the sense that it's. Whether it's easy to get a. satisfactory response
    by calling them here all. I will share my. picture of the. phone number for service.
    And sale quickly, I can do this. it's our meeting 16 today so. going to. look
    to adjust the size here the picture. And I will put it on. i'm just going to give
    you a sharing link to this picture. share this with us. see that either the shared
    screen or by clicking on the link that I posted in chat. Okay, so Karen. Please
    not send me direct messages, so that was an issue earlier. So don't get stuck.
    between us. anyway. Let me try a full year. Oh. I should share with you something
    else about. The event coming up. So add another choice based on that. So I have
    a poll open, if you want to reply to that. Please. we're gonna get some more participation
    here i'll give another 30 seconds. Okay, one more person. seemed like everybody.
    Okay i'll end up. So. Much more than happy to certainly more than half, you are
    about after you are very cynical. And then. The ones, you said of Mandela people.
    They have a positive outlook. Once he said discouraged, I think, have a slightly
    negative outlook, but then the ones that are saying it's just about the company.
    You have a more cynical view. But how can something like that be made easier.
    By come up there, so the other experience that I had. To try to use my credit
    card, so I tapped it and it seemed to work. I used to I used my apple pay on my
    phone. And as far as apple pay was concerned, it was happy. Then the vending machine
    said. Try another card. And I thought this would be. i've had that problem before
    and I thought, maybe it would be fixed by now. Anyway, so I happen to have some
    change my block so. I use coins. So I typed and. Excuse me, they were very few.
    I would like to get I want to get a coke. But I got a coke zero instead because
    there weren't any coke machine. So I typed in the number 25. that's what I believe
    I typed them and he gave me a bottle from number 26 these are just different spots
    and machine. So I was upset about that. Well, I noticed it anyway, I wasn't saying
    I was upset by it. But then when it came out, it was what it felt most we want
    to my touch, then I took a picture of the screen of the of that sign. need to
    call them later. So. Report on my experience calling that number. Where some.
    In this age of. Mobile phones and Internet connectivity. What might be some approaches
    that we could use to. Make it so smart more clearly. helpful to people so. My
    feeling is that most people would say yeah. i'm not going I can't be bothered
    to call them. and say that happens, a lot, but what. What could make. Calling
    the. The support number or the contacting the company, we can make that easier.
    Here, let me get on our whiteboard going to share whiteboard here. So should we
    do a breakout room breakout rooms for this. i'll say yes let's give it a try for
    10 minutes and see what we come up with for ideas okay. we're gonna see ideas,
    but what are the issues involved and. Why am I not be a good idea. is not a great
    idea to make it so accessible that everybody would complain and try and get something.
    From the company, but. anyway. i'll start up our breakout rooms here and we'll
    come back in 10 minutes okay. So verse 14 have you. let's try now do you want
    to do two or three breakout rooms. let's do three. And you can assign yourselves
    to them. Okay. And i'll. allow you to share your screen. So I clicked on the link.
    Does that work for you this dropbox link. Anyway, by the time I got to share I
    just thought i'd share the the image being application, the preview window here.
    Excuse me. So I was going to have an 830 class on Tuesdays and Thursdays as well.
    And I was leaving my house so just before eight. and we've had so much snow this
    year it's more than. Like it's more than we've had since i've been back in Regina
    so I I was born and raised here. And I left for about 10 years. And then I came
    back. Just over 20 years ago anyway, so I think we've had. No snow. In that 20
    years so. When I was shoveling the driveway. I didn't shovel. The whole drag out
    fight. Like. The snowbank was encroaching on the driveway little bit. Anyway,
    so and I backed out this morning. I was. jumping into the snowbank and I got hung
    up on it snow drift and. It took me a. Good 10 minutes of. exercise to get myself
    out of there. So I got my Cardio exercise for the day I guess. And I was a little
    bit late for class. Anyway, that's why I need some extra thing. anyway. So. What
    came out of the discussions. So let me go back to our whiteboard and then invite
    you to. annotate here if you'd like. You get this way. Okay, so. If we have buttons
    on. Excuse me. If you have buttons on the vending machine. So. If I want to. try
    and get. A coupon. or a gift card or something out of them for my warm coke zero.
    I need to have a way to. share my share some of my information with them so maybe
    that's more do you think that might be more difficult if. there's a but a contact
    button on. On the vending machine. So buttons might be good. to indicate. That
    something happened. But if there's no way for people to be rewarded for reporting
    on their experience with the machine. You think they might be less likely to.
    give an honest report. And maybe. The people there might be people who. were happy
    with. The drink they got. didn't have any issues with the credit card and the
    shoes. With. The drink they wanted to consume being in stock and it not being
    warm. All those things, so they could pay for it. And they were happy with everything.
    That saved those people what were some of those people who. want. to stir things
    up a little bit make a little trouble so they might. press the complete button.
    I think I finished my thought I was looking at the next comment about. yeah so
    if there's a button money machine anyway, I guess. So. For just letting people.
    Report, their experience with the machine and the troublemakers want to. Make
    trouble they might. Say that there's something wrong with the machine and there
    isn't really a problem. yeah okay so time. Time is important. We don't have time
    to complete the process. like to be able to. handle it later on. So this is why
    I took the picture of the label. so that I could call them later today and. ask
    why. New vending machines are heating. seemed like they were heating. The contents
    of the vending machine. So I just noticed the 10 written on the. upper left corner
    of the. coke Coca Cola label. Do you think that's significant. Are there other
    to the other machines on campus. Of the same equipment number. But maybe. A nine
    or 11 or. or. I don't know how many there are in campus. Oh, excuse me please.
    Warm coke service a poor substitute coffee. yeah so. I was thinking about qr codes
    as well. yeah I. Think location of the machines are important, so if they're just
    in public people might not take the time to report, or they might. Try and abuse
    the system. today. Maybe that's true most days. receipts. Take care.

    that I used. I will do that before next meeting.

  persid: S09
- desc: "It is completely unintentional that I have started with \u201COR DEATH\u201D\
    \ at the top of the image!"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "\U0001F603"
  persid: S03
- desc: Do you think that this sign is meant to help people to report or discourage
    them?
  persid: DHH
- desc: "It's not for helping people but helping company for not losing any products\
    \ without making benifit. (my POV) \U0001F62C"
  persid: S05
- desc: They just want to discourage only those who wants to take it for free of cost..
  persid: S05
- desc: yes sir
  persid: S05
- desc: Contact the company for restocking is that the question?
  persid: S10
- desc: to express concerns - in my case the warm bottle of coke zero
  persid: DHH
- desc: How was that?
  persid: DHH
- desc: sir can we have that picture again . I want to see
  persid: S11
- desc: does the dropbox link that I posted earlier today work for you?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes sir
  persid: S05
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S06
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S10
- desc: I was also able to save that picture
  persid: S05
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S08
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S02
- desc: 'There could be some buttons that represent issues that users face frequently.
    E.g. 1: Drinks are not chilled 2: Broken Candy Bar etc. Users will only press
    these buttons and it will then inform the company.'
  persid: S10
- desc: Any ideas? about calling the phone number? About sharing the asset number?
  persid: DHH
- desc: It is difficult to call and register any queries if the person is running
    out of time. A feedback button should be there... by which we can put our queries
    on that interface without calling anywhere
  persid: S05
- desc: Feedbacks/complaint button
  persid: S05
- desc: The machine could have a label with a QR code that contains a link to a webpage
    to report.
  persid: S01
- desc: I also think where these machines are installed matter. For instance if it's
    in front of a workplace or inside a campus, people might feel inclined to inform
    the company. But if these are in public places such as airport people may not
    feel inclined to report as there's a chance they are not going to use it again
    anytime soon.
  persid: S10
- desc: QR code can save a lot of time and it can be taken within a few seconds.
  persid: S05
- desc: "Is it feasible to put a QR code on the machine\u2026"
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think the QR code is a good way of giving feedback
  persid: S03
- desc: QR will have more % of feedback than giving them a call I think
  persid: S00
- desc: "that encodes the website and the asset #? Maybe the QR code be labelled as\
    \ \u201CFeedback\u201D and scanning the QR code\u2026"
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think yes .It is a best way
  persid: S02
- desc: Yes, the QR code clearly signifying its for feedback
  persid: S03
- desc: will populate a form about their experience and maybe a link to a phone number?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Everytime a new QR code should be generated in which the performed operation
    should be mentioned (automatically). So it will be easy for the customer/user
    to identify and after that providing some feedback with minimum input values .
    i.e what do you want from us.
  persid: S05
- desc: And scan of course. To the website where very short and precise questions
    are asked.
  persid: S03
- desc: I think this 10 has significance. It probably means the 10th machine in that
    area. So it's easier for the people who maintains or restocks these machines to
    simply refer by these numbers instead of those long hardware serial number.
  persid: S10
- desc: Because very less number of people can guess the exact time when they use
    the machine.
  persid: S05
- desc: I will have a look at other labels on campus :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'True'
  persid: S03
- desc: yus sir
  persid: S11
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S02
- desc: 'It''s easy to call a machine #10 instead of  #RY69696162****'
  persid: S05
- desc: Do you get a receipt when you use these vending machines?
  persid: S10
- desc: Totally agree
  persid: S03
- desc: is attendance done  ?
  persid: S11
- desc: Not sure, never used one. But I will make sure to use one this week soon
  persid: S03
- desc: '*This week'
  persid: S03
- desc: "Do we need to have the QR code regenerated (on a screen)? Or a static label\
    \ is sufficient? My Costco app seems to generate the QR code that it provides\
    \ for my membership a few times while it is open\u2026"
  persid: DHH
- desc: No receipt
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't remember getting a receipt. Don't know how's it in Canada.
  persid: S10
- desc: A static label is sufficient
  persid: S01
- desc: Scanning a QR code could capture the time of the scan for later reference
    (?)
  persid: DHH
- desc: '**By the static label the product information will not be there like units,
    price and time.'
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes, aside time it could also capture the reference or machine number
  persid: S03
- desc: Machine number and other information can be encoded in the QR code
  persid: S01
- desc: Or they can provide some drop-down after scanning QR code to identify our
    product. but QR code should be unique on every dispensing/vending machine
  persid: S05
- desc: Because then it would have been easier to generate an unique QR code for each
    purchase. And people could've scan and submit the report in their free time.
  persid: S10
- desc: But since there's no receipt, i think the QR code screen will have to do.
  persid: S10
- desc: "But I would say that if the code is scanned in close proximity to the vending\
    \ transaction, that report associated wth the scan could be cross referenced with\
    \ the logs from the vending machine\u2026"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "That\u2019s an interesting idea"
  persid: DHH
- desc: But the problem with this form of feedback is that, people mostly participate
    only when they're extremely happy or unhappy with a purchase. So i think most
    issues will never be reported.
  persid: S10
- desc: It should be dedicated for the customers who are extremely unhappy.
  persid: S05
- desc: (generate a new QR code per vending transaction)
  persid: DHH
- desc: Only then, they will report some issues that can be fixed or resolved.
  persid: S05
- desc: "Interesting discussion! I started this with the idea of talking about accessibility\u2026\
    \ we\u2019ll look at that in more depth next meeting. Have a great weekend!"
  persid: DHH
- desc: attendance  for today
  persid: S11
- desc: Take care!  You have another 13 minutes to use password
  persid: DHH
- desc: Any last thoughts
  persid: DHH
