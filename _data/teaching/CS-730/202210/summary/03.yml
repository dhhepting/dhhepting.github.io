- desc: Hello everyone. How are you doing today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Very well, thank you, how are you.
  persid: S01
- desc: Well i'm glad to hear that you're doing very well i'm doing all right, thank
    you. So we talked yesterday. And the Faculty of science at the university here.
    I bought I return to face to face learning. I mean our classes. was meant to be
    online. Regardless but we're now. we've announced the President has announced
    that everyone will come back to campus and March 1. and possibly some classes
    may return to face to face learning. one February seven. So march 1 is the. Week
    after our reading week or break. and So February 7 would. mean. For me, because
    i'm teaching another class Tuesdays and Thursdays. For in person. meetings before
    the break. So we're having discussions about. To return on February seven. or
    on march 1. So that's what's been going on here. So. Let me show you my website
    here again. So explain the issue that i'm having. So i'm using bootstrap. Sorry,
    I was getting a phone call there. heard that doesn't. So i'm using bootstrap,
    which is a mobile first. approach to website design, so that. that's using media
    queries. And so on to. create a. pleasant experience with the website, regardless
    of which device you're whether you're on a small for smartphone. or a tablet or
    a desktop. So i've been working on the teaching. material. And I. have made some
    progress on. updating it, but what I noticed was. That wasn't. There is change
    that I was making and I first attributed it to. A problem with the browser or.
    I was looking at it as a problem with the browser. On my iPhone because things
    weren't working just the way that I wanted. But then I realized that the CSS the
    cascading style sheet. file, where I had made my changes was not being updated
    on. My public website. So I made that change. And I was pleasantly surprised.
    So that introduced another issue because. The going from bootstrap for to bootstrap
    five. is broken. My homepage menu. So illustrates so here I am. With the navigation
    menu. stretched out expanded. And then, as I go. To a smaller size so it's past
    the. Small break point. So there's a breakpoint set there so smaller within that
    I get the toggle. icon. And if it's larger than that with that I get the menu.
    So this works. But now, this doesn't work. So. that's where i'm at today, so if
    you're accessing my website on the mobile on a mobile platform, and you have that
    toggle or. icon and it's not work. You may not be able to get past. The main page.
    So i'm hopeful that i'll get that sorted out today. But if you go to. An interior
    page.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: Then should all be good. Okay. So this is. I wanted to show.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The way.
  persid: ???
- desc: I want to show the results of me. debugging. This display so. As you go through.
    The page then. You can navigate by clicking on. One of the tabs at the top. So
    the idea is now. You can scroll through the page and so you have the header That
    gives you the. headings. And you can click on them to navigate to that anchor
    location. You see, at the bottom. A note about when the site was built so. Everything
    is contained in. In the display see you have a navigation top.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: You can see that window is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: ???
- desc: Maybe finesse us a bit more so that. You see, the whole thing right now it's
    got a little maybe it's still a little bit too big. So there we go. that's what
    i'm. So i've been up to so. And the reason i'm having. additional difficulties.
    deploying this site is because. The travis ci. process that was using. is not
    available to me anymore. Unless I pay some money i'm disinclined to do that. So
    i'm. Working on getting things set up so that. I can use a different tool. But
    in the meantime. I don't have any protection against me. doing the wrong thing.
    So. Alright, so let's do our attendance. We can stretch this out of bed again.
    Okay i'm. just looking at the comment in the chat so let's address that next.
    Okay, so to go through the comments so cached on the browser you know I tried,
    I did a reload or hard restart reload. So i'm getting the latest, the latest version
    of the site. Excuse me. You know. So I tried that now. Let me see what. This link
    does. So I clicked on the link. And it seemed to work for me, so this is. So in
    order. The approach i've taken with your courses or moodle. If any of you had
    experience with moodle before.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK.
  persid: ???
- desc: So my approach to using. moodle, so I think it's good for many things. So
    my. My effort is to keep. The content that I have about assignments. about other
    things so assignment descriptions I keep on my website so i'm not updating it.
    Constantly they're not constantly but, so I don't have to edit. The web page and
    keep track of. version that I have. So I have a little script on my webpage. So
    does. The link that I have for my. My website has an argument that says current
    at the end. And so. What happens is it goes to the main page for the course 730.
    And then it does a little check to see that. 730 is being offered this semester,
    and then it. switches the. changes the address in the URL. To go to. The fully
    qualified name for the offering. That makes sense. So I neglected to upload the
    transcript of our session, but here are their responses from you. So. The most
    important thing that I learned. i'm not sure about the wording of that type of
    response. The most important thing. Or how would you like, the most important
    thing that I discussed. or what's a better way to phrase that. i'm wary of. Saying
    that we learn. Particular things when. They can't put in discussion and. So the
    discussions are a good start. For learning about these topics. But I don't want.
    To say that you know we've covered. The whole topic. In our brief discussion so.
    I would appreciate your feedback about labels they use for the different types
    of responses. Okay. So, in the first comment I learned in the breakout session.
    So good interfaces are good yeah good interfaces. Are are smooth. easy to use,
    have a good user experience. color flow interaction with the application must
    be seamless to the user. Okay, so what. Can we maybe distinguish between ease
    of use and user experience. and Another term might be usability so what's the
    relationship. Between usability and user experience. Anyone want to. turn on your
    MIC and have a go with that one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And I want to believe that usability is part of user experience, like a good
    user experience so if it's efficient to use easy to learn and safe to use, for
    example, then the user experience. is good Oh, I see.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah, so I think there's their.
  persid: DHH
- desc: relationship, but they're.
  persid: S01
- desc: not exactly the same. So a on in the chat said. usability is functional and
    user experience. Now, how comfortable, it is for the user to. Use the interface,
    well, we might also say that. User experience is more. emotional. Maybe less objective.
    And designers when we design an interface we can't. force a particular user experience
    on a person. You know they will be. User will be happy when they use my interface.
    Or maybe they will be sad. I don't think that's not a design goal to make people
    sad using an interface. um. So user experiences about having. may be about having
    fun. If you think about something that's usable. It might be boring. So there's
    a video. At 10 by don Norman it talks about. These kinds of issues so i'll put
    that in our. plan for next meeting. yeah so something can be usable. good night
    have a great user experience. So we might distinguish. Between the kinds of. activities
    we can accomplish with an interface. So we may. start out. With an activity that
    we can accomplish and activities so that may we may talk about the activity being.
    Effective. Though we can accomplish it. But it may not be easy or may not. make
    us happy to do it, you frustrating.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But.
  persid: ???
- desc: We know that it's you can find we can locate the capability to do this and.
    and get through it. So a level up from that might be comprehensible, so that things
    are put together in a way that. Maybe requires a bit of thoughts, though, but.
    The pieces fit together in a way that. allows us to make correct predictions about
    how to access new commands. and so forth. And then, a higher level still be sending
    that satisfying you know, so that we don't. We don't end up with. getting out
    of our tasks are the thing we want to accomplish. It just makes sense. And so.
    we're allowed to stay in. A very tight loop of issue commands any feedback and.
    What seems to be the right thing to do, works. We can accomplish. Our task very
    quickly. And without. Sir thinking about. Now I have to do this with the computer
    and so on, you just. Doing. The US you're just doing the task. So one way to.
    Think about satisfying activities is that there's a very small very tiny distance
    from. Between the user and the computer server conceptual distance. comment in
    the chat. let's pick it up in a minute. So you can think of. conceptually there
    being a distance between the user and the interface. So. If the activity is satisfying.
    You have a very tiny gap. But if the activity is not satisfying it's difficult
    to understand how to accomplish the goals that we have it's difficult to understand.
    The state of the system after we execute a command. So we can think. More of these.
    tiny got. as being rather large golf so we go from the when the user issues a
    command. We can say there's maybe a big golf of execution. and In terms of looking
    at the state of the system after command is executed. and not being able to. identify.
    What happened with the commands we executed. That leaves us with a golf of evaluation
    so it's hard for us to evaluate the current state of the system. So we'll talk
    about those ideas. Some more over the. semester. So how is the.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Let me go back to a comment. sponsor navigation could be an example. Have
    a good user experience so. When it's working. And then it can be very much the
    case so. But. You can't see it that's going to lead to a good user experience.
    We might say that it responsive design. encourages a good user experience. So
    is that. distinction subtle or or too subtle. So, think about when you're on when
    you go to access a website on your phone. and uses respond it's a responsive website
    so on the phone. You have things that are properly sized. they're not too close
    together, so your fingers don't hit the wrong button. Compare that with going
    to. A destination website that's not responsive and so what happens when you go
    with the URL. You see everything and very tiny type, so the desktop site is. presented
    to you. In a very unfriendly way. Any thoughts about that. So how are things going
    with the wiki so notice.
  persid: DHH
- desc: cheers.
  persid: ???
- desc: That I appreciate about. appreciates the right word. So i'm. The thought is
    nice that we have. A table of contents. But it seems to be. Not a very reliable
    table of contents that gets generated. And there's very little documentation about
    it so. If I wanted to understand. How do you include a table of contents or how
    to. change it. there's very little support for that. So I would encourage classwork
    group one. To maybe add a bit more detail to the. To. Your notes about our first
    meeting. And then for last days meeting. If a bit more detail. So my if I talked
    about the usability of the wiki. Or the my my sense of using the wiki. I would
    say that maybe it's comprehensible. it's not quite satisfying. Anyway, so I encourage.
    You keep working with the wiki and we'll. get a better handle on things as we
    go along semester. What do you have any feelings about. Using the ricky. So let's
    do some edits here i'll show you. What the what the editing interface looks like.
    So here we're editing the page for today's meeting, so the arrow the top left.
    is about showing some more. items. So you don't have to worry about writing html.
    So much. sort of back to news, you can say up. Okay today see. Now you can see,
    navigation is. So i'm. So what I can observe here is. i'm not sure how to get
    a table of contents out of this. Because I think. My feeling is that are getting
    table contents, based on the headings. Maybe a few revisit. The page. No. So.
    that's the wiki. So we're in our third meeting today. If you're in group three
    today, I encourage you to take the lead on editing but you don't have to be in
    that group to add some comments. Some content to the page. And we can think about.
    Whenever we do something. How easy or difficult is. let's see. Well, how easy
    or difficult it is to accomplish a task without. Having to. take a step back.
    From the task and. and consider. What it is you're doing and what needs to be
    done, and so forth, so. Has anyone used to hammer and a nail. hammer to hit a
    nail into some wood to build something. So as an example. when things are going
    well and. you're in the zone, so to speak. You just you're you're building something
    building a box, whatever it is. and things are going great. Until the point when
    you hit your thumb instead of the nail. And then. you're taken right out of the
    task which you call wish trying to accomplish. You know, no longer building something
    you're. swearing at the hammer or the nail or the piece of wood. And so, when.
    We experience an interface that doesn't. keep us in it in the experience of the
    task. it's like hitting our thumb think hitting. hitting once thumb. With a hammer
    and. being very clear that we're. have to be very deliberate and careful with
    our use of the tool. So make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: In.
  persid: S01
- desc: Z anyone have. Other examples of that idea. That come to mind. So this isn't
    on your courses yet. But I neglected to talk about the other day. And then i'll
    i'll put a link into your courses. So here's a list of the reference materials.
    So the textbook. which has its own website. So look at the first six chapters.
    it's. Good investment. Because you will be. Making use of that text. In in 731
    and 732. So Donald Norman the design of everything everyday things. it's a very
    nice book. and elaborate and some of the ideas that will talk about. and seeing
    videos. So. there's a. open. psychology edition psychology reference. The link
    there. And then there's from the interaction interaction design foundation, the
    encyclopedia of H ci. So there are some chapters that we use from there also.
    So. A breakdown. For evaluation is. There be assignments with 25%. midterm exam
    there'll be 15%. A final exam will be half. The final grade and 10% for participation
    and engagement. So any thoughts, so I included a link. interaction design. chapter
    in the encyclopedia. So. On this topic, I wanted to. share with you some quotes.
    So here, the first one is a quote from. JCR lickliter. Who is head of the Defense
    advanced research project agency in the 1960s. And that's. that's agency that
    was funding a lot of basic research that help develop the Internet, for example.
    But he says insurance seems worthwhile to avoid arguments with other enthusiasts
    for artificial intelligence. By conceding dominance in the distant future, a celebration
    to machines alone. There will, nevertheless, nevertheless, be a fairly long interim
    during which the intellectual advances will be made by people and computers working
    together and intimate association. A multidisciplinary study group. Examining
    future research and development problems of the United States air force. estimated
    that it would be 1980 before developments in artificial intelligence. will make
    it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving a military
    significance. So that would leave say five years to develop a human computer symbiosis
    and 15 years to use it. The 15 maybe 10 or 500 but those years should be intellectually,
    the most creative and exciting history of mankind. So That to me is a reason.
    motivation to. Think about interaction design and human computer interaction.
    So this next quote is by john mere who's. who founded the Sierra club which was
    an environmental. Well sinking Sierra club is active today. Dealing with environmental
    issues. there's a better way to describe it than that but. that's what I have,
    for now, when we try to pick out anything by itself, we find a hitch to everything
    else in the universe. So. The takeaway from That to me is. That we can't abstract
    things too far. away from the context which makes things. relevant to us. The
    situation in which we find ourselves trying to accomplish a task. or. interact
    with something. is certainly an important factor. So this is. A popular. And well
    respected author who's no longer with us give a commencement speech in 2005. And
    then he wrote a book about it. called this as water Douglas pardon me David foster
    wallace is the author's name. So these two young fish. There are these two young
    fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way.
    The old aficionados at them and says morning boys how's the water. To yesh two
    young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at the
    other end goes what the hell is water. So. The reason for that inspirational quote
    is. that there may be things. around us that we just accept as part of. Our surroundings,
    we don't. We don't see them. We don't see them. As. on their own, I guess. So
    you might just make assumptions. And not. Look at the details. So I encourage
    you to look at the details about. When we're in the situation of designing interfaces.
    And the last one I want to. bring up for you is a quote from Steve Jobs. And I
    think 1995. and Steve sangu so when you grew up you tend to get told the world
    is the way it is in your life is just to live your life inside the world. try
    not to bash into the walls too much try to have a nice family have fun save a
    little money that's a very limited life life could be much broader once you discover
    one simple fact. Everything around you that you call life was made up by people
    that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it and
    you can build your own things other people can use once you learn once you learn
    that you'll never be the same again. So. That ties into this design involves changing
    situations by shaping and deploying artifacts. For one thing. So you're still
    with me. We might just have a peek at. The Chapter one. resources. So let's test
    okay not bad. So. It has a responsive design. may feel feeling is that some of
    this text is a little bit. On the small side. So just noticing there. The breadcrumbs
    about introduction.
  persid: DHH
- desc: See the screen.
  persid: S03
- desc: Oh. i'm sorry. So my observation here was so we have the breadcrumb home resources
    Chapter one introduction. If we go back to Chapter one. it's the same. To same
    place that we started that. And so the link. download the overheads for Chapter
    one as a PowerPoint. can think about whether. expect. The download. The word download
    to be. The link. and none of these other. words that may be. grab our attention,
    a little more quickly. So i'd like to encourage you to think critically about.
    The interfaces you encounter. and run out of time for today. I appreciate. your
    attendance today. Thank you, thank you for today and we'll see you on Thursday.
    And i'll. Get the transcripts uploaded. And we'll have. A response activity. right
    away, and if you'd like to talk to me. When officer starts in about 13 minutes
    or 15 minutes some somewhere in there. So I look forward. to seeing you Thursday
    and take care, have a great day. See you later.
