- desc: how's everyone today. Hello. Let me check the temperature. let's see by. 5pm
    about four hours it's supposed to be six degrees. Right now it's four degrees
    and it feels like too yeah that's Celsius. You still hear me. I was typing away
    and then. locking my input can't type anymore, and I can't see how. it's not working.
    The day when I feel like i'm going to start yelling at the computer. will try
    and. restrain myself. choose to be happy. Now let me finish that thought. Okay.
    So we've got zoom working again. So, as far as i'm concerned here let's go look
    at. i've got a few things open in my browser and. i'll. Post the URLs into the
    chat so you can look at them yourselves. So the first one. Is an update on. saga
    of me trying to correct. The data. discussion regarding cogan cases new cases
    and deaths. So. i'm making progress i've been making some progress in my understanding.
    So I believe that. Johns Hopkins University who's maintaining this repository
    of covert data. gets saskatchewan data from the public health. agency of Canada,
    and this is the URL we can get the spreadsheet. So I noticed on February six in
    the data. So the SAS column is the one that i've. generated from the reports.
    And P hack column is a public health agency Canada. And then Johns Hopkins University,
    this is the one that's in the repository now. So. The comparison between SAS can
    between columns one and two is. Really. Important. I think so. I thought there
    were some. Errors here, so these numbers. Not so much whether it starts on Saturday
    or Sunday. But the numbers here where there's 24. difference of 24 cases and 25
    cases and 26 cases. So I looked into that and it seems that. The weekly cases
    were not. The weekly cases and deaths were not properly. Added into the cumulative
    totals. So this column to see they asked to start the same. The end. The the verge
    of that. So what I notice. Is that. columns two and three start the same and the
    end the same. So the problem is really between February 19th. And march 3. There
    are differences. So this. Is an older plot but. It really should be a number here
    February 19 and there should be another one. For February 25 and that's there's
    a number there but. The numbers for February 25 should be associated with every
    19th. and so on. So i'm still. Working on that. Yesterday, somebody made a comment.
    That got my hopes up that maybe somebody who's going to review it. So here, then
    I made a comment yesterday. That they don't have to accept my pull request you
    can just use the data directly from the public health agency of Canada. Another
    it's easier, not. Hoping they'll get a reply. So there's that. into your. into
    our chat if you want to look at it again. Okay. So I wanted. To take a bit more
    time to talk. About inclusive design. So this article is from. website ux planet.org
    so. Our focus on design should be designing for everybody. What for people with
    a certain set of. abilities or. capabilities that's sentient same thing, I think.
    Whether it's colorblind this. Something more limiting perhaps potentially more
    limiting. So more and more things are becoming. digitalized. So that has the possibility
    of creating more accessible systems. Because. The digital versions May. Be more
    accessible. And the physical versions. But. it's, not to say that. doesn't require
    some work. So inclusive design. Practices designing products that are accessible
    and usable by as many people as possible. So, in order to design inclusively need
    to develop an understanding. of a situation as many aspects from all different
    and possible perspectives. So. If it's a mobile application. How easy, is it to
    use when. we're doing the the activity. When we're outside moving around being
    global. settings designed the lab may work fine. In control situations, but. We
    also need to consider when the situations are not so controlled when they. When
    the systems are the applications are the products. are being used in the wild,
    so to speak. sharp at all. If you want to look at it. I think it's not it's not
    strictly in our. focus here. And i'm. Not a big fan of the index in this book.
    Because they're just not. Good there's a lot of things that. you're not where
    I think they should be. I don't know what something changed on my display but.
    anyway. So when you think about. Accessibility in terms of human behavior and
    abilities. So inclusive product. Is usable by as many people as possible. and
    including those with well as many different abilities as possible. So here for
    terms. they're useful in describing how we might approach. Design process so i'm
    going to show you another. Article in a minute. That, I think, has a better. Better
    set of pictures for these. So the first one exclusion so we're excluding. A group
    of people from participation. yeah We might also approach it in terms of segregation
    so. We define. Groups of users and we assign sign users to those groups and then.
    working. With those segregated groups. integration. So we can. Bring users into
    this discussion about. Not using. An interface. And it gets us most of the way
    there, however. Integration is still. Keeping. The notion of another. give you
    a notion that. Different users are being. Integrated so there's still the idea
    of. These other. Humans other people. And being. pride in. So the different still
    I think somewhat. noticeable. And then. inclusion is the approach where we're
    not distinguishing. People. we're not looking at membership in groups were just
    looking at here people and. All people are welcome to use the system, the product,
    the interface. So understanding how it's being used and where people are being
    excluded from being. from using the interface. And the more, the more we can engage
    people from. different communities in the design process.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If.
  persid: ???
- desc: If designers. People who coming designers. Also, have these different abilities.
    than our the products that we create and. give to the public to. support their
    work. there'll be much better suited to a much wider audience because. we've included.
    people and their perspectives. and wide range of. ability, with the wide range
    of abilities. So I think. that's another way to think about that is. If we. support.
    In. The inclusive design. That helps. People who have different abilities than
    ourselves. Land up with a better product. And we won't. One day, find ourselves
    where we'll be less likely to find ourselves excluded from using a product. So
    that makes sense. So that's. me. An article. Here is one better picture. it's.
    About accessible tourism. from Spain. Yes. So here we can see in the top left
    exclusion. Men and women are in in the core group inside this box and outside
    are. Other men and women. With canes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So let's get back to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The.
  persid: ???
- desc: The distinctions between these four. So exclusion. there's definitely people
    on the outside and people on the inside. If we talk about segregation, we have
    the people, the preferred people on the inside, and we make a new group for the
    people on the outside. Then integration. Inside the one inside the one box. We
    have. Two people on the one hand, but then. we're creating a separate. area within.
    The one big box for people who. may have different abilities. So we're working
    to include everybody. But we're still making the distinction. Between regular
    users and special users. So. The most powerful approach in our design, then. is
    to think about exclude pardon me the opposite of exclusion, think about inclusion.
    So we're not. Putting any constraints on WHO. gets included and so. we're treating
    all the people. who have their own particular sets of abilities. Including them
    all, as users. So that's a good. philosophy, to maintain here or to espouse. But
    then, how do we do that in practice. Any thoughts about that. So we might. include
    support for screen readers. So let me I didn't think to do this before let's look
    for a screen reader. let's add it to chrome. So the other day when we looked at
    the bootstrap accessibility page. It. recommended some tools by deck I believe.
    And what was interesting. The page that said. i'd successfully installed those
    tools. That. When testing that page it came up with a few errors. In terms of.
    Ways of. Page could be improved for accessibility. let's add the screen reader.
    To go. here. Grumbach spoken feedback is right well there's no. window screen.
    New tab tab. New tab. search Google or type of URL combo box. homepage D H outing
    PhD nine items home current internal link list item about language item projects
    like list item research leg list item teaching like list item rss link list item
    search link list item news like list item and travel like this time. wasn't too
    bad. PhD mo at Simon fraser university heading five. d H Captain heading one.
    BSC ponds bullet University of Regina heading five. So positive is that it says
    region. But it. doesn't pronounce it very well. So I i'm a bit curious about.
    How to improve the. The text. Or what it chooses to read to me or to somebody
    else. Accessible rich Internet applications, why are you 1.2 tab okay i'm gonna
    turn this off. try again. extensions. banner search screen reader details page
    back about it. yeah. So, if we look, this is documentation for web accessibility
    initiative. Accessible rich Internet applications.
  persid: DHH
- desc: 1.2.
  persid: ???
- desc: So this is. What i'm looking at here is the breadcrumb example so let's. click
    on that. So. Right match with the URL that we have. So here's a breadcrumb example.
    The bread crumb isn't a match with the URL. So let's. i'm curious if we get this.
    This, to me, is a little. Using. Okay. let's go back to the breadcrumb design
    exam. note about the use of this example let's check that out. A robust accessibility,
    can you further optimize by choosing implementation patterns and maximize the
    use of semantic html. And healing the warning that know aria. it's better than
    that are you. let's see what. comes up here. So the readme was updated when nine
    months ago. But you're naked let's see. So, since June. of last year. Oh so. No.
    June 20 the readme was updated in June of 2021. Okay. So i'm here isn't. Quite
    right. I would say. let's look at the code code pen. not sure how to navigate
    back to. walk again. So. we're describing it as a brand. So they make a comment
    here. gina display technique that isn't represented in the accessibility trees
    by the screen legal events redundant and potentially distracting verbosity. So.
    The comment about transform. is right here and. i'm not sure why. It needs to
    be done that way. expect that to work. So we have the label. Red crown. And we
    use. Our current. we're showing the current age. So. We can do media queries.
    get some user preference information. So the reason i'm. Showing This is because.
    there's a comment on the bootstrap. documentation bootstrap include support for
    the prefers reduced motion media feature. So. here's a DEMO. way on my MAC I can
    access this. system preferences accessibility display reduce motion. This let
    me. So right now. Reduced motion is. Actually. Just change this super bowl screen.
    Access to accessibility. Like a book for display spine. So here are the different
    display. Applications I can set. reduce pollution. So keep an eye on video clear.
    image screen image. So now you notice. yeah. The decorative animation. is now
    active. And the video is also. Active is not showing a single frame, as it was
    earlier it's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: going.
  persid: ???
- desc: To. annoying. Video looks like from the jaws movies. that's the practical
    aspect of it. So another thing that we can. Look at is localization versus internationalization.
    So to do that. Language cultural other requirements. specific target. So there
    are things. You prefer you do one way here in Canada. and Maybe there's another
    way in the United States. And i'm not sure. How much that. is used in pockets,
    that all. within some some of in Canada, I indicate language on my webpage and
    says. Korean gutsy bash CA. So Canadian English. Yes. quickly here. set this to
    be good until. Two three. To 40 where's the password. Everyone get that. Thank
    you very much for today. hope you have a good weekend. And we'll see you on Tuesday.
    So we'll talk about the midterm I haven't forgotten about that, on Tuesday and.
    assignments as well. Okay, thanks again take care. we'll see you next week.
