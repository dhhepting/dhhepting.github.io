- desc: today. Okay, so i'm going to share my screen. The whole screen. i'm doing
    all right, thanks to happy Tuesday everyone or Wednesday, I guess, depending where
    you are. So we started talking last day about or we're talking more detail about
    the. web accessibility initiative. Accessible rich Internet applications. standards.
    So what i'd like to do is go through an example. How many of you are familiar
    with used react js and node js. Let me make a poll. i've given you four choices
    there. Try to make them somewhat equidistant but. it's really there's not an alternative
    for no definitely not not. Really, not a lot. anyway. There you go, so if you
    can. can answer the question, please. Looking for for more people to answer. No
    wrong answer. Okay i'll give another 30 seconds. So you can get the other two
    people to answer. Okay. almost everybody answered. Some have quite a bit of experience
    and then. Otherwise, no. That seems fair. So I thought we'd go through an example
    of how to get. Get set up with. react yes and no js. We do want things for forget.
    share my screen. Oh, they didn't share the results of the poll either. My bed
    there sorry. OK, so now, you can see, the whole thing. One other thing I wanted
    to share with you is. The link to the video from last week. My friend Ross Mitchell,
    who is. copy what aim for precision health care. there's a YouTube link for that.
    Again, talk so very good explanation of the things he's doing related to. Applying
    Ai for healthcare. So it's probably an hour long. him talking and then. 15 minutes
    for questions at the end. Talk about sitting up react, but let's go through a
    step about. Getting. The chess set up. So how many of you have. Anyone. Little
    windows here. Okay, so. start with I guess. You need to install it then go to
    the website. Sorry just occurred to me it's. about getting that first step done.
    anyway. So i've got mpm is node package manager. And so let's say we've got. That
    installed So if you want to create a. An application react. So i'll put all this
    information in a file. So NPs is that's. That runs a command so there's the script
    to create a react APP. So react is the front end and no jess is the back end.
    So. Together we can get a website running quite quickly here. So i'm calling the.
    The new so i'm doing NP axis i'm going to execute a command to create react APP
    as a script and then react bootstrap APP is a directory that's going to be created
    so inside that directory i'll. put some other stuff and. And we'll. go from there.
    Okay. So it's going to load everything into this directory that it needs to. have
    to run. So. it's called react bootstrap because we're going to use bootstrap for
    the. Mobile first. To us, to create a mobile first. interface. And then we can
    use the aria. Labels or the aria keywords properties. associated with. The different
    user interface elements. To. To create our interface, so this is going to be a
    little bit easier. A little more straightforward than writing. html code and so
    forth. Once again. This directory setup. sure you. know. So if you go visit this
    website yourselves. And you'll see. See the version, for your operating system.
    Okay, so that basic installation is done now. So it created a new react APP in
    this directory that's packages. This is the react. stuff it's needed. So we can
    look at npr audit. see what the issues are. So we can try and fix them just by
    doing fix. can do. X minus force or dash that's force. Before some. OK, so now
    that is it's all installed. scroll back up here to see now we can go back. To
    that directory and type mtn start. it's not quite started yet that's fine. Look.
    login servers running so we can see, we have a web application running on our
    computer so. let's see Mari. Okay, so. here's a reasonable tutorial setting up
    whoa. Okay, so we've got. Great creating the. So now, the next thing is to install
    react bootstrap. Which is. version of the bootstrap. Libraries written in react.
    So we can see things are still. Looking at. Jason. So miserable mcs we're using
    bootstrap by 1.3. react 17. and so forth. These are the scripts. So you say mpm
    start. Writing react scripts start. there's not too much. here. source directory.
    So there's that. let's go back to. web page. Alright, so let's put some. So we
    have header. text. So let's put a button on the page as well. So this way we're
    not. importing the whole. library we're just importing specific. pieces there
    components so we're going to use the button so important button from react bootstrap
    button.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: ???
- desc: it's. If you hover over it styling changes, a little bit. So, how does that
    seem. feel like I. didn't quit. anyway. having trouble getting to my chat window.
    So, since. Thursday I will i've had some problems with my MAC book. So I upgraded
    the operating system. It seems to have helped. But i'm still having some strange
    behavior. So that's put me behind on the things I wanted to do. Like. Like the
    exam marks. and so on. So my apologies there. This is one example of a problem,
    having is not getting the focus. just getting beeps. Okay. So we'll get that sorted
    out. So I think that's working. better than. My access to the chat window and
    zoom. So the idea with the lts is. Get the long term support long term stability.
    version. Little little bit behind. recurring so we're at 17.8 for the current.
    With the 16 point 14.2 is. Very that'll be supported over time. I really wish
    I could take them Swindon. Okay. how's this for. people other than a on. So. I
    guess my answer to the question was never used an end vm no burn version management.
    I didn't think so, but. Looking at the active path. seems like I have. Those are
    wise words. I feel like. very useful program would be not just sure node in mpm.
    throw or mpm. For. Other environments for Python Ruby. I feel like I have more
    than one. one set of. binaries installed and. that's not helping my computer run
    any better. So I meant to. give you a bit of introduction today to note and react
    js. So. mind. an assignment that will. Let you build on the example that we did
    today in class. So that's one part of it, and the other part, is to. Think about
    your experience and in installing the different pieces that are required. To.
    Get the application running. So have it written up for Thursday. Then we can discuss
    it further than. You see, the chat again. yeah that helps. So there's a node js
    website. Years react website.
