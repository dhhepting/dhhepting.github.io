Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Hello. So. Let me just type in the chat may be easier. For you, you can feel
    free to ask me questions with your MIC. So. You know the problems haven't been
    completely resolved, but. I think i'm making progress, so there is so the effort
    to install the upgrade was. More than I expected. So I made sure I had a backup
    and the system. So I was. Sick his big Sir I don't know like names ran together.
    was what I was upgrading from. 11.6 I was at. This is 12.3. So let me see if I
    can. it's still Intel let's see, let me tell you what it is it's a 2017 macbook.
    They have. it's. Seven dual core I seven 2.2 gigahertz. So i'm just looking through
    I just upgraded. realizing that I was woefully out of date. And lots of things
    got broken on Monterey I fixed. Okay, so. i'm just checking my homebrew. installation
    for Ruby and all these other things. Here I should share my screen, so you can
    see what i'm. I just thinking we should do attendance flyer number. So i'm trying
    to be good here and keep up to date with everything. I just I didn't even think
    about. It being so very broken after the upgrade. To Monterey to. So i'm wondering.
    What kind of. approach could we use to. warn people about. out of date applications,
    they may still need to upgrade after. Updating the operating system. So, can you
    see my screen here with the terminal window. Thank you can. This happened to me
    yesterday to in a different setting. So we're doing the seminars for computer
    science. and They can share that. With you see a few like if you're. interested
    in. Is a couple tomorrow afternoon about this time between 130 and 220. Anyway,
    so I went to one of the classrooms and they're set up. To for hybrid so they have
    the two screens and the projector. So the idea is that you can have people in
    class and and also people on zoom. coming in remotely. So I logged into my account
    and I thought everything. was going to be just smooth sailing because I was. familiar
    with my because i've done this with. Because I have. Another class at 830 on Tuesdays
    and Thursdays, in one of the few lecture theatres on the main floor the classroom
    building For those of you who. can relate to that, but anyway. So the process
    between that computer. And the one in the seminar room. setups are a little bit
    different. But anyway, anyway, what I noticed was when I logged in. It said preparing
    windows, for a long, long time so. That was a sign of trouble and then. Student
    in class came. up and said we should restart it Nice that sounds good, with the
    press the power button on the computer on the hour or whatever if you'd like to
    call it. And that restarted the computer, but the problem is still persistent.
    And then another student. restarted it by hitting the power button. And to boot
    from the server. Not not from workstation. So that seem to be okay, but then,
    when I connected with zoom didn't connect with zoom and that was 20 minutes of
    very slow. very slow video and so forth. So, then, the technician came and talked
    about this and. He said that because zoom. Well it's largely zoom and it's not
    it not playing well with other things, and maybe leaving some things around. So
    he advised me to restart the computer when I come into the room. So I have a much
    better chance. restart from the canal. on the screen, not using the power button.
    And then go into that process. Okay, so now i've gotten. Through updated start
    any messages for me. When I tried group doctor just to see anything comes up https
    now again after i've upgraded. looks much more. Calm than I did before. seemed
    like there really weren't problems identified. Okay, so just checking here. The
    command line tools are to do that. let's see what happens. For the first advice
    so system software update in system preferences and. let's try this. yeah so there's
    an issue. With looking for how many times bumper occurs. So I did earlier was
    fine. yeah so i've been using. Or the movie environment or the end. Will attack
    live stuff that's not. Even that's just. Their formatting code. But anyway. Should
    I try. I didn't know anyway. So the. The question I wanted to ask you, before
    I, as I do this, and I might. have to reboot my system but. If I if i'm upgrading
    to a new version of. software. what's the mechanism that that could help users
    understand or to remember when. They have outdated. versions of software. Around
    so they might be able to clean it up or. Be warned if there's. Running that command
    with this current setup is going to cause the system to break. Unless hope for
    things you're going to work out.

- desc: Hello Hello.
  persid: S01
- desc: So I tried to say anyone there. I realized my microphone was turned off. So
    when I say anyone anyone their mind through the movie called Ferris bueller's
    day off it was done 19 early 80s. Who is a professor in class. Saying anyone anyone.
    In like an error response it so. i'm just trying to. Encourage. typing or talking
    is. is equally fine. Okay, so I don't want to focus too much on Ruby in this particular
    issue but. let's think about windows systems. Linux. Well, be required to. Let
    people know what's going on. So, on the one hand. there be a list of. Applications
    that. Were installed. Not just in the system applications. folder. Also. executable
    some users slash local band or some other places. So if we understood all of the
    different applications that were. run the system, you could. Then, what if there
    was. way. i'm just working on this. Trying to encourage. Your ideas here as well,
    but it seems to me, if there was a. was a list of. Applications on a system and
    then. say. site. Where source of information on the web. That could indicate.
    What where there are possible problems so. there's an application that doesn't
    work with the latest operating system. I don't have a place where that's reported.
    So that might. Not requiring central Florida important but. Maybe we have a. Each
    application that's. runs under the operating system as a. As a URL to indicate
    that there are some issues. So, going to be some analysis. Another program to
    go through the lesson see if there are any issues. properties to clean up. Now.
    well. So I appreciate the conversation with a on here today, but i'm just wondering
    if anyone else has. Something to contribute. More questions about. what's being
    discussed.

  persid: S02
- desc: Good afternoon sir
  persid: S03
- desc: How are you today?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good afternoon
  persid: S04
- desc: Hi sir. fine
  persid: S05
- desc: I continue to be having computer problems! Fingers crossed that I am close
    to resolving them
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good Morning sir
  persid: S06
- desc: "I was having problems with my computer and so I decided that I should upgrade\
    \ the operating system to macOS 12.3 (Monterey)\u2026"
  persid: DHH
- desc: okk sir
  persid: S07
- desc: So, the problem has been resolved?
  persid: S01
- desc: Any hardware related issue?
  persid: S01
- desc: What were the problems?
  persid: S08
- desc: "That was an effort in itself \u2014 I had to restart my computer in safe\
    \ mode (any mac users out there?)"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "You don\u2019t have time machine backup?"
  persid: S09
- desc: I am using macOS Sierra (10.12.6)
  persid: S08
- desc: Yes, I do have a backup which I was very sure to update before trying the
    upgrade :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, it was Big Sur
  persid: S09
- desc: What exactly are the problems the system is giving ?
  persid: S04
- desc: So I thought that this upgrade would have been sufficient. However, different
    applications have been causing me grief since I upgraded.
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Today, I realized that my jekyll installation was out of date and when I\
    \ tried to run \u201Cbundler exec jekyll serve\u201D that became the latest problem!"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Apple Silicon or Intel?
  persid: S09
- desc: I know, time to upgrade! :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: I thought you were using MacBook Air
  persid: S09
- desc: But from the spec it looks like Pro
  persid: S09
- desc: I am! MacBook Air 13-inch, 2017
  persid: DHH
- desc: The problem is Monterey ships with Ruby and bundler. So I guess when you upgrade,
    it makes changes to the path and installs the latest versions.
  persid: S09
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: Could you run which ruby / which bundler and see which binary is being picked?
  persid: S09
- desc: So you are using rbenv?
  persid: S09
- desc: Could you check which gem package you are using? which gem
  persid: S09
- desc: Cause bundler is installed via gem
  persid: S09
- desc: I think your Ruby setup is all good
  persid: S09
- desc: Jekyll should work
  persid: S09
- desc: please
  persid: S09
- desc: Any ideas regarding my question?
  persid: DHH
- desc: "I think Mac users are used to it by now. \U0001F642"
  persid: S09
- desc: "They lost hope and stopped complaining about these issues. \U0001F604"
  persid: S09
- desc: "Yes, but that\u2019s not a good reason for keeping the status quo!"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Anyone else want to join the discussion?
  persid: DHH
- desc: How many md files are there?
  persid: S09
- desc: "Site says that it still generating \u2014 and I amI may have to restart"
  persid: DHH
- desc: A few. This is taking too long...
  persid: DHH
- desc: I will restart and rejoin you shortly
  persid: DHH
- desc: "I\u2019m back!"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Did you seem much of my demise onscreen?
  persid: DHH
- desc: "\U0001F641"
  persid: S09
- desc: Any thoughts about how to prevent problems like that (my earlier question)?
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Unless Apple stops shipping Ruby, Python etc. with their OS, I don\u2019\
    t think there\u2019s much they can do it prevent it. Sadly, this is how *nix systems\
    \ work. But they sure can warn the users about it."
  persid: S09
- desc: Linux can mostly avoid these issues as they have central repositories. However,
    this also limit the users from upgrading a package to a specific version as package
    dependencies are shared.
  persid: S09
- desc: 'Ok. Something easier: show me an emoji :-)'
  persid: DHH
- desc: please
  persid: DHH
- desc: "\U0001F60C"
  persid: S01
- desc: "\U0001F9D0"
  persid: S04
- desc: "That\u2019s better. Why don"
  persid: DHH
- desc: System packages are usually reside within /usr/bin. On the other hand packages
    installed by the users are installed in /usr/local directory. So, most of these
    breakage after OS upgrade should be fixed easily. Maybe it requires some changes
    in the PATH variable etc. Another problem I have seen, people run the sudo command
    without understanding its impact.
  persid: S09
- desc: "don\u2019t we end it here and I will get my system back on track and post\
    \ the details of the assignment. Any questions, please share them online in our\
    \ discussion forum \u2014 OK?"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Ok, thank you.
  persid: S04
- desc: Could you please extend the meeting response time? It seems we need to write
    3 responses.
  persid: S09
- desc: Sure! :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks everyone. Take care and have a good weekend.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you very much
