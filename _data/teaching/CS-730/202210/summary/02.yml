Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon. In Regina anyway. how's everyone doing today. Good so I apologize.
    I didn't give you notice. about my office hours this morning for. wasn't available
    for them excited dentist appointment. And I survived. Okay, and have you available
    for an office hour after our meeting now. In case you're interested in doing that.
    So what what's the local time where you are. Here it's 1pm in the afternoon.
  persid: DHH
- desc: In India, and that is 30 am it is midnight.
  persid: S01
- desc: it's 8pm here. In Nigeria is 8pm.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, Nice. Oh alright. Thank you for. Staying up late. we're getting up early.
    anyway. So let me share my screen. and Here you can see. Your courses page. i'm
    still. Doing bit of work on this, I apologize for the delay. But. A few problems
    so. They didn't put in the right path here. i'll fix that up. sure that I updated
    these things. quickly here. And then we'll get into our. i'm curious to know how
    the discussion went on last day. breakout rooms. In trying to. figure out what
    happened here. So. candid sorted out. So if everyone can record your attendance
    i'd appreciate that. Because we're. gonna have 27 students. In the class, but
    we. just want to make sure everyone's. Connected here. I haven't done this yet
    so encourage you sound you have done this. last day about renaming yourself in
    zoom. So the name you'd like me to me and other students in class to call you.
    Well, by your you China email ID. So don't don't need the whole email address
    that you giant.ca but that's. Your ID. For the email. So I see vitamin D is posted
    about discord server. i'm not sure. Well, you can certainly do what you like i'm
    not sure the. value of having that as an additional communications channel for
    the class, but I appreciate your. your input on that. New class. So they find
    their class group. is working on last day. here's a listing with everyone's. names.
    So i've added it oh I didn't edit completely. Remove student numbers. I missed
    one or two. They fix that right now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so ricky the meetings. indicated here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. This one should be. Okay. Okay, let me try new share. Is that continue,
    can you see my screen now. basis. Okay, so. Just a comment, please don't send
    me direct messages in the chat because then i'm. Then I get i'm stuck in the default
    Dennis for me to reply to you, and then I have to reset it to everyone in the
    meeting. Okay, so, while we're on. let's go back to the meeting here. Page for
    the meeting for last day. Okay, so. I invite. For groups, we have. To fill in
    the details of their own discussion for the breakout rooms. From last day. Another
    page here. Create that page. And then, I have a link here from from moodle that
    is maybe a good starting point for using the wiki. Okay. So it gives you a little
    bit of an idea of how he is working in moodle. Only people have used a wiki before.
    But some do some reactions. or hands up how's that. ends up her easy for me to
    see you and on my relatively small screen. Okay, so this is kind of where I thought
    we'd be. No earlier. But here's the transcript from last meeting. They can go
    to the responses as well, so there were four responses. So this can be. sort of
    raw materials for editing the wiki page. Okay, so. So know the transcript is done.
    With zoom it's automatic it's using. Its a company called otter otter.ai. And
    it does a pretty good job with the transcript so. So I get recordings so i'm recording
    the meetings and then I get. The audio transcript and the chat transcript and
    then I. Have a little script to process them so that everybody aside for me. Who
    makes a contribution to the meeting. gets their own. It like. Certified and then.
    ooh excuse me i'm. So you can tell who are 60 minutes here, I should add, Edit
    this. So I don't want to give away your details. I don't want to. it's not on
    the public website, yet this is only on my laptop right now. But i'll get it fixed
    up and. Anyway, so the ideas i'm going to. and give everyone. Some I will appear
    as D H h. And then everyone else. will be an. S, followed by a number. So I process
    them and then I. And then I. Then have this template that gets filled in so i'm
    using. A static website generated called jackal. it's written in Ruby. Does anyone
    have familiar Is anyone familiar with jackal.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So one person anyone else. I see no. So I noticed that bootstrap so i've got
    bootstrap and i've updated to version 5.02. And I see that in bootstrap five they've
    updated. From. From jacko for their documentation to Hugo. So is it worth switching
    to you go. So the thing that happened over the holidays was. You know, keep that
    in mind. we've got to get. This working in on. i'm gonna fix up my version and
    juggle before maybe have migrated to something else over the summer. So what happened
    over this over the break was. It became clear that shows doing. is using travis
    ci. To to run a test and deploy the website. But then I. ran to the fine print
    word said. They had switched over to a commercial website commercial. Paid account
    and they given a given me a certain number of credits. And so the fine print was
    that I ran out of the credits and now. I was good. So that was interesting situation,
    I was. thinking that I could get around it. By issuing some commands myself instead
    of. uncoordinated. By the service and so. So I can do it myself. Excuse me again.
    I can. can do the deployment myself. But there are occasionally times when I might
    break it. The past couple days I broken in a few times. So keep working on. Adapting
    a new process to make this little easier. Okay. So here we are, for meeting to
    and. When it is. No, so no I don't mind visit a on my saying that. Okay. It. Okay,
    thanks. So i'm just thinking.
  persid: DHH
- desc: About.
  persid: ???
- desc: What we've discussed what comes up in class our class discussions, so we have
    a record and. a place where we can add. And all add things as well. So. What we've
    done what was covered in the class was came up in breakout discussions. and so
    on. So. it's based on. On what we do so just. Creating a shared copy of notes
    about our discussion for the day does that make sense. So I had a screenshot from
    the whiteboard leading into our breakout room. From last day, but now I. misplaced
    it. So I wanted to just show you this other link here. Oh, I didn't put. It in
    create another. respond to meetings. So I can show i'll show you the detail that.
    Interesting or the peculiarities of the interface and moodle. or your courses.
    So it's a lot of. clicking with the mouse. So now i'm sending it to. be available
    after our meeting today until midnight. Local time for me. So now, the response.
    is available, we will be available for you to complete once it gets. into our
    meeting is finished here. So an interesting thing about the interface. So I can
    specify for today. And if you can see. The the URL with the arguments here. So
    the course. Number here is. Pretty pretty. main course the instance of the. For
    CS 730 class in 2022 winter semester. But then the time. Is. A little bit confusing.
    So how many people recognize. This number as number of seconds since January 1
    1970. until January 13 2022. So yeah so it's a unix timestamp. who's. it's not.
    Immediately I can't. At least I can't do this and I don't know who can maybe there
    are people who can do this and. create a timestamp. it's in the right. range.
    For. January 13th or January. 18 and so on. So. So now, I have a script to do
    this. and create this link, so that each day is correct. So regarding the wiki.
    Falling and question. So yeah. To the group assign to the wiki page is going to
    take the lead on editing as they don't have to. Do all of it. And, especially
    in the case where we have a breakout activity. than the individual groups for
    the breakout. In the. classroom groups which correspond to the breakout rooms.
    So. For meeting one. group one was doing the wiki so that still use the opportunity
    for groups. two, three and four. To post about their breakout room discussion.
    Does that make sense. Is that clear. Okay well. If it's not clear. We can. Well
    we'll discuss it until then we'll work out work on it till. yeah. Some clarity
    or something that works for us okay. So I wanted to go to the class or to. The
    text. website here. So. i'm not complete this website. But it has some. As some
    good stuff in here, I think. Okay, so if.
  persid: DHH
- desc: you're.
  persid: ???
- desc: gonna paste this. Welcome To core. So if you're still working on getting access
    to. A copy of the book. Let me add this. link here. We can access PowerPoint.
    presentation. So I believe there's a PDF. version available as well. So in addition
    to looking at materials for Chapter one. here's another link to review. For our
    next meeting. So. And i've been having some computer problems. Today, and if you
    can hear the fan running. And just. just put me behind. So I haven't quite got
    all the details. For the syllabus sorted out yet. But I will post them this week
    by the end of tomorrow. And i'll send a note. To the. announced announcements
    forum. When that's available. So one thing about good and poor design with zoom
    is. Sometimes it works to Double Click on something to start it. Other times.
    Because. Well, I have to go to the more menu to hide name is Anna taters. So you
    can. annotate. annotate the whiteboard screen. But for now. Okay, so breakout
    rooms are open now. So remember if you're in group class work group one. Join
    breakout Room one. Is group class work group to break over to last work group
    three rooms three. password group for breakout room Paco room for. And if you
    have any problems. Let me know. If you have trouble getting of the main room.
    Let me know and all. I can't help. Okay, so for those who come back.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So we only had like two people there. Because a short discussion.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay. Now let me bring everybody else back. And then we can discuss the results.
    getting into your breakout room was okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um I just lived the meeting altogether then just.
  persid: S04
- desc: No, but when you started.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah it was just okay okay.
  persid: S04
- desc: Oh so together the breakout room. You you left the meeting and came back in
    that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: job.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: I thought it was possible to leave the breakout room without.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Probably. Probably there must be a button, but I see that, so another example
    of design it gets.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah so. that'd be something to. takes maybe take some. Pictures screenshots
    and. I mean soon, so we can document what's going on and. document our frustrations
    with poor design. Because what I think what happens in in zoom is that the different
    clients have quite different interfaces. And they have maybe have different capabilities
    and it's difficult to. You give one. suggestion on how to do a certain thing without
    knowing the client. you're in. And they. Also update. The clients get updated
    periodically and maybe not everybody is checking for updates and so. Even within
    the same client, then there might be a number of variations, based on the version
    number. I know I have to just updated so. A few things who different. Anyway,
    so I guess anyone who's who's coming back has come back. Gemma good discussion.
    So I encourage each of the four groups. To add a bit about their breakout room.
    Discussion discussions to the wiki. So we're out of time today. So. i'll say goodbye
    and wish you. A good weekend. and see you on Tuesday. And if you have questions
    i've got an office hour, starting in a few minutes. it's a different zoom coordinate
    but it's on the web on the your courses webpage. and Thank you for today and look
    forward to. Continuing our class on Tuesday. And please have a look at those links.
    Chapter one in a textbook and. Other Chapter one and. encyclopedia. Okay, and
    we'll. go on from there on Tuesday thanks again take care. bye.
