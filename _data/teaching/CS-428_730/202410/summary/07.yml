- desc: Morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: How's everyone today?
  persid: S00
- desc: Good you.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah, pretty good. I'll give you an update in a minute. Good morning. So we
    have a presentation a few minutes from with C. Triple. S.
  persid: S00
- desc: I'll just share my screen for a quick second. If that's okay. If you could
    let me. Okay, just give me a second here.
  persid: S02
- desc: No, that's not. It's secure. A should be able to know.
  persid: S00
- desc: Perfect.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thank you. So Hi, guys, just really quickly, my name is Nabira Siddiqi. I'm
    obviously a student in this class as well. I'm also the president of the Computer
    Science Student Society this year. I just wanted to thank Dr. Heptang for letting
    me take a few minutes to talk to you guys about some events we have coming up
    while I'm talking. Please feel free to scan this QR code and join our discord
    and follow us on Instagram. So you guys can keep updated on all the events that
    we're having some of the things that I wanted to. Highlight is we're going to
    have. We're going to be having a meeting greet event tomorrow. It's Tuesday, yeah,
    tomorrow. In Lasite 1, 32. I'd really like for you guys to come out. Just say,
    Hi to the Css team. See how you can get involved. Tell us what you want us to
    do this year. What kinds of things you'd like us to advocate for plan events,
    stuff like that. And then this weekend. There's also the science gala. The tickets
    are gonna be so closing tonight. So please buy your tickets. Come out. It's this
    big party all the science students are. Gonna be there. It's gonna be lots of
    fun. it's $35. Now. Early Bird is sold out. But again tickets close tonight. So
    please buy your tickets. And I'd love to see more computer science students out.
    And then, lastly, we have our github workshop on the ninth. We're gonna be having
    an in class teaching sort of thing. And then we're gonna be working on some projects
    after that. So a way to kind of grow your technical skills. But yes, these are
    some events that are coming up. Please follow us on Instagram and our discord
    and stuff to keep updated with these events. I'd love to see you out, and if you
    have any questions please let me know I'd be happy to answer any questions. Thank
    you so much for letting me speak.
  persid: S02
- desc: You're welcome. So do you still use Facebook?
  persid: S00
- desc: Not quite. We do have one. I don't think we updated as much. But we do put
    out some of our updates on there as well.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S00
- desc: yeah, But yeah, we send out emails and stuff, too. So watch out for those.
    But yeah, thank you so much.
  persid: S02
- desc: You're welcome. Any questions about C. 2 plus. So how how big, is this masquerade
    gala going to be
  persid: S00
- desc: there's about 400 students, expected
  persid: S02
- desc: okay.
  persid: S00
- desc: and faculty is welcome, too, I know, I sent out a email to Dr. Hover to forward
    that invitation to faculty as well. So you as well. And any other colleagues,
    we'd love to have you guys there as well.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: S00
- desc: is that Friday or Saturday, Saturday.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay? And we need to have a inspired costume.
  persid: S00
- desc: It is kind of like a gala dress. And we're gonna be selling masks at the entrance
    so like $2 for masks. But yes, it's encouraged to buy a M. Bring a mask or buy
    a mask because it is a mask grade bowl.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S00
- desc: thank you. Yep.
  persid: S02
- desc: Any other questions check the chat. If okay. So anyone going to the gala.
    Okay, we've got a couple that's good to hear 3. Alright.  let me share my screen,
    and we'll hey? So there's a URL. For more information on Linktree. Okay? So my
    response, I looked at the responses from last day. and a quick summary is that.
    yes, design is rewarding and fun. So I think people working at Ideo on other firms
    like that have it good. although it's not the only place you can have fun or enjoy
    your work alright, so there's some comments about scheduling responses. Maybe
    11 PM. Is is a bit arbitrary, and I could make it at midnight, but then I decided
    to try it for our next response to make it before noon to-morrow. See if I've
    got okay. So this one opens at 1245. That's correct. and you can see it right.
    I am sorry I didn't make it visible right right at the start last last day. You
    can check that. It's visible. Let's look at the upcoming events to see how it
    appears. So you can do attendance. Still. Think that this should be first in the
    list. anyway. So do you think it's more helpful to see opens and closes for thing
    for items like this? This one says it's closes. or is it more helpful to have
    them both listed like 1245 PM. Until tomorrow at noon. Let's do. Let's see if
    I can do it. Survey quickly. A. So, can you see this zoom screen
  persid: S00
- desc: create survey? Yep.
  persid: S01
- desc: "yeah, okay. So this is interesting. I can create and then says, Choose a\
    \ survey type. I can create a survey, or I can create a polar, quit poll or quiz.\
    \ not polar, but pol or quids. which is more helpful. Having open and closed times\
    \ as separate events. Okay. Now, I have to go back here and activate it. Didn't\
    \ I save it? Some surprising results so far I'll give you a say another minute\
    \ to answer. okay, so I'm gonna end the poll share the results. So it's about\
    \ 60, 40 for 60% versus 40% for having a single event to list both open and closed\
    \ times together. So I have one more question then. So if if we have. instead\
    \ of having both styles. or maybe we could have a there could be a a selection\
    \ for the course settings to say how calendar events are going to be displayed.\
    \ So based on that style selection. should all the events be displayed in the\
    \ same format. So consistency is one of those heuristics we talked about. Okay,\
    \ that's 2\_min for the poll. So I'll share those results. Anyone who answered\
    \ No. like it. Like to make any comments about your choice in the chat or with\
    \ the microphone. Okay. So so we have a couple people who don't use the calendar.\
    \ Let's try one more question. Then. I can't say why that that was being underlined.\
    \ But I'm going to suggest the word that something that's not a word. You can't.\
    \ You can't see me editing this, anyway. so I'm giving you a couple choices here\
    \ for the calendar. I didn't give the title. But, anyway. is the calendar an important\
    \ source of information for you? Yeah. So. my kalo. that's a good comment that\
    \ the setting could be a user preference instead of a class. A class decision\
    \ may be made by the instructor. Okay, I think we've got our or participation\
    \ as much as you're going to get. So 75% said, yes, calendar's important. 21%\
    \ said, Keep track of them themselves. And 2 people said they use the links that\
    \ I provide. Okay, so a non-binding snapshot of what's going on in class. So the\
    \ nice thing about moodle is that its open source. So we have the opportunity\
    \ to get involved in the project and suggests changes and implement them. Okay.\
    \ any thoughts. So any questions or concerns about that. Alright. So let's go\
    \ back to here. So I thought we'd look at this video about Norman doors. It's\
    \ It's not too long. And it's fun. There's this door on the tenth floor of the\
    \ Vox media office that I hate so much. Damn it! Here we get this door wrong pretty\
    \ regularly. Have you seen people misuse it all the time? Everything! Me, too,\
    \ Kelsey. But here's the thing. As soon as you start looking for confusing doors.\
    \ They are everywhere. It's fresh. Why. I feel like Roman Mars would know about\
    \ this. This is 99% invisible. And those doors you hate are called Norman door.\
    \ What's a Norman door? Don Norman wrote the essential book about design. He is\
    \ the Norman of the Norman door. Alright. And where is this guy? You must go to\
    \ San Diego. Hi, Joe! Hey! I'm Don Norman, I'm see. You know, it's hard to describe\
    \ what I am. Well, he's been a professor of psychology, professor of Cognitive\
    \ Science Professor of Computer Science, a vice President of Advanced technology\
    \ at Apple. But for our purposes I was spending a year in England. I got so frustrated\
    \ with my inability to use the light switches and the water taps and the doors\
    \ even, that I wrote this book. If I continue to get that door wrong. is it my\
    \ fault? No. in fact, if you continually get it wrong, is a good one, but if other\
    \ people continue to get it wrong? Good sign! That's a really bad door. A Norman\
    \ door is one where the design tells you to do the opposite of what you're actually\
    \ supposed to do, or gives the wrong signal and needs a sign to correct it. Why\
    \ does it need of instruction? Manual? That is why do you have to have a sign\
    \ that says, push or pull. Why not make it obvious? It can be obvious if it's\
    \ designed right? There are a couple of really simple basic principles of design,\
    \ and one of them I'll call discoverability. When I look at something I should\
    \ be able to discover what operations I can do. The principle applies to a whole\
    \ lot more than doors. And it's amazing with many of our computer systems. Today,\
    \ you look at it. There's no way of knowing what's possible? Should I tap it once,\
    \ twice, or even triple tab, so discover ability when it's not there. Well, you\
    \ don't want to use something. Another is feedback. and so many times there's\
    \ no feedback. You have no idea what happened, what, why it happened. And these\
    \ principles form the basis of how designers and engineers work to day commonly\
    \ known as user or human centered design. I've decided at 1 point the word user\
    \ was a 50 Grady. Why not call people people. And it's amazingly simple and amazingly\
    \ seldom practice. We call iterative and sort of goes around in a circle. We go\
    \ out. We observe what is happening today reserve people doing it to answer. And\
    \ from that we say, Oh, we have some ideas. Here's what we should perhaps propose\
    \ to do. Then you prototype your solution and test it quite often. These are wrong\
    \ at first, but each time we go around the circle we do a better job of making\
    \ the device until the point. We're actually making something that really works.\
    \ And this process has spread all over the world. And it turns out it's improving.\
    \ Live from better, everyday things, like the ones that don't, using the same\
    \ process to solve huge problems in public health, in developing countries, water\
    \ sanitation, farming, lots more. So what it'd be a better human centered door.\
    \ An ideal door is one that as I walk up to it and walk through it, I'm not even\
    \ aware that I had open the door and shut it. So we had a door which had a flat\
    \ plate. What could you do? Nothing. The only thing you can do is push. See? You\
    \ wouldn't need a sign. A flat plate. You push this kind of push bar with the\
    \ piece sticking out on one side works well, too, so you can see what side you're\
    \ supposed to push them. Vertical bars could go either way. A simple little hand\
    \ thing, though, sort of indicates hold, but we still have terrible, terrible.\
    \ so many of them. There are lots of things in life they're fairly standardized,\
    \ and therefore, whether I buy this house or not is not a function, whether it\
    \ has good doors in it. So except for safety reasons, stores tend not to be improved,\
    \ but the tyranny of bad doors must end. I think that it's a really designed.\
    \ That's why misleading. You're right, Becky. You're goddamn right, and if we\
    \ all thought like you. Well, we might just design a better world together. It\
    \ won't open because it's a security door. What have you 2 do. hey? So, as you\
    \ can see since I started making this video. They've since. Changed the door a\
    \ little bit. Guess it's a step in the right direction. Thank you so much for\
    \ watching and to 99% invisible. One of my favorite podcasts. It was so much fun\
    \ to collaborate with them, thank you and check them out on any podcast app or\
    \ 99. PI. Dial. pour your doorbell camera company and cancel the. So would you\
    \ think that video I apologize for bad language. There's this door on the tenth\
    \ floor of the Vox media office that I hate now. I made the chat window exceptionally\
    \ large here, and I'm try to bring it back in. Okay. So what I thought we might\
    \ do is look at an example of something that II find frustrating. So what I'd\
    \ like to do is create some breakout rooms and give you some ideas to look at.\
    \ What are some issues that you might have with this design. This is a little\
    \ bit different than it used to be. but not substantially  some issues, and then\
    \ some ways, you might think about changing it. If this is an academic schedule.\
    \ Can you discover how to use it? And I guess feedback is a little is a little\
    \ harder with a piece of paper with a document. Let's think about that, and think\
    \ about ways. You might present this information differently. That might be easier\
    \ to. or they might address some of the concerns you have that you identify. Does\
    \ that make sense? Okay, so let me. I'm going to look for white boards for you\
    \ to to. So I might have to go somewhere else and create a whiteboard. Let me\
    \ try and do that. Sorry you can't see this. I don't believe so. I'm not sure\
    \ it's not clear to me how if I can say, each breakout room gets a a whiteboard.\
    \ So I have a whiteboard open here and we'll see how that works. Okay, so breakout\
    \ rooms. But would you like me to assign them automatically or let you choose.\
    \ hey? So we have 50 participants, I believe. 49. So let's do 6 breakout rooms.\
    \ I'll give you. So I have 8 people in a group. Actually, maybe we'll do 8 breakout\
    \ rooms with 6 people in a group. Okay? And we'll give you 10\_min to think about\
    \ that. And then if it's going well. maybe another 5\_min, and then we'll get\
    \ back together. Does that seem okay? Any questions? Okay. there's there's what\
    \ I'm asking you to look at. Okay. here we go. But I'm just going to be away for\
    \ a minute here. but I'll be back right very soon."
  persid: S00
- desc: We can't hear you.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay? Well, I said, we're back now. And did anyone have a positive experience
    with the breakout room and the discussion.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S04
- desc: yep, it was a good discussion.
  persid: S01
- desc: Good. So any ideas that came out
  persid: S00
- desc: there were a few ideas like in the color coding. If you look at the chart
    on the left hand side, the class dates, it's green, so you know, it should be
    uniform. we in in our breakout room. We discussed that the other important dates
    and deadlines should be in a separate box or column, and then so it's not cluttered.
    Then there's some, you know, issues in the date format as well in the fall. 2024
    column. If you look at, look closely. That dates are not probably yeah or mattered.
  persid: S04
- desc: You got a different schedule than the one we had a 2023, 2024 academic scheduled.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. let me switch to that one. I think I have it here.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah, there we go.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay? So which column
  persid: S00
- desc: on the fall column
  persid: S01
- desc: fall 2023, and the other important dates and deadlines
  persid: S04
- desc: right beside the giant white box that has no point.
  persid: S01
- desc: Oh, yeah.
  persid: S00
- desc: the date formats are kind of back and forth.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: S00
- desc: we also talked about kind of even just separating other important dates and
    deadlines off of the top initial box. Just because it's like reading it all is
    one. It's highly conglomerated. First it was overwhelming for me, but as I read
    it more and more and more, I kind of started to understand the scheme of how this
    report was set up.
  persid: S01
- desc: So anyone think about whether it's good to have it? This basic format is okay,
    or is it better to have key dates. because the dates in the columns are repeated
    it a little bit. They're this. They look like. To me. It seems like there's there
    are separate things going on because they're listed in the column on the right
    hand side of the table. But I see that they're repeated. So. for example, 13,
    September 23 is repeated a couple times. 20 seventh September 23 is. repeat it
    a couple times. Would it make sense to have it more of a calendar. Say here for  On
    this date the following things are happening. Anyone think about that possibility?
  persid: S00
- desc: So everyone I did test. I want productivity like we can. and I use several
    cluster. We can cluster it in several parts like for the summer.
  persid: S05
- desc: for the fall it should be separated. It will be more feasible and understandable
    to peoples
  persid: ???
- desc: alongside that for the visualization in my perception, if we use different
    color for the important dates like for class dates, where you using pre colors.
    But for the tuition fees and prepun, or any anything like that, if we can use
    some types of deep print color, it will be more eye-catching. And it will comes
    up to people easily actually.
  persid: S05
- desc: so this is a little bit of a perceptual issue. What about people who are color
    blind? We have to be careful in our selections. And
  persid: S00
- desc: yes, sir, because in the information visual edition, we see that if we use
    different color or different shape, it will be more V visible to people right?
    So their color can be infectful, I guess. But we should consider the color of
    the
  persid: S05
- desc: issues with the color for the black color. Black people like you.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S00
- desc: another big thing. That kind of boggled. My mind is, a lot of the border boxes
    have solid or bigger bolded borders, which kind of catch your eye, and when you
    start reading through it, you kind of draw towards those thicker borders.
  persid: S01
- desc: Hmm. the one I'm showing now are the 2425, one
  persid: S00
- desc: the link that who was it? Who sent it in. Chan. Yeah, the one that he posted.
    If you look at that one online, it's mean 2 lines down. There's a thicker border,
    and then you kind of go through it, and you can just see there's a bunch of different
    border sizes on some of these kind of draws your eyes to places. You don't want
    it to be.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah. okay. Yeah. So I notice that there's like the headings are repeated
    here halfway down other important dates and deadlines has a new section. so maybe
    maybe the the other important dates and deadlines could be more of a calendar
    format. so it would avoid the giant white box here. so I saw Khan from cadence
    about. It's useful to look up dates by having the the the title on the on the
    left, and then searching through it. But maybe so. The first first part of the
    table, the upper part of the table is good, the way it is, or organized by important
    dates. and then where those important dates are listed. but the bottom part maybe
    could be in a calendar format.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah, I definitely agree with that kind of separates it a little bit too easier
    reading.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, so we're almost out of time. So I was gonna tell you. this is not to
    get sympathy. But it's been quite a few days. So we had the memorial service for
    my mom on Saturday. and then Saturday night we heard that my mother in law was
    hit by a car, and she's in hospital now. So my wife went to Vancouver today. Where
    is going to Vancouver and Upkiple? She'll she'll be at the airport by now. So
    it's it's been an interesting few days. Certainly. Another question I'm going
    to pose for you on your courses is whether you think the Velcro suit idea or the
    video from Letterman. See if you think it's relevant still. anyway, I'll phrase
    a question for you to respond to. and you can. and I'll ask you about whether
    you you're feeling about the timings for the responses and quizzes as well. Okay.
    So here we are at the end of time to day. Thank you very much for your engagement.
    Have a great day, and we'll see you on Thursday.
  persid: S00
- desc: Perfect. See you Thursday.
  persid: S01
- desc: Any questions or concerns. Okay. anyway, I'll be around for my office hours
    on Wednesday. I have a department meeting and 3, so I'll have to
  persid: S00
- desc: alright see if you can
  persid: S04
- desc: grab me between one and 3, and I'll make up the other hour some other time.
    Okay. thank you. Thanks again. Bye.
  persid: S00
- desc: right. I'm sorry. Professor. Can we get some information about the assignments?
  persid: S04
- desc: Yes, we'll talk about that on next Thursday. Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.

  persid: DHH
- desc: both
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

    I keep a detailed agenda lol
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"it personally doesn'...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: I'm the same way
  persid: DHH
- desc: User could specify in settings which way they prefer to be displayed. Maybe
    more important events would be one way, the rest the other way, depending on their
    preference.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sounds good!
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good video
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think I have seen this video before in one of the classes
  persid: DHH
- desc: It's entertaining and covers the topic pretty well
  persid: DHH
- desc: The video shows that when designing something, need to think about who will
    use it, and whether your design is intuitive enough to use.
  persid: DHH
- desc: After being introduced to the concept every time I'm at the U of R I always
    seem to be looking at the doors

- desc: OK. Stay here. I will close the rooms.
  persid: DHH
- desc: not everyone we are
  persid: DHH
- desc: in room 1
  persid: DHH
- desc: Anyone?
  persid: DHH
- desc: We can't hear you prof
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yep we had a good discussion.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yep
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: A classmate put it pretty succinctly by saying that this schedule has issues
    with consistency, visual representation, and order. It's not very accessible or
    easy to read.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I personally think that it would make more sense to break the academic schedules
    up by term and have the relevant "important dates" listed at the bottom, with
    all dates where classes aren't being held grouped together.
  persid: DHH
- desc: They have made some improvements for 2025-2026 schedule if you take a look.
    The other dates are separated there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: One possible way we discussed is to re-design as a timeline based on months
  persid: DHH
- desc: When I look at the schedule I'm usually looking for a specific term, not all
    of them.

  persid: DHH
- desc: I see what they're trying to do here, because often just looking at a calendar
    you're looking at the date first, where in this case you're looking for when a
    date might fall. But overall the information is presented poorly.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think the calendar would be worse, I usually use this table to find the
    dates for specific things, so the calendar would require a lot of searching since
    I don't know what date I am looking for in the first place
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"I think the calendar\u2026\" with \u261D\uFE0F"
  persid: DHH
- desc: They could've made the "other important dates and deadlines" into its own
    calendar/schedule at the bottom
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"They could've made t...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry to hear that
  persid: DHH
- desc: I am so sorry to hear that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Damn, I'm so sorry to hear that
