- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S00
- desc: How are you today
  persid: S01
- desc: doing? Alright. I realized, once I got here, I forgot my phone
  persid: S00
- desc: hopefully. You don't have any two-step authentication you have to do.
  persid: S01
- desc: "Funny you should mention that. So I have to authenticate myself for your\
    \ courses. And then I thought, oh, I had these past, these passcode saved. and\
    \ I tried to enter one, and I tried to enter 2 of them, and they weren't accepted.\
    \ so I had to call it services it support. And he said, Oh, yes, we. They're only\
    \ good for 24\_h. Didn't mention that on the on the download screen that I had\
    \ saved. anyway. So they gave me a new pass code for to day. So let's I was checking.\
    \ That was going to be much more difficult than it was to get sorted out so happily.\
    \ I didn't run into too many problems that way. So first day of February. Still,\
    \ summer out, spring out today"
  persid: S00
- desc: looks like it.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. I guess I'll share my screen here, and then we'll get into our agenda
    for today. Okay. okay, so I want to focus on assignments first so happy! First
    day of February. Remember, do your attendance that's up to you. And then the our
    upcoming events for class. So the quiz closed at 1130. Talk about the answers
    there! Velcro closes. That sounds funny somehow. And here's the response for today's
    meeting. I'm sorry I didn't post the responses. Yet from last day's meeting oh,
    end of penalty! Free payment period for the winter term. and then we have that.
    So I think everything is set up properly. Let me know if it's to encounter problems.
    I wanted to show you. An event may be of interest to you on the 20 ninth of February.
    So just about 4 weeks. not just about 4 weeks. Today's Thursday. It's on a Thursday.
    So 4 weeks from today. Oh, I didn't have to do that. So Tim Belsher, who was born
    in in Regina and moved to BC. And when he was about 12, I think I knew him at
    Sfu. and he's been in film and games. He's gonna come and talk. It's gonna talk
    on Zoom. But his career in film and games. merging tech and art. So that's part
    of our that's the seventh lecture in our virtual public lecture series called
    Computer Science Alumni and friends. So there's a Facebook event page for it.
    It's also on the U. Of R. Events, calendar. So there's a link to register for
    the zoom Zoom Meeting. So I encourage you to check that out on the fair. But in
    4 weeks time. okay. you can read a bit more about his. his resume, which is quite
    impressive. Okay. does that sound interesting to anyone.
  persid: S00
- desc: I think it could be potentially interesting.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. anyway, I just wanted to draw your attention to that. So I wanted to.
    I haven't got things set up in your courses. But this is what I propose to do
    for assignments. We have 40 marks allocate to assignments. and 2 of them. I'd
    like to be assignments kind of standalone assignments. I'll give you something
    to do. and then you would submit a response. Submit your answers. and then the
    other 3 parts of it would be a project related. so they would build on each other.
    To get a to have a deliverable for a project. so 40 marks would be divided in
    5 ways. 2, 4, so 16 marks would be per individual, not individual, but more. one
    off assignments. and the others 3, 24 marks would be related to a project. and
    they would build on each other. So the first assignment I have would related to
    this experiment with your courses course. So, has anyone seen this in their ur
    courses?
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah, I was taking a peek at it earlier today.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, so let me see if I I'm noticing something here that I don't not loving
    here. I thought this was addressed before. Okay. so give me a second here to figure
    something out too many things going on here. and so that the the issue was. Oh.
    issue was that I'm seeing give, showing you something more than you should be
    able to see, because I have to be a teacher. So what I'm going to do is no, no,
    I'm not sure if I have to be the teacher or not.
  persid: S00
- desc: Are you talking about for you our courses? Yeah, the experiment with your
    courses. Believe, if you drop down the Dropdown arrow by your profile up at the
    top, you can switch your role to. And I think you can choose. Student.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah, no, that's I'm going to have to redo this. It seems. Darn that student
    role isn't what I was trying to do. I wanted to add my student account. but I
    tried to remove myself as a teaching role and keep myself as a beta teacher for
    learning as the rest of you were. And then it's I'll show you what it looks like
    now. So it's taken out all the rules. There weren't any groups before, but there
    aren't any roles, either. So I'm going to have to get this reset. Is it still
    available to you.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yes, it's still available. I can see it.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S00
- desc: find it weird because I have access to the edit mode. And though it shows
    that we don't have roles.
  persid: S01
- desc: This might be a better way to do it actually. while I have to investigate.
    So the purpose of setting this up for you was to, or is to give you a chance to
    experience. You are courses as a teacher. although now I'm not sure what you are.
    You can edit the class without you can enter the class without having a role.
    So that's I'm gonna have to check that out. So see if I can get that resolved.
    Today I'll send an email or a post to the class discussion about that. So the
    the goal is with this assignment is to get you to do some set up in you our courses.
    and and think about the implications of the interface design that lets you do
    what you set out to do, and so to reflect on it and think about opportunities
    for improvements in the interface. So what I wanted to my idea for assignments
    is to make all 5 parts of the assignment. so the assignments and the project parts
    make them available as to work on as groups in groups. And so what I will do is
    set up. so we might have different groups for the assignment pieces and the project
    pieces. So would that be a good option to have, and I'll put some polls up here
    in a minute. So would you like the option of having to 2 different sets of groups.
    or one set of one set of groups. One grouping for the assignments is the idea
    of group assignments. Appealing and well, those are the 2 questions, I guess.
    So let me put a pull up for that. Yeah, I'm still working on the poll. Okay? So
    I'm asking 3 questions. And here's the poll. Think that's been published. Now.
    okay, so we've got 82% participation was creeping up there. Okay, so we've got
    45 out of 46. That's pretty good. So let me end the poll. and then we can. I'll
    share it. And then you can see what you what you think about that any thoughts
    about that. any discussion.
  persid: S00
- desc: got one question. With group work. Would there be a peer review with that
    as well, or just kind of go for it?
  persid: S01
- desc: Can you give me a little more detail about your question. I didn't. What do
    you mean by peer Review?
  persid: S00
- desc: Well, I mean depending on certain situations. Some may do more than others.
    XYZ. Kind of a way, just for us to voice our opinions to you. If things didn't
    go so well in the group.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yes, I'll I'll give you the option to tell me about that. You can. I want
    to revamp it a bit from what I've done in the past. But basically. So if we have
    group of 4, I'll ask you to rate give each person in the group a share of 100
    points. So if 4 people in the group, and they all all did their share. No complaints
    then. that each get 25 from you. including yourself. So I. So I realize that some
    people prefer to do individual work. So this is what I propose to do. So for the
    first assignment about in experimenting with you. R. Courses. Once I get sorted
    out again. it seemed like a good idea to remove myself as a teacher. But then
    so this is an example where, as an aside. This is an example where undo would
    have been a helpful thing. or maybe a message saying. this is really going to
    mess things up. Are you sure you want to do this? That would have been helpful
    for me? So the a couple of the heuristics have been valued. violated are not followed
    in moodle slash UR. Courses. But I'll get it sorted out anyway. So what I propose
    is, I'll create groups with with one person in every group. So the groups I'll
    ask you to stick to your class. So 4, 28 students can get together with other
    4, 28 students if they want. and 7 30 students can get together with another 7
    30 students. So for the project pieces, I would like to have ideally a group of
    4, I believe there's that would be 15 groups of 4 in CS. 4, 28, and 2 groups of
    4, plus one group of 3 in 7, 30. So for the so for the the Simon parts. I'll put
    it up. I'll create 2 sets of groups. so one for the assignments, so everybody
    will get put into the group of one their own group. And then. if you want to work
    with other people, you can. You can specify. You can send me a note about which
    groups you'd like to which individual groups we like to work together. So I'll
    edit the list of groups. So I'll collapse up up to 4 of those individual groups
    into one group. and then that's what you'll use for it. The 2 pieces of assignments.
    so you can work on your own. or with one other or 2 other or 3 other people. Does
    that make sense? But for the project, I'd like to try and stick with 4 people.
    So I think that if my math is correct, based on the last enrollment numbers, I
    think we can do 17 groups of 4, plus one group of 3 for the project. So so any
    thoughts about that should I do that right now. let's try that. Okay. So now,
    what I'm going to do for my next. the next step. Okay. So so another thing I notice
    about creating groups is I can I can do an add sign for letters or pound sign
    or hash for numbers, but I can't use multiple numbers to get 0 0 padded numbers,
    so they show the groups will show up in numerical order. If I try to put more
    than one. I say, you're only allowed to do one. Okay, so now we're creating groups
    or 4, 28. Okay? So. So the idea is this gives you a way to choose whether you
    want to work by yourself or with the larger group for the assignments. So if you
    want to work together with a group for the assignment that I will fix up again
    and let you know before the end of tomorrow. So send me a note. And you are courses
    email and give me the group numbers you want to consolidate. So here let me join
    a group, and I can show you what it looks like. Oops. No. my math is wrong, so
    I think there's only 59 students and 4, 28, because I am listed as a student,
    I believe. So I apologize, Dane, that I'm going to it. Add myself to your group
    just for quick demonstration. Then I'll remove myself again. Okay, so if you go
    in. if you click on assignment group membership. you'll be able to see your group.
    And then so if you send me an email that says, I want 4, 28, assign 1, 2, 3, and
    4 to be together. Then I'll I will consolidate those 4 groups into one. and that'll
    be the the group for the assignments. Okay, if you want to stay on your own for
    the assignment that then you're set. Does that make sense. And so, if you want
    to keep the same group for assignments. As for the project. if you want to have
    the same group for the assignment and the project assignments and the project.
    Then make a group of 4, a group of 3 or 4. Well, let's let's try to make a group
    of 4 for the assignment. and then I'll copy those over for the project groups.
    So don't email me the person. the name of the person I want you to email me the
    groups that you want to consolidate. So if you're in Group 13, 4, 28, assignment
    13 group. and you want to work with 1415, 16. So that's 4. So you give me the
    group numbers and I'll put those together into one. Okay, so not the name of the
    people, but the name name of the group. I will put all this into instructions
    here under assignments. Okay. okay. So I I wonder if there are thoughts at this
    point after we've had this is our eighth meeting. What are things that work well,
    and what things are not working so well with the way I'm presenting this material
    to you. and I'll I'll add a try, a an opportunity to give me some feedback after
    the class in your courses, so let me anyone like to make a comment with the microphone
    or in the chat about this. Okay? So I'm saying it to be anonymous. Okay, so there's
    the feedback. Okay, so that's open now until noon tomorrow. So I don't mean to
    put you on the spot. Ask by making you make comments in public, I guess. So this
    is set up to be anonymous. So take it from there. So things like I'm wondering
    about is there a better way to incorporate the wiki into things. Should I put
    something? Should I make a habit of putting something onto the wiki after the
    meeting. or or do something else? So about the answers from the quiz which Gulf
    asks about system state. So we're looking at the Gulf of evaluation. We're trying.
    The question is, what's the current system state? So from the video, Don Norman
    talked about a juicer which is very striking. but it doesn't work well, because
    the one he has is gold-plated. and they can't make juice with that one, because
    the acid wouldn't. The juice would destroy the finish on the to you, sir. the
    the person who designed that choose, sir. as a I think, a Ted Talk, I can add
    a link to that as well. So I guess, in terms of feedback. I'd be interested to
    say. see what you think about where to put new links, and so on, that come up
    in discussions in the course of a meeting. Should I add that on the wiki. Should
    I add it to another heading on the same meeting page? Or should I add that on
    to the next meeting page things like that. I'd be interested in learning what
    you think about. So the cognitive frameworks. mental models, gulfs of execution
    and valuation. information processing. distributed cognition, external cognition
    and embodied interaction. So I believe these links are correct. Let me just try
    them out. That's for the response. Take the quiz before the start of our next
    meeting. I don't know how there's an attempt on that quiz already. I'll check
    that out. anyway. I'm gonna so here's a this is a reference in the text where
    they have the picture, I think the picture's here. Yes, you see that this is appears
    in the textbook. the user and the world. So when we're faced with the gulf of
    execution. we're asking, How do I use the system? So if the gulf so the gulfs
    of execution and evaluation. or the conceptual distance between the user and the
    the thing they are trying to operate system, we're trying to operate. So if it's
    not clear upon inspection, how do I use a system? I have a goal I want to accomplish.
    How do I go about achieving that goal? So you might think of ways that seem reasonable
    to do it. but if those don't bear fruit. then we're in a difficult position. If
    what seems reasonable to do is easy to make is easy to specify. and has a desired
    effect than the gulf of execution is minimal. Similarly, for looking at something
    trying to decide what we need to do. So we understand the current state of the
    system. and it's not clear to us what state the system is in, so that we can execute
    our plans to achieve our goal. then that Gulf evaluation is very large. But if
    it's clear immediately what the system state is. and we can see how to make a
    plan to achieve our goals. then the Gulf evaluation is minimal. so the the goal
    is to make them as the these gulfs as small as possible. So the bridge we need
    to build between the user and the world is as small as possible. So they talk
    about the example of Bluetooth headset. and I don't have it here. I'll see if
    I can add a link. But I encountered a website yesterday. They had to worst possible
    cookie settings interface that I have seen to date. I'll see if I can share that
    with you as well. so that it was not clear at all how to use that to achieve my
    goal of ignoring all non-essential cookies. Okay, so we're but out of time. any
    questions or concerns. So have we made progress on the assignment situation. So
    there's a couple more things I want you to read. So let's say, if you can send
    me an email. your courses with the group numbers. you'd like to work with. So
    not the People's email addresses, but their group numbers as we talked about.
    If you can do that before class on Tuesday. that would be sufficient, I think.
    Okay. I'll put a note on. I'll put a note in you. Our courses about that as well.
    Okay. So we're out of time. Thank you for today. and so I welcome your feedback.
    constructive as as possible. and let's have a good weekend. We'll see you on Tuesday.
    Take care, everyone.

  persid: DHH
- desc: My personal preference is to work individually. When given the choice between
    group work or individual work, usually even if it gives me more work I prefer
    to work alone in an academic setting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can we do groups of 2 or 3 or does it have to be 4?
  persid: DHH
- desc: So do we have to select group members or its auto allocated ?
  persid: DHH
