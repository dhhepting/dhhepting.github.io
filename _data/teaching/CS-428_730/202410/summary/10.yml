- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: So winter seems to be back again for a while. Yes, minus 4 is better than
    minus 4 d. So I'm concern. Now go walk, my dog. It depends which side of the street
    they're on. So some people's the snow melted and they didn't clean the ice off
    when it was nice. and now the ice is going to be under snow. Well, I'm going to
    test that out tonight. so if I, if you don't hear from me again. That didn't go
    well. or maybe I am in the hospital, or something. I have Grippy's shoes fur de
    winter, so that should help. Okay. let me let me share my screen. Okay. so today,
    I wanted to talk about empathy. That's the name of the assignment. And it's also
    the question I asked you. or the answer to the question I asked you in the quiz.
    So I gave you 3 options. for what a designer or a good designer needs empathy.
    sympathy, or apathy. So how will. I think design happens from all those perspectives?
    What do you think? A design from a designer? With apathy comes a what? Yeah, what
    kind of design comes from apathy? Yeah. So you may encounter lots of designs that
    come up this way. So the designer thinks they have a great solution. They don't
    engage users. and so they don't care. They they think their work is fine as it
    is. and sometimes maybe it's not bad, but chances are it's gonna be poor. And
    what about sympathy? Sympathy isn't bad. So the designer might have the viewpoint
    of oh, the poor user. Let me let me take care of them, and oh! And and might be
    a little paternalistic. So I know what what's the best thing here, and I'll take
    care of your needs. So that's not treating the users as okay. I'm just reading
    the chat here a little bit. Yeah. So sympathy is not bad. But it's not taking
    the full advantage of people's experience. listening to users. to the people using
    the software or the device and taking their concerns to heart. So I don't know
    that you need to start with sympathy. It's possible just to. I think it's possible
    to start with an open mind that the designer doesn't have the answers. To begin
    with. it's like in that article, the designer stance from David Kelly at Ideo.
    You talk to people understand their perspective and and value their input. Okay?
    So that was a good discussion about that. Any other questions or concerns regarding
    the value of empathy. So I looked at the responses. and one stood stood out to
    me. There was a comment about the course organization being a bigger issue. Then
    the person thought so are there concerns about the course organization. If there
    are, can you send me a note? So I don't want you to feel like you have to. I don't
    wanna put you on the spot and communicating in front of the class. So please send
    me an email, and you are courses. If you'd like to discuss that further. So. assignment
    one is, do after the break. I'd encourage you to well, to treat it like it's due
    before the break, I guess. So you get in involved. Yep. you. So you tackle the
    issues and identify questions or concerns that need more clarification need clarification
    before the break starts. And so the midterm will be online. We'll be doing. We'll
    be doing zoom breakout rooms. So I just want to extend an invitation for you to
    suggest midterm exam questions. That will be fair assessments of our learning
    to date. So the midterm is March fifth. So that's a little waysen that into the
    future. But I'd like you to think about it. So read a question, and well, you
    can write more than one question, but for each question suggestion indicate what
    you think is a good answer. Does that make sense? So I would say. I would encourage
    you to put them in the class discussion Forum. Okay? So you can do it as well.
    That's let me start.  Let me start a discussion about midterm questions. You can
    see me typing right? I'm
  persid: S00
- desc: yep.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. I just wondered if I had to narrate this as well. Okay, so thinking
    about assignments and housekeeping here, let's okay. So we have a few students
    looking to find others to work within groups. so to reiterate. there will be 2
    assignments. This empathet they empathize is one of them, and there'll be one
    more that can be done individually or in groups. and then there'll be 3 parts
    together will be more of a project. and those I would like to be done in groups
    of 4 with the caveat they might have to make a group of 3. So if you. if you're
    interested in
  persid: S00
- desc: working alone on the assignment
  persid: ???
- desc: assignments. that's fine. But can you indicate a preference? If you have a
    preference for the project groups. please let me know that. Otherwise I'll so
    what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take the assignment groups so 4 and make them into
    oh. copy them into the project groups. and then groups of less than 4 individuals
    or pairs. I will makeup groups a 4 from them. So if you'd like to have a say in
    the project, groups are formed, let me know. Does that make sense. Okay?  So I'll
    have the details of the project posted next week. So you can get everything. So
    you're clear about expectations for the rest of the semester. Okay. so let's go
    back to. Has anyone heard about the Tesla recall that was just in the news? So
    test this is. I find the headline interesting? Yeah. So Company asked to recall
    2.1 9 million vehicles. It sold to correct the mistake on font size. I'm not sure
    what the pizza store has to do with the font size recall. But it's interesting.
    I suppose maybe Tesla's yeah. So I think it's. I'm not sure. Yeah, requires a
    software update, but they may have to be done at the dealership. I'm not sure
    whether individuals can download their own download and apply their own updates
    to the car. I don't think that the recall means physically taking. Well, let me.
    I'm not sure what's details of recall. Mean, I just think it's a mechanism to
    ensure that everyone gets the software update. So I just want to show you this
    picture. This is the difference. So this might be the update. So here's the update.
    So just reading these release notes at the end. you are the driver as the driver.
    You must be vigilant to the road. Keep your hands on the wheel and be ready to
    intervene to maintain safety. So an issue with lots of these updates is related
    to whether whether the fix doesn't break anything else. So I didn't an advantage
    of having the touch screen. So everything is fixable with softer updates. There's
    also a potential disadvantage, because there might be errors in the code that
    are introduced and go unnoticed until something bad happens like the Therac. 25
    example we talked about. I am curious whether this is a testless sight or not.
    it's interesting. So the first one we looked at, not at Tesla app seems to be.
    not the test. That site. anyway. let's not dwell on this. So there's there are
    web accessibility standards that are related to this. and I'll post a link to
    that as well that we can discuss further. Okay, so I have more pictures from my
    car. I'm not sure what order they're in. Okay. So auto. if it's blue. it's on.
    So? If so, this means that dual is off. So I was thinking about dual. and I found
    this this definition on an encyclopedia that seemed to be reputable. But then,
    looking at all the ads. I'm not so sure but with 2 parts, or combining 2 things.
    So I wondered, with that sense of duel? Does it make sense that we are combining
    the 2 controls? Or are we operating them separately? But then they have an example
    with dual controls? And this seems really relevant to our discussion here. 2 sets
    of controls in a vehicle, one for the person who is learning to operate a vehicle
    and one for the teacher. Yeah. So the passenger, the instructor in the passenger
    seat. could have a brake pedal to use as required. For example. so it seems clear
    that dual controls mean they're separate. So what's a way that we can make this
    more clear? Is it sufficiently clear? Or is there a way to improve it. So that's
    an interesting idea that we have separate controls. This is really the only one
    that needs to be separate. It's the question of identifying to me. It's a question
    of identifying is. is the temperature controlled together or separately? So I
    thought, maybe changing the text here, depending on what the state of this button
    is. I could delete that one. I think so. Here is a situation where the climate
    control is off, so nothing is highlighted because nothing is turned on. Does this
    screen give you any ideas about improving the feedback about the dual temperature
    controls? Let me show you the rest of them. So duel is off, and so the temp temperatures
    are the same. Duel is on. and they can be different. So if I, if I adjust the
    temperature with these arrows and it becomes different. Then the dual gets turned
    on. Okay, some interesting comments. I thought about doing a video. Maybe I should
    try that. So there's an issue with the auto being above the temperature control,
    because Otto really deals with the centre 2 columns. So this is what happens with
    the menu button. Let me show you. Okay. So here you can see, auto is reflected.
    and at least 2 areas that are the fan speed and and the fan output, whether it's
    at your feet. in your face or on the windshield. So here I've adjusted the fan
    speed manually. so. Auto only applies to the place of output. So how can we improve
    this? So my suggestion relates to when the duel is off. instead of showing the
    temperature here. adjust the display to say off. So this temperature would say
    20, and if the dual was not active. then it would say off. what do you think about
    my idea? So if we called it. if we call it temp sync. I think we need to stick
    with a 4 letter word here. not not a 4 letter word that. anyway. not just any
    kind of 4 letter word, but one that would fit on the label. So maybe if we said
    sync for this. then the sense would change. So Sync would be off when we want
    that control to be active. so maybe that there could be another solution than
    the one I proposed. If we go with that. So the comment that maybe people would
    think that they're not getting any any heating if their control is off. If the
    if the passenger sees the screen and says it's off. I'm not sure what how to convey
    that more clearly. I would think they would be able to. since the temperature
    and feel the air moving on their side of the vehicle. I would say that maybe before
    I adjusted things I would feel the temperature, the air blowing out of the out
    of the vents. Yeah. So passenger might be. Might be a good good label. Yeah. So
    there's a few options there. I think so. On the one hand. original display doesn't
    give us a lot of doesn't give us a lot of maybe enough clues to understand it
    fully. But we can interact with a display and get some feedback. So lots of good
    ideas here, I think so. What I and invite you to do is to think about how you
    might redesign the screen to make it clear when the control. when the dual control
    is active. when the passenger side control is active. and people have suggested
    other rearrangements. So if you. I invite you to make a sketch of an interface,
    and I was, gonna say, put it in the wiki. But no, let's do a class discussion
    topic about that. and maybe I'll include this screen here as as an inspiration
    for you. so we can think about discoverability and feedback as a way to to interact
    with this. So the display might not be cleared just to look at it. But we can.
    we can interact with it and understand how it operates. Okay. please reply. it's
    okay. So one thing that we haven't talked about is an empathy map. So here's the
    template for an empathy map. I'm asking to do so as you're doing the the activities
    well. as you're going through creating the activity and the resource in your own
    section of the version. In in that experimental you are courses. Course I want
    you to think about. Reflect on how you're going through things and what you're
    feeling. what you're doing, what you're thinking and what you're saying. And so
    you might think this is easy or this is hard. You might feel frustrated or empowered.
    and and then the things that you're doing like adding. clicking here and clicking
    there to accomplish a task. And if you click on the wrong thing and have to go.
    Then how do you correct that? And what you say might be once you verbalize. So
    that's a little between what you say and what you think or what user says, and
    thinks that might be a little difficult to distinguish. There's a little bit of
    guidance in the article. But you might say. What do I do here? Even if you're
    by yourself, and you're not doing something. Does anyone ever talk to themselves
    when you're frustrated with an interface or or just talk to yourself. Anyway.
    it depends. Anyway, I won't go into that. I won't attempt  sidetrack there. So
    the idea is to understand. get a sense of what the issues are. We might also think
    about dude. the heuristics that we have those 10 heuristics and trying to make
    sense of where there are issues. But idea here is not to propose a solution. It's
    to understand the issue from the perspective of the user, to say so. Part of listening
    to the users is not saying, Oh. you're having problems with this, then you just
    need to do the following. So, coming back with a ready answer. Maybe without even
    the impression of listening is is not really empathizing. So we're trying to understand
    the perspective of the user. And this is a tool. There are other tools as well
    that we can think of. This is a tool to help us understand things from the user's
    perspective. So it's about defining the problem. And then from there we can. or
    understanding the problem. And from there we can start designing things. So I
    have a couple links to processes for design. So one is. And I just wanted to show
    this graphic. So we start to emphasize. understand. explore alternatives and then
    materialize. And this is a iterative process. So we empathize, to begin with and
    define. And then another model of design design processes the Double Diamond.
    So we discover. So think about the designer stance article we we start from. We
    have a starting point, and then we do a breath search search. So we look at. we
    think in a breadth-first kind of way to understand the problem broadly and the
    user issues. And then we begin to define a solution. So we're expanding. And during
    discovery discover phase. And then. as we define a solution. we're narrowing down
    to think of what are the important pieces. And then we develop. And we're looking
    at alternatives. So we're thinking expansively here looking for ways to develop
    the solution. And then, as we get to deliver. then we're focusing on one that's
    going to meet our needs. So we start from the challenge and go to the outcome.
    And there's lots of errors to go back. So design principle number 4 is iterate,
    iterate, iterate. So lots of iteration here as well. So I'm out of time here.
    Any questions or concerns. Okay, so have a good weekend. I've have a couple things
    to read, a look at for reading. and we'll see you on Tuesday. Have a good weekend,
    and take care. Bye.

  persid: DHH
- desc: weather is always crazy and unexpected here in Regina
  persid: DHH
- desc: weather has its own mood in this city
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good morning
  persid: DHH
- desc: please be safe prof
  persid: DHH
- desc: lets hope that doesn't happen lol
  persid: DHH
- desc: It will go well
  persid: DHH
- desc: hopefully all goes well
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good morning
  persid: DHH
- desc: A bad one
  persid: DHH
- desc: probably that gold plated juicer
  persid: DHH
- desc: hard to understand design
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"probably that gold p...\" with \U0001F602"
  persid: DHH
- desc: a bad design I assume, because it does not take into account the user
  persid: DHH
- desc: An application that might work but is very user hostile
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"probably that gold p...\" with \U0001F602"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"probably that gold p...\" with \U0001F602"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Put yourself in user\u2019s shoes"
  persid: DHH
- desc: sympathy is good
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sympathy would be better but would still lack understanding of the needs of
    the user
  persid: DHH
- desc: There's a distance or separation from the designer to the user if they are
    relying only on sympathy
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"There's a distance o...\" with \u261D\uFE0F"
  persid: DHH
- desc: either sympathy or empathy takes the user's experience into account which
    is always something important to consider during design
  persid: DHH
- desc: So true Moaz, I feel like they need to start with sympathy to figure out what
    impact/problems other people have and then find ways to empathize to have a deeper
    understanding of what is needed for the actual design
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"So true Moaz, I feel...\" with \U0001F4AF"
  persid: DHH
- desc: empathy because the designer has to connect with the user in order to gain
    a perspective from their end to ultimately deliver a good design according to
    needs of the user
  persid: DHH
- desc: I feel like we almost take a sympathy approach when dealing with clients,
    as the project continues to develop we switch to empathy once the user get evolved.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good point Daryl, I guess they dont NEED to sympathize, I meant they CAN if
    the designers aren't personally connected to the problem initially
  persid: DHH
- desc: Empathy is the aways the end goal :)
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, do we email them to you?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sounds good to me
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'no'
  persid: DHH
- desc: No, what is it about?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: yes - alert icons/fonts too small as per required norms
  persid: DHH
- desc: i heard about a pizza store that got fined for having tesla in its name
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"i heard about a pizz...\" with \U0001F602"
  persid: DHH
- desc: why did they need to recall the cars couldn't they fix it via a software update?
  persid: DHH
- desc: i think it can be fixed via a software update - one of the perk of having
    software buttons i think
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"i heard about a pizz...\" with \U0001F602"
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah Tesla owners can do that. It's like a phone update basically where they
    roll the update to everyone and they can download it from the car
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah i think its has to be done at dealership cause not everyone can update
    or are aware of it and having tesla do it is a good measure to make sure maximum
    vehicles are updated
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, usually a recall just involves a very fancy letter in the mail lol.
    I got one for my car because there's a common problem with the steering analog
    buttons.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The article says "As per usual, this is not a recall in the traditional sense.
    Tesla says it will push out an over-the-air software update to correct the font
    size to comply with FMVSS, which is how it typically corrects these mistakes."
  persid: DHH
- desc: They had to do this before with the Autopilot issues.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe separating the controls by passenger, if they're meant to be separate?
    Driver vs. Passenger, or P1 vs. P2, rather than Dual?
  persid: DHH
- desc: For temperature controls, it's often preferred to have physical buttons or
    scroll wheel so it doesn't distract the driver and just the value shows on the
    screen
  persid: DHH
- desc: To be honest I feel that the climate controls are a bit too cluttered for
    a screen that is this small and responsible for controlling multiple things
  persid: DHH
- desc: the word dual makes me think both are controlled and would be the same when
    it is turned on, rather than when it is off
  persid: DHH
- desc: dual and auto are too ambiguous of words in my opinion
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"dual and auto are to...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah overall to me the distinction is weird tbh. Why does it matter whether
    dual and auto are on? To me the temperature is really the only thing that matters
    here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That's what I was saying the layout could use some cleaning/decluttering
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'my idea: reorder the buttons in a more appealing/easy-to-understand way and
    use less vague words to describe functionality'
  persid: DHH
- desc: That to me makes sense, but then I wonder if people would think that there
    is no air blowing on the second passenger at all.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Your idea sounds good. We could also rename DUAL to something like TEMP SYNC,
    since all it does is synchronizes the temperatures.
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Your idea sounds goo...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Replying to "Your idea sounds goo..."
  persid: DHH
- desc: what about passenger
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"my car has a button ...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: maybe just sync then, since we already know its temperature controls
  persid: DHH
- desc: Replying to "what about passenger"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Instead of Off we can say Synced for the passenger side, or remove the passenger
    controls altogether when SYNC is on.
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Instead of Off we ca...\" with \u261D\uFE0F"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Instead of Off we ca...\" with \u261D\uFE0F"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Instead of Off we ca...\" with \u261D\uFE0F"
  persid: DHH
- desc: another one i think is that it should have 2 buttons on top like SYNC and
    DUAL to quickly switch between modes
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes haha
  persid: DHH
