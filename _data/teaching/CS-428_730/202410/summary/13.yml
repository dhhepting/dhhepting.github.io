- desc: Morning. so how did how did ever enjoy the break? Who's loving the return
    of winter to day? I'm just publishing a few changes to the website. So I think
    I've got everything up to date with the responses and transcripts. Now.  sorry
    meeting 13. Lucky 13. Well, it's not a Friday. So we're we should be a fine. So
    this is halfway through our class. And I didn't finish it. Moving from moving
    from sort of analysis, sort of understanding what problems there are into design.
    That's what I was going to put. So here's the link for attendance. So I just wrote
    a quick response to responses. So what was the group's interface about and say,
    it's a possible project. and we'll talk about that in a book. Sorry I'm not sharing
    my screen. Who was going to let me see if there are any comments about that already?
    How long are you? Gonna but wait till you let me know that I wasn't sharing my
    screen. Okay? So there's a comment about AI and the risks of AI. Has anyone heard
    of a centre for humane, for humane technology. That's good. Which sociology class
    was that digital society? Huh? Cool? Is that a reasonable elective to take for
    computer science? Do you think? Okay. there, you have a recommendation for digital
    society from so sociology department. Okay, so center for humane technology is.
    Trista was co-founded by other people. But the 2 people who are hosting the podcast
    are Tristan Harris. I think that's his last name. He was a a designer at Google
    for many years. and Azaraskin, who's the son of Jeff Raskin, who wrote the book,
    the Humane Interface. and he's been a developer and entrepreneur. So there is
    a relationship there. So from the humane interface. we go to humane technology
    and their podcast your undivided attention. I've actually linked to the podcast
    here. So you can check that out if you like. yeah. So dangers of AI are with respect
    to that travago ad. Maybe it's alluring of the bar. the devouring of human creative
    effort. If we have an an app that can do something, an apt lends credibility.
    So did everyone watch John Oliver last week tonight. So he talked about this week's
    show he taught. He's starting season 11. Now, this is the second episode. and
    I think it's good. It might be on U. Tube by Thursday for the main story. But
    the main story was about the pig butchering scams. So what was interesting there
    is well. few things interesting, but a lot of the the scams used used apps that
    are on the app stores for Google play and and apple. And one of them was Meditator.
    which is. it's a trading app. They it's been used by scammers to lend an error
    of legitimacy to their operations anyway.  So there's risks all around. So let's
    talk about the assignment. Let's do tonight. So I wanted this. So now all group
    members don't have to submit this one submission for the group. so I haven't.
    Let's go back to your courses to the course on your courses. No. So I'm trying
    to get a screening of social dilemma in the CS. 2 80 class, this semester and
    maybe make it also available on campus. That's why I'm so. I have that tab open
    a. So I said, there is enough sections. Has anyone had trouble getting a section
    is anyone. Can you let me know if you've had trouble getting a section? Okay?
    All right. So this assignment was focused on finding the problems and not going
    into the design of finding a solution. So that's part of empathy. So we want to
    listen to the users and not come up with a quick fix to say, this is clearly this
    is what you need. It's like the toaster example again. Well, if you need a new
    toaster, here's what you need. You just need to put more curlickies on the side
    of the toaster. and that's going to fix it up. And so the so the client may have
    some ideas. and you might have some ideas, but the idea is to focus on the problems
    that you find. and there may be some good things that you see as well. So you
    can include those in your analysis in your empathy map. But when we talk about
    opportunities for redesign. so it's not the redesign that we're doing. It's just
    the problem areas that we've encountered. So at this stage, we're trying to understand
    what's going on in the application. And in the interface and and think about what
    are the problem areas. But then, as you move along further in the process. we'll
    take on ways to ways to address those issues in in a in a design effort. Does
    that make sense? So yeah, it's focusing on the problems. Okay? So I thought, I
    had a link here that I don't. So there are 3 phases here. So there's understand.
    explore and materialize. So so the project that we'll focus on will be. We're
    going to have a section about, understand. explore and materialize. So those are
    3 parts. So we'll do 1, 2, 3, and leave the HP. 8 marks. So my thinking was that
    we would use the group interface as the source of our project as the thing we're
    going to focus on for the project. Does that make sense? Okay? So  wondering if
    it's that makes sense for the project to divide it into. understand. explore and
    materialize phases. each worth 8 marks? And does it make sense to focus on the
    group interface? So it. There are many issues in the group interface, I think.
    And we can goes through goes through them again with the experiment you are courses.
    So there's a question about when we be able to do the prototype and test whatever
    redesign least, not such a short period of time. So the material. So the idea
    would be that we, you would design low fidelity, prototypes. a low fidelity prototype.
    and then we can. Well, we'll work out the details. But I understand that it's
    that the time is condensed. since we're at their midway point in the class. and
    we have the midterm coming up on Tuesday next week. So I'll take all those things
    into consideration. So yes, you can use the experimental? Yeah, ur courses. So
    about the midterm. still interested in receiving your question suggestions. So
    the questions with your suggested answers in the class discussion on Friday at
    noon. so the last assignment. So I hope that I've gone to 32 marks so far, including
    the ones due to day. The last assignment I'll deal with. Let me finish this slide.
    so it'll be about so for the midterm use zoom breakout rooms. So a format exam.
    so it's going to be online. So both exams will be online in your courses. So I'm
    not. I would tend to think it would be a closed book exam. But I'm willing to
    discuss that. And so so since you have access to the experiment with your courses.
    you can suggest different types of questions that are supported in the quizzes.
    so the midterm will be about things before the break. How's that to make it easy?
    So the things in the meetings. in our discussions and in the sources that I've
    asks you to look at all those things can. We'll form the base of our exam. So
    I'm against soliciting questions for a questions, suggestions with answers that
    would represent a fair assessment of your learning in the first half of the semester.
    So let me let me let me add another section for me. Let's add a few more just
    in case. So I'm still sharing my screen. Right? Okay? So I'm getting an error
    message. And I'm not. Let me see if more information about this error actually
    has more information. A general error occurred. Sorry we can't be more helpful
    here. You could try and copying the text that was shown and doing a web search
    with it. Wow! Has anyone gotten that message in your efforts to do the assignment?
    Let me see if I can reload it there. It's happier now. Okay, so PQ. Quiz. So when
    I create the quiz. I'm just creating the container for it. and then we can add
    questions. and the way to add questions is to go to the ad. which is not the most
    obvious place for it. So we add a new question. So we can add a question. So there's
    quite a few different ones here. I stick to the can drag and drop text. That's
    kind of that's the kind of fill in the blanks. I think there's a calculation and
    short answer, multiple choice matching. That's another good one. So I'm curious.
    I haven't checked what the other one is. What does help say?
  persid: S00
- desc: Oh.
  persid: ???
- desc: "so you might have better luck in your browser with the help to get this.\
    \ let me try it in chrome. So you see, maybe you saw that I'm using one password.\
    \ Look at my password manager. How many people are using password managers, and\
    \ which one do you would you recommend? I had used lastpass for a while, but this\
    \ is much better, I find. Let's see if we can add. let's see what happens when\
    \ we add a help. So I'm trying to get oh, sorry I'm not sharing my other screen.\
    \ So I had the idea to make it to when to zoom out. Let's see if I can zoom out\
    \ a bit more. so it's unreadable. But let's just see if I can get a bigger window.\
    \ No. So that's that's me trying to access to help. So anyway. you can, you can\
    \ feel free to be specific about the kinds of questions that you want. that you\
    \ would suggest, including the format. And you can you can you have permission\
    \ to edit in this section here in Section 30. Let's rename that. I don't know\
    \ if that's gonna cause a jam, a log jam. If more than one person's trying to\
    \ edit my quiz, but I'm sure I just changed that, and I get returned. Oh, there\
    \ it is. Okay. anyway, that gives you an idea of. I'm trying to give you an opportunity\
    \ for a hands-on work with this. Okay. so let's had an activity for group members.\
    \ So there are some groups. So let me first go and make a grouping and some groups.\
    \ So the way to access this is from participants and then go to groups. Well,\
    \ let's do groupings because we don't have. So it's nice that I can reuse groups.\
    \ And that's what I've done in our class that I've for the groups that have 4\
    \ people in them. I've just included them in the project groupings. But there\
    \ are some issues. What I want to make sure is that people are in one group for\
    \ the project and not in more than one group. And that seems to be difficult to\
    \ find. And that interface. Okay, so so I'm going to leave it. As all groups of\
    \ grouping here and now let's make some groups. So not groupings. but groups.\
    \ auto create groups. So let's make a letter number of groups. Let's say 26. We\
    \ don't run out of letters so we can control a little bit here. So then we have\
    \ to select grouping. So we have 26 groups here. Oh, I'm not sharing the oh, darn!\
    \ What happened? Oh, I must have taken the tab out of the another window. Okay,\
    \ I think I'm back on track here. So these are the groups. So that's so, this\
    \ shows everyone in their own groups. So that works all right. Now. if I want.\
    \ So we'll do a manual. So we'll do number of groups again. 26. We'll do. Yes,\
    \ for group messaging. So let's do no allocation. We'll put them in the same group\
    \ here. same grouping. So if I want to add or remove users. So this is where the\
    \ Gms Klm also comes in. So I want to add, remove users to the group. so I can\
    \ select me and then add heresis then. So we're not enough people in the class.\
    \ So I have to search everybody in 2 80 there are 266 students. So it doesn't\
    \ let me scroll through the list. I have to do a search which is at the bottom.\
    \ So I have to scroll down. And so I'm when I add student people individually\
    \ to the group. So here's the search. not picking on cadence. So there are some\
    \ issues here. I can't check the groups of the people I've added to the new group.\
    \ So it seems that the when I do a search that the selected user's membership\
    \ doesn't show up correctly. Let's test that. Yeah. If I'm picking from the list.\
    \ if it shows the selected user's membership. So here I am. We'll do one more\
    \ with. So if you remember, there were. there were 71 people. So if I want to\
    \ say. make groups. I want to divide the class into groups. What I find frustrating\
    \ is that I can't say. If I've added 6 people to the first group. then, instead\
    \ of 70, 3 people, 71 plus one plus one. there should be 67 potential members.\
    \ So there's a lot of scrolling here. and if I want to change the group membership\
    \ it. it switches from the right to the left. So that's those are just some observations\
    \ about about the group's interface. So the keystroke level model. So I went into\
    \ just bring up the different approaches we can have to analyze the interface.\
    \ So if we don't have without users present. We have a couple of options. We can\
    \ do an analysis or an analytic evaluation. So when way to do that is using the\
    \ heuristics to do a walk-through. So we might notice different things about the\
    \ interface. The things seem to be the things might be problematic or not. and\
    \ things might  might be highlighted. That aren't really issues when it's being\
    \ used and the real issues might be missed. But it's a good first step to do that\
    \ kind of analysis. So the keystroke level model is another way to approach analysis.\
    \ So here's an example. You can try this for yourselves. delete the word tell\
    \ from the third line, ensure that. and maintain a single space between words.\
    \ So here we go. So there's me doing doing the delete by positioning. So I'd hit.\
    \ So there are different timing. So it's not you. What's important is the relative.\
    \ They don't. The timings don't have to be accurate for an individual, but they\
    \ can be representative. So thinking takes the most time pointing. then homing.\
    \ So if we're moving between the keyboard and a mouse. or doing fine control.\
    \ Pressing a button is point one seconds. Keystroke is point 2 8\_s. So we get\
    \ the Klm is a thinking, pointing button button combing, picking keystrokes. 5\
    \ keystrokes. So that's so. That was 6 6\_s. Let's try another one. So that was\
    \ me double clicking on tell and deleting it. So this one oh, sorry! That's not.\
    \ The calculator isn't reflecting my own clicks there, but on the left side. This\
    \ is my information for this. So it took about a third of the time. and there\
    \ are much fewer operations. So there's a calculator there. So we get a sense.\
    \ The Klm approach gives us a sense of the relative merits of different interfaces,\
    \ so one that can rely on keystrokes. Not so much on pointing. Oh, I'm sorry I'm\
    \ 2\_min over here. so thank you for today. I should end there. If you have. Yeah,\
    \ I'll end there. I have. I'm gonna give you a video to look at. I'll update that\
    \ on the meeting page. anyway, I'll say good bye. Thank you for to day. Take care.\
    \ and if there's questions. let me know. Have a great day. Everyone stay warm."

  persid: DHH
- desc: Any fans of Last Week Tonight? (John Oliver)?
  persid: DHH
- desc: For the assignment, do all group members have to submit for their own or can
    one representative from the group submit for the entire group instead?
  persid: DHH
- desc: sounds good, thank you!
  persid: DHH
- desc: No troubles getting a section?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'No'
  persid: DHH

    we wouldn't really be able to do the prototype and test part of a redesign (at

  persid: DHH
