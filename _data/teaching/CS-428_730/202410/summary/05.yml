Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. I apologize. I wasn't keeping an eye on the clock. and then
    I had to log in again to zoom. So how's everyone doing.
  persid: S00
- desc: Morning, sir.
  persid: S01
- desc: Good morning. happy Tuesday. So it seems like spring almost again after last
    week,  okay. So let me do one thing here first, and then I'll share my screen
    OK. So I've just made heresus a co-host. He's gonna be our ta who will join us
    on Zoom calls. It'll have some availability during the semes during the week to
    supplement my office hours. So maybe heresys if you can turn your camera on and
    say, Hello.
  persid: S00
- desc: Hi, sorry. I just woke up.
  persid: S02
- desc: No worries. Yeah. I'll share my camera.
  persid: S00
- desc: 100 it's obligated. Yeah, I'll turn my camera on and be next meeting a day.
    Okay, yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: "alright. So will figure out a schedule for his office hours. and I'll put\
    \ that on  on my office hour's schedule as well. So it's in a easy to reference\
    \ spot, and then we'll add the links as required. Okay. so he'll be. And monitoring\
    \ the chat for questions. So help our discussion. So I'm not looking at 3 or 4\
    \ different windows, just one or 2 during the our meetings. Does that sound? Okay?\
    \ Okay? Well, an animated thumbs up the this new Zoom client is really making\
    \ great strides. Speaking of Zoom. Or let me share my screen. let me see if I'm\
    \ on the right screen first. and I'm not so, I mean. or I share my your desktop\
    \ here. I'll okay. I got that going now. Okay, so please don't send me direct\
    \ messages. because then I have to reset to send to everybody. so can. If you're\
    \ sending a direct message to me. can you please post it to the. to everyone.\
    \ Okay. so this is speaking of Zoom. This is what I want to show you. So I wanted\
    \ to let you know. First of all, there's a an event coming up on February 20 ninth.\
    \ We're having another installment of our computer science alumni and Friends\
    \ Virtual Lecture series. It's open to the public and  I'll show you the I'll\
    \ share. I'll get the Facebook event link here as well. But I wanted to show you\
    \ this because I wanted to get some information. So you notice if I scroll if\
    \ I mouse over the title. it turns blue like it's an active link. and then it's\
    \ got. So this also turns blue the same time the timing between 7 and 8 PM. CST,\
    \ and then I also have options to do to start. start the meeting, edit it and\
    \ or delete it. I definitely don't want to delete it. but I wanted to get some\
    \ information about the event and see how many people have registered already.\
    \ So I so because so what would I? What do you think I should do to get some more\
    \ information about the event. Any thoughts? Okay. But where should I click on\
    \ it? So what I? What I tried to do? I clicked on the time. So the time, the time\
    \ the clicking on the time isn't doing what I thought I would do, either. I thought\
    \ I was gonna give me something. Yeah, that's right. I noticed the icon is different.\
    \ So I have a feeling I don't remember exactly. I'm not going to stop our Zoom\
    \ Meeting to test this. but because I have a zoo meeting going already. I can't\
    \ start another one. It seemed to me yesterday, when I was looking at this clicking\
    \ on the Times would start that would would try and start the meeting. It was.\
    \ It was more frustrating yesterday. Now talking with you about it. It seems little\
    \ bit more reasonable. but if if this is disabled because I the start because\
    \ I have a meeting going already. then it shouldn't turn blue. and it shouldn't.\
    \ Rolling over the title shouldn't activate the other link. or if it's not a link,\
    \ if I just imagined that it was a link. it shouldn't turn blue like its link.\
    \ anyway. So I just wanted to say that I'm still behind on some administrative\
    \ things. and I'm I'll get this resolved soon with Harris's help and and other\
    \ things. So I appreciate your patience on that. So you got some. Some of you\
    \ got some email from me earlier or last night or early this morning. so I think\
    \ I'm caught up on our email. And you are. Chorus is. So please let me know if\
    \ there are any issues in that. And so Heresys will also get those emails. And\
    \ there are some things. If those are things he can address, he'll take care of\
    \ them as well. So what did anyone have any thoughts about after reading the designer's\
    \ stance. Yes. I'm very impressed with the way they do things at ideal. There\
    \ was also, that reminds me of a couple things that they've done on video. one\
    \ is designing a shopping cart. and they did it for a news program. I think one\
    \ was for 60\_min. I think that the 60\_min thing was the shopping cart. And another\
    \ time they did a video about designing a cubicle inspired by Dilbert. So I'll\
    \ look for those things and make those links available. So before okay. again,\
    \ please don't send me a direct message, because I end up. I end up replying only\
    \ to you if I don't lodge it. anyway. So I was just going to say. But there's\
    \ a comment about the quizzes timing for the quizzes. So. whereas I had originally\
    \ had the opening at midnight of the day of the meeting. I've changed them to\
    \ be 6 PM. The day before the meeting and the timing. The events should be listed\
    \ in the course calendar. Let's just check the course calendar for today. So their\
    \ sorting algorithm is at least something to be desired here, because you'd think\
    \ that the thing that closes would go before the event that continues the closest\
    \ at 1130 goes before the one that starts at 1130. So here's the response. So\
    \ between the end of class in 11 PM. To night. an then the quiz does. Oh, I guess\
    \ it's not to day cause it opens tomorrow. So let's look at the upcoming events.\
    \ Okay, so the next quiz is opening tomorrow at 6 PM. And do at 11 by 1130 before\
    \ last time. So I'm just curious. Let me see if I can do a all about that. Nope.\
    \ me see how quickly I can get this done. Okay? So I got 2 questions. Okay, sorry.\
    \ There, there's 2 questions about the quiz. so we'll leave that open for a little\
    \ bit. Let's see if we can do better than two-thirds participation. So this. So\
    \ when I get stuck at 40, 46 of 57. We're 56, excluding heresys and me. and I\
    \ wonder if some people are not at their at the Zoom Meeting are not actively\
    \ engaged in the meeting. so I know it's not always a a joy to listen to me. I\
    \ say, Ivan, do an extreme William Shatner impersonation with pauses, but I try\
    \ and do some hope to hope to make this worthwhile your time in the Zoom Meeting.\
    \ Okay. anyway. So common about the quizzes and the timing. So okay, so let me\
    \ talk about that, and then I'll talk about. Answer how the quizzes get marked.\
    \ So the idea is to encourage you to pass it. to reflect on what we've done in\
    \ in the today, in the current in today's let me back up before the start. The\
    \ next meeting a quiz gives you a chance to reflect on what was done in the previous\
    \ meeting. and look at the materials I am asking you to look at for the next meeting.\
    \ If I left it open til the end of the class meeting. then I think that people\
    \ will have a tendency to do the quiz during the meeting instead of instead of\
    \ focusing on the meeting. I'm not saying that people would do that maliciously.\
    \ but it's just. It's just the way things go sometimes to root. Well. you have\
    \ the best intentions, but maybe they don't always work out that way. Okay, so\
    \ I'm going to end the poll and share that with you. Okay, so is 6 pm. The day\
    \ before the meeting until the start of the until the start of the meeting. Enough\
    \ time. So 84% said, yes. 16% said no. And then I asked about checking the course\
    \ calendar for opening and closing times and days. So 76% said, yes, they do?\
    \ 16% said No. And then. and then 4 people answered, What is the course calendar?\
    \ So I'm going to say we're looking at it right now on the screen like that old,\
    \ old commercial that will really date me. anyway. No, I'm I'm discretion is a\
    \ bare part of valor. I'm not going to bring it up anyway. So this is the course\
    \ calendar. and let me see. I'll show you. It's also on the home page if you want\
    \ to look at directly. Why can't I move so can you see the yeah courses home screen\
    \ homepage so we can look at full calendar. And then this is really helpful here\
    \ that it's got all the classes that are that have ever set up in you our courses.\
    \ There's choices there, but here's our course. So here we are today. So yesterday\
    \ quiz 5, the quiz for today's meeting opened and it closed today, and then tomorrow\
    \ quiz for meeting, 6 will open and it'll close at the start of the meeting time.\
    \ Okay, so that's the calendar. So you can click on the links to the meeting,\
    \ or you can from the course home page. you can access it. So so you open the\
    \ drawer on the right side of the screen. Let's go back to the homepage here,\
    \ so next we'll close the drawer. open the drawer on the right pate right side\
    \ of the screen. and the calendar's the first thing. So I also have links. And\
    \ I thought, there is something taping it. Okay? So one time only thing, I will\
    \ extend the time of the availability for this quiz. Okay, so that's you're not\
    \ trying. I don't want to be unreasonable. so have we discussed it to exhaustion.\
    \ So everyone's clear on the policy and the rationale. and they know where the\
    \ calendar is now. but it'd help if I put a link in. Would it help if I put a\
    \ link on the in the general section to the course calendar. Okay? So that's let's\
    \ enjoy watching me add something to your courses. I was going to say enjoy might\
    \ be, not the right word. But so we want to add an activity or resource. And then\
    \ I'm going to add a Yeah, URL, okay, so let me. So I don't want to lose that\
    \ screen. Oh. duplicate this tab so I can select upcoming events and select this\
    \ course. So you can see this is the the arguments to the URL that will generate\
    \ it'll get to this page. So I'll copy that and last, then title so upcoming.\
    \ Yeah. So I find there's no way to sometimes finding the way back is difficult.\
    \ Just look under, general. So I'm gonna put upcoming events just under to day's\
    \ schedule. Okay? So it wasn't too bad, I think. Let's try and see it. Oh. okay,\
    \ we'll leave it there. So just test it again. So it opens in a new tab calendar\
    \ upcoming events. And from here you can adjust it to see month or today or upcoming\
    \ events. Okay? And you should get an email about the fact that it's been added\
    \ to the page. does that seem all right? Anyone give me a thumbs up. Can anyone\
    \ do that? If that's if that's what you'd like to communicate? Okay. so we'll\
    \ let Yash speak for everybody. Just kidding. That's an ethical issue we have\
    \ to be concerned with when we're thinking about. Okay. got another hand in the\
    \ sense that if we're trying, if we want to design an interface for a particular\
    \ group of people, maybe senior citizens or or kids. So this goes when, if we're\
    \ trying to have conversations about what needs to be done. and we want to test\
    \ whether our interface designs are appropriate. then we need to talk to people\
    \ from the group we're dealing with, and we want to make sure that we have a representative\
    \ sample as well. So if we, if I ask you to tell me. how well I did with my interface\
    \ for my senior citizen friends. I don't think that I am a senior citizen yet,\
    \ so just do it to make that clear. If I went on to get your you might be able\
    \ to give me some feedback about it. according to the heuristics and and things\
    \ you can observe about principles for interface design design. But you can't\
    \ represent the group to which you don't belong. and it's not fair for me to put\
    \ that on you as well. Does that make sense? So it's in the syllabus there's a\
    \ comment about you are not your user. So this is a little bit of the same thing.\
    \ We can't just substitute anybody for the our intended users cause that can get,\
    \ give us misleading information. And ultimately we don't want you like. we, if\
    \ we can get, have to have less information. but more trustworthy information\
    \ from people we know who might be using the this interface design. Then that's\
    \ better. Does that make sense of that post comments? Nothing about us without\
    \ us is a good principle to work from. says Dane. And that's I agree. Thank you\
    \ for sharing that.  okay. so toasters. So that brings me back to the the quiz\
    \ marking. So the way I'm doing setting up the marking is if it's a short answer\
    \ question. I I have a few keywords mixed in with wildcards. so I'm not trying\
    \ to get. I'm trying to give as much flexibility as possible to match key phrases\
    \ from the the text. So I'm I'm trying to  build in appropriate flexibility for\
    \ you. but sometimes I can see that I haven't done that. So if you're concerned\
    \ about a correct answer. You think, is the correct answer. But you've been. It's\
    \ been marked incorrect. Please send me a note on your courses email. and I'll\
    \ adjust the template as required. The yeah, the I'll adjust the quiz settings\
    \ and regrade them. Does that seem? Okay?"
  persid: S00
- desc: Sounds good.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay. So in the text, in that favorite story of mine about, we have to look
    at the history of bread crisping in Renaissance, France, and on the space shuttle.
    And after that we might decide that we just need what we really need to do is
    put more acerly keys on the side. But so it's a breadth-first. So it's looking
    at the problem in  in a wide sense. and then narrowing down instead of starting
    narrow, and then and then having little room to maneuver. so in terms of costs.
    So if we spend time on design and do a a thorough job of our analysis. understanding
    the design, opportunities. and the possibilities that exist from different sources
    of inspiration. But if we're doing that at a time when we haven't committed anything
    to code. then that's the most cost effective time to do it. If we realize. after
    the after we've committed some design time to building screens and having code
    to work with them. So we're become attached to the code. And we also. So even
    if we're not attached. I guess it still means we've put effort into that which
    could have been better spent in in design, where we're working with in the design
    time we spend before we get to writing code or building prototypes of toasters,
    or anything like that. Does that make sense? So you don't have to people you're
    not obliged to say yes, it makes sense. But if you have a question. please let
    me know. Okay. So I wanted to get back to the tire pressure warning example from
    last day. and it occurred to me we'll talk about this in more detail, but it's
    also interesting to think about how our understanding of how the sensors work.
    Effects are use of that information. So if we think that the pressure it that's
    displayed on the screen is accurate, then we can use it to. We can use as a tire
    pressure gauge. If it's just an indication that it seems low, then we can. We
    can. You might use it in different ways. So another example is maybe a thermostat
    which is good to think about in winter. So if we think about coming home in. maybe
    coming home early, and we have the thermostat set to be cooler because we're we've
    been away. We want to heat up the room quickly. Then how we. the model we have,
    or our mental model or understanding of the system as users. might affect, how
    we interact with the thermostatin. If there's a way to get to her out quickly.
    so you might turn it up very high. so that the furnaces where the heater is running
    full blast. and then we can turn it back to our desired temperature once we've
    gotten warm. So that that depends on how we think about how the if we understand
    how the thermal. how the furnace or the heater works. If there is a high setting.
    if if setting it to a a desired temperature to be, say 32. I'm saying 32, because
    that's the highest temperature I can get in my 2,011 Ford fusion. So I turn it
    up to the to the maximum. So maybe that's a well. maybe I should think about the
    car example as a little bit easier. so I can turn it up to 32 in my fusion. and
    I have another Ford vehicle where I can hit Max. and I just turns it to high.
    so that, and encourages the model that I can turn things on  at a high setting
    to heat it up quickly. So that's evidence that I might take with me to my home.
    But the heater or the furnace, or whatever amusing to get heat is. may not be
    operating in the same way. So make sense. Okay. we'll talk about that in more
    detail coming up. So I wanted to mention a couple interface design issues that
    are somewhat famous. Has anyone heard of the therac 25? So the idea was that was
    a radiotherapy device made by atomic energy. Canada Limited. I think it was in
    the 70 s. And 80 s. So radiotherapy is when you're giving radiation treatment
    to cancer patients. So it was based on an earlier model that had physical interlocks
    that would prevent dangerous settings. And so they were developing software. For
    this. the they had developed software to run on the machine that had also the
    physical interlocks. But then the new version. they did it away with the with
    the physical safety measures and relied on the software. So they thought the software
    was working fine in the earlier version. But really it was. They were being saved
    by the mechanical interlocks from doing harm to patients. And so there were a
    number of deaths of patients who received lethal doses of radiation and things
    like input buffer overflows. Those were the things that cause strange settings
    to be and convey to the whether the machine and because there were no more physical
    interlocks. The the patients we're not protected anymore. So the other example
    I wanted to mention briefly today. and we'll talk about some more after we look
    at. Look, look at the meetings for next meeting. Okay. So with Apollo 13. Anyone
    familiar with that that flight that was in. I think it was in 1970. I believe
    that was when I was in kindergarten. My memory serves me. Anyway, that won't be
    on the final exam. or maybe I maybe that would be a fun exam fun question. nor
    see. Anyway, the idea was there was an accident in space on their way to the moon.
    They were going to land on the moon in and do some research. But there was a problem
    when there's a spark in one of their oxygen tanks on the. and they stirred it.
    I think they were doing some routine procedures. And okay, again, I've gotten
    a direct message. So please. we send that to the bowl to everyone. anyway. So
    I'll I'll put a link for this. But the the issue was. they changed the mission
    from landing on the moon to getting everyone back home safely. and so there was
    2 parts to the vehicle. At that point they had Lunar Lander, and then the the
    crew capsule that would take them back to Earth. So they had to conserve power.
    and they also had to make the CO. 2 scrubbers from one part of the ship of the
    Configuration, the from the lunar lander work in the command module. But even
    though they were. you would think they would be interoperable. they were made
    by different contractors. so they didn't fit 1. One was square and one was round,
    I believe. So. This was depicted in the movie, Apollo 13 that's already some years
    old, but it's still a an interesting movie. anyway. So the the engineers I don't
    know if I would call it a documentary. I'm sure there's a documentary about it.
    But anyway.  So they had to. Happily they had some duct tape. They had enough  materials
    in in their craft that they could fashion away to make the CO. 2 scrubbers work
    so they didn't die because of. They had no had no oxygen to breathe. anyway. So
    it's a happy ending. And I will put some links up for that as well. Okay. so we're
    about at a time here. So we've started to think about industrial designs will
    be looking at not a bit more. We'll look at a few more case studies next day.
    So the ideal chapter is a good example of the industrial design approach. So also
    put some links up about ideal. I can find those videos online. anyway, any other
    comments or questions before we go. so is everyone clear about the quizzes. So
    the responses are due. Starting now until 11 PM. And in the quiz starts at 6 Pm.
    Tomorrow and ends at the start of class time to the next day on Thursday. Okay.
    thanks for today. If anyone wants to put the camera on and wave feel free to do
    so. Oh, wait! Oh, I'm not in the frame. Very well. Okay. Have a great day. Take
    care. See you on Thursday. Okay, take care. Everyone bye.

  persid: DHH
- desc: -5C
  persid: DHH
- desc: hello sir
  persid: DHH
- desc: Many of us have a scheduling conflict with the current quiz timings as they
    overlap with another lecture. This consistently leads to us missing quizzes. Could
    we kindly request a timing adjustment to better accommodate our schedules?
  persid: DHH
- desc: ok sir !
  persid: DHH
- desc: can we please make HCC quiz timing after our lec ?
  persid: DHH
- desc: click on it?
  persid: DHH
- desc: click the title link?
  persid: DHH
- desc: not the time the title
  persid: DHH
- desc: The title
  persid: DHH
- desc: the title yeah
  persid: DHH
- desc: click the title because it shows as a hyperlink
  persid: DHH
- desc: click the title as the arrow cursor becomes a finger pointer
  persid: DHH
- desc: I liked the quote "dream beyond what exists, as opposed to fixing what exists"
  persid: DHH
- desc: I really liked his perspective on design, especially how his teams work on
    a new project
  persid: DHH
- desc: Broad and diverse teams working smaller sounds like an interesting way to
    approach a problem, and also allowing a leader to emerge naturally.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I also liked how they research a new design project from a broad perspective
    and then narrow it down to the specific details and information.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I thought it was interesting how engineers were compared to designers, I always
    just thought engineers did both aspects, but they have contrasting approaches
  persid: DHH
- desc: Please,Sir can again open today quiz so remaining  students like me can attempt
    quiz.
  persid: DHH
- desc: the quiz answer was quite varied and would be between joy of creativity through
    the perspective of design, however if you can consider those answers as well,
    sir?
  persid: DHH
- desc: it will be great if it closes after the HCC lec ...
  persid: DHH
- desc: The specified correct answer for the today's quiz seems too specific. If those
    exact words are not in the answer then quiz is marked wrong.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir can please open for us remaining students to attempt today quiz ?
  persid: DHH
- desc: It's clear to me, but I can't speak for anyone else.
  persid: DHH
- desc: would be helpful ya
  persid: DHH
- desc: '"Nothing about us without us" is a good principle to work from imo'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes professor
  persid: DHH
- desc: "The warning should be taken as not much more than just a warning, the readings\
    \ are never 100% accurate since they aren\u2019t plugged into the tire via the\
    \ valve stem, it\u2019s an estimate at best."
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have, yes
  persid: DHH
- desc: Nope
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yup!
  persid: DHH
- desc: There are a couple different examples specifically related to radiation therapy
    and older designs. They are all very interesting
  persid: DHH
- desc: Wasn't that the situation where they had the engineers all stay in the same
    room till the issue was solved?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I've seen the Apollo 13 documentary with Tom Hanks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Best documentary of all time \U0001F602"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Best documentary of ...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"I've seen the Apollo...\" with \U0001F605"
  persid: DHH
