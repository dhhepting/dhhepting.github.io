- desc: Good morning. How's everyone today?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Pretty good.
  persid: S00
- desc: That's good to hear.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S02
- desc: Morning. happy Thursday or last Thursday of January. So let me bring up or
    share my screen for and bring up the meeting. Sorry I'm dealing with a little
    bit of clutter. Here. let's say it's not my own doing. Okay? So here we are on
    at meeting 6 of 26. So there's the attendance link for you to record your own
    attendance. So I did upload the responses, but I didn't. I had an issue. I had
    to. I forgot something at home. But I just wanted to show you that transcript
    is there, and the responses are there. Okay? So and I've uploaded the transcripts
    for the other meetings we've had, so far as well. So it should be up to date.
    So any thoughts about our last meeting. So just a comment about the way I've gotten
    some formatting issues here. I'm writing this in Jason. So it's I'm writing it
    in Json and Markdown. So it's a Json file with Markdown and formatting in it.
    So I suppose I can just show you that. And I can correct that formatting issue
    in all. Update the web site here. I'm looking for the window here. I want to show
    you should be. I was looking for under the wrong name. So we Vs code shows up
    his coat, and I realized the windows were except alphabetically organized. And
    so each of these lines. So I've had the today's outline. and I'm making a list.
    So in Markdown I have a bullet point. and then I have a new line. and then a tab
    character to make a sublist or a bullet point of a sublist. and the issue was
    that I didn't have a space between thee asterisk and link. So it didn't understand
    it as a as a list. So I corrected that so open square bracket is a link label.
    Close is the end of the label, and then open parentheses is the URL, and then
    this flavor of mark down lets me say, open a new, a new window a new tab. So that's
    what what's inside the brace is after the you are out in the close parentheses.
    So then another new line and the tab. And this is another list item. So this is
    a description of the idea of shopping cart from the ideal website. Okay, so that's
    that. save it. Wish it to the website?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Not a love syntax.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah. Well. I've changed this this semester. I used to have a llamo file.
    but I was a little bit more restrictive than I wanted. So this gives me more flexibility.
    but it doesn't. So I have a link to tell me when I'm have a problem with Json.
    I don't have a lint for the markdown that I'm putting it into the Json file. So
    magically we should see it change. Okay, so that's that's been corrected. Now.
    So there's a okay. So this is a gives a bit of a history of the praise, nothing
    about us without us. And this is the idea of shopping cart. So let's take a look
    at the idea of shopping cart. So they did. A, a, 1999 episode of A, B C's late
    night show called Nightline. And they've they noticed they've have a link to the
    official source of the video which gives streaming rights for 3 years for only
    a hundred, $99. We can get DVD plus 3 year streaming for 2, 99, or a DVD. For
    1 99, so as much as I'd like to support the film media group and ABC, and there's
    also a Youtube video. Let's just take a peek at that
  persid: DHH
- desc: '100'
  persid: ???
- desc: it used to be that you just can you refer to the boss? The boss is all. Does
    that translate? Well, if I play that in in in our shared. I share the video playing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah. The audio is coming through.
  persid: S00
- desc: Always gonna have the best ideals. I'm not loud. So should we watch it?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Mean. I can't speak for everybody, but I'm down for it.
  persid: S00
- desc: It wouldn't be right for me to take your  your agreement as speaking for everybody.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah. Come on. Nothing about us without us, hey?
  persid: S04
- desc: Exactly. Maybe we should have a pole.
  persid: S00
- desc: Okay?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think a lot of people in the chat are saying Yes, anyways, with more than
    a couple of people, I think. But the majority is saying that we should watch it.
    So
  persid: S02
- desc: okay. I'm going to. Okay. You can time. Me, how much, how long it takes him
    to do this! So how was my time doing the quiz? They're doing the pull? Oh, pardon
    me, it's not a pole any more. It's a survey
  persid: DHH
- desc: quick and efficient.
  persid: S00
- desc: "Thank you. So who felt pressure to say yes after it started, and you saw\
    \ how many responses. I guess he didn't see the responses until you. I shared\
    \ it with you. hey? So now we don't have time to watch the video anymore. After\
    \ all that just kidding here, nimble fingers, alert minds, and tireless machines,\
    \ and it used to be in most companies that chaos was discouraged. This is where\
    \ the crazies live. This is where we do our work. Good morning. Good morning.\
    \ Used to be. You were supposed to climb the corporate ladder status is who comes\
    \ up with the best ideas. Not who's the oldest? Not who's who's been with the\
    \ company longest? Not not who has that biggest title? If you go into a culture,\
    \ and there's a bunch of steps going around. I can guarantee they're luck. They're\
    \ not likely to invent anything. You could stack this up big as big as you want.\
    \ That's great. Thanks a lot. We had a great time today. Well, forget the way\
    \ it used to be tonight. The deep dive, one Company's secret weapon or innovation.\
    \ Too many things going on here. Not further along in this broadcast, near the\
    \ end. As a matter of fact, you still see the video central character suggest\
    \ that we look around. The only thing that's not designed by anybody, he will\
    \ say, is nature. Actually, you could say the same thing by observing that the\
    \ only designs that don't require constant modification are the ones we find in\
    \ nature. But the point is well taken from the buildings in which we live and\
    \ work. To the currents we drive, or the knives and forks with which we eat. Everything\
    \ we use was designed to create some sort of marriage between form and function?\
    \ Does it work? And can we make it look interesting or attractive? What is truly\
    \ amazing is how long we tend to put up with things that may not work particularly\
    \ well, or may look especially unattractive, simply because we're accustomed to\
    \ them, and because no one has ever suggested redesigning those things. There's\
    \ an interesting distinction between design and invention. Whoever came up with\
    \ the idea of dental Floss, for example, was an inventor, but the man or woman\
    \ who put it inside that clever little plastic box that lets you tear off just\
    \ the right length. That was a designer. Now, how does the process of designing\
    \ a better product work. And would it be interesting to watch that process when\
    \ we first broadcast this program back in February, we weren't at all sure what\
    \ you would think. But judging by the number of you who ordered videocassettes\
    \ of the program and the number of people who contacted the industrial product\
    \ design firm that is featured in this program. You liked it a lot. Here was the\
    \ premise of the program. We went to ideal the product design folk, and said,\
    \ Take something old and familiar like, say the shopping cart, and completely\
    \ redesign it for us. In just 5 days. ABC. News correspondent, Jack Smith tells\
    \ us what happened next. 9 in the Morning Day one, and these people have a deadline\
    \ to meet. So welcome to the kickoff of the Shopping Heart Project. This is Palo\
    \ Alto, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley, and these are designers at\
    \ Ideo. Probably the most influential product development firm in the world designers\
    \ are the reason Tvs have square screens, chairs, fore legs, and toothbrushes.\
    \ Nowadays, those squishy handles. In fact, it was ideal that designed those squishy\
    \ handles. Ideo has designed everything from high tech medical equipment. 25 foot\
    \ mechanical whale in the movie, Free Willie and the first computer mouse for\
    \ Apple Smith, ski goggles, sunglasses, and he see computer screens. hundreds\
    \ of products we take for granted. This is a called the neat squeeze squeeze Toothpaste\
    \ Tube, which you would visit the man who runs Ideo is Dave Kelly Stanford engineering\
    \ Professor Mark's mustache to have a genius and an approach to innovation that\
    \ usually works, but not always. I can say some products have failed. came up\
    \ with this idea called monster Shoes, where you take these little monsters and\
    \ lace them into your shoes like this, and we built a bunch of them. And I didn't\
    \ want those either. So mostly what I do designs, though, does work, and it works\
    \ very well. Dave and his design teams create about 90 new products every year.\
    \ The point is that we're not actually experts at any given area. We're kind of\
    \ experts on the process of how you design stuff. So we don't care if you give\
    \ us a toothbrush, a toothpaste tube tractor, a space shuttle, you know a chair.\
    \ It's all the same to us. We like want to figure out how to innovate in in by\
    \ using our process applying it. And so for the next 5 days the team will apply\
    \ that process to bringing the supermarket shopping card into the 20 first century.\
    \ I think first, we should maybe all acknowledge that it's kind of insane to do\
    \ an entire. An entire project in a week. Project leader is Peter Skillman, a\
    \ 35 year old Stanford Engineer project leader because he's good with groups,\
    \ not because of seniority. He's only been at Ideo for 6 years. The rest of the\
    \ team is eclectic, but that's typical here Whitney, Mortimer, Harvard, and MDA.\
    \ Peter Coughlin, linguist, Tom Kelly, Dave's brother, marketing expert, Jane\
    \ Fulton Surrey, psychologist, Alex Kazakh's 26 a Biology, major who's turned\
    \ down medical school 3 times because he's having much fun at Ideo. It's climbing\
    \ up and doing this safety emerges early as an important issue. 22,000 child injuries\
    \ a year, which is. And so they're hospitalized injuries. I mean there. There\
    \ are many others and theft. It turns out a lot of carts are stolen. What is the\
    \ average life of a car? Does it last 2 years? 5 years? 10 years! And and how\
    \ big is this stuff? Say, 10 Am. As the team works it becomes clear there are\
    \ no titles here, no permanent assignments. The other side says it gives a lot\
    \ of help. Be safe to be equal. They love to mock corporate America. I'll give\
    \ you status. I'll give you a big red ball on a, on a, on a, on a post, and that\
    \ says you're a big guy. You got a ball, your senior vice president, you know.\
    \ What do I get of the desk, red Ball? It's all same in a very innovative culture.\
    \ You can't have a kind of hierarchy of Here's the boss and the next person down\
    \ the next person down the next person down, because it's impossible that the\
    \ boss is the one who's had the insightful experience with shopping carts is just\
    \ not possible. According to Kelly, even employees who merely listen to the boss\
    \ don't have that much, either. See? Gotta hire people who don't listen to you,\
    \ and that I don't think corporate America wants to hear that right? Yet. The\
    \ team splits into groups to find out first hand what the people who use make\
    \ and repair shopping carts really think, okay. yeah. And these things have been\
    \ clocked at 35. It cost a function. Well, that's actually pretty good point.\
    \ The the trick is to find these real experts, and so that you can learn much\
    \ more quickly than you could by just kind of doing in the normal way and trying\
    \ to learn about it yourself from everything I read. These things. Aren't that\
    \ safe, either. you know. So probably the seat itself is gonna have to be redesigned.\
    \ What you're seeing here is the kind of social science, like anthropologists,\
    \ you know, like you go and study tribes. What is it that they do that we can\
    \ learn from that will help us design a better card. One of the interesting things\
    \ for me is looking at how people really don't like to let go of the card. Except\
    \ for the professional shopper, whose strategy is to leave the cars at various\
    \ places in corporate America. Many bosses like measure, whether they're whether\
    \ their people are, you know who the good people or the people who are performing\
    \ the ones that they see at their desk all the time. That couldn't be further\
    \ from the truth. People who are really giving the information are out here talking\
    \ to the buzzes of the world, going to to meet other experts much more useful\
    \ than signature. Desk 3, 30 in the afternoon, and the group is back at Ideo.\
    \ There is no letup. Each team is going to demonstrate and communicate and share\
    \ everything that they've learned today. People went off in the 4 corners of the\
    \ earth and coming back with the golden keys to the innovation. Yeah. Shopping\
    \ cart has been clocked at 35 miles an hour, traveling through a parking lot in\
    \ the way we were in the store like 2\_h, and and it was truly frightening just\
    \ to see the kind of stuff going on you had to designate some people to make damn\
    \ sure that the storage point of view is represented after 9 straight hours. The\
    \ team is tired, they call it a day. So right cool. Well, that's great. Thanks\
    \ a lot. We had a great time today. Next. I've worked with some of the largest\
    \ retailers in the planet. We think they all have it figured out the shopify really\
    \ does. You can build a totally custom application. And by doing that year over\
    \ year we've been able to dramatically increase conversion rate. And that's get\
    \ together and start here. They, too, at the start of Ideo's unique brand of brainstorming.\
    \ They call it a deep die. If a sort of total immersion in the problem at hand.\
    \ Ideos mantra for innovation is written everywhere. One conversation at a time,\
    \ stay focused, encourage wild ideas, defer judgment, build on the ideas of others.\
    \ But that's the hardest thing for people do is to restrain themselves from criticizing\
    \ an idea. So if anybody starts to nail an idea, they get the bill. Hmm! The deep\
    \ dive begins, and for the next few hours the ideas pour out and are posted on\
    \ the walls. Oh, the blind, the privacy blind like when you're buying 6 cases\
    \ of condoms, it sort of has to nest. If it doesn't nest. we don't have a solution.\
    \ Call wild ideas and end up being better ideas than if you said if you if everybody\
    \ only came up with same things, you know, kind of appropriate things you'd never\
    \ like have any points to take off to, to build a a really innovative idea. It's\
    \ not organized chaos. By 11 Am. The group begins narrowing down the hundreds\
    \ of ideas written or drawn on the wall, how? By voting for them both? An idea\
    \ that's cool and buildable. if it's too far out there and can't be built in a\
    \ day. Then I don't think we should go to. Why not have you be the judge, or because\
    \ because I'm I'm gonna be wrong. It's the team that that's able to really judge\
    \ with the best idea. Enlighten trial and error succeeds over the planning of\
    \ the lone genius. If anything sums up Ideos approach. That is it that at the\
    \ focused chaos that seems to go with it. I took a point of view. I call it the\
    \ sport, utility, vehicle, cart. It is noon worried that the team is drifting,\
    \ but can only be called a group of self-appointed adults. Under Dave Kelly holds\
    \ an informal side session. We don't want to tell them what to build, or else\
    \ we take away the benefit of the whole thing right? What needs to, they optimize\
    \ their solution. The purpose is to refocus the deep dive. Maybe we arbitrarily\
    \ say 3 to 5 teams. 4, 5, 4, 5 teams forget a week, and we give each team a need\
    \ area. Hey? Can we? Grab everybody over to the wall? Here there has to be a command\
    \ decision. It becomes very autocratic for very short period of time, and defining\
    \ what things people are gonna work on like it or not, the team is told. It will\
    \ split into groups to build markups covering 4 areas of concern that have been\
    \ identified shopping safety checkout and finding what you're looking for, I noticed\
    \ that toward the end of the process the adults took over. Yeah, that's because\
    \ we we have no choice but to to stop that cycle. I mean, there's if you don't\
    \ work under time constraints you, you could never get anything done because it's\
    \ a messy process and go on forever while the team starts building prototypes.\
    \ Dave Kelly takes me on a tour of the rest of Ideo. What's happening in here\
    \ is that's a client meeting. That's a first climbing. That's the first time we\
    \ met with the client, so we haven't trained them yet. If we took them straight\
    \ from there into a room where music was blaring and everybody was throwing nerve\
    \ darts at each other. That would be a little hard to take, you know. So we're\
    \ warming them up. But this is this is where the crazies live. This is where we\
    \ do our work. It's different. You can tell with their places playful in about\
    \ the first 15\_min, as you walk down the hall. Being playful is a huge importance\
    \ for being innovative. I mean, if you go into a culture and there's a bunch of\
    \ stiffs going around. They're not. I can guarantee they're like they're not likely\
    \ to invent anything, invent anything like this futuristic looking instrument\
    \ for kids. So no matter what you do it. I think you always sound great. You always\
    \ sound good. You have to make it so that this can happen. Whoa! Is that a break.\
    \ No, it didn't break. There is a whole department at Ideo devoted to toys turns\
    \ out to be one of its most profitable areas. Fun, too. So got these little wings,\
    \ and no matter what you do. if I get in trouble here. it's always a spiral. At\
    \ Ideo they found that fresh ideas come faster in a fun place. And not only is\
    \ the furniture on wheels to suit the needs of the moment, but people are encouraged\
    \ actually to build their own work areas. And they were designed this space. And\
    \ they said to me, You know, we'd like to have, you know, $4,000 extra in our\
    \ budget for a DC 3, wing. And I said that, DC, do you have to have that? And\
    \ they said, Yeah, they have to have it. So. DC, 3 wing. Yeah, that's just the\
    \ core. That's the car. That's Ambiance. You know, that says we're weird. And\
    \ we're proud of them umbrellas on the ceiling to shade computer screens from\
    \ direct sunlight and bicycles on ropes to prevent clutter. The first guy who\
    \ hung a bike up on a thing he didn't come to me and ask me. He didn't ask some\
    \ facilities person. Okay. He tried it, and then, like he waited and see if anybody\
    \ complained. If nobody complained that a guy hung a bike up. and pretty soon\
    \ everybody's got their bike stuff, and nobody's complained right? So it's that\
    \ whole thing of try and stuff and ask forgiveness, you know, instead of asking\
    \ permission, this is the way people come up with new ideas. Ideo has such a reputation\
    \ for innovation that client companies are increasingly asking Dave not just for\
    \ new products, but also to remake their corporate cultures. You may be looking\
    \ at the workplace of the future here. It's one thing to be able to do a product\
    \ once in a while. But if you can build a culture and a process where you routinely\
    \ come up with great ideas. That's what the companies really want. It is 60'clock,\
    \ for Mark ups already, for showing baskets also can be. If you think we will\
    \ have more volume. Baskets can be put in. A modular shopping cart gets you through\
    \ the traffic, jam a checkout. a scanner on the shopping cart. So if you, as the\
    \ customer, as you pull it off the shelf. would scan each item, one that's built\
    \ around child safety and another that lets shoppers talk to the supermarket staff\
    \ remotely. But the adults again decide. More work needs to be done before the\
    \ mock ups can be combined into one last prototype. Well, we have all the parts\
    \ come up here for a second. I think it'd take a piece of each one of these ideas\
    \ and kind of back it off a little bit and then put it in the yeah. In the design.\
    \ The design is still not there. But there's another motto at Ideo fail often\
    \ in order to succeed sooner some of the team will be up half the night trying\
    \ to put together a design that finally does work. So when you write your tone\
    \ influences. How readers respond whoops with Gramerleen. Just highlight your\
    \ text and type. How you want to sound it is day 5, and Dave Kelly has no idea\
    \ what the final card looks like, only the team does. If they kind of got their\
    \ heads down, they don't look at me. I'm nervous, you know, if they say Wait,\
    \ you see it. Then I know we're in good shape, so I'm getting. Wait until you\
    \ see it. I think it's that'll be good. We took the best elements out of each\
    \ prototype. designed this entire cart in a day. And then this card, this fabricated\
    \ day with an amazing team of people on machine shop pulling yourself working\
    \ in ships throughout the night. Well, I'm impressed. So we, the cart which is\
    \ designed to cost about the same as today's cart is different in every other\
    \ way, and baskets that stack in the metal frame and major improvements for all\
    \ you. You just lift the handle up. You drop it, put the children in, and then\
    \ you can close the the the handle right over them, and they instantly have some\
    \ little bit of a work surface that they can play with. What do you think? Process\
    \ stuff? Well, I I'm very proud of the team. I think it's it's great. This does\
    \ this work for you works for me? Great! It's also beautiful, I mean, let's, you\
    \ know, take it over to a local supermarket and see what they say. Wheels turn\
    \ 90 degrees so it could move sideways no more, lifting up the rear in a tight\
    \ spot, and you shop in a totally different way rather than taking a call. Everywhere\
    \ you go install through crowded store like this much more efficient to take a\
    \ small basket, rush around to where this the particular shelves are. Come back\
    \ and put them back. Put them here. Treat this as like a center for your shopping.\
    \ and with a high tech scanner, so that in the future you skip the checkout traffic\
    \ jam and then drop it in my basket because stores don't yet have those high tech\
    \ scanners. The team designed checking out today means doing it the old-fashioned\
    \ way. but the bags are hung on hooks on the cart's frame. Remember, there is\
    \ no basket here. Why get rid of a big basket? The basket is tyranny. The basket\
    \ is tyranny, because it's not really needed. If all your stuff ends up in bags.\
    \ Why need the basket? In the first place. there is no value in this card without\
    \ the basket, because you can't carry anything. It's useless to anybody. Barbecue.\
    \ So it's not gonna get stolen. That's right. So this auto field is stolen. Okay.\
    \ yes, I was a little shocked. But I think it's you have some fantastic ideas\
    \ here, indeed, a little refining, but I think that it's great. I mean we would.\
    \ We would want them and she also gave us some really good comments about how\
    \ we could make this thing better just wherever you are. Look around. The only\
    \ thing that's not designed by somebody you like is nature. So the trees are not\
    \ designed by us, but everything you see, everything is to every light, fitting,\
    \ every flower, base, every scale, every stand for fruit. Everything is designed\
    \ has to go through this kind of process, and they can do a better or a better,\
    \ worse job of innovating or improving, but everything is designed has to go through\
    \ this process. It wasn't effortless. Oh, my God! So that's how it works that\
    \ I saw there. It was hard work. It's a lot of hard work. We all love it so it\
    \ doesn't look like it's hard work, but it's live hours, a lot of hours. It's\
    \ also an open mind boss who demands fresh ideas, be quirky and flash with it\
    \ a belief that chaos can be constructive and teamwork great deal of teamwork.\
    \ and these the recipes about innovation takes place. This is Jack Smith for Nightline\
    \ Palo Alto, California. I'll be back with a brief update on our story in just\
    \ a moment. Incidentally, the nightline shopping card won a silver award in the\
    \ industrial design excellence awards. And there's talk now of developing it commercially.\
    \ That's our report for tonight. I'm Ted Carpel in Washington for all of us here\
    \ at ABC. News. Hmm. Wix, for my business, because of its massive scope for functionality\
    \ and freedom of creation. So it's actually 25 years old or soon to be 25. It's\
    \ 24 right now, I guess. although originally aired in February, so February of\
    \ 99. So it's almost 25 still seems quite relevant. Any thoughts about that. You'd\
    \ like to share. Then, in the in the chat."
  persid: DHH
- desc: I mean, I guess another problem that I kind of see with that shopping card
    is, say, you have something big. You have 6 baskets, and then you got the bottom
    part, which is usually used for, like softener salt, or something like that. But
    say, you buy. I don't know a big thing of toilet paper. Now it's gonna be up and
    out, and it might be awkward, I guess, with the cart
  persid: S00
- desc: Umhm
  persid: DHH
- desc: door if it fits in the basket right? You can only technically put what you
    can in the size that you're given.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah. And then if they put a shelf on the bottom. then it's becomes more valuable
    again as a item for theft. Maybe the shelf could be removable, or yes, and then
    that becomes a an issue of managing the carts afterwards. So if you have, if you
    take a card out with a shelf on it. then the store has to manage getting it back
    into the store right away. or it gets before somebody grabs it. Then I suppose
    somebody might steal it with the idea of making their own shelf or basket for
    it. That's maybe that's maybe a different demographic than they've traditionally
    had to worry about for stealing carts. These are some good. These are some interesting
    ideas. Certainly.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I mean, even if you look at like the functionality of a shopping cart, what
    do we do? We take one from outside in the parking lot in a corral. Then we take
    it inside, fill it up and bring it back out with this one. I feel like they would
    have to have the baskets inside. so you might have to go outside. Fill your car
    up. go back in, drop the baskets off to then take the framework and put back outside.
  persid: S00
- desc: Well, I think we would take it out with bags on the hooks. so you wouldn't
    have the baskets anymore. They would keep the baskets at the till. But then, if
    you scanned everything. and so you don't need to go to the checkout. then that's
    a question of how that would. how you would transition from having the baskets
    and  because you would go out to your car with the baskets. Presumably you wouldn't
    have a station to transfer the baskets into bags. So that would be another issue.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think, another issue. I think that is a valid concern. Is that not a lot
    of people nowadays, if they're used to something they don't like change. People
    don't like change. They don't want change.
  persid: S04
- desc: And I think
  persid: ???
- desc: if I were to like, give an estimate, I would say, maybe like at least 40%,
    if not more of people would say, Bring back the old shopping cards. We don't like
    this. We don't like changing on things to stay the same as they were before. We
    want them to be predictable, we don't want any of this new stuff
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah I can see that certainly as well. So it's this was done as an an exercise
    to to illustrate the design process. and there are certainly issues with, you
    know, child, safety and and and safety of.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I guess another thing you could say is that toddlers usually end up in the
    bucket of the carts nowadays if they're too big for the little spots by the handlebars.
    So you you couldn't have that either, with those carts which some parents wouldn't
    like. But obviously I don't think those parents care too much about their kids
    safety if they're just toss him in the bucket. But I don't know
  persid: S04
- desc: you could hang them on the hangers or on the hooks.
  persid: S00
- desc: So what do you think about the Velcro pants and the Velcro seed idea?
  persid: DHH
- desc: It's great until they wriggle themselves free.
  persid: S04
- desc: I just remembered David Letterman. He once wore a Velcro suit and jumped onto
    a Velcro wall. I'll have to see if I can find that video
  persid: DHH
- desc: feel like that also comes down to safety, though, because if your kids Velcroed
    into a seat and that cart magically falls over. I mean, given the kids should
    be strapped in period. I mean it. Yeah, they're gonna basically be stuck to an
    object that's going to be crashing to the floor.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah, what if the shopping Spart or shopping cart decides to spontaneously
    combust? Then you don't want your kids trapped to Velcro?
  persid: S04
- desc: I'm gonna have to cart tip over. But I guess that's a possibility. Right?
    Anyway, I just
  persid: DHH
- desc: it seems like more of a possibility with that redesigned cart, because it's
    a lot narrower and taller meaning, it would probably have a higher center of mass,
    making it easier to tip. I feel like traditional carts as long as you have something
    on that like bottom rack. they're they're pretty difficult to tip.
  persid: S04
- desc: Yeah. these are certainly good ideas.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I was gonna say, like the carts kind of lightweight in that design. I do agree
    with Braden, like the old carts are steel bodies. They're heavy, they're rugged.
    They're meant to be. you know, stationary and stable. That one does look like
    wind would blow it over.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah. But again, it's got the the pivoting wheels on all 4 wheels, right?
    So then it's like not quite as easy to tip over unless you push directly from
    the top. because there's no like resistance from the back wheels of the cart.
    If you're pushing from the side
  persid: S04
- desc: now. But we know over the course of time those wheels get, whether exactly
    they get stuck and whatever else. So
  persid: S00
- desc: yeah. And then, if they're supposed to be cheap and effective. Then you can't
    always be doing maintenance on them.
  persid: S04
- desc: And with the 90 degree wheels it seems like that. That's a bigger risk for
    having rogue carts in the parking lot with the limited mobility of the current
    wheels. They don't just. They wouldn't just blow any which way. or get blown any
    which way by the wind.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If anyone's been shopping in Calgary, they probably know that sometimes there's
    slight inclines in all the parking lots, so that that could be a problem, too,
    just without the wind present.
  persid: S04
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it kind of comes back to what we were talking about with our readings.
    You know, designers. They believe in their own design. They don't really look
    beyond the actual aspects of the the design. I can see why they like it, it makes
    sense. But in accountability to other people actually using it there's things
    that they missed in my point of view
  persid: S00
- desc: well, it's like met manufacturers making like a super fast car, like super
    cars and stuff, and expecting people to follow. You know the the the laws of the
    road, or, you know, not speeding them, even though they're very capable of those
    things. It's like they put too much faith in their consumer base or something.
  persid: S04
- desc: Well, we can also think about Elon Musk and the Tesla car is, with the autopilot
    feature exactly made claims about. It's reliability that have been unfounded.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think there have been tickets handed out for people sleeping with autopilot
    on.
  persid: S04
- desc: Well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: "I mean the Tesla's do have the feature that you're supposed to touch the\
    \ steering wheel every what 1520\_min, or whatever else, when you're an autopilot,\
    \ just to make sure that you're aware and stuff. I mean, I'm giving him the benefit\
    \ of the doubt. He's the first one to really kinda venture into the space of AI\
    \ car driving and everything else. So is there going to be flaws in the beginning,\
    \ 100%. Could he make it better possible?"
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah, it's it's an issue, certainly with. I want to say in. there's an element
    of being careful not to let a genie know the bottle. So we're doing innovative
    things. But then we have to also be concerned with what the new technology that
    we're developing has a potential to do to  Well, its impact on society, I guess.
    So I think there's some ethical considerations there as well.  so I went into
    speaking about the reading I gave you yesterday or last day.  so I just wanted
    to bring up the idea of the designer, the user and the system image. So we have
    the idea that the designer of the system is or has a a conceptual model of how
    the system should work. and for the designer it may be very elegant. and everything
    makes sense. And the designer's expectation is that the user has the same model
    of the system so they can appreciate the elegance of it. However. the user doesn't
    have the benefit of the of seeing the whole conceptual model in. and it may may
    be an elegant conceptual model. but the user doesn't have access to it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The
  persid: ???
- desc: their mental model of the interface is being developed in an ad hoc way. So
    they experience something. And so then they develop their mental model based on
    their experience with the interface. So the designer might expect that the user
    has the same model. There's no way to communicate the conceptual model to the
    user except through system image. which is the documentation and the other features
    of of the softer or the device. And so some of those messages don't get sent are
    received very clearly. So a mental model is for the user as a, because it comes
    from experience with the interface. We can talk about designers encouraging the
    user to develop a certain model of mental model about the interface by using metaphors.
    So for example, in shopping. online shopping. we have  we might. if there are
    some people still who have not haven't had experience with online shopping. You
    might say it's like going to a store or a grocery store. pushing your cart down
    the aisle and picking out the items you'd like to buy and going to check out.
    So in that way we're encouraging a metaphor of the the bricks and mortar experience
    of going to visit the physical store. and the idea that metaphor is encouraging
    a certain encouraging the user to develop a mental model that's consistent with
    the designer's intent or a designer's conceptual model. But we as designers, we
    can't enforce or force the users to adopt the mantle model or the metaphor and
    the mental model that that we prescribe. so we can encourage the users so we could
    say. it's we kin put pews in the on line shopping experience that make the encourage
    the connections with shopping in a bricks and mortar store. But we can't say we
    can't make the user follow those cues that we've given. They still might have
    some other experience with the they might experience the interface in a different
    way that we haven't encountered accounted for. So that so that's where the design
    issues come up in particular. And when we have the. when we need to actually talk
    to users. and that gets us to the point. nothing about us without us. So we need
    to talk to users. understand how they see the problem and have conversations that
    get us to the point of understanding. And and it's okay to fail in some early
    designs. because they'll ultimately let us succeed more quickly and build a better
    solution. Ultimately. does that make sense. hey? So I'm going aside from the Dave
    of Largen video.  I'm going to add a couple more videos as well. I won't. So I've
    I've indicated looking at Chapter 5 of the psychology online resource. And I've
    put the link in in the or next meeting. So that's getting on to our next topic.
    So we'll still continue with her discussion of of the Dawn Norman book chapter
    one in in the next week. But I'll I'll look. I'll put some videos up that you
    you can explore on your own. Well. yeah, I'll do that, and maybe we'll watch another
    video on Tuesday. a shorter one. So I've been getting better with my zoom office
    hours. I did had zoom open Monday and Wednesday. I had no takers. Did anyone try
    and get me and zoom. so I had a and I had a couple people come to see me in my
    office. my physical office. So that was nice to see. Anyone tried to get me on
    zoom, but couldn't. hey? I feel like. maybe we could stop early today. Would that
    be okay? Any questions. hey? So we'll see you. I was going to say about office
    hours. I have a meeting at 3 3 PM. On the 30 first. so I'll have to shorten my
    availability. 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 on Wednesday. But I'll make it a I'll make it up.
    Okay. So a comment that the link for today's response is not there. I think it
    is can use. I'm still. I'm still sharing the screen right? So submit your response
    to the meeting before 11 PM. I think the link works, but it will just say the
    questionnaire won't open until 1245, and I have the quiz set up as well. I think
    I have the link set up properly. Okay. so let me know if yeah, if anything comes
    up. Okay. anyway, thanks again for today. Have a great weekend. Take care, and
    we'll see you on Tuesday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Perfect thanks again. Have a great weekend.
  persid: S00

    over that time.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I see 1 big problem with the shopping cart... possible theft of the baskets
    or people putting them places they shouldn't be

  persid: DHH
- desc: Do they make an extra large sized cart for Costco shoppers?
  persid: DHH
- desc: The concept of having a scanner on each shopping cart to help you checkout
    faster reminds me of the self-serve Amazon in-person stores that now exist where
    each item you place in your shopping cart is added to your Amazon cart on the
    app and then you checkout your groceries off the app.
  persid: DHH
- desc: the thing that blows my mind is that it seems none of that innovation made
    it past that special
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"The concept of havin...\" with \U0001F62F"
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: Replying to "The concept of havin..."
  persid: DHH
- desc: That seems like a bunch of extra steps
  persid: DHH
- desc: Also that new shopping cart did not solve the problem of nesting. Carts cannot
    be stored together efficiently without taking out the baskets.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Exactly, people hate change
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's putting a lot of faith in velcro
  persid: DHH
- desc: velcro gets old and crummy and doesn't stick as well over time, it would likely
    need to be replaced often
  persid: DHH
- desc: "I won\u2019t prefer Velcro pants or seats"
  persid: DHH
- desc: i also think that their process generally discourages criticism of design
    as well in order to drive innovation, but that means that always "yes and"ing
    means some important criticisms might get missed
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: DHH
