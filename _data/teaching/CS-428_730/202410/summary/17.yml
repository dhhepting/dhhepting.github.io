- desc: Good morning. How's everyone doing today? So is winter over. or maybe now
    we're in the season of freezing rain. I was talking with a friend about the old
    saying about how. if March comes in like a lamb, and it goes out like a lion.
    or vice versa. So it kind of came in like a lion. but I don't know whether it'll
    go out like a lamb or something else. Maybe we need new things. and we also used
    to have a saying that April showers bring May flowers. so maybe we'll have, say
    some sayings about freezing rain in March or April brings trips trips to the emergency
    room. Anyway, I digress. Okay, so let me share my screen here. So what I have
    presently the Graphic is in Spanish. But it's pretty easy. I think it's easy to
    see what's being intended. The rest of the Texas in English. Here the differences
    between exclusion, segregation, integration, and inclusion. So exclusion is. people
    with other abilities are excluded from the main group. Segregation is. we put
    people with other abilities into a separate group integration is that we bring
    the people with other abilities into the main group. But there's still some differentiation
    and inclusion is when we remove those barriers. We don't distinguish people on
    on what makes real distinguish between people or on the differences between people,
    but rather on their abilities. And so inclusion is. we're not. You treat each
    one, each person as an individual. So this is our our goal. We're talking about
    accessibility. Okay? Oh, one other thing I wanted to mention is. so we're going
    to. If you're available. On Thursday afternoon, between 2, 30 and 3, 45, we're
    going in the CS. 2, 80 class. We're going to have a screening of the classroom
    version of
  persid: S00
- desc: speaking, how can I help you? Good, good. Good. How about you?
  persid: S01
- desc: "Okay. To occur to cur that. So we're going to have a screening of the classroom\
    \ version of the social dilemma. So if you're available at around 2 30, well.\
    \ we'll start the screening shortly after 2 30. So and it's about 45\_min long.\
    \ So I expect there to be a few seats available if you're interested in seeing\
    \ them that movie. So I'm going to try and arrange that full the screening of\
    \ the full-length movie later on in the spring. so you can keep an eye out for\
    \ that. so that the social dilemma addresses some issues about interface design\
    \ and dark patterns, and how we how technology is getting people to do things\
    \ they don't want to do. which really, which is essentially what those dark patterns\
    \ are anyone interested in going to see that if you haven't seen it already? Okay?\
    \ So, Dorcas. you said, you think there's an error with assignments on you, our\
    \ courses? Can you let me know what that is? Okay. I will look into that. Okay,\
    \ so let's look at the assignment. Hey? See? Did I say something? Well. so maybe\
    \ a paragraph or 2. So maybe a page or 2 about describing the activity and and\
    \ a bit about the user wanting to complete that activity.  so a couple paragraphs\
    \ for the one or 2 paragraphs for the activity and a paragraph for the user and\
    \ for the define. Maybe that's a page. So we're just focusing on the problem is\
    \ that just to identify the the problems and unmet user needs. So no solutions.\
    \ Okay? So I can add. I can add something to the assignment about the length.\
    \ Would that be okay? Does does those comments make sense. So I gave you more\
    \ than 3 choice. So the question was, should we focus on understanding any of\
    \ one of the interfaces? Okay. let me see. focus on understanding any of the 3\
    \ interfaces. groups, groupings or overview. or should we aim to empathize and\
    \ define all 3? So I gave you more choices, then those 3 interfaces. because groups\
    \ appear in different places. So so there's a question about whether you can do\
    \ the same activity from the empathized assignment. So the empathized assignment\
    \ wasn't dealing specifically with groups. If if you focus on groups. you can\
    \ do something similar to what you did in the first assignment. but the focus\
    \ should be on group, the groups interfaces. The idea of groups in you are courses.\
    \ Does that make sense? So questions? So can we just pick any functionality, facet\
    \ activity described Miss Simon? Or does each group have to do a different activity?\
    \ So I'm I am inclined to say every one can pick their own. and I hope that not\
    \ everybody's going to do the same one. But we can. We'll come to that bridge\
    \ will cross that bridge when we come to it. I guess I welcome your suggestions\
    \ about how to organize things. We get coverage of the different aspects. and\
    \ when we get feedback about the last. the Simon before this to being the next\
    \ one. I hope so.  we can move the just to make that more likely we can move the\
    \ due date to Monday instead of Friday. Would that be okay? Okay. So I'm not sure\
    \ about your responses to that. That was me trying to be funny. so I can see that\
    \ you don't have to type in. Yes, any more. I got the message, so we'll adjust.\
    \ I'll adjust the due date to Monday. Okay? So since we get lot, lots of activity\
    \ in the chat. I put a question in the chat. So any thoughts about ensuring some\
    \ variety of coverage of group interface issues. Hey? I can. I can do something\
    \ like that for today. A sign up sheet. I think I can use a scheduler to do that.\
    \ or we can use discussion forum. So if you've already picked an activity, and\
    \ so maybe it's easier to just to just declare what you're interested in doing.\
    \ Maybe we can use the wiki for that. and then if there's overlap, we can. Well.\
    \ I don't want to put put anyone off of doing what what they'd like to do. So\
    \ we'll manage that, so I'll put a I'll put the list of suggest. Oh, put the list\
    \ of suggestions, suggestions that I came up with. and then groups can indicate\
    \ what they're doing that way. That'll help us do a pairing of the groups where\
    \ the the the testing phase that we're going to do. So we'll try and match groups\
    \ with this that aren't tackling the same ideas that makes sense. Does that make\
    \ sense? So I'm I'm really tired of the current groups interface. So I'm I'm excited\
    \ that there's lots of opportunities to to identify some issues in the present\
    \ system. So if I can maybe mention a little bit about the current groups interface\
    \ or the ways I've used the current groups interface to make up the project groups.\
    \ So if you had a group of 4 for the assignment. I kept that group in the project.\
    \ If you had a group of less than 4 in the assignment. Then I and I put your name\
    \ into the hat to generate project groups. and I didn't see it. There wasn't an\
    \ easy way for me to preserve the groups that were established for the assignment,\
    \ say groups of 2 or 3, and add one person at random to make it to fill out the\
    \ group so that could be something to explore. So I think I did this advertised\
    \ with the groups. I said. if you. if you have the group of 4 for the assignment.\
    \ Then you can continue that group for the project. If you don't have a group\
    \ of 4 you'll be put into one for the project. So I had a couple notes about people\
    \ saying they forgot to submit the tenants during the midterm exam. So that's\
    \ that's not a thing to be concerned about. Okay, let me put your mind's at ease\
    \ about that. Okay, is everyone at ease about that. There are other. There's another\
    \ way for me to tell that you attended by having the exam. So does that comment\
    \ about the project. Groups make sense any issues that need to be dealt with or\
    \ errors that I made along the way. So I I am hesitant to open the group's interface,\
    \ because then you'll see. maybe if I switch to the experiment with viewer courses.\
    \ so you won't. You'll see names, but not so if we turn on editing"
  persid: S00
- desc: this way.
  persid: S01
- desc: I,Lauren.
  persid: ???
- desc: like the jump.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. I don't remember doing this myself or not. Do we do this in class. anyway?
    Let's look at. Let's look at that interface to see. And let's see about switching
    people around participants. So let's say, we're gonna move some people around
    in these groups and we'll make another group. Okay. so I want to make another
    group. So I have to go. Let me duplicate this tab. Then I went. I want to have
    actually all 3. Somebody's turned their audio on. So I'm just going to type in
    the chat. Please please feel free to unmute yourself when you have something to
    say to class and hope. That's clear.  okay, so I want to see. Let me do one more
    duplicate tab for this. So then, I can see groups so that the my email about the
    problem with the the problem I was trying to show you at the end of last meeting
    that makes sense where there was an error on the assignment that said. not everyone's
    in a group. or they're somebody's in more than one group. Let me show you the
    okay. Let me try. And since I brought that up, let me show you the picture from
    the other day. So this Eric comes up when I say, require students to be in a group
    and give a grouping. But the grouping. So the the setting required to group to
    make submission is enabled. and some uses are either not a member of any group
    or a member of more than one group, so are unable to make submissions. So the
    way to debug I debug, that is to, or to find out what the problem is. I have to
    view all submissions and then look in the group column or a message that indicates
    if they're not in a group, or if they're in more than one group. so it doesn't
    tell me that. So there's no there's no way to specify or to correct the grouping
    in the group's interface. There's no way to specify. Then I'm going to use this
    group for assignments. and or that I need to have this. Everyone has to be in
    a group and only one group. Okay. so I'm getting direct messages. So please, if
    you want me to talk about them. post them to everyone. So it seems like the root
    cause of this messages the problem with specification of the groups in the groupings
    in the grouping. So the I would rather deal with this when I'm creating the grouping
    instead of at the point of having the assignment and realizing there's a problem
    with it. Does that make sense? So there's a comment about the groups were shuffled
    a bit after fixing the error. Well, that this error was unrelated, I I had fixed
    the well the screen. Listen, let's see from the air, I recreated. I guess, an
    error. There were some problems with groups. but I've just discussed the reason
    for the shuffling. and I believe I had made the groups as advertised. So I indicated
    a way as a possible focuses how to preserve small groups and add members to them.
  persid: S00
- desc: You don't hold a trigger
  persid: S01
- desc: a. So let me get back to this. This is the overview page. even though it says
    groups. It's the overview page. And this one is groupings. Oh. sorry. Okay. So
    the question is, is it possible to keep the same group as assignment for the project
    as well? So if you were in a group of 4 for the assignment. your group of where
    the assignment has been preserved. If you weren't in a group of 4, I have put
    you into a group of 4 for the project. If I've made an error in that that you
    add. for in your group for the assignment. and didn't have that group transferred
    to the project. Let me know. I'll fix that.
  persid: S00
- desc: Do we need to email you for that?
  persid: S03
- desc: Sure.
  persid: S00
- desc: Okay? Because I had a group of 4, and all the 4 participants, participants
    have been randomly assigned to different groups. That's why.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay, I'll fix that.
  persid: S00
- desc: I'll just mention all the student numbers and the the students names, so you
    can rearrange the group, then for me.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well, it should be. You should have. Just tell him. Just tell me the group.
  persid: S00
- desc: Okay, Sharon. Okay, okay. it makes sense to me, thanks.
  persid: S03
- desc: anyway. Yeah. Okay. okay. so here I have groupings. So this screen, it lets
    me add groups to change the membership of groupings. And here's the group screen.
    So this is all the groups that have been created in the course. So I want to create
    a new group. We'll call it DHAA. And then we'll move some people around. So what
    if I want to make sure this is in the grouping. DH. Any way to do that. So edit
    group settings is that the comment? Is that what you mean? Let's see what edit
    group settings brings us. No, there's nothing here for grouping. And I think so.
    I have a feeling that's it. There's no grouping specified, because groups could
    be put into different groupings. like the project grouping that I made for the
    our class contains groups that are labeled that are called project and groups
    that are labeled assignment. But that distinction isn't a distinction about a
    group being able to be put into multiple groupings is lost. So or maybe there's
    a way to present prevent present that the choice of putting it into a grouping
    by default. Or maybe there's some other way to deal with it. I don't know. It's
    just. I'm not sure which grouping I'm creating a group into. But II get. let's
    put a couple people in here. So we get a bit of information about. But who's in
    which group? So so let's add. well. effectively, want to move. So I know as to
    this selected user, members user's membership doesn't always show up. But if you
    want to move yes. person. and into the group. So which if I wanted to the person
    we've added ESMA beer.  that's showing more information than it should. But which
    group should I remove if I want to keep. say that dh, H. Grouping was set up so
    that everyone is in one and only one group. Which group do I need to delete now?
    Anyone, remember. So I think I remember. But let me check. So that's group Q,
    so go back here. So we don't have to delete the group. but we should remove the
    person. That's we want to remove. So it so clicking on the name doesn't affect
    it. There. now, let's check on this DH. Grouping. So we need to add the new group
    that we've created. So let's think about if we wanted to say we went for trying
    to communicate the process of managing groups to somebody. But would you say,
    it's like. so what is group management like? Complicated for? Sure? Okay. so that's
    not necessary. Metaphor. Maybe kin say it's like a Rube Goldberg machine.
  persid: S00
- desc: It's kind of like the game of perfection you need to find which space or where
    to put things. you're back and forth, trial and error.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay, I'm I don't. I don't mean I'm not sure that I'm familiar with that game.
    So that's an effective metaphor for some people or it but has a possibility of
    being an effective metaphor. But that doesn't help me. So let's what are some
    familiar elements. So a designer can't influence the mental model. Pardon me,
    they can influence it. but they can't specify it. So we can encourage people to
    have a mental model that that the designer think this will help help the user
    navigate things, but and the metaphor. So this is like like something like a stack
    of cards. So the add and Remove interface has some familiar aspects. but it seems
    blankets slightly more difficult because we can't. because we can't operate on
    the list. We have to click the button to add and remove at the bottom. There are
    extra steps involved in view our course's version. So I've added my group. DHAA.
    Cause. It's not here. But why don't I see it at the top. but I can see that it
    was added at the bottom. So have you done groups like this in other classes? Have
    you from other instructors. Have you had experience with groups? So the thing
    about groups in your courses is the ability to create groups from a Csv file.
    from external input is reserved to the system administrators. They can do that
    at course, creation time. So that's how we have 2 groups, the CS. 4, 28 and the
    CS. 7, 30 groups. So I can't specify group membership with a Csv file which complicates
    things. So, Nasar, can you give us some more detail about your comment that they
    were much less complicated and easier to understand.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yep, yep, like. first off, when I first emailed you for the groups you replied
    to us, saying that there should be just 2 members for the assignments and 4 members
    for the project. and then we segregated our group to 2 and 2, and then there was
    trouble for us, for assignment, submission. And then now, when we are trying to
    analyze the project. the groups are shuffled again. So that's why they were much
    less complicated and easier to understand.
  persid: S01
- desc: So I don't recall saying that you had to have groups of 2 for the assignment.
    I will review the correspondence and see where that message was miscommunicated.
    So.
  persid: S00
- desc: okay, okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: so anyway. I was wondering if your comment was about your experience with
    groups on you are courses in in other courses.
  persid: S00
- desc: Oh, okay. So like, you were asking about making the groups and
  persid: S01
- desc: so have other instructors used groups. and there you are courses.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yep, yep. Other instructors have used groups. Yep. we had groups for assignments,
    and we had groups for project. As well. Yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: okay.
  persid: S00
- desc: they The only thing different was they never had a group submission link.
    They had individual submission links. So we had to submit for each group member,
    and it kept it kept it easier, or else other instructors also suggested that any
    one member of the group can submit to the UR. Courses. and he will consider it
    for the whole group.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah. that's the way it's set up.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah. But
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah, I understand there is some issues. So I'll work to resolve those
  persid: S00
- desc: we're out of time today.
  persid: S01
- desc: So any questions. So the question that we have to add delete for our own group
    interface or other groups as well on the experiment. Your courses. I was just
    using this as an example. So you're free in the experiment with your course's
    course. to explore the interface, so it's not to have to do something in particular,
    but it gives you a place to experiment. Yes, I I missed the quiz yesterday. I
    will add a quiz. I'll set up the next quiz. and I'll I'll give you 2 quizzes for
    the the price of one for the next meeting. Okay. thank you for today. Have a good
    day.
  persid: S00
- desc: I proof I have a question here regarding the group project.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S00
- desc: So for the groups, do we need to follow the groups you assigned, or we can
    choose our own members. Hello.
  persid: S05
- desc: yes.
  persid: S00
- desc: Do we not need to choose the groups? Can we choose our own members for the
    group, or we need to go with the groups assigned by you.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes, I understand the question we've been talking about this to day. So
  persid: S00
- desc: did you have a group of 4 for the assignment? No.
  persid: S05
- desc: Did you have a group of more than
  persid: S00
- desc: did you work with anyone else? Yeah, we were, too.
  persid: S05
- desc: I'll see what I can do.
  persid: S00
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S05
- desc: thanks.
  persid: S00
- desc: thank you.
  persid: S05
- desc: You're welcome. Take care. Everyone have a great rest of your Tuesday, and
    will see you on Thursday.

  persid: DHH
- desc: the empathize submission is now showing under the zoom vs protorack submission
  persid: DHH

    for both of those?
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

    that would need to be provided by like the end of today to give people enough
    time to coordinate with their team and complete the assignment by Monday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Between groups
  persid: DHH

    forum
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

    please?

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

    or other groups as well on the experiment ur courses?
  persid: DHH
