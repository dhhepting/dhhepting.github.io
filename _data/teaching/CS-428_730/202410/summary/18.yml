Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: How's everyone doing today? Okay, it's 1130 now. So surprised, I'm here on
    time. and not a minute later than 1130, anyway. So let me tell you a funny story,
    not very funny, but made a little sad when I duplicated the other assignment for
    the for the last assignment for the Zoom versus brought versus Proctor track.
    I duplicated it fine, but then I edited the wrong.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I edited the copy.
  persid: S01
- desc: so I made the copy. Wait a day. so can you hear that I'm turned? I've turned
    on the doorbell. There should be another option for the door. It took me a long
    time to find the option to turn on. But the doorbell sound. The documentation
    on Zoom wasn't great. but or didn't match the current client that I have. There
    could be an option, though once the meeting starts. don't ring the doorbell. I
    was concerned because I was used to getting the doorbell. When I have zoom office
    hours. I was used to getting it. Then I realized people were coming in through
    my office hours, but I wasn't being notified. so I turned it on then. Oh.
  persid: DHH
- desc: okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: I just saw it because it was coming out.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It's loud enough for me to hear. I thought you might be able to hear it as
    well.
  persid: ???
- desc: anyway. So it's kind of buried in some menus. and it's not in a where I think
    it would should be. but I turned it on, and I think for the most part it will
    be a good thing to have. anyway. So I digress. I was telling you about my mix
    up with you are courses. So I copied the first assignment, the empathized assignment.
    and duplicated it to make the last assignment about comparing zoom. breakout rooms,
    and Proctor track. so I duplicated fine. But then I edited the wrong. I changed
    the empathized assignment into the I change the original appetite assignment into
    the assignment. 5 on both Zubin Proctor track. so that the then made it look like
    all the submissions are gone. and then some people submitted again to the original,
    to the the remaining empathize assignment which was intended to be the Zoom versus
    Procter track assignment. Does my play by play make sense to you. anyway? So when
    it happened. I just thought I've been. I don't want to touch anything. so I didn't
    quite understand what was going on at first. and I was dealing with groups and
    stuff. So I asked. view our course's support, and so say gently pointed out my
    error. and and likely had a good laugh about it. So? Is that a funny story. or
    is it a funny story about me or none of the above? Okay, so we've got the assignments
    sorted out? I think so to make you feel better if check your assignment group
    for the empathize. Yeah. everything gets funny over time, doesn't it? This only
    happened last week. So it's not quite comedy yet, I think. anyway.  So I think
    I think the markers will get in touch if anyone's missing an assignment submission.
    and we won't penalize you for being late. but we may. So there might be one submission
    lost. So have a look at your submissions there. not all the ones that don't have
    a submission beside them are lost. But maybe on the save side, you can add them.
    Okay. does that make sense? And so I've renamed groups again. So so now I've so
    the 7 30 groups are the same. The 4 20 groups assignment groups. If they're groups
    of 4, they have a letter, A in the name, and then a number. So there's 9 groups
    with with 4 members each, and for 4, 28. Here, let me end up over here. A. So
    under participants. and I select overview. No oops is good enough. I think. So.
    Here the same. The assignment groups for 4, 28, so a one through 9, those each
    have 4 members. and then there are 5 groups with 2 members. and then there are
    16 15. Pardon me 15 groups with one person in them. So 15 plus 10, 5 times 2 plus
    36, 9 times 4, 36, plus. It's 46, and then less 15. That's 61. That's how many
    students we're in. 4, 28, anyway. So I've divided. I divided them up that way.
    So I was trying to give them a more more clear organization. So then. then. the
    project group. If you have a group of 4 up here for the assignments. you'll see
    the same group for your project group. and then for the people who weren't in
    a group of 4. Then I've made 6 new project groups do not knew they were there
    before. but I've rearranged, rearranged them so that there aren't and duplicates.
    So there's no warning message on the assignment that some people are in no groups
    or in more than one group. And so I've taken care to preserve the groups of 2,
    except we're instructed to not do that. so I hope everyone is clear and not upset
    about what I've done with the project groups. Any questions about that. So that's
    interesting. I'm looking at the chat, and I'm presuming the circle with a line
    through it is no. II know, is in my first interpretation of that. I would say.
    Maybe that's more like forbidden questions about project groups are forbidden.
    No, that doesn't make sense, either. Anyway, it's interesting. Well. I okay. So
    what are some other ways to say? No, I guess I didn't mean to disapprove of the
    circle with a line through it. I just thought it was an interesting choice. Some
    of these I can't see very clearly. I'll have to. Can I zoom in on the chat? Let's
    see. not a lot. Yes, so we'll talk about the project today. And I thought we'd
    even do break up rooms with the project stuff. Okay. hey? So now we've got the
    group sorted out out of the way. So I'm gonna talk about metaphors. So I was.
    So we had. We came up with some unkind descriptions about a metaphor for the current
    groups interface. complicated, unintuitive.  But I think maybe folders is a useful
    distinction. Let me see if I can come up here. Bring up an example on the Mac
    here. So this is my directory for my website. So these these are the column views.
    So on the left. there's it's the enclosing directory. and then in the middle.
    there's the next level. Then I can open another level. and I can open another
    level. So is this. So this has some potential as a metaphor. except well, we have
    that if we're thinking about organizing files in a directory, then if we want
    to include the same group in more than one hierarchy. how do we extend the metaphor
    to do that. So we don't want to duplicate the files, because then then that gets
    away from what we wanted wanted to do. So we don't want to. So I guess on the
    rightmost column we'd have students. and then we can group them in different ways
    and then put them in groupings. So the the way I thought about letting letting
    the same students be in different groupings. Different groups and groupings would
    be like creating a symbolic link in the system. So for every grouping, we create
    a a reference to that same student. So we. we have the students in different groups
    and groupings. But they're all referring to this. All the references to Darrell
    in your courses as pointing to the same. So person they're not. I'm not being
    copied or cloned. Is that helpful as part of the metaphor? How many people are
    familiar with that kind of did you just have you? Do you call that from 3 30 CS.
    3, 30. Anyone. So can you tell? Dame's written set like, send to or move to? Yeah.
    Okay. so I don't want to. I don't want to cause any. And in I don't want to have
    anyone relive painful memories. But for the most part, maybe teachers are not
    the ones who are going to understand that. So what? How can we convey that, or
    what would it be like? So send to or move to? What? What what about those. Can
    you explain those a bit more? Okay? So like, yeah, Urls, that we're we're linking.
    So we have a resolvable yeah, URL for each student. And then that's put into groups
    and groupings. More of a web focus. You think that's more clear for people. Anyone
    wanna comment on that in the chat I'm sensing. Nobody wants to comment. Okay.  So
    if we have students. the collection of students or individuals in the class as
    a set of but say, web pages. So then, the groupings we create are they are the
    groups and groupings we create? Are they separate from the web pages? So we just
    manage the organization of the of the links. and would we be able to divide. to
    divide the or compose groups and groupings? Sophie said. there's a grouping for
    CS. 4, 28, and grouping for 7, 30. Could we then say that there's a grouping?
    There's a class grouping that contains CS. 4, 28, and CS. 7, 30 groupings. So
    could we nest them? Would that make sense? So I think that's so. Let's test that
    metaphor out. So Micaelo said. So the students are web pages which are like book
    marks and groups of, or folders of bookmarks we create in the browser. So does
    that seem. Can we discuss that a bit to see whether that seems like a good metaphor
    for dealing with students and putting them in groups. Okay, so you have a bit
    of support for that idea. Okay. well, I don't want to. So that's a possible way
    to think about this. So in your courses at present, we can't nest groupings. So
    I've tried that. and it doesn't work. That's why I have created. So I created
    assignments 4, 28. Oh. I didn't switch back my sharing. Sorry. So for the groupings
    in the class. I've created assignments. and I tried to make assignments contain
    assignments for twin aid and assignments. 7, 30. But I couldn't do that. So I
    created the one here. Same thing. Here I did projects 4, 28, and project 7, 30
    as a way to add a bit more structure. But I wasn't allowed. and so that to be
    combined grouping. I'll show you how that works or why I created it. That's how
    I came up with the project groups to begin with. So I said. auto create groups.
    So the add sign is the letter. So create a number of groups. No, we won't create.
    We'll create based on members per group. And we want groups of 4 students. And
    then we can select a grouping to be combined select members from group soul. not
    from a particular group inside that grouping. So it seems like I could. I didn't
    want to do this, so I didn't check it, but it seems like it's not respecting the
    choice of grouping here. because I don't think these are compatible where they
    might beep uncompatible, and I'm not sure it will happen. Then let's try it. A
    at sea ship. We'll just do preview. There are no civil users witness in the selected
    role. Let me see if changing this to none. Oh. now there are. Okay. Let me switch
    back to here. Let's test this again. Okay. none. Preview. Okay? So then that's
    how I made. I can make some groups then. So that's why I put I created that to
    be combined grouping. Okay? So the metaphors like the one we discussed about the
    bookmarks and bookmarks organize in folders? If we have a comprehensible metaphor
    like that. does that help? Does it help the users. Does it help you to think about
    how to work with groups? Does it influence how you develop a mental model of the
    workings of the group mechanism. So think about on Tuesday, when we went through,
    and we describe the metaphor as complicated, unintuitive. and so on. And then
    think about today with students have their Ids on the Ur course system, and we
    can link to them. So grouping them is like organizing bookmarks in a series of
    nested folders. So a question about the bookmark analogy. the question of the
    book? I'll answer the question in second question with the bookmark. Analogy is,
    if we organize. say, the individual students into 18 groups of 4. Which is our
    case approximately. can we can we work with bookmarks that? And we work with bookmarks
    in folders at different levels. So okay, the example I'm thinking of, let's say.
    in our case 4, 28 has 9 groups of 4. So that's straightforward, too. And we want
    to create groups of 4? Can can we use the metaphor to think about combining 2
    groups of 2 to make a group of 4, and to a group of 2 and 2 groups of one to make
    a 4 with that. would that be possible that we could think about in our metaphor
    of organizing bookmarks. And so the question about can we have one student be
    part of multiple groups? So I would say. yes, that's so. Yes, we could have students
    be part of multiple groups. But maybe we want to have the condition that every
    student is only in is in one. And only one group inside a grouping. Does that
    make sense? And then so the problem here that you're asking about from the chat
    I'm reading. you're asking about the fact that we're moving the folders and not
    the book marks themselves. When we have nested groups. I'm gonna try and draw
    something. I can play a chime for raised hands. But I can't. It doesn't give me
    the chance to change the doorbell for new entries. anyway. Baker urge. So I'm
    not. Gonna I'll see if I can make this work here. So this is a group of or so
    we have. or try and draw it. And this is a group of 4. This is a group of 2. So
    who can see my right, my diagram? Here. let me let me try instead of me trying
    to find my Powerpoint and open it up and draw something on the screen. Does that
    make sense? Okay? So a metaphor doesn't have to work exactly. Yes. just needs
    to be close enough to think about. so that people can transfer the general ideas
    from from the familiar concept to the new interface. So in the case of making
    a group of 4 from from 4 student, from 4 students. we can create the group of
    4 as some kind of separate or new entity. And so with where we have the group
    of 2 plus 2 individuals we have, we could have the group of 2 be created as a
    new entity. Then, when we're making groups. We can use these other entities as
    well. So we could have the 4 individuals become a group of 4, and we could have
    2 individual, the group of 2 plus 2 individuals become a group of 4. I'm not saying
    that we have to have a perfect metaphor for that. and I encourage you to think
    to brainstorm about things, and let's ideas that are further out out in left field,
    so to speak. Don't discard them right away, and just think about the implications.
    So for the project. I'm asking you to take a part of the groups interface. So
    focus on one activity in that piece of the interface. so it might involve. and
    brainstorming and conceptualizing new metaphors for groups in general to support
    the activity. the identity, the activity you identified. and your new designs
    for that activity, the interface for that activity. so creating groups. managing
    groups. assigning markers to groups. sorting by groups. checking that groups for
    an assignment have everybody in one and only one group. so we don't have the bug
    that message by so scrolling through the whole list. So when I get that error
    message that says you've required a group to submit. but not everybody's in a
    group or or in on either. Some people are not in a group or there in more than
    one group. So then, I have to go. This is the way that I understand how to fix
    it. To go through the list of groups, and there's a message there. either not
    in a group or in more than one group. Then I have to go to another page to see
    which groups the person is in anyways. So the other fertile addition, an additional
    fertile ground for project ideas is looking at the mobile interface. So please
    don't send me direct messages. Would it be helpful to make to due date next Thursday
    instead of Tuesday? Okay, so any questions about that. So  trying to keep it focused.
    So we're just looking at a particular aspect of the group's interface and the
    user as a teacher. you can. you can look to me for details. You can ask me about
    my experience. So I just want to give you a an experience of going through some
    of the these steps. So are there questions about that? Should we want? So I can
    talk to people individually about issues that's do the breakout rooms. And let's
    create 18. Let me create 18. I'll let you choose your room. But now I realize
    that that it's groups aren't numbered. So let's so a a one through 9, you can
    use the the number of your group there. so that takes care of the first 9 rooms.
    then the next 3 are the 7 30. So that's 1011, 12, and then 13. Through 18 are
    projects A, BC, DE, and F. OK. I'm going to open the rooms, and I'll come around.

  persid: DHH
