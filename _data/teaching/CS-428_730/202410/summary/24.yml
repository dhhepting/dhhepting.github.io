- desc: "Good morning. I'm dressed for spring. I have a t-shirt on, but in my office\
    \ it's cool. They've got the air conditioner on, I think. and I have a decorative\
    \ thermostat in my office, but it doesn't seem to do much. so I have a sweater\
    \ usually doesn't get cold until the afternoon. So I don't know what happened\
    \ today. I guess they're working on the as temperature gets warmer then things\
    \ are changing. anyway. So how's everyone today? So not every office in computer\
    \ science has a thermostat. So I'm one of the lucky ones who has the appearance\
    \ of control. I think the thermostat is set to about 20, which should be a generally\
    \ a good temperature. But I'm not sure what temperature it actually is in here.\
    \ anyway. Yeah, okay. so let me share my screen, and we can start going through\
    \ some things. So I wanted to touch on the issue of security and privacy a little\
    \ bit more in interfaces today. But there are a few questions that came up in\
    \ the responses. So I thought maybe I'd answer them first. But first I wanted\
    \ to check our class discussions. So if there are any comments. what's it about\
    \ what I posted yesterday. and I don't see any. So okay. have you seen my post\
    \ about paired groups for testing and the materialized portion of the project.\
    \ This one right here. hey? So how? The question was how the other group would\
    \ actually test our low fidelity prototypes which are not actually prototypes\
    \ but drawings. And then I. So my response is, aren't they actually prototypes?\
    \ So the drawings that's the low fidelity part of prototype. So our sketches can\
    \ help us to understand. to to convey ideas about how we would organize the interface.\
    \ So we don't have to expend a lot of effort creating the low Fidelity prototype.\
    \ If we're drawing it by hand. we should be somewhat neat about it, I guess. and\
    \ print legibly. But we don't have to use a piece of software to create code to\
    \ populate it, an interface design with widgets. So one that's not so low fidelity\
    \ anymore. And 2, we get attached to the design, and then we're maybe less inclined\
    \ to change it. Does that make sense? Anyone like to give me a yes or a no in\
    \ the chat. So what would you like me to explain again the idea of a low fidelity\
    \ prototype? So the low fidelity prototype is one that's easy to create. So sketching\
    \ with pencil and sketching on paper with pencil. Or now, where is I? Yeah. So\
    \ the low fidelity part makes it easy to create. So we're not attached to it.\
    \ and it's easier to explore new ideas. But the sketches can still convey a lot\
    \ of information about how we see the interface working in terms of how we're\
    \ going to interact with a system so it can be quite valuable, as especially as\
    \ a way to get some early input into the design process. Okay? So another question\
    \ was, I don't. I do not understand why there needs to be 2 people for the testing\
    \ process. Why can't the person testing write down the things that confuse them\
    \ instead? So I understand this to mean, why can't we just say. here's the interface.\
    \ Look at it. So I would say we want we want to. The idea of giving them consistent\
    \ instructions is important. So have a script to say. Hello, imagine you're a\
    \ teacher. You want to create groups in a grouping for an assignment in this particular\
    \ class. or you want to put pair 2 groups together in your human computer interaction\
    \ class that you're teaching. whatever the task is. So imagine you're the instructor\
    \ in the class. Here's what you want to do. Now, here's an interface that we've\
    \ designed to let you do that. So you want to set it up and present it to them.\
    \ So when they say what they would. If there are 2 screens. then you need to navigate\
    \ between the first screen and the second screen. based on what they do. So it\
    \ allows the person giving you the feedback on with whom you're testing the interface,\
    \ to have more of the illusion that they're working with an interface, instead\
    \ of then having to follow instructions that they read. okay, if I did this I\
    \ should. I would get an error message. If I do something else I would get onto\
    \ this next screen and see what you're not. I should back up and ask if that makes\
    \ sense. So so the person running the test is pretending to be the computer system.\
    \ Instead of making the person say, Here's. here's all the information you need.\
    \ Do this yourself. questions about that. So it's actually. if everyone can meet.\
    \ then it's really 4 people, 2 people presenting the test and 2 people responding\
    \ to the test. And the reason I've done that is. to give people the experience\
    \ of running and participating in a test. but and make it less onerous than everyone\
    \ doing their own test. So, seeing no questions. I'll move on. So another person\
    \ asked. I would like to know more about the collected data during the testing\
    \ stage of materialized assignment. Do we have to record during testing or taking\
    \ notes enough. So taking notes are enough so you might ask them questions. What\
    \ do you like best about the interface? What do you like least about the interface?\
    \ Or you have a rating on a scale of one to 5, one being. let's see, very unusable.\
    \ 2 being unusable. 3 don't know for being usable, and 5 being very usable. for\
    \ example, so that that's often called a liquored scale. And the idea is that\
    \ we have the scale centered about immediate middle point. So there the ratings\
    \ are balanced around a center. So whether or not we include the center or not.\
    \ we could have a 4 point scale and leave out the don't know or undecided option\
    \ at 3, so we'd have. So the advantage there is. People are always going to come\
    \ down on one side or the other of usable or not usable. Even the disadvantage\
    \ is that we don't give people the chance to say they don't know. So both scales\
    \ are balanced around the center. and when we put the center as a choice and the\
    \ other one, we don't. So an example of that. So I think there examples in the\
    \ the Zip Care test documentation that I link to. But there's also an example\
    \ in the formative feedback for Dr. Hepting that I'm going to talk about in a\
    \ minute. So that's the way you can collect quantitative and qualitative data.\
    \ So to answer the question in chat. Oh, can you please send it to everyone instead\
    \ of just me? So are the 2 people supposed to do the test together, or do we test\
    \ one person and then test the second person. If you want to to do the test separately\
    \ with 2 people. and you agree to that, then that's fine. but I don't have that\
    \ in mind as a requirement, so you could do one test. So pair group one pair,\
    \ one. Tess gives presents, their interface A to group 2 pair one and gets feedback\
    \ and then group 2 pair. One presents their interface, A to group one pair, one.\
    \ Okay. So, Patrick, do you want to just repost your. you know. Direct messages\
    \ to me to the chat, please. Banks. Okay. So then there was a question I'm paraphrasing\
    \ a bit here more about last assignment and final exam. So the last assignment\
    \ is about preparing to do proctor track for the final exam. So yeah, I believe\
    \ even if you've done onboarding for other classes. it's still a good idea, for\
    \ it's maybe even necessary for you to do onboarding the onboarding quiz for this\
    \ class. So I want you to go through that process and send me proof that you've\
    \ completed it not send me submit with your assignment. proof that you've completed\
    \ it. And then let me maybe bring it up here. So basically, you're asked to compare\
    \ your experience using zoom breakout rooms for the midterm with your experience\
    \ of being of being on boarded for proctor track for the final exam. To prepare\
    \ this. to prepare to do this comparison, to take the final exam. All instructions\
    \ for proctor track onboarding and practice exam. At this link. I think those\
    \ links are correct. Let me check them. So this one is a UR. Course. Okay, prepare\
    \ practice. Exam an onboarding quiz at this link. I guess I didn't make it open\
    \ in a new window. That's why it's overwritten the assignment. So I want you to\
    \ describe the steps you you perform to to do the the onboarding for proctor track\
    \ and share your user experience from completing them. So provide proof that your\
    \ onboarding has been completed. Reflect on usability and user experience goals\
    \ that you find applicable to your experience of completing the activities. So\
    \ that's from the I interaction design book. It's section 1.9 in chapter in the\
    \ sixth edition and section 1.7 in the fifth edition. So the last bit is to compare\
    \ your proctor track experience with using with your experience using zoom breakout\
    \ rooms during the midterm. So I need to fill these in. But basically you. then\
    \ the 2 marks for doing the on. we're completely onboarding 2 marks for the Usability\
    \ and user experience questions and then suggested improvements. And then comparison\
    \ with zoom breakout rooms used for the midterm. Okay, does that make sense? Okay,\
    \ for the final? It's on the 20 third of April. It'll be online. So I've I've\
    \ gotten some good feedback from review of the midterm. Is everyone. Did everyone\
    \ who wanted to complete that that questionnaire? Were you able to do it, or should\
    \ I reopen it for a bit longer? I got 25 responses. So that means 22 of you up\
    \ thereabouts who are here didn't respond. Would you like to respond to the questionnaire\
    \ about the midterm? Exam. Anyone? Yes or no? Okay. So I'll take that as no. So,\
    \ thanks to those of you who are in the class and who responded to the quiz. We'll\
    \ go over that shortly. How about right now? In fact, so review of the feedback\
    \ about the midterm exam. So this is anonymous. So I can show you this without\
    \ without reviewing any secrets here. So one suggests this is the note I send\
    \ about instructions. and after reading it again this morning I realized I did\
    \ mention that we need to use 2 Zoom Meetings. but I could have made it more explicit\
    \ about having. It's a grouping for meeting for Midterm A and Midterm. B. I just\
    \ made those up at random to accommodate the need for 2 Zoom Meetings for invigilation.\
    \ But I should have. So of the 25 people who responded the minority. 40%. So 80%\
    \ people responded this question. and only 40 said, yes, they'd seen the announced\
    \ me before joining the exam. So it email sent via your courses would have been\
    \ the preferred option. But also there were comments about sending it. Okay, so\
    \ the email. But then maybe also my website and doing a post about it in the class.\
    \ making sure that everything was covered. then, also putting on the exam page.\
    \ So that's what I'll do for the final. I'll put instructions on the exam page.\
    \ So for those who saw the instructions. and maybe those who read the instructions.\
    \ they were clear enough. So any improvements that you can make to the midterm\
    \ instructions. Yes, I could have talked about how the exam will be conducted,\
    \ which I think I did, that. How many questions will there be? And all the others.\
    \ Yeah, I could have given you more and information about the structure of the\
    \ exam. Send instructions earlier. previous lecture or previous day. Yeah. So\
    \ I send them in the morning of the Exam. About 8 a. M. So I could do it before,\
    \ or talk about them in our last meeting for the exam. So maybe what I didn't\
    \ do was say. because how many people are logged into your courses right now.\
    \ and do you log into your courses before you log into the view. Startup, zoom,\
    \ or after. Let me do a poll for that. So that's hard to express in a thumbs up.\
    \ So question one is, do you? But you generally sign into the Zoom Meeting. Join\
    \ the Zoom Meeting before signing into your courses. during our Zoom Meetings.\
    \ That clicking you here for me is trying to select the whole, the all the text\
    \ that they've put in as a sample. not in a way that I can just type in have the\
    \ sample disappear. But I have to edit. I have to remove the sample first. which\
    \ is another issue with Zoom. Let's try that as a questionnaire. so we won't have\
    \ Zoom to contend with for the final. But for the instructions for the midterm,\
    \ I could have made it more clear you should sign into your courses first. and\
    \ then you'd be directed to a different Zoom Meeting to to attend. I'll give another\
    \ 15\_s or so for people to complete the quiz. only 31 of 46 have participated\
    \ so far. And that's 34, 46. Okay? So I understand the question to say that you\
    \ sign into. Well. we sign it to you our courses first. and you most people access\
    \ your courses during our Zoom Meetings. So anyway. so I'm not sure what the comments\
    \ were not constructive. Is that the marked exam? Why they lost marks in the discord.\
    \ I don't think you lost marks in the discord. But you're discussing after the\
    \ fact. So that's a different issue. More ways to distribute them. Maybe ask how\
    \ to ask help. ask for help from the vigilator. So fairness of assessment. Most\
    \ of the questions did all right except for the match in question. which was on\
    \ the only one on the didn't make somewhat fair. so I'll take that into consideration\
    \ when creating the final exam. and I also asked for clarity. So I'll try and\
    \ improve the clarity of those questions as well. So one of the questions had\
    \ a word limit, and I don't think there should have been. I meant to. How that'd\
    \ be a feature, not a a bug, and I didn't realize that it wasn't being communicated\
    \ to you. And then I didn't realize that people saw the message that your answers\
    \ too long without seeing a word count as you're typing your answer. so I'll I'll\
    \ need to review that those features so that I I don't. They don't cause extra\
    \ stress for that. Questions required answers that were way too long. Yeah, okay.\
    \ I'll try and and deal with them. So I encourage you again as I did for the midterm\
    \ to suggest final exam questions in different styles. So you have access to the\
    \ viewer courses. If the experiment you are courses, you can. You can make up\
    \ your own questions and the different styles that you think would be appropriate.\
    \ So I'm not asking you to do the work for me. but I think that would also help\
    \ you to prepare for the exam. So was was the the template that I added to that\
    \ sample quiz. Is that helpful. So let me go to that. So I realize you can remove\
    \ things from the template. so maybe it's more helpful to leave it in. But I can't\
    \ require that. So here I've given a maximum word, count. I'm not sure that's\
    \ helpful. If I if you can't see what your word count is as you go along. Oh.\
    \ here's a word, count at the bottom who noticed that before. So maybe it is helpful\
    \ thing to do that. So if I start with. So that leaves you 680 words about with\
    \ the template in place. so I can give. Make sure that I highlight that the word\
    \ count shows up at the bottom of the textbooks. Okay, does that make sense? So\
    \ I propose is, we'll we'll do a a test next week so that we can see what it's\
    \ like to do the exam in Proctor track and or me as much as we can do a test.\
    \ So everyone's familiar and clarify any issues before before we leave our class\
    \ meetings next week. Okay. so here's that formative feedback for me that quiz.\
    \ Oh, 4 more people have replied. So that's good. So there are rating questions\
    \ and open-ended questions. So the quantitative and qualitative data that's being\
    \ collected would anyone like to have that open longer. It closes tomorrow night.\
    \ It's set to close then, anyway. Okay. they, when is anyone interested in those\
    \ research credit that research credit opportunity I posted in does anyone I'm\
    \ not in. I don't wanna have anyone tell me what whether they did it or not. But\
    \ are there questions about it? So the idea is, if you participate. Oh, okay.\
    \ sorry we'll we'll have more opportunities in the future, I think. as a matter\
    \ of course. So if you're able to do that. Then you can earn a bonus mark in a\
    \ class in this class, for example. Okay, I just want to mention also about those\
    \ who are interested in designing and building interfaces. those students in 4,\
    \ 28, who are taking 4, 90 DG. In July and August. to also consider taking 4,\
    \ 90 A. P. In May and June. because building an interface which should be done\
    \ in 4 90 A. P. Would be a good tie into evaluating one. If you're if you're taking\
    \ dg, maybe to Ap. Is a good one to add in May and June, if you're able to. So\
    \ how do you feel about security and privacy at the York courses any big concerns.\
    \ So do you know which communications in your courses are private, or which ones\
    \ I can see. and which ones are private and which ones I can see. So in in which\
    \ way does it, monitor browser behavior? Oh. yeah. So I I have. I have a setting\
    \ for read tracking the only, and I never turned that on. But I I do 4 subscriptions.\
    \ So you get emails about forum posts. Anything else that comes up. So would you\
    \ like to see in a message saying that this group communication form is visible\
    \ to the instructor? If that's the case. yeah. So yeah, so security is better\
    \ because it's open source. And people can get into the code. But a downside is\
    \ that it's maybe not the most. it's not the easiest software to get set up to\
    \ contribute to. because it's using a different version of Ph. P. Then is current.\
    \ So I tried to get the development environment going on. My Mac. And there were\
    \ just a few frustrations. Because it's using. Ph, yeah. Ph, P. And the version\
    \ we had this summer last summer was using an earlier version of PHP. And I think.\
    \ than than I could get with Homebrew. So I guess that's a question of whether\
    \ it's open source in in name only. Well, that's not. I'm not suggesting that\
    \ either. But maybe if we can think about the openness of a project is being more\
    \ the accessibility of, or the practicality or feasibility of contributing to,\
    \ open source projects. As a as an interesting, interesting aspect of open source.\
    \ Projects like we talk about usable privacy and security. We can talk about usable,\
    \ open source contributions, I suppose. So. What about you? Security and privacy\
    \ in zoom? So were, are there any issues about knowing? When I join a zoom breakout\
    \ room with you? I can't lurk. I don't think so. The one feature that I found\
    \ interesting. and this was suggested. What the midterm question was that the\
    \ broadcast messages that appear in breakout rooms are transient. and perhaps\
    \ a useful feature would be to see the log of messages that were sent to the breakout\
    \ room to review them. because they only last for a few seconds. maybe not long\
    \ enough. So you need to switch your attention to see the breakout room message\
    \ and then have time to read it. So those are some issues, I think. go with with\
    \ regards to the usability. And if you see messages about security and privacy\
    \ in Zoom. Jen being able to read them and act on them is important. So I found\
    \ this. I did a search for usable privacy and security. and the conference comes\
    \ up. It's called soups symposium. Symposium on usable privacy and security. and\
    \ I think that's about the twentieth. They've been holding them for 20 some years\
    \ now. So what's in it? Have you encountered examples of interfaces that don't\
    \ provide usable privacy and security. Does anyone ever had problems changing\
    \ her password because some interfaces have rules that they don't necessarily\
    \ make clear. To begin with. I've never heard of that game. Oh, okay, thanks for\
    \ the link. See? Let's click on it and see. Can you see the screen now? Am I sharing\
    \ it with? I think I am. Okay. Let's do a secure password here. Okay, let's see.\
    \ Month of the year. Okay. okay, I need some help with this one. okay, so I don't\
    \ think we could go on for a while there, I think. Anyway, thanks for that, that\
    \ link. That's quite fun. So this is not quite so such a good example of usable\
    \ privacy and security. Yeah, it's very relevant. Thanks again. So anyway, I was\
    \ going to say that I did a search for usable privacy and security. and I came\
    \ up with the acronym weird. Has anyone heard that before? So W. Is Western? Anyway,\
    \ here's here's just the abstract merged countries are western. educated, industrialized,\
    \ rich. and democratic. So that's not necessarily very representative population.\
    \ So the researchers found a skew towards weird countries and usable privacy and\
    \ security greater than in HCI. So that's an important aspect to think about.\
    \ because we want to design things, not just for the people who are who who are\
    \ just like us. Perhaps. I mean, we don't want to just focus on Canadians because\
    \ these issues come up in on a global basis. anyway, any comments on that. Any\
    \ questions, other questions about the materialize portion of the assignment of\
    \ the project and the last assignment. Okay, so let's take a minute to do the\
    \ breakout rooms just to check in. And you can let me know if you have questions.\
    \ Okay, you can ask for help. so I'll do the breakout rooms like I did before\
    \ our last day with 9 breakout rooms and let you join the one corresponding to\
    \ your paired group for testing. And so so, Cono, of that, I made the pairs with\
    \ the hope that I've not. You're not. But both groups in the pair aren't working\
    \ on exactly the same thing. Okay, that was the rationale for making the pairs\
    \ that I did. Okay. So I'm going to open the rooms and join them, and take a minute\
    \ to coordinate and ask questions if get me involved, if you need some questions\
    \ answered. Okay. So the rooms are open now. Hello! This is me! Broadcasting my\
    \ voice to the breakout rooms. Maybe I have to. Let's see. Okay, now I'm Hi. This\
    \ is me. Broadcasting my voice to all breakout rooms. Is this a better way for\
    \ me to communicate to breakout rooms? Important information? I'll put a quiz\
    \ about this on you. Our courses. Thanks. and we're almost out of time, so you\
    \ can leave when you're done in your breakout room. Take care everyone have a\
    \ good weekend, and I'll see you Tuesday. Bye, everyone have a good day."
