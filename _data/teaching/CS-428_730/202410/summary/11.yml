  persid: S00
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: So it seems like winter again today with the snow. I was going to say, if
    it's Tuesday, it must be winter. That reminds me of an old movie title. Ef it's
    Tuesday it must be Belgium referring to a whirlwind European vacation of. or it's
    hard to keep track of the countries you're in. anyway, that's an old reference.
    So how's everyone doing today? Yeah, things are busy. But anyone looking forward
    to the break next week. Okay, share screen. I think I didn't save something. My
    apologies. Okay. So so I didn't put on the list here. The revisiting the redesign
    or thinking about the climate controls in my forward edge. and how they might
    be more more friendly. Be more clear about what to do with them. But we'll take
    that up later. So just a bit of background. I wanted to send some flowers to my
    wife, who's now in Vancouver with her mom, who's in the hospital. So I, being
    an older person. my first reaction was to try F. Td. And then it came up. I searched
    for FTD. In Canada. and I clicked on the link. And my first clue that something
    was wrong is that showed Zip Code that it wanted me to enter. And then I realized
    I was in the American sight when it wanted a 5 digit or 5 character zip code.
    so there was no indication that they were interested in serving a Canadian customer
    there was no message about. Oh, you're trying to send flowers to Canada. Let's
    help you out. I believe they had a number to call. which I called. and they said,
    this number is no longer active. But that was a number listed on the website.
    So that was very frustrating. So then I went to Tel Avora. which seemed to be
    more interested in delivering to Canada. Now I'm going to see if I can do this
    as a live demo here. So let's say, this is the flowers I want to send. So let's
    use the university's postal code. for example. So it doesn't doesn't give any
    details here. That's not. I'm not sure what to do if it's registered or not. But
    I tried this, and this is this is what I want to show you it says, Find zip code.
    Please enter the city and state, search for zip, slash postal code. So  Can you
    see that dialog box. So you can see this. So that's so. At this point. even though
    it seems like it would be possible to send something to Canada in Canada. I decided
    that I wasn't going to use this website. So I wanted to. Yeah. this site. Seems
    it seems to be screaming designed with apathy. We have to allow Canadians to send
    flowers to one another. Let's not make it easy. or I don't care if it's easy or
    not. Hostility. Yeah, that's I don't know a pathy that corresponds to outright
    hostility or malice. anyway. So I want to just show the to this cookie dialog
    box here that says we use cookies on this site tube to be a. to make it work.
    to capture analytics and to tailor the site to your interests and present relevant
    in advertising and information except all cookies. So there's a big except all
    cookies. But then there's a link here that isn't obvious. Let's click on that.
    So there's no other option to select tracking. and it's not clear what happens
    ef I just leave the box here so I can. Seems I didn't select this except all cookies.
    anyway. Let me get back to our meeting. Page and I have a couple more links here.
    So I I found a web site that was connected to a company in Canada, in in BC, in
    the Greater Vancouver area. and so I ordered with them. and in the process of
    entering the information II used a form fill in for some of my for my billing
    address. and I didn't check that. It changed BC. To Saskatchewan and the delivery
    address. So then, I replied, I said, there's an error. And then I got an AI generated
    message. saying that they had corrected Saskatchewan. Coquitlam, Saskatchewan
    to coquitlam, BC. But it didn't. The address didn't show the unit number or my
    wife's cell phone that I had included. So I reply to the AI. And I. So I asked
    if there was a unit number. and if the cell phone was attached and it said No.
    and then I said it should. The address should have the unit number and the cell
    phone. And then I got a reply. It said, Oh, too late! It's been sent so for delivery
    already, and that was at 5 30. I got the email at 7, 30 local time. So that's
    5 30 in BC. And it said they couldn't make any changes. So I copied that email
    to a customer care address that that sent me another offer. And the email said
    that email bounced it said that address wasn't. Wasn't that didn't exist. So I
    resorted to calling somebody. and I got to speak with somebody right away. They
    took the order number and they said, yeah, it has a unit number. Yes, it it says
    it's equivalent. BC, yes, your wife's cellphone number is there? So the AI was
    was helpful to begin with, but then it was unhelpful. or the rest of my interactions
    with it. So I wonder whether AI and they make us more productive. But the quality
    of the interactions. I think, is going to decrease may very well decrease. hey?
    So I came across quite an accessible paper about dark patterns, so that that cookie
    example is who just looked at as an example of a dark pattern. So there's so here's
    the page for the paper in the Acm digital library. What makes a dark pattern dark.
    And here's the Pdf. Of the paper. So you should be able to access that on campus
    or with proxy. So I got this in an email. I think it was an email. So this is
    about Microsoft, and whether they're using personal data to train AI. So they
    had 9 9 experts look at the new service agreement and none of them could tell
    whether Microsoft plans on using personal data to train its AI model. So that
    seems like a dark pattern. So I wanted to just mention a couple examples. This
    one came up when I was setting up Zoom to add my phone number to zoom. And I got
    this error message. Please provide a correct phone number. Yes. So once or without
    the hyphens. So is that let's evaluate this in terms of what we've been talking
    about and the gulfs of execution and evaluation. So I want to enter my phone number
    and I enter it as I normally do with hyphens. So we have the area code 3 digits,
    the prefix, 3 digits and 4 digits. I wanted to say, suffix. I guess I'm not sure
    how these parts are named. The 7 digit local phone number, which we which we don't
    use anymore. We need to always specify 10 digits in Canada. So say, it's my mobile
    phone. That's straightforward. I get my country code from a drop-down. I can select
    select Canada and it comes up as a plus one. Then I enter my phone number. Now
    we get. please provide a correct phone number. Yeah. So there's an issue about
    what is the user's responsibility. And what's the system's responsibility? And
    then we also have the idea of the user's mental model that comes from their interaction
    with the interface. And then we have the designer's conceptual model that makes
    sense to the designer. But the system image. So we can't have access to the designer's
    conceptual model. We have system image that gives us this. and it's not clear
    how to resolve this. So the golf of evaluation is not as small as it could be
    here. and one way to resolve, that is. to reformat it. maybe not to reformat it
    on the screen. but to accept the input as it is and search for and modify the
    string internally. So we get the 10 digit number to extract it from the string
    that's entered. Maybe it would be good feedback to modify the number just to make
    the 10 digits. So the number is a correct phone number. So the message could be
    more clear. Yeah, the message could specify the issue that so once we clearly
    specify the issue, I feel like the system should say the programmer was too too
    lazy to check that. Your format that you have a correct phone number. But the
    format isn't what they coded for. So we apologize for that. Please enter without
    separators. That would help you make sure the number is correct when you enter
    it. So if we give that kind of message, then it may be. then maybe it would just
    beautiful. easier to to handle it in the code. It would be interesting to see
    a message like that, wouldn't it? Program was too lazy to to deal with your correct
    input. Yeah? So there are some websites that have text. It's not actual text,
    but as a model for input that has its own issues in terms of whether we need to
    clear that text before entering something new. because you can't clear that. So
    it just maybe adds a bit of confusion about how to use the interface. anyway.
    Does that make sense in terms of an analysis? I made this. Well, we'll talk about
    that in a minute. So this is parking pay station in the Kinesiology and health
    studies. Arcade, underground parquade. Please pay here tap or credit card. So
    there are some things worth mentioning here. so we can pay by coins. so we can
    use quarters, loonies, and Tunis. So the fact that here is a stick on sign indicates
    some problems with the instructions so to pay with tap or credit card insert ticket.
    So so, anyway, tapper, credit card insert ticket. press the blue flashing button.
    pay by tap or insert credit card. and then cash or coin one insert ticket pay
    by. So the cash or coin instructions are quite limited. Maybe people aren't. This
    is maybe an afterthought
  persid: S00
- desc: where they have this size, O sticker that they're going to put on
  persid: ???
- desc: so we can enter builds when you pay with a 5, a 10 or a 20. It's not. I'm
    not sure whether you could pay with a 50 or a hundred. So the issue here is using
    the images we can. We can convey the idea of coins and bills. but it's it isn't
    clear whether the coins and bills depicted are the only ones that are accepted,
    or whether they're meant to signify any coins or bills anyway. So tap or credit
    card insert ticket, press the blue flashing button may by tap or insert credit
    card. So the other thing I want to point out about this sticker that caught my
    attention is that press the blue, flashing button. They have a cutout of this
    sticker. and they've used it to point at the blue flashing button. So they they
    decided they needed to put a sticker on here to make it more clear. and then they
    took a bit of that sticker and pointed at the flashing blue button. So it's not.
    I'm I'm not preview to what this looked like before the sticker was put on. If
    it's hiding some information about the flashing blue button. any thoughts about
    that so answers to the quiz. So the interaction types are instructing, conversing,
    manipulating, exploring. and responding. So each of these different types indicates
    a way that the interaction is structured between the person and the system. So
    the interaction type for the parking meter is instructing. so does the parking
    meter do a good job of instructing. Does the pay station. Do a good job of instructing.
    Let me ask a question for that. Okay, so I'm going to launch the pole air. So
    I'll accept another answer for the 3 ways of knowing what to do. as that was indicated
    in the chat we are and the poor. Now we did pretty well with responses. So it's
    interesting. I gave a. The second question is, yes, no, maybe. And it looks like
    everyone planned coordinated their answers because we have equal split between.
    Yes, no, and maybe so. Anyone care to here to speak to any one from the yes, the
    no, or the maybe answers, would you like to speak to why you said it was yeah.
    So this parking apps or pay by phone. the pay by phone that's used on campus.
    There aren't parking meters anymore on campus where there were parking meters.
    Now there's a short, stubby pull with a cap on it. and so we have to deal with
    getting an app or not being able to park or hoping we don't get a ticket and hoping
    I don't get a ticket doesn't work very well. even when I paid for parking, and
    I've been late getting back to the parking meter. My my vehicle. II had a ticket
    on occasion, so. and the tickets are, I think I have it right here. Actually.
    So the ticket, if I didn't pay it quickly, was $50. But fifth, but it was $30
    if I paid quickly. so I don't know people who don't have cell phones smartphones
    how they can. hey? I suppose you can go into the but 2, and at the booth if they
    starve the booth on MoD tube. Yeah, it's becoming less personal, isn't it? Okay?
    I got a couple yeses and and knows any maybes. Okay. anyway. any thoughts about
    designing the here let me show you better picture of. I had trouble getting this
    text into the right spot. Well. so I invite you to post sketches, so we had one
    post about with a sample from then. Andphigma. which is, looks looks very polished.
    You don't have when I ask for sketches. You don't have to use software to do it.
    You can use pencil and paper to make a sketch. and you can take a picture with
    your smartphone or scan it. So here's just my thought about when the duel is off.
    instead of just saying off here because this the fan isn't off. And but looking
    at an alternative here for the driver an alternative text instead of saying off.
    maybe having a message that says Driver. controlling the the temperature. Oh,
    okay. let me stop sharing this. Okay, sorry about that. Thanks for the heads up
    about the sharing the wrong window.
  persid: S00
- desc: So this
  persid: ???
- desc: a good compromise instead of having them. Let's do another will. So the options
    I am giving you are driver as in place of temperature. Okay, so 3 choices. So
    as we as you answer the question. and we're running out of time here. So I just
    I'll ask you to read that paper I have linked to on the page for next time, and
    we can just talk about implications of that for human-computer interaction. And
    so next day we'll talk about project groups. our assignment groups and project
    groups and the group interface in you our courses. And then we'll explore that
    a little bit as well. Okay. so thank you for today. Take care everyone have a
    good rest of your day, and tomorrow I have office hours tomorrow afternoon. Remember,
    if you want to come and see me. and we'll see you on Thursday. Otherwise have
    a good day.
  persid: S00
- desc: Have a good day.
  persid: S03
- desc: Thanks. You're all have a good one.
  persid: S04

    website, then they give you a prompt to redirect you to the Canadian website.
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

    LOL
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

    all other websites do
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

    unnecessary steps. Like why do I have to press the button to indicate I'm paying
    with a card? Why can the machine not just detect what I am doing when it comes
    time for payment?
  persid: DHH
- desc: The other issue with the parking machines on campus is that some of them do
    not accept cash or coins. One time I had to run around campus since my credit
    card was broken and had to try and find a pay station that accepted coins.
