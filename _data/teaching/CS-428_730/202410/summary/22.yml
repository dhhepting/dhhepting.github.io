Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. So I have posted the midterm marks so they're a little bit raw,
    preliminary still. but nobody fanned. But I'm going to do a bit of adjustment
    to them. But it gives you an idea, and we'll talk about the exam. And we'll talk
    about the final as well. So how's everyone doing today? Ready for the Easter long
    weekend? So it's especially Good Friday tomorrow. Okay, so let me start by sharing
    my screen. Okay? So I'm starting to add a new quiz here. and we can discuss the
    options. Let maybe let me look at the midterm first and preview mode. I think
    I can still do that. Okay, so this is what it looks like when the midterm is available.
    No, I'm still in my teacher view. So I'm doing a preview. So let me know this
    is different than what you saw. what you see when you do a quiz. Okay, so this
    is the screen that comes up. Does that person look familiar. anyway? I don't know
    how many years ago that was taken. It's not my first picture here, but because
    my card my card wore out, and I had. I got a new picture taken. so my card, the
    picture on my card I won't show you, but it's worn off again, so I'm not sure
    whether I should keep that one or get a new picture. Yes, so the picture my profile
    picture that I use everywhere it was taken by what's it called now? One area used
    to be the photography department, but it's part of information services now. anyway.
    So though I sat for a portrait head shot there for the web page that was back
    in 2,012. I'm not sure what this year which year this is from. anyway. So this
    is what you'd see, because you get the photo id. so you can see the. So when when
    with the zoom breakout room, you could see your picture. Now, there's some browser
    issues that didn't show everyone's picture there. anyway. Let me revisit the way.
    So there's some. So there are some comments about the navigation. Does anyone
    anyone see this? The bottom here? No, and that goes away? I thought that was always
    there. So who saw the navigation on the first page. Oh. right. Okay. So first
    question, who was able to use the navigation? Yes, Dane. Oh. do you have a comment?
    Or are you just saying you're able to use in navigation. I'm gonna do a quiz here,
    or a poll, or whatever they're called now. So would it? Okay? I should have asked
    that. So 70 30 for people who could use navigation. So stop sharing. So I can
    only have one full going at once. So here's one more question about that. Wow.
    So it's almost okay. Only 64 people. 64% have participated. 74. K, let's end it
    there. And I'll share the results. So there. quite evenly split. I'm wondering
    is the is the no response, because it's maybe easier to keep track, of which questions
    you've done. Hey? Anyway. Yeah. okay, so they're pluses and minuses trade-offs.
    So that's about. that's what design is about making trade-offs. because we don't
    necessarily have a clear answer. Yeah, so you are courses, is doing a lot of work,
    this semester, or is doing more work than it has in the past, maybe. And so it's
    just takes a bit longer to respond. So maybe I can put a description in the first
    page to give you a bit of a heads up. Okay? So I'm not sure if the interface is
    expressive enough to group certain things on a page if I do them randomly. So
    I'm everyone sees a different order of questions. So I'm not sure that I have
    the granularity to say these can be on the same page like the matching questions,
    or whatever multiple choice could be on the same page, and the longer written
    answer questions, each on their own page. But I'll look into that. Okay, so let
    me go back to the preview. And let's talk about the questions themselves. So these
    aren't in particular order. Okay? So compare a paper-based map and a smartphone
    map app, what are the main concepts and metaphors that are used for each is time
    conception. So I would say. the concepts and metaphors that we have a bird's eye
    view. Or maybe we have a drone flying over the train to be a more current example.
    And maybe the smartphone app is having a window on the train, maybe like having
    the a drone flying over it, and maybe the the map is more like having a balloon.
    Well, we have a static view of the. So we don't have maybe a satellite view because
    the bird is flying around like the drone. So maybe that's more like the smartphone
    app. How is time conceptualized each of them. So time on the paper map is based
    on the scale and the distances. How long it would take you to travel the highways.
    or how long it would take you to hike. depending on what kind of map you're looking
    at. But on a smartphone you can get an estimate of how you're gonna how long it's
    gonna take you with current traffic and so on. So it's it's very immediate. How
    do they differ? Well. we have access to real-time information on the smartphone
    app with traffic and or maybe not real time, but perhaps historical data about
    traffic and so forth. and the paper-based map we. If we have a current printing,
    we might have accurate information. But if it's an older map we might be missing
    some things. Some things have changed. Roads are maybe no longer there. Smaller
    roads are not there. or maybe roads that appears. Secondary. Roads have been upgraded
    to very comfortable roads. so the preferences might change. So there's lots of
    things have come from the paper-based map I made into the digital app. anyway.
    So so if you gave reasonable answers for all all the points. Then I gave you a
    good mark. But if you're missing something, then I'm so I gave full marks if I
    said, Okay. and I gave 8.5, and then, if it's incomplete. I gave 7. And then,
    if it was, there were some problems I gave a lower mark than that. anyway. So
    talking about the role of designer and their responsibilities. So it's there's
    designer isn't just there to do whatever the user tells them. They what the client
    wants them to do. So you can think of that story about the toaster and the garlic
    use, and so forth from the designer stats is an example of that. So design, thinking
    the Double Diamond and building creative confidence in clients. So does introduction
    of AI change any of this. So I was looking for. The idea is that the designer's
    role is more than just doing what the user once. but doing in terms of the double
    diamonds, the divergent thinking, to explore alternatives. to discover alternatives
    and then converge to a design and then diverge and converge again when you deliver
    the product. So maybe it's selecting alternatives to get feedback from users.
    So idea is to get users involved. but also not just. but but to curate and filter
    the those ideas so encourage engagement. But there's still an important role and
    responsibility for the designer to direct the project. And so that's also what
    I mentioned. But I hinted out with the video, I about the spaghetti sauce and
    happiness. So this in chapter 5, I asked you to look at. This is an example of
    maybe how we're Howard doing with Zoom. So today, especially, I feel like I'm
    giving a monologue. And then I'm mindful of not. I'm mindful that I have an audience.
    anyway. So are there some ways to. So we can think about some ways to to make
    class more interactive? I suppose that makes sense. But anyway. so I wanted to
    show you and my, the word interface here that I have switch to that for this first
    question, for the question about safety. No, that's not it. I'm looking for the
    window that I just opened Eleanor. Well, I guess. Let me try and just do the whole
    desktop. Can you see that. Okay. okay? So I I know about saving. So I want to
    save on my computer. Let's say. Oh, and I want to turn on auto saving. So that's
    what happens when I try and turn it on. This phone needs to be saved in the cloud
    first. Okay. how do I do that? Let's see file. save as okay. Where's the cloud?
    Could it be this so I don't know about having a onedrive account or sharepoint.
    so I don't know if I have an account, or what I'm not inclined to do that. so
    there's no direction here about how to save it to the cloud and how to navigate
    that. and there's no explanation of why I need to save it to the cloud to do an
    autosave. So some people pointed out that there should be an option to save on
    your local computer or a reason why they're pushing the Cloud Storage account.
    But at this point, if I don't have a cloud account a onedrive account. I don't
    want to set one up, then I can't use the autosave feature. so there's no indication
    of why I need to put it into the cloud to save the file automatically. So there
    were some comments about the history of revisions. So that's maybe a little bit
    different issue. Then auto saving. So the question about safety is, if you decide
    to go without save turning autosave on. and you forget to save it, and the power
    goes out and the computer dies, and the copy of your. the most important document
    ever is not saved with your latest revisions. So that's one thing, and then the
    other thing is, maybe it's easy to turn it off. So so maybe what wasn't clear
    is that I showed you the dialogue fact of me clicking auto save to turn it on.
    But I get this message instead. Does that make sense? So we talked about some
    opportunities there for redesign, like maybe having the option to auto save to
    your local jet desk and so forth. Okay, so this one empathy map to describe your
    experience of getting slept to write this exam in your courses in zoom breakout
    rooms. So I appreciate everyone who shared honestly about the stress that this
    whole thing caused. and I apologize very much for all of that. So part of it is.
    we're talking about system image to the designers model and the user's model and
    the relationship. So I had one definitely, I having one view of things. that everything
    was smooth, and I laid it out for everyone. But does it? I couldn't adequately
    communicate that to you I had to leave it. In the interface. The system image.
    as presented in the image is presented on screen. and the emails or messages I
    had sent to the discussion group beforehand. So I had. And so the issue with the
    exam not being ready on time not being a vet viewable on time was because I had
    joined as a host of a Zoom Meeting. and I realize I need to do something else.
    But I I didn't leave the Zoom Meeting, and I kept getting requests for help from
    individual people in their zoom breakout rooms. And that's so. That's so. That
    delayed me from completing what I need to do in the UR. Courses setup. So I ultimately
    left the zoom breakout room for a bit. fixed the issue in your courses, and then
    came back. So anyway. So I didn't explain why I had midterm A and midterm B groups.
    Was anyone concerned about that? Or can anyone express some concerns they add
    about about that. So the reason was because I can only do 50 breakout rooms in
    Zoom. So we had to have 2 separate Zoom Meetings to accommodate everyone. So that
    was the reason for having 2 groups, 2 separate Zoom Meetings. Does that make sense?
    Anyone have any questions about? Okay. yeah. So I did an example. An example of
    the midterm. So the gulf of execution arises because there's a gap between what
    the user wants to accomplish the goals that the user has. and finding out how
    to convert those into commands in the interface and the Gulf evaluation arises
    when there's an issue in interpreting the state of the system as displayed as
    presented. So there's maybe not feedback. and so on. So empathizing with the user
    and understanding. Their perspective is an important step in minimizing these
    golf's. So we understand what they want to accomplish. how they view the the tasks
    which metaphors might be appropriate and then design the interface to be consistent
    with those metaphors. Okay. so this question about the front camera, low visibility,
    clean screen. So it's good because it's showing an issue. But it's bad, because
    doesn't exactly see how to resolve the issue. So, as far as I know, there's no
    way to get an image from the front camera. I didn't know there was a front camera
    until I saw that message the first time. So I think the camera is behind. It's
    pointing out from the area behind the rearview mirror so it would be nice if I
    could get a there's a way to if this message came up. Once I'm pulled over and
    parked. Then I can get a an image from the camera that would help me understand
    what the problem is. because, with the rear camera in my vehicle. I can use a
    windshield washer in the in the rear to clean the back window, and it will also
    clean the camera. because the the way it's positioned. so I can do that easily.
    But with the windshield wipers the way they are I can't just. It seems to be in
    a spot that's not covered by the windshield wipers and the wind front windshield.
    And the car is big enough. It's that's I guess it's a was it called a crossover.
    It's a Ford edge. So. reaching the top of the the top of the top middle of the
    windshield is not an easy task. and I'm not sure that the Manual has that information.
    So the question isn't really about driving. Some people have said that they don't
    drive or they're. but it's really about the message. So there's an issue. And
    so this is a situation that requires interaction from the user, from the driver
    or from the person operating the person in the driver's seat. but the user who's
    sitting there and sees the message. They need to do something. since they're just
    dismissing it and could say how to locate the camera. And then. maybe, instead
    of having this pop up when when I'm driving. perhaps when I start the vehicle
    or and when I'm in park. There's a way that I could test. That the front camera
    is. is, has good visibility, is working properly. So if I dismiss this. I don't
    know if it's gonna if it if I dismissing it and it goes away. I don't know that
    I'm solving the problem, or whether I've just dismissed it. And it's not clear
    what the status of the system is. 10, does that make sense? Okay. hey? So I just
    realized, oh, I was, I'm showing the whole screen, aren't I? Okay? So here's the
    answers for the question. So execution at the visceral level. perform execution
    at behavior levels, specify execution at the reflective level plan. So the idea
    is we ref. So reflecting at the from the user. deciding what to do. make a plan,
    we have a goal in mind. So you make a plan. and then then we specify what needs
    to be done. And then we perform the steps that we've that we specified. and then
    an evaluation at the reflective level as we compare. So this is it. we're interpreting
    the state of the system. So at the highest level, we're comparing what we. But
    we've where we understand the interface state to be with the what we're to, what
    we expect evaluation, the visceral level. It's pretty shared. So the next step
    is so before comparing, we interpret. that's behavioral level. That's the middle
    step. an evaluation at the visceral level. As we we perceive. So the visceral
    level is closest to the system. So we're performing. And we're perceiving at the
    visceral level. at the behavior level, we're specifying and interpreting and at
    the reflective level which is closest to the user. Then we're planning and comparing.
    So then I threw in a couple extras, though that was so, understand is, maybe I
    realized too close it could fit into this. It's too close to the other answers.
    I realize. So this is part of the adjustment that I'll make so my apologies? So
    were the questions generally fair. So I'll put some of these questions into a
    a feedback activity. So it's exam. But the question. so I'm curious. Think the
    questions in general are okay. If there was enough information there to answer
    them, or there were just too many of them. That's not an or another issue is,
    if there were just too many of them to deal with. Okay. So I didn't realize it
    was a secret word limit. So so it it didn't. I just noted it. It didn't truncate
    anything. Hmm. hey? So I apologize again. So I'm going to try some things. So
    I'm going to create a quiz. So these are the options I have. So I can. These are
    the options I have to deal with. Exchange some attempts. so I will have that available.
    And we can work out some question formats so that we don't have the same issues
    as with the midterm. So was it a good thing to have another question I want to
    ask is, was it a good thing to have it? Be it open book. hey? So so the thing
    about openbook is, I noticed that some answers were word for word for paragraphs
    of the book. and for the most part they were acknowledged. So that's an issue
    that I I want to make clear is that we can. We don't. So I want to be clear that
    it's not. It's not sufficient just to copy content from the book without acknowledging
    it. for one thing. then also transforming it so that it's clearly you understand
    what's going on. So let's so we'll work on it being open book the same way where
    you have access to either the fifth or sixth edition of the Interaction Design
    Book by Rogers, sharp and priest. either hard copy or online and electronic form.
    So I'll so I'll see about the details of that. And we'll keep that conversation
    going. Is that a reasonable compromise for for a source or the open book of the
    text of that main textbook? Okay. so I will look into that. So in terms of the
    syllabus. So the syllabus is a syllabus. so it the final exam will be comprehensive.
    So there would be some focus on what we did before the midterm. Most of it will
    be. and the maybe one third before the midterm. 2 thirds after the midterm. But
    in some ways it's it's hard to separate because we've we've revisited concepts
    from time to time over the course of this semester split. We'll look at the whole
    semester and boom focus on things that are referenced in the textbook. Yes. So
    we're going to use Proctor track for the final. So please everyone do the onboarding
    quiz so that you're set up for this class. That's also part of the last assignment.
    Any questions about the last assignment? It's not available on the website. What?
    I was sure it would whoops wrong class. You see this zoom versus proctor track
    on my screen. Let me see if it's going to the right spot for it. Oh. no, it's
    not. I have to fix that link. Sorry. you know. Fix that right away. Okay. okay.
    So now it's that Link is working. So I I've cleared that up. I hope so. If you
    refresh it, your you are courses now. You should be able to see it. so I think
    a good source of exam. Final exam questions would be. and some reflection and
    analysis about where the midterm went wrong. So I'm I want to find the balance.
    I mean what I say when I say it. I want the exams to be a fair assessment of our
    learning, this semester of your learning, this semester. So I encourage you to
    engage with me in the conversation about what that would mean for you. Anyway,
    we're out of time for today. so I hope this was helpful. I'll deal with adjustments
    to Marks and have a good Easter long weekend. See you on Tuesday. We're in April.
    Then 4 more meetings after this. Thanks! Again! Take care! Everyone.

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: the navigation part can be pulled out from the right
  persid: DHH
- desc: I did
  persid: DHH
- desc: I was able to use it
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah the separate pages is easier to see which questions ive done
  persid: DHH
- desc: if all questions are on the same page, you may accidentally scroll past one
    question and don't give it an answer. when they are on separate pages, you can
    look at navigation and see if all are filled out or not
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think on one hand it's nice to easily see the questions so that you can
    decide which ones to answer and plan out your exam, but I also think it's possible
    to lose track of the questions more easily if they're all on the same page.
  persid: DHH
- desc: the questions take awhile to load on my computer when they're all on diff
    pages, thats my only gripe
  persid: DHH
- desc: I said "not sure", because from my experience sometimes it is better to have
    questions on separate pages and other times it's better to have them on the same
    page. Depends on the type of questions and the way they are displayed by the system.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Written questions should be on their own page, matching and multiple choice
    can be on the same page imo
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Written questions sh...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: yes, it makes sense
  persid: DHH
- desc: what will be the Final exam syllabus?
  persid: DHH
- desc: We didn't talk about that one matching question, could you explain the answers
    for that one? I know I wasn't the only one bamboozled by that question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: ^^ I also did not understand the matching question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"We didn't talk about...\" with \U0001F446"
  persid: DHH
- desc: yes please, I remember I had difficulty finding answers for that question
    as well during the exam.
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"We didn't talk about...\" with \U0001F446"
  persid: DHH
- desc: I personally found this question to be too vague to answer properly. I understand
    your explanation right now, but I think other words could be argued correct as
    well. There was too much room for interpretation for a matching question maybe

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: The questions in general were okay, but required a lot of typing to provide
    a thorough answer.
  persid: DHH
- desc: My biggest gripe was that there was a secret word limit that wasn't communicated
    to me until after I had written my answers, and also no live word count, so I
    had to try to estimate how many words to shave off. That wasted a lot of my time
    during the exam.
  persid: DHH
