Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning, everyone. So I need to debug my my file was sharing the web
    site. And I'm not seeing what the problem is. Okay, I found it. Okay. So today,
    I want to talk about assignments. including the project. And and I'll go through
    some things related to that. I also want to go through some things we've talked
    about last day, and some of the things were brought up in the responses. Okay,
    so let me share my screen with you. so you don't have the big. My big giant head
    is the only thing to look at. Okay, so let me zoom in a little bit here make a
    little easier to read. Okay. So one issue that was brought up was responsibility
    in an interface. So who is? Should the developer have responsibility for following
    heuristics. listening to users and thinking about. But what the most vulnerable
    potential users might experience? Or is it up to the person using the system to
    the careful? Should we expect the the interface to be concerned with our safety?
    Or should we be? Do we need to be wary always? And if we're taking the perspective
    of user beware. do we need to think about regulatory frameworks. different ways
    to approach the issues of safety? So, for example, do we thinking about the dark
    pattern stuff? Is that something we we value? We search for? So something like
    the app store on Apple or Google play. Could there be a a process where dark patterns
    are identified or and not just identified, but lagged for users, or maybe even
    disallowed. was apt to be disallowed from being available on the various app stores.
    So that's a lot more than just that first comment about responsibilities between
    developer and the person using the system. Any thoughts about that
  persid: S00
- desc: feel like the responsibility kind of falls on both parties. You know, it's
    our responsibility as developers to create something that is nice, easy to use
    for the user, but also safe for them to use. But us as users as well, kind of
    have to take the responsibility to cover our own butts just because there are
    things out there that point us in the wrong directions or could get us into trouble.
  persid: S01
- desc: Umhm.
  persid: S00
- desc: I mean, if not mistaken on Google play. They have that Google Guard, or whatever
    it is, for all apps that are submitted. But there was a bunch of them last year,
    if not mistaken, that got through the protection. And they had a bunch of ill
    things inside their programming. So
  persid: S01
- desc: hmm. okay. So common in chat, I feel like users shouldn't be normalizing being
    tricked through dark patterns as part of them using the software, I feel that
    it's the responsibility of developers to explicitly address such techniques, for
    when used, and to inform users about them beforehand instead of tricking them
    into it. Okay, so what do he say to users? This web site is trying to get your
    money, so we're mak not making it easy for you to use it without paying for anything.
    So the dark patterns and dark patterns are. or maybe not. Well, not, maybe, but
    are, are never a good idea. So there are some comments about AI not being helpful.
    And so I wonder has anyone seen the new travago ads? So someone sent me a direct
    message. Please don't do that. So in that direct message I was called Mister Hepding.
    so Mr. Hepting is not incorrect in general, but I I indicated you can call me
    Darryl or Dr. Hepting, please. I had someone I heard some one on Cbc. Talk who
    got his Ph. D. Recently said. anyway. anyway, I don't want to go into that. So
    the new trivago ads. Anyone see the old travago ads. Have you seen any trivago
    ads?
  persid: S00
- desc: Those are the ones with the gnomes.
  persid: S01
- desc: I think that's a expedia or travel us. It's different. Those are different
    ads, I think. Let's see. So you can't see. I'm going to take a picture of this,
    and I'll post it. You can't see the quiz interface. We were talking yesterday
    about about having text, and suggests things. So in this interface there's text,
    but it's part of the label. So if I don't erase it. Then it's just gonna be. It's
    adding to the what I'm trying to enter. That makes sense. It will make sense when
    I show you the picture. I guess. So here's a quick poll about the travago ads.
    okay, so we have 97% participation. So let's stop the poll. There share results.
    Okay? So the people who said, Yes. what do you do? You have any impressions from
    those ads? So they're done with AI, and what I notice is that they're essentially
    saving money by having one actor, and then they're doing the dialogue in. So I'm
    not sure whether the voices are. If if the actors after, if the actor's voice
    is ever his own in the ad, but they're generated. The different languages used
    in the ad are generated using AI or the the sinking of the audio track to the
    video is done with AI. So they're able to. So they're able to save a lot of money.
    But the impact is even in English. which is presumably the the original language
    that's being recorded for the video. It feels like it's out of sync. So they might
    be too generic. So I have an article about that I link to. So there's so this
    actor appears in all the ads, and he's speaking different languages. So here's
    a comment. Why'd you replace him with a I? But I can do a better job. so a measurement
    of success is so I might be saving the company money. But whether or not people
    are reacting positively to it. and whether AI is helping anything other than the
    bottom line in terms of producing ads is still a question. I think it'd be interesting
    to see some research done about people's reaction to the the ads can fit the these
    overdubbed ads with the previous ads, for example. where we have somebody speaking
    in their native language. So we don't have the impression that the video and the
    audio is disjoint. anyway. So another comment that I saw seemed to indicate that
    the teleflor website that we looked at last day was nothing out of the ordinary.
    It was a pretty standard website for ecommerce. So a question is, why do we as
    users. except that low bar of or design any thoughts about that. Yeah. Okay. so
    thanks for the link to the video. There's. I think there's a video here as well.
    Here's a second version. I haven't looked at this video. Let's try it, though.
    What would you like to pay for your hotel in tonight? A 185, a hundred 69 or a
    hundred $55. Same room, same service, just different prices. frivolial to you.
    Well, nobody asks you. There's a perception. but that's exactly what Cherva does.
    Cherva compares hotel prices from hundreds of phone sites. so save yourself valuable
    time and money. Use trivago, prepare hotel prices, and save up to $30 a night.
    Hotel Travaga. Is this the same one? Let me let's try this one. No, that's maybe
    the same one, anyway. don't want to belabor the point. But it's yeah. So the uncanny
    valley is is a real thing. And so it's these ads seem a little bit creepy to me.
    so we'll see whether or not they help the accompany or hurt them in the long run.
    Or maybe people don't watch the ads who are looking. I've used the Travaga website
    before. and maybe maybe people like me have used it and found it helpful will
    continue to use it despite having bad advertising. We'll see how that plays out.
    I'm just looking at the comments. So if not travago, what's what's the what's
    the better website to look for comparing hotel prices. So now want to get into.
    There's a comment about errors that people make, and and so the heuristics we
    talk about handling errors, and, better yet, prevent errors altogether. So there
    are slips. The 2 types of user errors are slips when users intend to perform one
    action. but end up doing another one. for example, and sift, and I, typing an
    eye instead of it all counts as a slip. accidentally putting liquid hand soap
    on one's toothbrush instead of it. Toothpaste is also a slip. That's a pretty
    serious slip, I think slips are typical when users are an autopilot when they
    don't fully devote their attention to resources at the task at hand. so maybe
    they make a slip by clicking the wrong button on an interface by clicking. Yes,
    when the man to say no. So when mistakes are when users have goals are inappropriate
    for the current problem or task. Even if they take the right steps to complete
    their goals, the steps will result in error. For example, if I misunderstood,
    stood the meeting of the oil pressure warning light in my car and thought it was
    a tire pressure monitor. no matter how carefully I added air to my tires. would
    not fix the air, fix the issue with my oil pressure. This would be a mistake,
    since the goal that I was attempting to accomplish was inappropriate for the situation,
    even though I made no errors in executing my plan. Mistakes are conscious errors,
    and often, but not exclusively arise when a user is incomplete or incorrect information
    of the task and develops a mantle moth that doesn't match how the interface actually
    works. And that's that's an issue of design. And here's some more detail about
    that. So if I'm continually doing the wrong thing like with the Norman doors from
    trying to always push instead of pull or vice versa. That's a design problem.
    Yeah. So there's there is some issue of responsibility to understand the interface
    as best we can. but it still might be still might be prone to mistakes. because
    it doesn't present information properly, or it's confusing. And if people are
    making that error. A lot. That mistake has happens a lot. Then that's an issue
    for the designer to handle. The designer may have this elegant conceptual model,
    but its not being communicated to the user. So we need to address that.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah, II can agree that it's up. It's kind of up to the the designer to have
    a proper design. But I feel like it's glossing over the fact that I think the
    consumer or the end user has a certain degree of responsibility. I mean, I had.
    I had a friend in high school who wasn't allowed to drive his parents car until
    he read the user manual from front to back. which gave him like a really really
    good understanding of the car, obviously, and how everything works, so that in
    a case like that there was no misunderstanding. and they do give you a user manual
    for you to read it. It's there for your use, is there to inform me on how to use
    the car and what all the different things mean. You know I digress, but there's
    some I feel like there's a little bit of responsibility on the user to familiarize
    themselves with a new car if they get that new car. And sure it's kind of inconvenient
    to have to read through a manual. But just to, you know, get in it and assume
    it's like any other car is a bit like I don't know. I feel like that's not fair
    to the manufacturer.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah. so there's some issues, then. that I could think of so different manufacturers
    want to differentiate themselves. So they make interfaces that are different for
    the sake of being different, and they might not they, they might not effectively
    leverage people's understanding about how controls are arranged.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah, that's that's true, and that's fair enough. But
  persid: S02
- desc: and the other thing and my Ford edge again. So there's I have gotten this
    wrench up here on the display, and it says. check user manual for details. And
    I did check the user manual. But there is nothing that said what to do with a
    wrench coming up on my display. So it's can. So it's a question of whether the
    the manual's been written carefully. If it's a good quality manual, then it's
    a good thing to to direct people to it. and if you're going to direct people to
    it, make sure that you're directing them in a way that they can find what they're
    looking for, and in the manual. So if there are occasions when direct, it's like
    a wrench shows up. See Manual and I, there's no way to find the relevant material
    in the manual no easy way than I might disregard any further attempts to reference.
    The manual
  persid: S00
- desc: yeah. And and that checks out. It's kind of like a double edged blade, where,
    like both sides, have to put in the the same amount of effort for it to actually
    be like. The sort of fruitful. you know. Interaction.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: S00
- desc: I think it kind of comes down to people and humanities just gotten lazy and
    complacent in certain things. I mean if you look at a vehicle manual from back
    in the eighties and nineties, they were detailed. and you know now they're a little
    bit more vague and harder to find information.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah, and I think part of that is because there's like a norm that like, you
    leave the user manual in the car, and you only reference it if you really need
    it. And even then, like II know people who haven't touched the user manual for
    their for their cars. And I mean, yeah, cars all kind of work the same way they
    they drive you from point A to Point B. But there's again I feel like there's
    some level of responsibility on the user's part to actually take the incentive
    to to learn rather than just like expect the car to tell them everything they
    need to know. I 100% agree. It's like people who try to do an Ikea set without
    following the instructions. I mean, you see how sometimes those things turn out.
    It's like they're there to help you, and if you don't use them to help you, then,
    like I don't know what you're expecting to get out of it. But then, again, there's
    the other side of the argument as well. The manuals kind of suck. and you know
    what some of them do.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: S00
- desc: So it's it's like looking.
  persid: S02
- desc: Not all should require you to check the manual, especially the stuff that
    we're talking about in class like, I feel like goes example. You shouldn't need
    to go into a manual to understand what the car is saying like, these are issues
    that are pretty frequent, like the air pressure and tire. They should be designed
    so that you don't need to go check for some for somewhere, for instructions to
    understand what it's saying. and it's not hard to design something that's understandable,
    especially now that there's standard like there's a standard of how to do it.
    I guess it depends on older classes different. But the manual is there for certain
    issues. But something shouldn't need you to check a whole bunch of instructions
    to understand it. So
  persid: S03
- desc: I don't know. I think it depends, I guess, on the car. It does depend on the
    car. It also depends on the user. Right? So if someone has like a pretty like
    in-depth knowledge of cars, and how they work, someone kind of like myself. and
    I see a light come on the dash. I'll like 95% of the time. I'll already know what
    it is. I don't need something to tell me. Oh, it's like a tire pressure sensor
    light, or it's an oil pressure sensor light. They they both look different. And
    I've already made that differentiation. I've already seen it. So it I feel like
    it's you can't sort of apply it to the general population, because you have sort
    of 2 sides. You have the side that doesn't really know what's going on with their
    car. They don't really know how it works, and you have the side that's pretty
    well versed in that stuff that can figure it out relatively easily. And yeah,
    older cars obviously don't have the same types of equipment and whatnot. To tell
    you what's wrong. It'll be like, oh, something's wrong. The engine light just
    goes on, and then, if it's like a misfire or something with like the timing, then
    it will flash at you, because that's like really bad. but like not, everyone's
    gonna know that. So again, it's like. I feel like it should be approached more
    on a case by case rather than like a generalization.
  persid: S02
- desc: Umhm
  persid: S00
- desc: kind of falls back to how we all are complacent with how technology has brought
    us to this day. You know, we we've gotten more and more complacent with things,
    telling us what to do automatically without having to go back to what we used
    to do in the past, which I mean kind of plays into this as well cause you have
    different generations who are gonna have different ideas on both sides of this
  persid: S01
- desc: Umhm. So where you're in. possibly in danger of becoming the civilization.
    One of the Star Trek episodes were to rely on the computer to manage everything.
    But then the computer breaks down, and they don't know how to fix it. And they
    were lost without it.
  persid: S00
- desc: Exactly. I mean, it even comes down to AI. Look at email. Everybody hated
    email at the very beginning, when it first came out. Everyone loves it. Now. you
    know, AI, it's new. It's starting to. It's being developed more and more each
    day. It's getting better and better each day. It's better than what it was when
    it first came out. So it's like how much time, until everyone just gets complacent.
    And AI is, you know. AI, it's it's acceptable in our culture.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah. there's lots of risks with a I that aren't the same risks. As with email.
    So this is a different kind of technology. It's not. It's of a different character,
    I think. And maybe that's not clear to people.
  persid: S00
- desc: I mean, it comes down to dark patterns, right? If AI is used in the proper
    sense with honest intentions. then I mean, I could see it being something very
    useful potentially in the future. I mean, but with a bunch of the dark patterns
    that go on in this world today. I mean, I could see how that could totally be
    used for ill purposes and everything else, right  and it's kind of like phishing
    scams and email I mean, it was one of the big things that people hated about email,
    you'd get emails from people all over the place. You don't know what it is. You
    click a link. Next thing you know, you're hijacked ransomware, whatever else.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah. okay. So I think maybe if we if we could always think about a find uses
    or use AI as a way to upgrade people's skills and support them and augment their
    daily lives. That would be great. But the potential for R is also present, and
    we need to be careful in how we adapt things, I think. adopt things. So let me
    go on to what I wish to talk about today. which is about I went to demonstrate.
    do a live demo here about group form, project, group formation. And so we have
    the heuristics that we can use to evaluate and interface by looking at it. We
    don't need users to to do that. Evaluation. Experts can evaluate the screens and
    look at what happens when wait we click through different things, and so we can
    use those heuristics to do a walk-through and get a an overview of what a sense
    of what might be issued where issues might be in the interface, and whether it's
    well designed and not and do that kind of evaluation. So that that's and we can
    do an evaluation that's empirical where we get user data. And we can do an evaluation
    that's analytical where we don't have users. We do a separate analysis. So another
    kind of analysis we can do as called a keystroke level model. It's part of Gos
    gums, the gums framework. Gole's operator's method selections. And I'll put some
    links about it as well. But the idea is to look at the different actions that
    are required. So a key press takes a certain amount of time. and moving. The mouse,
    moving from the keyboard to the mouse and pointing. takes a certain amount of
    time. and going back and forth from the mouse to the keyboard takes a certain
    amount of time. so there are a number of actions that are required of of the number
    of actions that are required. They each get a time. and we can get an estimate
    of the relative time that an interface takes. So I want. I want to keep that in
    mind as we look at view, our courses interface. So I also want to think about
    this in terms of as you watch me go through this is there? Think about creating
    an empathy map for me as I go through it. So the project ideas I would like to
    consider is that we focus on like, there can be different aspects. But the focus
    on  the group's interface in your courses. So what opportunities there are for
    design, and how we might go about creating a new interface. So there are a number
    of facets for this, so we don't. We don't need to. I mean, there's opportunity
    to look at different aspects of it. So when I go to group under participants,
    I go to groupings. So I started making a project project groups. So the 3 project
    groups for 7, 30 were same as the assignment groups. So I copied them over. But
    II realize that maybe that's not the most clear way to do it. So I'm going to
    delete these groups. and I'm going to instead. because they're the same as the
    assignment groups. I'm just going to put these assignment groups into the project
    group. Does that make sense? So I can remove these groups? Let me see if I can
    to all 3 at the same time. Okay, that's all right. Okay, so I can reuse the groups
    there. So what I want to do for the 4, 28 project groups. So the reason I'm copying
    them without change is because there are 2 groups of 4 and one group of 3. So
    that's already set up according to the way I indicated for the project. So keep
    the same groups there. So there aren't any groups in 4, 28 project. Let's take
    all the groups that have 4 members. and this we don't have that information here.
    So let's go back and see see how this works. Let's just duplicate this tab. because
    we'll need to look at groups. So here we can see there's one group. So those are
    the. So we. I think we need one group O 3 for 4, 28 as well. So there's one group
    there. So here the list of groups that have 4 or 3 in them. Now I want to take
    that information and put it into here. So I know that group one has for. and then
    15, 16, 17 as well. 23 and 25, 27, and 41. Now, what I want to do is take the
    remaining groups and use them to generate groups of 4. So let's see about auto
    creating groups. So we want 4 people in a group. and we'll just see whether we
    can get this members from grouping assignments 4, 28. So I was hoping that I could
    select groups individually here. But I can't. I can only select one group. So
    my plan is to then make another grouping for this group should have one or 2 members
    in them. so we can shuffle the groups that get generated. That's not my concern
    right now this makes sense. So it it's great that they do auto naming, but there's
    no way for me to specify for numbered groups. There's no way for me to say. Make
    them 0, pat pat them with 0. So they become. They're listed in numerical order.
    because I can only put in one at sign for a character or one number sign or hash
    for a number, so I can't say but 2 of them together to make a a two-digit number
    for the group. anyway. So let's go back here back to groupings. So let's create
    a new grouping. So all I can do here is name the group. I could give it an id.
    Maybe in the description there's no way for me to say. Have rules, let's say about
    what I want to put in this group this grouping. Now let's see if I get a screen.
    Okay. let's make one more copy of this. So here are the ones I want to exclude.
    So be nice. Say, I would like to take the silent grouping and take the rest of
    the groups in the assignment. 4, 20, Simon's 4, 28 grouping and put them. and
    to the other other grouping here. So 1, 1516, 17. So I'm trying to paste. Oh,
    there's a copy. See if that works. There we go. Okay. So I don't want one by 1,
    10 do. 14, 18, 22, 2325, 27, 24.  wanted to leave 25, yeah, and 27 and 41. So
    the rest of these can be added. So it would be nice. Just think about this, that
    pick a group being here to choose from. So I don't have this extra noise and these
    other groups that are around. So here's the okay. I want to get this sorted before
    it doesn't show up. Okay. So no whooping. Okay, that didn't didn't quite work
    out. So let's adjust the grouping. I'm out of time here. So I appreciate our discussions
    till what I'd like to do. So I'll get this laid out and we'll focus on this after
    the break. Thank you for today for the discussion. That was very good. I appreciate
    it. Enjoy your break and take care. I have a great.

    go somewhere else. To me it's a red flag. If they can't bother to make a good

    of customers. There are some outliers, but as a general statement, a weak advertising
    campaign won't really deter the existing customer base.

- desc: As far as the oil pressure light and tire pressure light mixup goes, I think
    the end user has some level of responsibility to become familiar with their vehicle
    to safely operate it. They do have a manual for a reason.

  persid: DHH
- desc: It can also come down to the readability of the manual too. I agree that its
    a good practice to familiarize yourself with the user manual, but that is also
    on the manufacturer to ensure that its contents are easy to understand and doesn't
    overwhelm the user at first glance.

    with a new system. It doesn't excuse bad design but the goal of design should
    not have to make everything "beige" or the same as every other designer for simplicity.
    Designers need to be permitted to try to improve designs

    the blind set were abysmal, and YouTube and Google didn't help. I had to figure
    some things out on my own, and it probably added a solid hour onto the task.

    on them. Sure the user can just search up the manual online for pdf or something,
    but at that point they may just result to searching for the actual solution to
    the problem they have rather than consume a manual and hope that it contains the
    information they need.
