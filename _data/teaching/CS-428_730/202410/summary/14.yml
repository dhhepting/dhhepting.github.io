- desc: Hello, everyone!
  persid: S00
- desc: How's it going today, Darryl?
  persid: S01
- desc: Well, it's going alright, I guess. Thanks. And you.
  persid: S00
- desc: It's going just preparing for midterms and stuff.
  persid: S01
- desc: "Yes. I'm preparing for a midterm today in 2 80. And then there's another\
    \ midterm coming up on Tuesday. Perhaps I had a request to move it to Thursday.\
    \ so I put a choice on you. Our courses. I'm sorry about the responses and the\
    \ quizzes or the response in the quiz for his last meeting not being available,\
    \ I recreated. When I recreate it. I've created a response for last meeting and\
    \ made it open until tomorrow at noon. So if you want to do both at once. You\
    \ can do that. My apologies again for that. So the other thing about the midterm\
    \ is. should it be open book? So I'm just checking on my settings. I made for\
    \ that. Let's make it available until the end of class. Or, let's say, 2 30 this\
    \ afternoon. you know. Make it available to everyone. Once Hong Kong and answered.\
    \ Okay, let's see if that works. I have my mic on. You can hear me muttering,\
    \ can't you? A okay. So 5 people have responded. 6 people have responded so far.\
    \ and I can't show you the screen because it has names on it. But what if you\
    \ answer the quiz, if you answer the choice. then it will and publish the results\
    \ for you. I'll post the link in the chat. Oh, yeah, that's right. It's a sleep\
    \ day today. So to celebrate. you should come to the talk from computer Science\
    \ Department. Friend Tim Belshur was born in raised in Regina until the age of\
    \ 12, when his family moved to BC. So you spent 25 years in film and games places\
    \ like ILM. And electronic arts. So he'll be talking about his career and film\
    \ and games emerging tech and art. So that's a Zoom Meeting. I think it's on our\
    \ calendar for today. and good news about. I mentioned the social dilemma the\
    \ other day. So I've gotten permission to screen it so I can. So I'm thinking\
    \ of screening the 40\_min version in class one day and then arranging for the\
    \ 90\_min version to be screened one evening or more than one evening. Does that\
    \ sound interesting? Yeah. So I guess it's a comment about it's been. It's difficult\
    \ to move the the schedule of the slate date. So the other thing about moving.\
    \ It is, I have to. I have invigilators arranged with a department, and so I have\
    \ to arrange for them to be. I would have to arrange for them to be moved. But\
    \ I guess as well I can't move the exam unless everybody agrees. Okay. okay. So\
    \ so I appreciate the comment about being uncertain about the exam. So I want\
    \ to talk about that day and and get you involved in the conversation so we can.\
    \ We can be sure about it. So I would say about moving it. It's it would be. There\
    \ are people who can't move it. Then the question is motive. Other people would\
    \ like to move it. So we'll have the exam on Tuesday. And so so if we could say\
    \ it's openbook, and you can use textbook either. What whichever addition of beyond\
    \ in or interaction design beyond human computer interaction. Whichever version\
    \ you have. Okay. So everybody in class who's in this meeting use that link and\
    \ submit your vote on the quiz on that choice for move. Midterm march seventh.\
    \ Okay, so some people only have the online or digital versions. So I will see\
    \ how to make that possible. Okay, so I'll work on that. Does that seem? Okay?\
    \ So question about not having a camera on your computer, will that be an issue.\
    \ I will have to find out and find what might be a workaround. Okay. so have lots\
    \ to do. And I will reply by tomorrow. But these things. So what I would say about\
    \ what's gonna be on the midterm is what we've discussed in class. So what's been\
    \ recorded in our meetings in the so the transcripts are up to date. I believe\
    \ I might have a few screenshots today. We'll share with you still that I haven't\
    \ posted, but I believe most of the things. Yes, so I ran into some struggles\
    \ with my Microsoft version of Microsoft word that threw off my attempts to get\
    \ things done quickly with the other class. So that's a poor excuse, and I apologize.\
    \ But I'll I'll make a list of of the videos and so on. and the resources that\
    \ we've used. That would be a good reference for you to look at. But I'll keep\
    \ in mind if we restrict the reference material to the interaction design book\
    \ online or in physical versions during the exam, is that okay? And I will see\
    \ just what's what's possible for that? What would you like me to say again. So\
    \ I will post a summary of our our meeting resources. and I'll see whether it's\
    \ possible to keep the online reference material to this. either the online or\
    \ the fiscal copy of this book. or an earlier version of it, earlier edition of\
    \ it. And if it's not, then I'll let you know that as well. Okay. so I will. I'm\
    \ still welcoming your suggestions for exam questions. the ones that are open-ended.\
    \ although I appreciate those, maybe if we can keep those to limited in scope,\
    \ so they're not cause I am going to be marking the exam. So if we have at least\
    \ a mix of things that can be marked automatically. and then maybe one or 2 things\
    \ that I could mark by myself. and I'll try and turn those around as quickly as\
    \ possible. So keep that in mind in your suggestions. Okay, does that make sense?\
    \ Okay, I'm especially interested in so. But whether some questions are open book,\
    \ and some are a closed book. I will have to see what I can arranged so disadvantaging\
    \ some people over. I'll just see what I can do with openbook online. Does that\
    \ make sense? So my thought is to even though we've maybe discussed concepts with\
    \ other materials, that there will be references to it in the textbook. So if\
    \ I can. yeah, there's 2 2. So the examples aren't the same. But the ideas they're\
    \ in the Dawn Norman book have expressions in the in the interaction design textbook\
    \ for the most part. So I would. I would restrict questions to things that can\
    \ be hmm. To have mentions in the in that one textbook. That's my plan. Okay?\
    \ So again, I'm looking at the responses to that choice. Yeah, that's what I'm\
    \ saying. So focus on the interaction design. Okay? So I just want to mention\
    \ I would appreciate your SIM your engagement with this choice. I just see that\
    \ this there seems to be there seemed to be more knows. Then I see on the on the\
    \ responses. Anyway, I won't harp on it. so we'll keep. Whom have the exam as\
    \ open book. We'll keep it on Tuesday. and I'll just close the the choice now.\
    \ so I will try and find out as quickly as possible. But I can save for an open\
    \ book online. Exam. So there are some things in the news that I was interested\
    \ in to share with you. Is it interested to share with you. Pardon me. this is\
    \ maybe more of a 2 80 kind of item. But oh, I'm sorry. So there is a vending\
    \ machine it had that showed up with this error message on it in vena vending\
    \ facial recognition, app dot E. Xe. Application error. This exception is unknown.\
    \ This exception, unknown software exception. Blah blah blah occurred in the application\
    \ at a location. Blah blah blah. So what can we say about that error message?\
    \ I guess that's one thing from the heuristics that we can. It's not making it\
    \ easy to recover from errors. But the one thing the company says they're they're\
    \ not really using facial recognition. although they've made a poor choice of\
    \ softer name. If they're not so, it's than anyone think twice about buying candy\
    \ from a vending machine."
  persid: S00
- desc: I mean, yes and no depending cause. Most vending machines systems. If something
    screws up they'll give you like tenfold back. Happened to me with like a Coke
    machine. It stole my money, contacted the vendor, and they sent me basically coupons
    for like 12 liters of Coke
  persid: S01
- desc: I haven't been. I haven't hit the jackpot like that on vending machines. But
    I've gotten some coupons. Yes. but it's not about getting the losing money. It's
    about having them record your interaction with the vending machine there. It took
    me a long time to type that in. So I'll just share that with you. So is that that's
    something we should communicate with users. Say you're being recorded, or your
    faces are being recorded. not for recognition purposes, but to analyze your age
    and gender. because I think that's what they said. It was in this story we talked
    about using facial analysis here. I'll so I'll put the link in the chat as well.
  persid: S00
- desc: I think something kind of important to ask here is as like an individual.
    Do you expect to have privacy in a public space like like an open public space
    where there's going to be a bunch of people coming through. And like more. More
    that you can put on is like, Okay, you're crossing the street, and someone's got
    a dash cam on their car, and they're like the first car. And you're on their dash
    Cam, and you're in a public space. You're not giving them permission to record
    you. But it's happening anyways. So if you're if you're gonna like, I don't know,
    I feel like it's like, not the greatest thing the the vending machine is doing
    that. But again, this is definitely not the only thing you can go after for that
    kind of stuff. If you do not give consent to being recorded, and I think you know
    it's kind of common. and I don't think you can build up like a legal case against
    it being recorded in public without your permission, because it is a public space.
  persid: S02
- desc: So
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah, so there's some. There's a difference between. So if you go to a bank
    machine, you're going to be recorded. But there's maybe some expectation of that.
    And so it's not just recording. It's also doing analysis. So it's a question of.
    does it? Did the universe? Oh, sorry. I don't know. I did send it. Okay? So it's
    a question of, does the university know when they bring them on campus. that they
    have this feature recording and doing analysis on the video.
  persid: S00
- desc: I would figure it's somewhere in a legal clause somewhere, but definitely
    kind of buried in in, like the in the paperwork, or maybe in small text. I don't
    think it's telling the users, but it's probably telling the people who are buying
    and selling or distributing to the vending machine somewhere
  persid: S02
- desc: it's like, too, long didn't read and the envy's relations agreement.
  persid: S00
- desc: "Yeah, exactly. I mean you. You can come up with a lot of reasons just looking\
    \ at the chat. Now, 24\_h video surveillance. Just in case, you know, the machine\
    \ gets what is it vandalized? Yeah, that's fair. And there's like a ton of reasons\
    \ that you could give that like a simple vending machine would record you. But,\
    \ realistically speaking, if like, let's say, this vending machine is like analyzing\
    \ you doing this like, what's the difference between, you know, the Vending Machine\
    \ company hiring a guy to sit next to the machine and do all this stuff like you're\
    \ in a public space. I feel like your right to privacy is kind of squandered,\
    \ because literally, anybody who's around you can take notes about you and try\
    \ and analyze these things about you without your consent."
  persid: S02
- desc: I think the difference is that it's it's a vending machine. How many of us
    expect to be recorded when we go to a vending machine? I think that's the difference.
    When you're in public use cameras, you know you record it. That's nothing new.
    But it says if I went to something for a service. I expect that service, and I
    don't expect to be recorded. I think vending machines. It is weird that it is
    recording, and even if it is, it should be labeled, and the user should know.
    That's
  persid: S04
- desc: I think it also has a little bit to do with principle. Right? So obviously,
    if these vending machines are recording you. Maybe they're doing something a little
    bit sketchy with the data that they're gathering. And obviously, there's going
    to be objections on on that grounds what's happening with the data. But I again,
    you'd have to like kind of dive into what exactly is going on, because, is it
    being recorded in a public place that you're not okay with? Or is it what they
    might be doing with the data that you're concerned about? Because I think to have
    an expectation to not get recorded in a public place is kind of I don't know.
    It seems kind of ridiculous to me.
  persid: S02
- desc: I agree with you on that. I mean, anytime you're in public. That's it's exactly
    that. It's public.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: I don't think maybe I kind of Miss explained. But the problem is not being
    recorded in public. It's that it's a vending machine. You are not expected to
    be recorded at a vending machine. I think that's the problem. Like, I know. Everywhere
    we go and people not have the expectation. I don't think anyone just expects not
    to be recorded. And in public, people are making videos. Someone mentioned dash
    cams, all that stuff is expected. It's the vending machine recording you. That's
    not. This is the first we hear of it. So we're surprised. So that's the expectation.
    It's like, Oh, this is not normal. That's the problem. It's not the fact that
    it's in public.
  persid: S04
- desc: No. But then, again, it comes down to, I mean, I see rights on the Wikipedia
    there, but, like what's taking the rights away from the company, I mean, they're
    people as well. So if they want to record their machine to make sure no one's
    punching the screen or shaking it, to try to get free stuff, or whatever else
    they have that right. just like anybody else in public who's taking a picture
    of somebody at the Eiffel Tower, or something like that? They have that right.
    And if you so happen to be in their picture, it is there right  that's the problem
    is you're trying to take away rights from companies as people as well. If it's
    public space, everyone has the right and ability to basically record freely.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah, okay, so again, it's not just recording, it's the analysis, what kind
    of analysis are they doing? And they said, they're not doing facial recognition.
    So the the message was not just about recording. It's about doing facial recognition.
  persid: S00
- desc: Maybe it's just bloat wear. Or maybe it's for like credit, card fraud, or
    something like that. I mean, the Irs is involved. Who knows? I mean, yeah, there's
    all these like, what ifs that you could say?
  persid: S02
- desc: And there was also a in some. I think, pharmacies in America they had those
    digital drink doors instead of like just glass, where you can see through. And
    those doors, too, also had facial analysis and recognition, and all that. And
    the purpose of those was to see what the customer was looking at, what drinks
    appealed to them, and what they were most likely to buy, and I think it's likely
    or like, you can make that connection, that with the vending machine, it's probably
    the same way where it's more focused on what to sell to people than something
    like security for credit card fraud, or just like tampering with the machine.
    I think it's more being used by these companies to like more like, I don't analytical
    data on like what to sell. And I think that's the difference between being recorded
    all the time via CCTV, or like a dashcam is that it's more being used to sell
    you more product. And it could be more convenient for some people that they get
    more things that they like. But it's also kind of a discomforting space to enter
    into now, where it's always advertisers trying to analyze what you like, what
    you want and try to sell them to you.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes, so I don't want to cut the discussion short, but I just wanted to think
    about or making connections with. So the idea that there's a camera in the vending
    machine. That isn't clear. It might be enough to say, if you made the camera look
    obvious. that would be a better alternative that you're not trying to hide what's
    going on. But it's not about. So this is just another instance of analyzing behaviors
    to improve marketing. So you can think of. I'm just thinking about the social
    dilemma that movie that's focusing on what the big tech companies do to know every
    detail about us or know. build very extensive profiles about us. So this is an
    example of of that phenomenon. Perhaps so. it's a question of it's not just a
    question of recording. It's it's a question of do we have the right just to buy
    a bag of M. And M's as not as Daryl, hepting, but as a person at the university.
    So then, the question, we're talking about dark patterns in the interface. and
    we also talked about errors and slips. and whether they're poor design I just
    wanted to think about. I just wanted to pose a question about whether the things
    that we attribute to or design might be examples of malicious intent to get user
    information more easily. Does that make? Does that make sense the question?
  persid: S00
- desc: It's kind of like, if things are designed in such a way to make their intentions
    a little bit more obvious. Is that what you're saying, or kind of like a signifier?
    You are being recorded?
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah, these I wasn't thinking about that so much. But I that's connected with
    what I said about making the camera be a bit more obvious. I was just thinking
    I was also thinking more generally about things that seem like they're poor interference,
    poor design. like the word. the way Facebook hides makes it. So it makes it. Facebook
    makes it easy to share your information. but it makes it more difficult to protect
    your information puts the privacy preserving options behind a collection of  menus
    and the dialog box. Is that increase the resistance for you to do the thing that
    you you would like to do, and makes it easy for you to do the thing that Facebook
    wants you to do. So maybe instead of thinking of about design errors. maybe we.
    I'm just wondering, are they also not designed. They're intentional designs to
    put the user in to positions they don't want to be in to make choices. They don't
    want to make. Does that make sense.
  persid: S00
- desc: almost like a dark pattern. Almost. Yeah. It's like poorly designed to the
    point where the user ends up doing what they probably might not want to do just
    out of sheer convenience.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah. So the dark patterns maybe maybe appear as poor design
  persid: S00
- desc: instead of intentional design. Yeah, yeah, okay. I don't exactly see how we'd
    apply that to this vending machine. Maybe the poor design is like the ugly looking
    camera that everyone notices. But then there's not like, I guess a dark pattern.
    There would be like collecting data about you. But it's also like, kind of informative.
    If you see the camera. And you're like, Oh, wow, that's very upfront and obvious.
    I guess I'm being recorded.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah. So let me look up in then, then
  persid: S00
- desc: not great reviews on Google.
  persid: S02
- desc: So anyway.
  persid: S00
- desc: these machines kind of remind me of the ones that you see in like Japan, and
    stuff like that.
  persid: S01
- desc: Hmm!
  persid: S00
- desc: Maybe that has something to do with it. Manufacturing of where it was first
    developed. I guess.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah. anyway. So I'm just. I just wanted to raise that in the context of interface
    issues. So there's one more Cbc story I learned mention so just thinking about
    this from an interface perspective. So there people who are using E transfers
    to continue an abusive root their abuse of people from whom they've been and disallowed
    from sharing. from contacting and social media, and so forth. So this is an open.
    This is the back door. Perhaps so in Australia. So this story is talking about
    in Australia. How the banks there noticed that there were abusive messages being
    sent using E transfer services. So so they've put in automatic filtering of messages
    or blocking of messages that are abusive. But in Canada it's not the case yet.
    So is is that an interface issue? So another thing the Australian banks make.
    there's an Australian bank who's making their code for monitoring and blocking
    these messages available freely to any other bank around the world to to use.
    So the story has some details that are maybe disturbing. So I think there's a
    a warning just a little bit further down the screen, but I'll paste this into
    the chat as well. So I think this is, maybe the story came up to day, because
    you're talking about how it was missed in the bill that was put forward earlier
    this week about the it's called the Online Harms Bill. I think. and they've identified
    this as a major topic that was not covered by the bill. So there might be some
    stories like this coming up other things that are missed, or maybe the things
    that are  that are not missed but or covered, or so, maybe we'll see some more
    coverage of aspects of the on that new build that was proposed. The Online Arms
    Act or Bill. Pardon me. that's not it. Okay, so let me just go through what I
    have on the meetings pages. So one thing here in the media is this whiteboard.
    And we tried so do you think so? It could ask about analyzing the experience with
    the whiteboard in terms of our discussions in class. So that was the creative
    confidence video like you, what did I give you the first day. So chapter one of
    the textbook of interaction design. So I believe I've got all the meetings up
    to date. Now let me see if I have that. That's true. Yeah. So there's the audio
    transcript. And then the Zoom chat as well. even with emojis. That's right. And
    here's our discussion of controls in automobiles. So this isn't. Aside from my
    experience with this. these buttons wasn't too bad. Once I figured out what was
    required of me. there seemed to be reasonably intuitive, and the design was it?
    Can it made sense so from shifting into drive or reverse, then that requires me
    to pull. but insert my finger into the hole and pull on the button. but if I wanted
    to put into bark or neutral. then it was a push, a button. or move into more of
    the manual setup as well. So we didn't have a meeting on the Tuesday, January
    sixteenth. and I didn't give you anything for that. or did I? Yes, okay, sorry.
    And 10 usability. Here is 6 from Nielsen, Norman group posters with curly cues
    on the side in that hole process of design. entire pressure warnings. So we talked
    a bit about Sarac 25, I should. I should include, update these to include links
    here. Sorry about that. Okay. so there was the ideal video there. and also the
    David Larmann video that I posted because of the Velcro Pants idea from the shopping
    cart session. There's Norman doors. Video. This was looking at the calendar from
    the registrar's office to the academic schedule. So the concepts were discoverability
    and feedback from the Normand doors. Video. And we also talked about the gulfs
    of execution and evaluation. So the video alright, I can go back to the video.
    This video is sort of the the Ted Talk version of the 3 levels of designed a visceral
    behavior behavioral. And what's the other one? Anybody anybody still there?
  persid: S00
- desc: I think it was reflective.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yes. yeah. So that's the highest level. So there are some. These are from
    the text book, cognitive frameworks. mental models, golf of execution and valuation.
    information processing, distributed cognition. external condition, cognition,
    and embodied interaction.
  persid: S00
- desc: Do you put it in here?
  persid: S01
- desc: So I made a comment about little groups reminding me of Apollo 13, because
    I don't know if it came across in the interface. because it's the idea was it's
    I want to look up participants by their full names. But so one place gives me
    full names. The other place gives me only E email addresses. And so there's a
    mismatch between in doing the whole process of creating groups.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: "if I'm putting together different groups. So like the process of going from\
    \ putting everyone in in their own group and then making some groups of different\
    \ sizes was difficult, because it it required me to look up a couple different\
    \ things. I haven't made that more clear here, but I'll I'll try and illustrate\
    \ that with an example. we'll add an example here and then there. Discussion about\
    \ this interface. The Tesla recall design, thinking 101 in the design. Console\
    \ Double Diamond? No. and have it set to be 2 sensitive, somehow more pictures\
    \ from my car. or look at the ordering flowers for delivering Canada website and\
    \ dark patterns. There's the Zoom interface. not allowing me to enter a valid\
    \ phone number. but not telling me why it's not correct lips and mistakes. And\
    \ last day at so does the keystroke level model make sense as I just as I discussed\
    \ it. So maybe just let me revisit the example here. So the calculator that's\
    \ not involved in the process here. So the activity activity is to delete tell\
    \ here from the text and keep the spaces. Keep a single space between them, so\
    \ it'll close when I stop when I complete the task. So if I start activity. I\
    \ can use the arrow keys to manipulate cursor position. and it's not done yet.\
    \ So I have to move the extra space, and that's now it's done so. If we do this\
    \ in the calculator. I can do it all with the key presses. So do an M. First,\
    \ and then KKK, okay. and then and then I explained about things. and then I did\
    \ it. Another couple presses so so I didn't count the number of key presses here.\
    \ because you can see how the the number of the seconds comes up. so we can make\
    \ this more precise by counting the number of key presses. But so my elapsed.\
    \ Time was 12\_s. So possibly quite possibly I'm taking point 5\_s to do a key\
    \ press. But the point is, it's not It's it's not important to get the exact timings\
    \ here we can use the these is a reference. Just finding the values for me isn't\
    \ important. and we can see the different ways we approach this task and what's\
    \ available in the interface that took me 3\_s. So it's an M. And P. And 2 button\
    \ presses and a key press, I think so that gets me to. That's a fairly accurate\
    \ estimate. and I realize now I'm over time. I apologize so I'll ask you to give\
    \ me your suggestions for exam questions, and I will be communicating with you\
    \ about the details of how we'll make this happen for Tuesday O'kane. So today\
    \ and tomorrow I will send some emails. Okay, thank you very much. For to day."

    so hope that our latest boat of winter is over anyway.
  persid: S00
- desc: Hey, sir? I had a question for you.
  persid: S06
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S00
- desc: I emailed you for the assignment one about my group.
  persid: ???
- desc: There was no.
  persid: S06
- desc: So I know that.
  persid: S00
- desc: Okay, so do we have to submit it again? Or is the email just fine.
  persid: S06
- desc: I think I can handle it.
  persid: S00

  persid: DHH
- desc: Hello and good morning!
  persid: DHH
- desc: "It\u2019s ok."
  persid: DHH
- desc: No worries!
  persid: DHH
- desc: No problem!
  persid: DHH
- desc: I'd say yes
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes it should
  persid: DHH
- desc: I vote yes
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes please
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes yes
  persid: DHH
- desc: let's do a poll
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Haha yes
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yep
  persid: DHH
- desc: Don't worry about it
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah it does
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes!
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes it does
  persid: DHH
- desc: yes!!
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes!
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Would that be an in-person screening or something virtual?
  persid: DHH
- desc: So is the test not open book?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think part of why students might want to move it is because there is so
    much uncertainty regarding the midterm right now. None of us know what is on it
    or what to study for, or how we should approach studying.

  persid: DHH
- desc: I'm looking at the chart, and so far people are voting "Yes" to move it
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can we use the online or digital versions of the textbooks for the exam? That's
    all I have.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I only have digital versions
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

    \ midterm?"

  persid: DHH
- desc: "Replying to \"I don\u2019t have a camer...\""
  persid: DHH
- desc: Another question, will you be posting a list of relevant materials like you
    have for your other class?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have no objection.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can you say that again?
  persid: DHH
- desc: About the textbook, sorry
  persid: DHH
- desc: ok
  persid: DHH
- desc: So the textbook would be all we have access to during the exam? Then all questions
    not referring tot the textbook will be technically closed book?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I feel the midterm can have the majority of questions be multiple choice,
    similar to the quizzes we have been doing
  persid: DHH
- desc: this will also help you during grading since multiple choice questions can
    be marked automatically by the sytstem
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: I'm just asking because we refer to several textbooks in this class. That
    makes sense for now! I'm sure more clarification will come once you look into
    the options. Thanks!
  persid: DHH
- desc: sounds good
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK! So don't worry about the psychology, encyclopedia, or design of everyday
    things textbooks?
  persid: DHH
- desc: That helps alot
  persid: DHH
- desc: Perfect, thanks for clarifying and sorry for asking so many questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks for minimising the scope.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Honestly I really doubt there is anywhere we can go in public spaces anymore
    that aren't recording our faces with biometrics.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is there really an expectation to privacy in a public space?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Anyone disinclined to buy candy from a vending machine?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Replying to "Is there really an e..."
  persid: DHH
- desc: Supposedly they should at least disclose that they are in fact recording your
    face but I'm not sure that actually occurs. I think in many cases entering a space
    is considered consent to be recorded.
  persid: DHH
- desc: https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/vending-machine-facial-analysis-invenda-waterloo-1.7126196
  persid: DHH
- desc: They can put a sticker on a vending machine saying, 24hr video surveillance
    or something. It's probably done so that if vandalism happens they can see who
    did that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think another important thing is intention. What is the purpose of the recording?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I looked into the article and the vendors said it was to know when a person
    is infront of the machine to leave standby mode
  persid: DHH
- desc: I'm curious whether Zoom will be collecting user data during meetings
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"I'm curious whether ...\" with \U0001F602"
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think even mobile application needs user consent to take a photo. So it
    should applies to vending machine as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Replying to "I think even mobile ..."
  persid: DHH
- desc: It's similar to the privacy concern we probably all have had and discussed
    regarding proctortrack collecting our facial information and sometimes even our
    spatial information
