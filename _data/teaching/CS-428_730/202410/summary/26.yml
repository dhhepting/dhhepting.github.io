Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. Good morning. Everyone. So last meeting today. So I'll just
    share my screen. Okay, so basically, we'll do a review today and talk about the
    final exam. So we have some questions that came up in the in the responses. I
    wish you could have had a better or more substantial conversation about the airline
    design flaw with the landing gear. So I have a couple links for that. marks being
    posted. the last assignment it and in the Simon groups and the final exam. So
    there's another item for CS. 4, 28, who are interested in those spring and summer
    classes who've been maybe taking the evaluation class in July and August is to
    encourage you to consider the design and implementation course in spring, May
    and June. So we also have a guest today. Reignard. is that right?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah. Renewal.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. seeing who's doing the he's with. IT support handling exams and proctor
    track. So I thought it would be nice for him to come today to talk to us about
    using proctor track in the exam. So not everyone has completed the onboarding
    process. as I understand. But it's very important to do that. So we have some
    time, I guess, to complete it. It's exams on the 20 third. But I've also made
    it part of the last assignment. So and that's due today. Does anyone have questions
    to start with? Oh, yes, sorry. It's due tomorrow. I keep thinking it's Friday.
    That's right. The Simon's due tomorrow.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I do have a question about the proof. Do you want us to take a screenshot
    with our name present, or the notification? What.
  persid: S02
- desc: I guess I was.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Screenshot.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah, if you the notification, or if you get the email.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Perfect, that works.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, other questions. So, as I understand it, if you did the onboarding yesterday,
    it might take a few hours to get the email confirmation.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I can see that their onboarding is complete.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. so how many students in class have yet to do the onboarding.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Let me check about that. So yesterday it was 15, and I think today it should
    be lesser than that.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, so 15 people still to do it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yep.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. so what about proof? So some people are saying they didn't get an email
    from.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So in case if any student didn't get any email they can go to onboarding quiz,
    and when they try to reattempt it. They can see their status there if it's failed
    past or pending.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, yeah. So if you don't have an email. you can submit a screenshot of
    that, I think.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For onboarding.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah, it's proof that they've done it for the assignment.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: I suppose I can. I see the whole. I can see the names on the dashboard as
    well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah. So like, students needs to submit screenshot of like email for their
    assignment. Right?
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, so token. So you will see when you attempt the onboarding. Quiz your
    onboarding status screenshot. that as proof is that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So with that Dr. Hept, will we need to have 3 cause in the assignment. You
    have us do your onboarding quiz. and then we have 2 more to go through with the
    other link. So do you want 3 individual screenshots, or do you just want one saying
    that our profile has been on boarded.
  persid: S02
- desc: I think 1 one from the the class onboarding quiz. Yes. Okay. gonna take a
    minute here. This is the one. Oh. I have to edit this. So I included a link. I
    included links for extra documentation. I'm just waiting for the menu to fill
    in here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Do you want me to change the date for you?
  persid: S01
- desc: Yes. to make it tomorrow at midnight. please. Kent.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, it's yeah. It's updated a.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay? So it's not enough to have a profile on the system, but it has to be
    associated with this class. Correct.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah. So like, if any student have completed like onboarding quiz in any other
    course. and it's still valid, it will be good for this class, as well.
  persid: S01
- desc: I'm sorry I can. You repeat that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So like students needs to complete on boarding quiz in like any course. So
    if they are taking any other course, and they have done on boarding. In that course
    it will be good for this course as well. But for practice they can attempt on
    boarding quiz in this course as well.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So like a few students.
  persid: S01
- desc: If they've been on boarded in another class, they'll still be showing, as
    their status will show actually here when they try to attempt this quiz.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah. So like, when they try to attempt to quiz, it will be shown as approved
    in different course.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, but they but they can still attempt the quiz for practice.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay? So there's a a comment about somebody's onboarding whose whose onboarding
    has failed. So if anyone's had problems getting on with their onboarding. can
    you please add a note.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, so I can drop a link for that. and they can join our it sport Zoom Meeting,
    and we can help there.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, that's right. So and what are the hours for that? Okay, thank you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And I said, Yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: Or okay. So if you on on your zoom, you just join the meeting. You are dot
    remote.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, that's the id for Zoom Meeting.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah, does that make sense students? Okay? And about access to an online version
    of a text. If.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like online version of their onboarding set status.
  persid: S01
- desc: No. So now I'm talking about the exam. We talked about having it access to
    some. some materials like an electronic. an E textbook.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For that. We can change the settings. And like, you can also join your remote,
    and we can discuss the settings there.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. But do I need a yeah. URL, do I for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I can share the URL in course email. And I will send email to you, or you
    can use your dot remote id for that meeting.
  persid: S01
- desc: Sure. No, I understand with the meetings. I'm just.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For, like online.
  persid: S01
- desc: Authorize access to the the textbook. I need to have a a link for the E textbook.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah. So you require a link to add it to the proper track settings.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: So if if you have an E textbook students, can you send me the link that you
    use so I can make sure that's added to the the proctor track settings. Please.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Question about that. What about if it's a Pfd or Pdf, sorry.
  persid: S02
- desc: Let me check about. Vdf. yeah, we can change the settings for pdf, as well.
    and it will be allowed on Proctor track exam. But I need to discuss this this
    with for your professor before that.
  persid: S01
- desc: Hey? So our exams on the twenty-third. So we have a bit of time to get that
    sorted out. So I will be in communication with you about the details for that.
    Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sure.
  persid: S01
- desc: Students. Okay. alright, so are there any other questions about Proctor Track?
    Well, Ranjan is here. and we use zoom instead. I don't think that's a good option
    for the final. But we'll make sure that everything is set up properly, too. to
    make it stress free. Not like the midterm exam issues. Yes. So I will collect
    the information about. I will collect the information about your electronic text.
    If it's a yeah URL, or if it's a Pdf. and we will make sure that's set up properly.
    I will communicate about that. I will be available. I will be available during
    the exam. okay, so to make sure I get all, does it? The information that's needed
    for the the textbook and your questions? Let me make a post here to the class
    discussion. It's not cooperating with me. Okay? So I will ask that question. And
    please provide the details of your text book that you're going to have access
    to. Okay, I will put that up soon. Let me try again here any questions for Rana
    before he goes. Feel free to unmute if you like. Okay. so no one's responded with
    a question. So thank let's thank our guest coming by to reassurance about the
    technology and answer questions. And as he posted there. if you have individual
    questions about getting on board. go to the UR. Remote. You are remote Zoom Meeting
    between 9 and 4 to answer any other questions that come up in the meantime. Okay,
    thanks again, Raniad.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, thank, you.
  persid: S01
- desc: Looks like your courses is a popular website today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I've noticed since the outlook integration. It's been slower.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah. yeah, I would. so what do you think? What was your user experience of
    your course's email?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I mean, the webmail was okay. It was a little bit rough to learn in the beginning,
    because I'm used to a different system. But I mean, outlook is so much nicer.
  persid: S02
- desc: Oh, well, that's good. I'm not using an outlook client, so maybe I should.
    I'm wondering whether I have to bite the bullet, so to speak, and because I have
    it in my office package. So we'll see. Yeah. So was it easy to forward.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It works like any other email system where you just go into your forwarding,
    put in the email you want to forward to. Hmm, there you go.
  persid: S02
- desc: "Oh, okay. alright. Well. I'm not going to spend last 45\_min waiting for\
    \ the screen to refresh as entertaining as that might be okay. So I put quotes,\
    \ I've I've edited this comment a little bit. so it's not direct quotation, but\
    \ wish it could. We could have a better or more substantial conversation about\
    \ the airline design flow with the landing gear that resulted in a crash. So there's\
    \ a Youtube video. I'm it looked promising. I didn't preview it. and I'm not going\
    \ to watch it. Now. Take up time our time with that. But there's a Wikipedia page\
    \ about the crash eastern flights. 401, 1972, a Lockheed. L. 1011. Try Star. So\
    \ this is what that plane looks like. Looked like. I'm not sure how many of them\
    \ if there are still some flying. So the crash occurred while the entire flight\
    \ crew were preoccupied with a burnt out landing gear indicator light. The captain\
    \ bumped the control yoke on the aircraft, turning up. causing to turn off the\
    \ autopilot due to the focus on the landing gear and the minimal changes in the\
    \ cockpit pilots didn't notice the the light. The autopilot was off until they\
    \ heard some warnings. and that time it took them a is it a few seconds to realized\
    \ that the autopilot was off, and they were at a dangerously low altitude. and\
    \ and they crashed. And so there isn't. I'm not using the summary see controlled\
    \ flight into terrain. due to pilot error and loss of situational awareness due\
    \ to the burnt out lightbulb. So so is So I don't know about it being pilot error\
    \ so much as a poor interface. but I think investigations have changed the way\
    \ that the cockpit crew handle situations like that, so they don't. All all 3\
    \ of them are not occupied with trying to track down a burnt out bulb. So there!\
    \ There's more more structure in the cockpit and the way there their procedures\
    \ since that accident. So that's one thing. So the landing gear was down, but\
    \ they couldn't see it. because it's such a dark night, and the bulb. the lighting\
    \ in that bay where they could see the landing gear was burnt out, so there is\
    \ no way to tell for sure. So I think Pilot error is a little bit. There's a little\
    \ bit of an easy explanation for it. So would you like to take a few minutes.\
    \ Let's see. we can. How about we use 9 breakout rooms, and we'll take 5\_min\
    \ to. We'll use the same numbers as for the paired for the testing groups. So\
    \ we'll take 5\_min to have a conversation about some issues and see what questions\
    \ come up. and I can provide some more answers, perhaps based on those questions.\
    \ Okay. so please go ahead and join a breakout room. and I'll call us back together\
    \ in 5\_min. So the question. The question for discussion is. or the conversation\
    \ is about the the. the crash and the Everglades, and what what interface issues\
    \ impacted it. Okay, is everyone back? Looks like it. Okay? So any any questions\
    \ or comments that came up in your discussion about the flight and the burnt out\
    \ lightbulb. So thinking about that flight from 72 reminds me of more recent news\
    \ about Boeing and Boeing and Lockheed merged some years ago, and the culture\
    \ and Boeing has changed to be more business oriented and less safety oriented.\
    \ Yeah, I'm not sure what's yes indicators for indicators. But maybe there's would\
    \ be a button to test."
  persid: DHH
- desc: From what I know in most modern aircraft, there's like an extensive list that
    pilots and co-pilots will run through during their sort of run up, which is like
    before takeoff with the engine started where they basically have a checklist that
    runs them through every single possible scenario. And I think a part of that run
    up with most commercial aircraft is, there's there's things you or there's flip
    or switches. You can flip and whatnot to like basically turn on every single error
    light. And then what you're supposed to do is make sure that they all turn on
    as like, just to make sure. Oh, well, this light didn't come on. That might be
    burnt out during the run up, so they would like know that before they take off,
    or if it's a big enough problem, then they'd have to postpone the flight and like
    make repairs to the aircraft and whatnot.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: From what I know. That's kind of a part of regular operations now. but I'm
    not sure how big of a thing that would be on like more private aircrafts that
    are like owned by people than commercial.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It was also in the seventies or eighties, if not mistaken. So I mean, things
    have changed since then.
  persid: S02
- desc: They usually say, like Nate Ops is written in blood, and that's because well,
    everything that ever went wrong. Well, they obviously want to plan for that kind
    of stuff to never happen again. So I mean some of the stuff you can't plan for
    until it's happened. Right? So.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Was probably one of the triaging events to that sort of test being included.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yes, I think lots of came out of this crash. But it's interesting like with
    the Boeing 7, 37, Max. There was. There were a lot of corners cut. They were relying.
    if you remember, they had 2 fatal crashes with that plane because the software
    the M cast software took over the flight. and it was based on data from a single
    faulty sensor. So there were some, certainly some issues about maybe maybe masquerading.
    So they were. There are pitfalls that we're known that we're fallen into. even
    though they might have seemed like a new thing. not saying that so well, perhaps,
    but so, anyway, the most most recent thing with Boeing and the the door hat over
    the wing hatch blowing out to inflate who's maybe well, some example of poor quality
    control. Anyway, if you're interested, John Oliver did a a story about Boeing
    and Lockheed with a change in changing culture at Boeing over the years. So if
    you want to look that up, you can. Maybe I can find it as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I remember seeing something recently where it was like secret cameras in the
    Boeing factories, and a lot of the people in the factories were like, Yeah, I
    wouldn't ride on this plane or like stuff like that.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah. I didn't know you could do that as a reaction, Dane. I wonder. Anyway.
    I was asking about emojis the other day, but I kinda I got a sense of what that
    one was. anyway. So shall we any other comments about this. hey? I think I'm still.
    Oh, maybe I'm not. Maybe I lost sharing when I did the breakout rooms. There we
    go. So another comment about marks. So I realize there's some issues here. There's
    some issues because I didn't discover an incorrect setting that I had, that that
    this allowed feedback comments to be posted for the understand part of the project.
    So I'm I'm working with the markers to get that information posted. What else
    can I say about that? I guess that's that's the situation we're in that. and we'll
    get. So if you need to resubmit things as part of the assignment, the materialize.
    Assignment, submission! You won't be penalized for for them being late. Does that
    make sense any questions about that. or concerns? So with the materialized assignment
    I'm allowing, I'm allowing you to resubmit the understand and explore parts of
    the project if the if there was a misunderstanding about requirements with your
    submission. So I don't want to penalize anyone for that. Any questions, comments,
    reactions. are we still connected? Okay. so is that clear enough? I apologize
    for my unfortunate use of well, my my errors and settings for you our courses.
    That caused a lot of issues. first, the copying the wrong for not duplicating.
    for not creating the fifth assignment. This last Zoom versus proctor track assignment
    correctly. and then for also not have being the the settings set properly for
    the understand portion. and I will see about getting the rest of the feedback
    to you as quickly as possible. So no, no comments about set. Does that seem well?
    Do you have any questions? K. So the last assignment is set up to be done in the
    assignment group that you had for the first assignment the empathize assignment.
    So the way it can be done in groups is that each group member submits. They're
    separate proof of onboarding for proctor track. And then the written parts of
    the discussions can can be done in a group. So everyone does the onboarding. and
    then the group discusses and formulates. the group, responds to the other parts
    of the assignment. Does that make sense a. So the final exam will be online and
    you are courses. Let me see if I can go back to your courses. Now see if it's
    could be more responsive. So here are the final exams set up so that the Exam.
    Is from 2 to 5 PM. On Tuesday, April 20. Third. Now, what will be on the exam.
    So I wanted to look at the syllabus. or I direct you to the syllabus. and I want
    to focus on the parts or the references where the interaction design book is mentioned.
    So, chapter one. chapter 4, chapter 3, chapter 6, chapter one, again. chapter
    2, chapter 7, chapter 5. So let me write this into the chat. The exam will. So,
    as we based on our class discussions and I will create questions. choose from
    our meetings. So they have support in the interaction design book as outlined.
    There may be so ideas that come up in videos and how the resources may also be.
    I wanted to say that I still welcome suggestions for final exam questions. So
    for the essay questions. so the exam will put more focus. So I will give a a review
    of what you should focus on from the class meetings. So are the transcripts useful.
    I think I've caught up and put available. Now. I think Zoom does a not bad job
    of creating the transcripts. Maybe the Chat transcripts are also good to look
    at. Okay, we're a couple minutes over time. so we'll say goodbye for today I'll
    be in touch. I will create something, for was that I'd like you to reply to indicating
    which version of the interaction design book you'd like to that you'll be having
    with you the Pdf. etc, or if it's a yeah URL, and I'll be around for office hours
    next week. anyway. Thank you for today. Take care everyone have a good. have a
    good day, have a great day. and you'll be hearing from me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you. I hope you have an excellent day.
  persid: S04
- desc: Thanks you too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks, Daryl, have a good one.
  persid: S02
- desc: Welcome!
  persid: DHH

  persid: S05
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: How about you?
  persid: S05
- desc: I'm doing, okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Hey? Yeah. So I was checking the responses yesterday for 2 weeks. Yeah.
  persid: S05
- desc: Minute.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes. Okay.
  persid: S05
- desc: I, okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah. So the script the script throws an arrow when I try to run it for the
    last few responses like you said that it's important for the other subject as
    well.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't know but but I did duplicate responses. I didn't create like new.
  persid: S05
- desc: Do you see my email?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Did you send me today.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yesterday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yesterday. But let me see.
  persid: S05
- desc: I sent you a fix.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh. but I didn't see it. Let me check it.
  persid: S05
- desc: I was sure that I sent it. Let me check.
  persid: DHH
- desc: With it. Let me check it. Yeah, I got it. But It shows like crossover the
    file. I'm no wine and got.
  persid: S05
- desc: I'm having trouble with your audio now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is it? Is it good now.
  persid: S05

  persid: DHH
- desc: so will be able to use etext right?
  persid: DHH
- desc: With Zoom we would be able to hear your announcements.
  persid: DHH
- desc: will the pdf have to be opened in another tab? or could it be opened in another
    program (ie acrobat)
  persid: DHH
- desc: Will you allow us to test it beforehand (maybe sample test)
  persid: DHH
