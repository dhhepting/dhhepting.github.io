- desc: "Good morning, everyone. So I realized I didn't update. I didn't publish my\
    \ web page. So I'm just doing that now. So if you refresh today's meeting. it\
    \ should be available for you. Sorry about that alright, so happy. Tuesday. So\
    \ last Tuesday of March. It'll be the second of April when they meet again on\
    \ a Tuesday. so it'd be nice if spring would come along soon so. and get into\
    \ April showers to bring on May flowers. These are also outdated sayings, I think.\
    \ anyway. So I looked at the responses. So the videos seem to be very popular.\
    \ So I wanted to share one. That's I really enjoy, and it's very relevant, I think.\
    \ So. I ask you think about how it is relevant. and it's called choice happiness\
    \ and spaghetti sauce. So I won't show that in class, but you can look at it.\
    \ So I want to take some time today. and our breakout rooms do 15\_min and then\
    \ regroup after session. So so don't go away When, when when you're in your breakout\
    \ rooms, I'll return us with 5 or 10\_min left, so we can regroup and discuss\
    \ what was happening in in the breakout rooms. Okay? So a student came to my office\
    \ hours yesterday asking about they explore Project peace it's due to in a day\
    \ at the end of the day. So, and I was thinking about metaphors for creating groups\
    \ in a grouping. and I thought we would explore that a bit. Today I'll try and\
    \ do some sketching on the whiteboard. And so I was taught thinking about the\
    \ metaphors, and it occurred to me that maybe it's a metaphor is like card sorting.\
    \ So I have a stack of names of students. and I want to sort them into piles.\
    \ so I could do that by taking them. If I want to make groups of 4, I can take\
    \ them for 4 at a time. or I can put. put one in each group. and then the the\
    \ second card in each group, the third card in each group. the fourth card in\
    \ each group. and then and then occurred to me that that's maybe like dealing\
    \ cards in the card game. Maybe that's a more accessible metaphor who plays cards.\
    \ Okay, 2 2 card players. I'm also a card player. although not so much lately,\
    \ because frequent in the past. I've been a card player. I don't do it as much\
    \ lately. I guess we'll say that. But so if you're dealing cards to. there are\
    \ different rules for dealing cards. But maybe you shuffle the cards. You cut\
    \ the deck. You do some rearranging of the of the cards. but I want to mention\
    \ a little bit card sorting as a tool for interaction design first. and then I\
    \ have a link here to Nielsen Norman group. So uncover users' mental models for\
    \ better information architecture. So the idea is. you put information on cards.\
    \ So here's an example. With an athletic clothing. Ecommerce site might give a\
    \ participant a set of cards, labeled sweatshirts, gloves, hats, tank tops. So\
    \ the idea is that you're put them, put them into groups. into piles. and then\
    \ you label the piles. So that's called an open card sort. So there aren't any\
    \ rules about how many things to put into piles. or what to call them. So if we\
    \ do a closed card sort. then we have the the categories listed here. and then\
    \ you're asked to put them into as you encounter each card, then you put them\
    \ into the pile which best matches label. So if we started with tops and accessories,\
    \ then I don't know what you would call PC tops is one. You have bottoms as another\
    \ category, and then accessories. So maybe put leggings and shorts into a category\
    \ called bottoms Redding shoes. And now I'm not sure what joggers are. Anyone\
    \ help you with a definition for that my feeling is that those are shoes as well.\
    \ anyway. So if we have the, if we have the labels for the piles established,\
    \ that's a closed card sort. and if we're asking users to name them, that's an\
    \ open card sort. So if we've got the names there, we have also the term number\
    \ of piles to me. So an open card sort. you could have varying numbers of piles\
    \ based on the user. Does that make sense? Oh, okay. okay, thanks for all the\
    \ the help with the definition of joggers. So okay, does that make sense. Kate?\
    \ So we can use this to test our our menu structure if we have the commands that\
    \ are in the in the menus as items on cards. then asking users to put them into\
    \ groups and labeled the groups the most can be the names of the menus that we\
    \ see in the toolbar. We're at the top of the screen top of the window. so we\
    \ can test that. We're we're putting things where people expect to find them.\
    \ and the ones that move around a lot are aren't consistently placed in the same\
    \ pile. then we'd see an opportunity to redesign redesign either the menus or\
    \ the the names for the functionality that appear there. Okay, so so you can't\
    \ see this. Maybe if I share my whole screen. let me try that. Can you see my\
    \ sole screen now? Even the picture of me and the even the video of Mia, the participant\
    \ list. So when I look at the zoom interface here. it looks like I'm still sharing\
    \ the screen. I mean just the browser window. Some people may be only so are only\
    \ seeing the browser window. So is this, maybe a difference in? Okay. let me go\
    \ back to what I was sharing before. So I want to make a whiteboard. So when I\
    \ have, I have the floating interface now, and I'm going to do a screen capture,\
    \ and I'll share this with you. So I don't see the whiteboard interface or option\
    \ in the menu. We're in the control panel. and I don't see it in the more section,\
    \ either. So I'm going to take another. So when I have the floating interface\
    \ that you'll see when I post these. I don't have to do them separately. That's\
    \ the second one. This is the first one. Can you access those. Kate? So so I wanted\
    \ to do a whiteboard. and it's not there, and that drove me crazy a little bit,\
    \ but that I've discovered a founder. I discovered that under new share I can\
    \ do a whiteboard. so let me take a screenshot of that, and I'll post that later.\
    \ Okay, so now we're collaborating on this. But let me try and drive. I can see\
    \ her name's going across. So if you want to make the screen. this is the idea\
    \ of of doing low fidelity prototype with the idea of Okay. who's moving my square.\
    \ Was that me? I don't think so. Okay, maybe that's not a great idea to alright,\
    \ so we have. No, I didn't. I thought I turned it off the collaboration part.\
    \ Okay, I'm I'm just going to ask you to know that move the I'm just taking the\
    \ names. I can see. I'm not trying to single anyone out. Okay? So maybe we have.\
    \ So let's won't go into details of how he might. So maybe we have a counter here\
    \ of how many people are in the group. Let's just do 9. How does it look so far?\
    \ Thanks. I got some clapping hands there much appreciated. So the idea here is.\
    \ I'm going to just put students into groups. And if I if I use a direct manipulation\
    \ style. I can drag the names over and put them into groups. That's one way that\
    \ I can make changes. Perhaps. So if I'm taking students from the students list\
    \ and put them into groups. then they should. because I'm I only have this. Each\
    \ student appears once here. so if I take them here and put them into the grouping.\
    \ then they'll then their name will be removed from this list that's consistent\
    \ with dealing some cards. Okay? So if we. how many do I have 8? So we can imagine\
    \ selecting a student here. and I'm not gonna show. Show the intermediate steps\
    \ here. But we could imagine doing a selection. or you can select more than one.\
    \ If this is a really. really a box that allowed selections that control that\
    \ goes select on an h hedged on a web page. Let's imagine that I can. so I can't\
    \ pick names at random. But let's put Scott and Kevin into one group. So if I'm\
    \ take the names and drag them and drop them here can imagine that happening there,\
    \ let's save this and and so on. Let's do one more. No, why can't I edit that?\
    \ Okay? So then let's imagine another step would be well. I did something to it.\
    \ so we could say, drag Daryl into a group with James. So each of these 3 groups\
    \ would have 2 in them. So what I went to illustrate was. this is a low fidelity\
    \ prototype. So we're showing the steps. We're showing a sketch of the steps to\
    \ operate the interface. So. and I've I've left out a couple of details here so\
    \ we could do a bit better sketch and and allowing multiple selections from a\
    \ a select control. for example. So we can use a direct manipulation style interface\
    \ in this case. So does this make sense. I will try and figure out how to edit\
    \ this. So we get. I can demonstrate a few more things here any questions about\
    \ this. So if I so if I'm doing a direct manipulation style interface here. then\
    \ that maybe that supports the idea of dealing cards or sorting cards into groups.\
    \ is this helpful? Okay? So in order to stick with my timeline, let's do the breakout\
    \ groups. If if there questions now about this and how it relates to our explore\
    \ segment that's due today at the end of the day. If there aren't any questions\
    \ I'll I'll do the breakout groups now. Breakout rooms. Pardon me. so I'm going\
    \ to let you choose your your rooms same same rooms as before for your groups.\
    \ So if you're not sure which room you're to go into. look at your Project group\
    \ communication form for the breakout room that I sent you last week. Okay. so\
    \ they're open now. So please join your breakout room that you've been assign\
    \ for your group. Okay?"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Most of your mic is on mute.
  persid: S01
- desc: So I had a few more questions in groups. So anyway, just to wrap up in our
    last minute or 2, here was that helpful any questions. So the idea of the low
    Fidelity prototypes is to represent an interface, an interface design based on
    the metaphor you've chosen are the 2 metaphors you've chosen. And so that's what
    I try to do in the whiteboard, and I'll clean those up and share them as pictures
    that if I can. So if you have questions, stick around. I'll stay till one. if
    that's possible. Otherwise. yeah. send me a note, and I'll work on getting a reply.
    We got another class coming up, so we'll get. That's if you can stick around.
    If you have questions. then we'll do that. If you don't have questions or you
    have to go. Have a good day and see you on Thursday. Okay. thanks. Everyone. Take
    care. Okay, so what questions? So can you unmute yourselves if you have a raise
    your hand, if you have a question. Okay? So, NASA, can you unmute yourself and
    ask your question?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sure, Professor, so as stated in the assignment, it says that have to choose
    interface metaphors, and what would be suitable to help users understand the activities.
    So in in the metaphors section in the textbook. they don't have like an actual
    metaphor that can correspond with the activity. So do you have, like an example
    of a metaphor that can be used.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, so did you understand my metaphor of card sorting or dealing cards?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Not not exactly. I was able to catch up with you till the mid mid part, but
    then I lost you somewhere.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. So the idea was. we have this. The students let me see if I can bring
    that up. This is what we started with. Right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, yes.
  persid: S02
- desc: So the students' the deck of cards. And you can imagine a direct manipulation
    kind of interface where I, Greg names from the students list into the group, into
    the the groups. So these represent 9 groups that I have in the yeah project. So
    as I drag think this worked. So if I dragged first 2 names to the first group,
    then I have to to 2 cards in this pile.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Hmm.
  persid: S02
- desc: And then they disappear from the list of students. Okay, yeah. So once the
    students list is done. I don't have any more cards to deal with. So I just but
    I can manipulate. I can switch. I wanted to show the idea that I could say. Take
    Kevin from group this first group and put them in a different file. So there's
    Scott would be in one, and Kevin would be in another.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yes, this is okay. But what would you say in the metaphor for this prototype.
  persid: S02
- desc: So it's like sorting cards or dealing cards, dealing, dealing, playing cards.
    So the number of groups is the number of players.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: And then the number of cards each file or each the members in each group is
    the number of cards each player gets.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. okay. And
  persid: S02
- desc: If we're dragging and dropping. So the direct manipulation style of interaction
    is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is the metaphor for this.
  persid: S02
- desc: No, but it, it encourages it. Okay, it influences the metaphor. If if we can
    do drag and drop.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, okay. So still my question. oh. was I was asking like, what example
    would you show as an example for a metaphor. or should we just treat it as a figure
    of speech? And we can influence and metaphor by ourselves, and then associated
    with it.
  persid: S02
- desc: So whatever you activity, you're relate to groups that you've selected say,
    this activity is like something so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: I said, making groups is like dealing cards.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Dealing cards. Okay? Okay? I understood. Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay? And then there are 2 metaphors for
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah, so think of 2 ways to think. Think of 2 different ways. to conceptualize
    the problem, to say, well, it's like dealing cards, but it can also be like something
    else.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, okay. so what our main problems that we discovered in our understand
    part was group dynamics and following groups performance. So that I'm I'm probably
    not able to think about it right now. But the prototype for that, I'm thinking,
    is like making an actual interface of the Urses, which is like an edited version,
    you know, like we can, I will schedule.
  persid: S02
- desc: And you. yeah, you just doing sketches.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, and then there will be 2 sketches, and then 2 for 2 interfaces.
  persid: S02
- desc: 2 sets of sketches. Yeah, you might have more than one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: I mean, you might sketch more than one screen as you show the the progress
    through the steps.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, okay. So here for 2 metaphors, there can be 2 sets of sketches. And
    then do we have to? Have any theory, part included in the Pdf. Or No.
  persid: S02
- desc: Any what.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like theoretical part like, do you want us to define those modifications.
  persid: S02
- desc: No, just what I've asked for. Just say. describe, describe just to describe
    what's going on.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. So I, I have another question here. And we're okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, okay. okay, so can I ask one last question before I let you go here.
  persid: S02
- desc: If it's I'll decide if it's I'm gonna answer it. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, okay, okay, so your last point on then explore project is, do different
    interface type suggest alternative design insights or options.
  persid: S02
- desc: Is dash. So here I'm doing interaction with direct manipulation. Most example.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: So does that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, okay, so there should be different types of interactions.
  persid: S02
- desc: No, it's just a question to help you think about it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, it's just question how? Okay? It's not a point which we have to fulfill
    in the assignment.
  persid: S02
- desc: Right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, it's just ha helps us to think about the assignment.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. Thank you.
  persid: S02
- desc: I'm gonna cut you off.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you. Thank you.
  persid: S02
- desc: You're welcome. Scott.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is it possible to share screen? I don't want to do it. If there's a bunch
    of students in here because it is our assignment just to kind of give you an idea
    of what we're what we're dealing with.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah, okay. So. Michaela, you're in Scotts group, are you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, it's and Julia as well.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah. So ashraful. Do you have a question? Okay, I'm gonna remove you from
    the meeting. K. Harris. This is a TA, so you can go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Chance I can get permissions to share.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yes, I keep forgetting about that. Yeah, there you go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Says I can't share, because we're on a whiteboard collaboration.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah. Okay. there. try that. Now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Alright. Do you see everything that's here? So basically, we made our first
    metaphor. Our first metaphor is a low fidelity prototype of a Rolodex. You know
    you're creating individual cards. Then you organize them. Then they get placed
    into a roller decks, which is kind of similar to how your courses is running things.
    That's what we thought you wanted for our prototypes. We ran our scenarios, which
    are fine, we analyze them. We gave negatives and a conclusion. Our second prototype
    is the fridge, you know, individual groceries Aka students. Then they get grouped
    up, and then they get categorized in the fridge. So you have, like your groupings.
    Sorry your groups with your groupings. So now you're basically saying, judging
    from class today that you wanted something that would be similar to. And I mean,
    this is just I don't know if I can see if you can see this, I might have to swap
    my share. Okay. so you want something basically like an interface style. Then.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah, just a rough drawing of the interface.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, so that's that's where we missed, or that's where we misunderstood the
    the assignment. We were thinking that we're drawing these interface based off
    of metaphors.
  persid: S03
- desc: Some nice drawings. By the way.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, these ones here. Yeah, you can. You can thank Julie for that. She is
    definitely an artist.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah, so so keep those. But just.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But you want something similar to like what we are doing in class today on
    the on the whiteboard.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Where we had explained. Like, I'm.
  persid: S03
- desc: And.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This one almost is similar to what you have, where you would have your people,
    you create your cards, place them in there you have your projects. That type of
    thing. Okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. perfect. I think that is.
  persid: S03
- desc: So if you need another day to polish things up, that's okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. yeah, we just we. We misunderstood the the metaphor to interface drawing.
    So we we were thinking that we were drawing our metaphors to explain how you would
    create a group and how those would. Basically, our our assignment is like creating
    groups and groupings. We had that at the very beginning when we first started
    and then I think it was a couple of classes later, where you said we should break
    it up a little bit. So we kinda preemptively started early. So.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay. yeah. So thanks for clarifying that. does that make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, it does. Now.
  persid: S03
- desc: Sorry for the confusion.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No, it's all good. It's it's understandable. Well. we're just happy that we
    got it answered now, and we'll get those. We'll get those interfaces put in there,
    and we'll have that resubmitted.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, definitely clear things up. Thank you.
  persid: S04
- desc: You're welcome. Okay? Anything else.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I'm good. Okay, Misha, you're good. Yeah, I'm good. Julie, you good.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: S05
- desc: Perfect thanks. Again Dr. Hepton.
  persid: S03
- desc: You're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Alright. Thank you.
  persid: S05
- desc: You're welcome. Take care!
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good day.
  persid: S04
- desc: You as well. Bye, bye.
