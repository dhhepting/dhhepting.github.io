Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S00
- desc: Morning, Darryl.
  persid: S01
- desc: Good morning. So what program are you using to generate the audio
  persid: S00
- desc: to generate audio?
  persid: S01
- desc: It sounds like you're you're you're using a computer voice.
  persid: S00
- desc: Oh, it might be a Internet connection problem then. Oh, okay, now, you sound
    like a person. Oh, great!
  persid: S01
- desc: Maybe that's a feature on zoom, that's a newt. they've added. So I had some
    struggles with Zoom. So how do people was the link working to day? Better?
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah. The link was working fun.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. yeah. So what I did when I I had a hair trigger and I pasted the link
    twice into the URL. Field. Think that's why it gave so many problems. anyway.
    Welcome everybody. So I mean. what'd you think of the quiz?
  persid: S00
- desc: There was no questions for me on that quiz. It was completely empty.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah, we couldn't access the quiz.
  persid: S01
- desc: Huh? Yeah, I had some. Let me see what happens when I do it. Huh? So I typed
    in. I typed. It sounds a bit rusty. So this is sort of the novice and expert user
    dichotomy. So it's not not one or the other. You're on a scale. And so I'm at
    times quite an expert user on things. But sometimes I end up having to figure
    out things from scratch again, so I'll go through this and let me share my screen.
    and then then I can go through the process and see where I forgot to click something.
    and I'll I'll open the quiz to the end of the day today. Well, yeah, okay, that's
    okay. So you can see the U. Rcourse's screen now. No, it says. I can't see. I'm
    okay. So let me go to settings first, and I'll change it to V. This one will be
    available from it's midnight today. Okay, so add a question. okay, so we're. where
    do I add questions. anyone see?
  persid: S00
- desc: Maybe maybe check the question, bankhas anything.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay? There should be. Yeah, there are 2 questions there
  persid: S00
- desc: that
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah. I just realizing here that the name is different. I wanted to make it.
    It should have had the key in front of it. I don't know why it came up with a
    different kinds of it, has. There's 2 of them. one with, and one without the prefects.
    anyway. So there's 2 questions there. So I know they're there. Let me go back
    to questions. Any ideas how to get the questions from the question bank on to
    the quiz. I thought I did this last night. It's something on the screen here.
  persid: S00
- desc: is it? Maybe the little add drop arrow below shuffle.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yes, that's right. Took me a few minutes to figure that out again. That was
    as I dip back to novice. So you can add from the question bank. It tells me there's
    questions there. so you can select these I can save. Go back to quiz. Just let
    me save preview it. There's one question. And there's another question. Okay,
    so let me see, if I switch to a student role. they can actually see the question.
    I can take the quiz.
  persid: S00
- desc: I just refresh my page here, and it actually allows me to attempt the quiz.
    Now.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, that's good. So another struggle I had yesterday in preparing the quiz
    as I had the questions sorted out, and I said. and I had in mind. because I'm
    teaching teaching 2 classes this semester had in mind which questions for which
    class? And then I but the questions into the wrong class I was. I thought I was
    being careful to not do that. but I ended up mixing them up. So that was. it could
    have maybe been a bit more. The class name could be a little more prominent as
    well. And that's more of a me problem than a you problem. anyway. Okay, so I've
    made some progress here. So I realized, this link isn't gonna work. It, does it?
    Yeah. I realize that I am off by one of the quizzes. So I'll have to redo the
    the links. So I'll get that sorted by Tuesday. Okay, but here I have the transcript
    from Zoom. If he's noticed this already. anyone. I'm surprised. That fills in
    the this gives me one solid block of text here. anyway. So there's the Zoom Transcript.
    the audio transcript, and then there's a chat complete with emojis. so you can
    let me know if that's helpful or not. Okay. So here are the responses. So I appreciate
    your responses. So Andrew, and who got it. made a gave a response. We'll get the
    2 marks for that. But going forward, I'll be a little more selective in terms
    of  the thoughtfulness of the answer. So if you, if from going forward. If you
    just put some text in to say you submitted something that that won't get you full
    marks. and remember it's only you you don't have to answer all 3 questions. One
    thoughtful answer will get you full marks. anyway. I've so there's that, and it's
    broken down by the questions. And so here. It's a picture of the whiteboard. so
    I can. Let's see if I I'm having a bit of trouble with with the pick, with the
    media uploading the pictures properly. so I've got a work that out as well. so
    I haven't. Here's my office hours, but I haven't added them yet. but there'll
    be here from on Monday and Wednesday from one to 4, and I'll give you a zoom option
    as well. So you come and see me on campus in person, or you can zoom to get to
    my and office. and if the times of setting out Monday and Wednesday afternoons
    aren't sufficient, then we can coordinate and make an appointment either or in
    person or in zoom for some other time during the week. then. So this link now
    works. So here's the updated version updated information for the sixth edition
    of the textbook. If you have the fifth edition, that's okay, too. Then Don Norman's
    sign of everyday things revised and expanded. So I gave you. These are given to
    you in the Link section. Here's the breakdown of grades that I talked about. So
    you have to pass the file to pass the class so late. Assignments will never. I'll
    leave it as a percentage of your grade up to a certain point, and then  anyway.
    Then, if the midterm exam is missed for approved reasons, like you have a doctor's
    note or something else happened. we can change the the weight or move move the
    weight from the midterm to the final. But if you miss the final without making
    arrangements beforehand. then you'll get an NP. As your final grade. So attendance
    is expected, of course, meetings. and you are encouraged to record your attendance
    on your courses. So does everyone see where how to do that. Okay? So in the chat.
    so in zoom, if you send me a direct message, then I need to reset it. Can you
    see the menus coming up on my shared screen. Okay. so what happens when you send
    me a direct message? Then it it's set to reply to the person who sent me the direct
    message. so please don't send me direct messages. because I might try. It might
    be the occasion. If I don't notice it's set to be a direct message. Then I'll
    send it back to the person, but not to the whole group. So I please don't. Okay.
    So Midterm is Tuesday. arch. fifth and final. Okay. so just say exact details
    of exam delivery to be determined. Hmm, yeah. So I would say. likely we'll do.
    We won't. Following the pattern of past. We'll do some, not something not proctor
    track for the mid term. and we might do proctor track. Then we would could use
    Proctor track for the final. That's the likely scenario. That's the most likely
    scenario. But still some details be worked out. Is that okay? So likely not. Proctor
    track for the midterm. yeah. Okay. okay, so let me finish going through this.
    The syllabus here. Okay? So I was at the point. So if you've missed doing the
    response from yesterday. Don't. I'm not going to reopen it, but don't worry, because
    well, I won't. I will drop 2 of the responses from your Mark's calculation. So
    if we have 25 responses, because you won't respond to the midterm. then I would
    count 23 of them in determining your grade. Does that make sense. So you still
    have the chance for full marks. even if you missed the first one. Okay? And does
    the attendance seem okay. hey? So I welcome your comments about the process and
    how to make things flow flow better. So the text. the main book that interaction
    design talks about, or the title, the subtitle of the book is beyond human computer
    interaction. So it's not just about designing computer interfaces. We were talking
    about  designing experiences. So we can think about designing the design of the
    course whether the parts are on line or not. So I want to highlight the academic
    integrity portion here. because it's certainly very important. and and the consequences
    can be very serious. So if it's very hard to to pass off some other, some work
    you found on the Internet as your own in most cases. so so don't do it. So so
    I I'm asking you for your honesty. So if if something happens so. the instant
    will but get get reported to the Academic Associate, Dean, Academic and Science.
    or that's for CS. 4, 28, and otherwise it'll get report to the associate, Dean
    FGSR. For 7 30. So I have the first link. Here is the academic integrity, Hub
    urijiyan.ca. then here the next one is the reference to the undergraduate calendar.
    4, 28 students. and then the last one is for grad studies for the 7 30 students.
    So if your need of accommodations contact the accessibility center for student
    accessibility. Because I need a letter and I need to discuss it with you before
    those accommodations can be granted. Okay. so here's a breakdown of weeks and
    topics and references. So what's not included here is who have a supplemental
    Ta. who will also have some office hours. So I that's still being worked out.
    So that's the only addition to the syllabus. So if you have questions. let me
    know. So while I'm here, let me. So I'm wondering whether putting this link out
    will be helpful. so I'll leave that open for a bit in case the other 12 people
    who have a group. I thought, that sounds like me, and it is me. And while I'm
    not sharing the screen oh. I'm looking in. Does that seem. Do you think that would
    be a good view to share instead of just the transcripts? So the audio transcript
    follows the video. But the chat messages don't seem to do that. anyway. I'll look
    into doing that. So here's our whiteboard from yesterday. So there's page 2. But
    there's nothing on page 2. This has given me a lot of problems last night. So
    I'm not sure this is a a great way to do to do things. We'll we'll try again,
    maybe today. Then let's see surveys. Here's the results we had yesterday. So I
    have.
  persid: S00
- desc: And
  persid: ???
- desc: another image I want to show you. Okay. my car is in the shop. So I have a
    rental car. and the person gave me a breakdown of the controls and different things.
    and then they went back into the office, and I sat there and I looked for how
    to put the car in gear. So there is the means to change the gear in this picture.
    Can you find it? Yeah. So I haven't driven Gmcs. So sometimes when we're does
    things get designed? It's not necessarily the most efficient or effective design
    which could be determined by testing. but it might be we need. The requirement
    is to have something different than other manufacturers. So like the car I have
    is afford. And so the gears are on a knob which is over here. Yeah. So the buttons
    are here. Oh, I have to do something else. So I'm getting a open. a need to give
    some permission to. Oh. is that better? I'm looking at all the options on zoom.
    So park is push. reverse is pull neutral is push and drive his pull. and then
    this is the semi-automatic, semi-manual option. They have the plus minus to adjust
    to give the driver some sense of control. But anyway, on the ford this is a gear
    shift here approximately so. The the dial is an improvement over the physical
    stick shift. On earlier cars. I have an earlier Ford fusion. and I occasionally
    leave it in drive when I park it, and if it's cold like to day, that'll drain
    the battery in no time flat. It's also a danger, because if I'm on an incline.
    and I shut the engine off with the with the car in not in park it could roll away.
    and some years ago the actor who played chuck off on the New Star Trek series
    of movies was killed when his vehicle wasn't parked properly the same kind of
    issue. And well, I don't know more details than that. but it's a pot. It's a certainly
    a big issue. So whether it's a knob for the gears or buttons. The improvement
    in recent models is that the car puts itself in park when the vehicle is turned
    off. So I was at London drugs yesterday. This is another experience with with
    the idea of novice and expert. So there's a London drugs app. So they you ever
    go to lending drugs, they have this LD extra program for points. So every time
    you buy something you get. you accumulate some points. But the app. I feel is
    not designed to encourage people to redeem points. Last time I used it a couple
    months ago someone explained it to me, and it seemed all right. But then, when
    I tried to use it last night, I had some problems again. and the person at the
    the cashier wasn't clear about it either. And so it took me a few minutes to figure
    things out again. But to me that's a case when things are designed. not with the
    most effective or efficient approach. but the one that's meeting some other goals.
    So I asked you to look at the first chapter. any thoughts about that. Okay? So
    I don't. The questions in the quiz are related to usability goals and user experience.
    So I don't want to get too much into that. I wanted to bring up before we go here.  usability
    heuristics that were first published in 1994, and they were updated in 2020. And
    there's still a very useful approach to think about interface is so. So we have
    the visibility of system. Status design shows keep users informed about what is
    going on through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time. A. The
    match between system and the real world design should speak the user's language
    and use words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user rather than internal
    jargon. Oh, real world conventions making information appear in a natural and
    logical order. User control and freedom users often perform actions by mistake.
    They need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the underwater action without
    having to go through an extended process. So an undo is always helpful. Consistency
    in standards. Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations,
    or actions mean the same thing. follow platform and industry, conventions. error,
    prevention, good error. Messages are important, but the best designs carefully
    prevent problems from occurring. In the first place. either eliminate error-prone
    conditions or check for them. and present uses with a confirmation option before
    they commit to action recognition rather than recall. So we want to minimize the
    user's memory load by making elements actions and options visible. The user should
    not have to remember information for one part of the interface to another. Information
    required to use the design should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.
    so that seemed appropriate with my experience in the LD. Extra app. So I'll post
    a couple screenshots, and so on for next day recall might be better for exams
    and then better than recognition. But if you want to make things easier for the
    user. the person and the system then important to not but too many obstacles in
    the way that said, we don't want to do too much for the users, so they don't stay
    in the loop that they're not engaged in the process. If we just have dialog boxes.
    we just have to click. dismiss, or okay, or yes. there might be a time when an
    important dialogue box comes up where you don't want to say OK. So we want to
    keep people alert enough to realize when their actions are required, and when
    important situations come up. flexibility and efficiency of use. Shortcuts hidden
    from novice users may speed up the interaction for the expert user. so the desire
    can care to both inexperienced and experienced users allow use users to tailor
    frequent actions. aesthetic and minimalist design interfaces should not contain
    information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information
    in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes
    their relative visibility. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.
    Error messages should be expressed in plain language. no error codes precisely
    indicate the problem and constructively suggest a solution. Open documentation
    dispersed. If the system doesn't need any additional explanation. however, it
    may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete
    their tasks. and it looks like we're out of time. So we went through the syllabus
    today and a few examples of interfaces. So well, can can you. with  have a look
    at the encyclopedia chapter one that's in the sorry. Yeah. The Encyclopedia chapter
    one as well as the textbook. Chapter one. And I've got some. So some work to do.
    Get things a little more streamlined. So see some improvements for Tuesday. anyway.
    That's that, I guess. And so oh. say goodbye, and wish you a a good weekend. and
    we'll see you on Tuesday. Anyone want to turn on their cameras?
  persid: S00
