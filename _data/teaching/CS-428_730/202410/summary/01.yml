- desc: Hello!
  persid: S00
- desc: Good morning, Darryl.
  persid: S01
- desc: Good morning. Happy New Year. Everybody. Okay. I'm gonna share my screen and
    will navigate a little bit on my web site tour and get to her your courses stuff
    as well. I'm a little rusty with zoom here, so please bear with me to day. Okay,
    can you see that my website? Now. I'm not sure how to get rid of the notification
    bings from emails. So if you hear a  some bells going off. I apologize. Okay,
    so that's my home page. And here's teaching. So I have today
  persid: S00
- desc: the
  persid: S02
- desc: which isn't there we go. So today we'll we'll give you the link for the meeting
    that's going on today. So let's go there now. So we have 26 meetings over the
    semester. So for each meeting I have a page like this. and we'll have an outline
    for today. So what we're doing. and then I've got some headings. which I'll explain
    as we go along here. Let me go up a little bit here to the. So I had a little
    bit of technical difficulties. But I'll get this all populated before next time.
    anyway. So here's our attentive schedule. So the week of Monday, January eighth,
    which is this week. So we have 2 meetings. We're gonna talk to a welcome to day.
    and then we'll also start into the foundations of usability. So the no tears.
    The first class meeting is to day. So Reading week is in February nineteenth.
    so the nineteenth is family day. so there's no class meetings that week and then
    resume on the 20 sixth. Turn me to 20 seventh. So I've scheduled the midterm for
    Tuesday, March fifth. For those of you who are in 2 80 as well. We're going to
    have our midterm on Thursday. the 20 ninth of February. Very special midterm cause.
    If every 20 ninth doesn't come round all the time. Well, every 4 years, as you
    know.
  persid: S00
- desc: excited zoning.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, somebody's not muted. I'm going to just do a mute for everybody except
    for me. You have to listen to me. Talk for a bit more.  Okay. alright. So back
    to our meeting today. So under the administration section, I have first our greeting
    of Happy Tuesday. and then here's a link for attendance. so you can record your
    own attendance. So these are your courses links. so you can access that on your
    own and make a and record your attendance. So just a way to engage in the class.
    So then, we have a class calendar for today. So take attendance, record your attendance
    here. and you can go the activity from the calendar. So I'm going to ask you to
    do a response. We'll talk about that in a minute. And so that opens at 1245 at
    the end of class that's open to 11 PM. Tonight. So that's for today. So if you
    go to it now, just say that it's not open till tonight till till after class.
    Okay? So that gives you today's events. then upcoming events. So have a little
    quiz before the next meeting, so that opens at midnight on Thursday. and it'll
    close at 1130, for before the class starts or the start of class. and then we
    have attendants. and I apologize. You're the way this is. This isn't organized
    the way that I think it should be. But anyway, I hope it's a helpful things. So
    so those are links you can get to. So if you log into you our courses. then these
    will be these will take you right there and then, if you're not logged in, then
    you can log in. will take you to log and screen. So. starting next meeting, I'll
    hover. I'll have a section here for my response to the responses. So there are
    3 questions. Then you can answer one or all, all 3 of them. So is there. What?
    So in today's meeting, what's the most important concept or perspective you've
    encountered today was something difficult for you to understand in today's meeting.
    And is there something from today's meeting that you would like to know more about.
    So those are the 3 questions. So most meetings I'll ask. So that's so. I'll so
    once after the responses are closed. then they'll appear here at the bottom responses.
    and there'll be they won't be identifiable as coming from any one. So don't don't
    identify yourself in your answers. please. and then so results from last meeting.
    So this is going to be a a feature. So most meetings I will ask you to interact
    with the class material in your courses. Now post the results here from the previous
    day. So I'm not asking you to interact. Today, I've got a poll for you. which
    we'll bring up in a little bit. but nothing, so I guess I can. I'll put that in
    in here. As for a record of it. Okay? So then. so that's how I'm gonna organize
    the beginning of. So I'm not going to deal with these in class. So those are just
    there for you. so we'll start next day. We'll start here with the response to
    responses results from last meeting, and then we'll get into to day. So to-day
    I start out with introductions. So I haven't introduced myself yet. Some of you
    I recognize so hello to people I've not seen before had classes with before, and
    hello to people who I haven't met before. I look forward to meeting with you over
    the semester. So my name is Darryl Darryl, hepting. I'm a professor in computer
    science. And so you can call me Darryl or Dr. Hepting. But please just pick one
    of those, too. Let's see. So I did my bachelor's and master's degrees here at
    the University of Regina a few years ago. just like almost yesterday. and did
    my Ph. D. At Simon Fraser University. and I have been here for awhile as a faculty
    member. So if you're on campus or in the city. and you want to come and see me
    during office hours. I am in College West 308.2 2. I say it used to be the alphabetical
    section of the Computer Science Department. but some of the h's have left one
    once moved to a different office. and another one that's left. So it used to be.
    There were 4 h's, and we were all in a row alphabetically. anyway. that's neither
    here nor there. So making most of zoom. So one thing I suggest, and I see some
    people have done this already. If you click on your window and in zoom where there's
    a dot dot dot on the upper right hand corner of the street of Europe. Your rectangle
    in zoom brings up a menu menu so mute, my few different choices here. The one
    I am interested in here is rename. So I said. with the name you like to be called.
    So I gave you 2 choices, so I'll better list both for today, anyway. So this is
    what I've suggested. You can't see that, so I've renamed rename myself. but I
    I feel like I should also encourage you to list your pronouns. I'll adjust that
    in my description. Okay, so if you do that. that'll help me associate the names
    you like to be called with. Your identity, in course. renew our courses. And so
    I can start making those connections a little bit more easily. So I'm not sure
    if it's possible to to save that or Avenue each time. Maybe I should. Well. I'll
    take your advice about that. This is a good practice or not. Well. I think it
    would be a good practice. But we can refine the process. Okay, so that's me. So
    the other thing about zoom is. it'd be nice, free to turn your camera on from
    time to time to say hello. So perhaps at the end of the meeting we can for those
    who are able who have a camera functioning. Then we could  wave and say. See you
    next next meeting. So when you log into zoom. you noticed about the meeting being
    recorded. So I'm going. So I'm recording this. And then I'm going to create an
    anonymous anonymized. And I spell it wrong. I think I got it right. Yeah, okay,
    so there's some comments about the cameras, so as as you're able to do that. I
    encourage you to do it. So if you don't have a camera all the time, or if you
    don't. if you're not up to showing yourself to the world or this small portion
    of it. I understand as well. Okay. So tour of yeah courses is next. So the in
    this version of moodle there's the left hand pull out. That does sort of the index
    for the class. What is it called course index. And then on the right-hand side,
    there's the block drawer.  yeah, okay. I was expecting something different, but
    that's because I still on the calendar page. Okay, so let me pull out this and
    then can see the calendar here as well. So that's a little bit of an overview
    of that. So I'm we'll get some more things added to the general portion. So this
    is general information. I'll put a link to my web page for the course and some
    other things as well. So then we have. Your next section is meetings. So zoom
    for class meetings that's fair enough. So we got here attendance. So record your
    own attendance, of course, meetings. And then we have a meetings. Wiki. So this
    is the home page for the wiki. Okay. so so how did you? So for the people who
    had problems accessing the zoom link. how did you get in? Well, I didn't want
    to open the email. Let me just look at that. Hmm! I thought the link had the passcode
    in it. Oh, I think I see the problem here. I copied the I pasted the link twice
    whose drawing on the screen. Okay. so maybe that's fixed. I'll work on that to
    make sure that for next time it works properly. So thank you to whomever. Yes.
    So the syllabus. the Pdf version is not quite ready. Who will talk about the marking?
    Break down in a minute. Okay. so I've set up pages Wiki pages so you can make
    notes about what happened in the meeting. and I've done some navigation links
    here to get back to home. and I'm working to improve those as well. Let me just
    show you how the syntax goes. so you can write an HTML. This is HTM. Editor, but
    to create a Wiki page. You have 2 square brackets. and then the name of the page
    enclosed 2 square brackets. so the page exists. It becomes a link to that page.
    The page doesn't exist. It'll show up as bread and italics. and we'll give the
    option to create the page. So that's that's the gist of the wiki. So I'm not going
    to force people to use it. But if there's I'm providing it as a way to encourage
    engagement with the material and the course. so I'll I'll leave that with you.
    So respond to. So this is organized a little bit. Well. so we have meetings. and
    we can close that up. so respond to meetings. So the that'll be 10 marks towards
    your final grade. So if you rate something to make a submission. You'll get Mark.
    You'll get a mark of 2 persons per response that you write so. But this is a bit
    like negative option billing. So if you write something. you'll get the 2 marks
    that upon our review of of what you've written, if it's if it's nothing substantive.
    or however, it's saying. if you just typing in some characters to satisfy the
    requirement. Then you you'll get one or 2 marks deducted from it from your score.
    So so you don't have to answer all 3 questions, but you can answer one of them,
    1, 2, or 3 of them. in a thoughtful way. That would be appreciated. and you'll
    be rewarded for it. So with the quizzes, that's another 10 marks. So the quizzes
    will be about what we've discussed and wet. and what I've asked you to look at
    for the preparation for the next meeting. So so the quizzes are open from midnight
    until last time starting time. So we'll see how the timing works. So let me answer
    a question. So you you won't get partial marks if you give a thoughtful answer
    to one or 2 of the questions, and not the third. that you get full marks for a
    thoughtful answer. Okay. and yes, the syllabus will be available before next class.
    So there! So 40 marks towards your final grade. It will be on assignments. and
    then the exams will be 40 marks as well. 10 for the midterm and 30 for the final.
    and you must pass the final to pass the class. So participation I will put here
    the items for interaction in New York horses. So I don't have anything today.
    but we will in the future. and I have a poll for zoom, which I'll get to in a
    minute. But I don't that I don't think that can be listed here. So that's separate.
    Anyway, the last bit is about if there is an opportunity. My research opportunity
    with the participant pool in computer science. You have a chance to earn one or
    2 bonus marks you can. You can earn up. If there's one study. you get one. You
    can get one bonus mark for participating in that study. and if there are 2 studies
    in which you participate, then you can get up to 2 bonus marks, so one for each
    study. But that only applies in the case that there is studies available. So if
    there aren't research studies available. there won't be a research credit opportunity.
    Does that make sense? Okay. let's try the poll. Okay, I'm getting ready to launch.
    So I'm asking, where are you joining from today. So are you on campus at the University?
    Are you in Regina? Are you somewhere in Saskatchewan? Are you in some other part
    of Canada? Are you in some other part of North America. or are you somewhere else
    in the world? So gay people are responding in the chat. But now I've got a poll
    up. So I'll leave that open for a bit in case the other 12 people who haven't
    replied want to do that. Okay, so gone. do that. So the other other bits here
    that I didn't talk about on the page. So, Media. if we were doing this in person,
    I would take pictures of the whiteboard or blackboard chalkboard as we're progressing
    through. or a meeting. so here we won't have that. But I might take some screenshots
    or use the whiteboard. and and so we won't have something there every day. But
    that's what is meant by media transcript. So I'll zoom will create a transcript
    of the audio recording. So I'll anonymize anonymize the the speakers. and I'll
    also do what the record of the chat as well. So I showed you the wiki. So here's
    a link to the Wiki page. so let me go up again to the page for our offering. so
    I didn't put in my office hours yet. but I'm thinking of Monday and Wednesday
    afternoons from one to 4 PM. And I'll have a zoom link as well. Does that sound?
    Okay? And if that time doesn't work. Please contact me. and we can arrange a time
    on zoom or in person to discuss or answer any questions you have. So under the
    links. If you're interested you can download a calendar file with all the course
    meetings in it. Okay. so that's so. The syllabus will be fixed by Thursday's meeting.
    Your courses gives you the link to the home page our course calendar file I just
    talked about. You can also download a calendar from your courses, I believe. Let
    me see if that's that's true. Oh, I think that's the issue. Yeah, there, I didn't
    see the bottom of the page. You're probably wondering why I didn't see it. So
    importer export calendars. I haven't tried it before, so I'll we can explore that.
    So after the calendar file is the link to the website for the textbook. A sixth
    edition is now available. So if you can get the sixth edition, that would be great
    if you have the fifth edition. We can work with that. So there's that. Here's
    another reference. It's an open textbook about psychology that will be using some
    resources from. And then there's the Encyclopedia of Human-computer interaction
    from interaction design dot org. And then here's a link to the Nielsen Norman
    group. Oh, I didn't mention design of every day things that's encouraged. No.
    So yes, I'm going to post a transcript from the chat and from the audio. I'm not
    gonna post the audio. I will post the transcript of the audio. Sorry I'm looking
    for the whiteboard. and I don't see it. Okay. so this is this course is about
    the fundamentals of human-computer interaction or human computer communication
  persid: S00
- desc: at all.
  persid: ???
- desc: Or maybe people centered people centered computing. There's a lot of different
    ways to talk about it. So I'd like you to in the last few minutes of our meeting
    here. I'm going to stop shirring my screen. Well, let me go back to meeting one
    here and say the last bit to read. Chapter one of the textbook OK. So I'm going
    to stop sharing. Maybe that will bring up the whiteboard. Yes. it did. Okay? So
    I see lots of people floating around on the whiteboard. So a question is. and
    let me so. and you add text, try not to overlap. Pick your own spot. answer that.
    and if you'd like to use the microphone. you can unmute yourself. Do I need? Do
    I need to enable something  security. So adding text on the left-hand side, there's
    a the tool. a toolbar that maybe has an arrow, a pencil. some shapes, and then
    if you show more tools. Then there's a T for text. Yeah. So the whiteboard feature
    has as an example of bad design. I don't disagree. It's it looks better than it
    was before. But there are some issues definitely okay. So we're out of time to
    day. So I meant chapter one of interaction design. fifth or sixth edition. Oh,
    I sent that not to everybody. I mean. try that again. Okay, So, for example, I
    don't see a clear way to and the whiteboard and make sure it's saved. So I'm going
    to close the whiteboard now. and we'll see what we get from it. Anyone want. Turn
    on your cameras and and wave blue
  persid: S00
- desc: work with you.
  persid: ???
- desc: Yes, if you're not using your camera, you can do a wave and gesture under
    reactions. Okay, so thanks for to day. Everybody see you on Thursday. Okay, I'm
    gonna close it. Take care, everyone. We'll see you on Thursday. Have a good day.
    some of you. I'm gonna see? At 2 30 in classroom 1, 10. Okay. Bye.

  persid: DHH
- desc: A good design would be the one which is user friendly and easy to use, a poor
    design would be the opposite of good desgin which is not user friendly and not
    easy to use.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I agree with Mohammed on that
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good design is intuitive, which means that someone can use it or figure it
    out easily without needing to be taught (or there is little documentation required).
  persid: DHH
- desc: A good design is something that is intuitive and easy to use. A poor design
    is harder to approach and has unnecessary barriers of entry
  persid: DHH
- desc: a good design is something that is clear, easy to use and functional - where
    all parts of design and application come together to create a good user expereience
  persid: DHH
- desc: Which textbook are we supposed to read from?
  persid: DHH
- desc: A good design is intuitive and has a simple UI, bad design is overly cluttered
    and difficult to navigate or learn to use.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A good design has to be simple and intuitive while also offering all functionality
    to the user
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"I agree with Moham...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Anything could have a bad design. For example take a look at cars. If we had
    a car with a door that opens into the vehicle, that door is poorly designed as
    it either completely stops the passenger from being able to operate the car, or
    makes it much more inconvenient to operate.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The user interface of smartphones, with intuitive icons, clear navigation,
    and a visually appealing layout, is often considered a good design.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A good Software design is Easy to use, Functional and clear which secure and
    also reliable and a poor design is not aesthetic, not easy to understand and is
    not reliable.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good design is usually intuitive to the end users and bad design can be frustrating
    to navigate. An example of this is how most social media apps have similar navigation
    as they all have the same user base
  persid: DHH
- desc: Interaction Design (5th or 6th edition)
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Interaction Design (...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good design is easy to use , which means that someone can use it or figure
    it out easily without needing insructions or prior experience.
  persid: DHH
- desc: example - a remote control - where all buttons are clearly labled and the
    function they represent and are easy to use
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Interaction Design (\u2026\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good user design is clear and easily to understand for user
  persid: DHH
- desc: A good design is one that is intuitive, easy to use and understand and laid
    out properly. A bad design is the opposite of a good design. An example of bad
    design is Facebook
  persid: DHH
- desc: good user design allows users to do the task they are trying to achieve with
    minimal frustration
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good design to me is one that is easy to understand and use. It has good looking
    interface which provides easy navigation and user experience
  persid: DHH
- desc: A good design should help users to navigate and understand through information
    easily.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks Daryl! Have a good day everyone
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you
  persid: DHH
- desc: A good design is easy to understand viewer while bad design is difficult to
    use user
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you!
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you
  persid: DHH
