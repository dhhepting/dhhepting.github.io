- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: How's everyone doing today?
  persid: S00
- desc: Good yourself?
  persid: S01
- desc: I'm pretty good. Thanks. It feels like winter again to day. A very brisk minus
    4. I think it seems plenty to say that in February
  persid: S00
- desc: nothing to complain about, in my opinion.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah. sure beats minus 40. We might end up seeing a few more of those days
    yet before winter is officially done. Okay. so let me let me share my screen.
    There we go. Okay. so there are a few things I want to focus on looking at the
    results from the question I asked about revisiting the course. so maybe we can
    have a peek there first. So these are anonymous. So I think it's okay to show
    them like this in raw format. So the the response one didn't stick out to me before,
    but it does now. So I if you notice anything in the responses. let me know you
    can comment on them in the chat, or have a discussion about them. So the external
    web site does help keep things together and on track. But the reading material
    can sometimes be difficult to find. but just referring to the wiki. So yeah, sometimes
    I just give you. I say. look at Chapter 5 in the Interaction Design Foundation
    Encyclopedia, IDFE. Whereas I could give the link for that I don't have links
    for the design of everyday things. The only thing I link to is the is the article
    about the revised and expanded edition
  persid: S00
- desc: on the Nielsen Norman Group page.
  persid: ???
- desc: "So I think there are some Pdf. Versions of maybe the first edition. But if\
    \ you're able to get your hands on the revised and expanded edition, I think it's\
    \ a good read. has lots of interesting stuff in it. and the textbook. Either the\
    \ fifth or sixth edition is good. it's good to have. And the book's website also\
    \ has some material on there that you can access. So they have Powerpoints for\
    \ the different chapters. So for those of you who are interested in Powerpoints.\
    \ you can have a look at the Id Book web site. So I'm trying to sprinkle in the\
    \ the resources that are in the syllabus listed for the different topics. So I\
    \ just 1, 2 keep you on track with with that today, I think it's enough. and we'll\
    \ talk about the first assignment. and it's enough to get you to work on on the\
    \ ideas we're talking about there. So I don't have another explicit reading or\
    \ resource for you to look at. I'm gonna see if I can say, do not disturb. See\
    \ if that helps the being. So. Yeah, there's lots of reference materials for the\
    \ grad class at 7 30 that's more intended for. So the readings are aimed at the\
    \ 7 30 class more than the 4, 28 class. So as an undergraduate student. you can.\
    \ you have different expectations? But I would say. keep track of where we are\
    \ in our discussions. and that will  that will help any other. So I asked about\
    \ the wiki. and I'm curious if there's any any thoughts about using it in a better\
    \ way. I wonder whether it's it may be more effective if maybe we have a summary\
    \ with the links that I bring up in our discussion. not the transcript per se,\
    \ but just some things that were brought up during the the meeting. and if there\
    \ are some links that come up later on, I can add them. Does that seem, Mike?\
    \ A good. a good way to use the wiki? Or where should I put. Where should we put\
    \ things that come up after the meeting? That sounds like a good thing for a pole\
    \ or a survey, I guess. Wiki page for that meeting. web page for that meeting\
    \ or web page. and I'll also add another. Hey, here we go. Okay. leave it for\
    \ another 30\_s or so see if we can get the last. a people to participate. Okay,\
    \ I think we can stop. So the person who said other to be discussed. would you\
    \ like to see you put forward what you had in mind if you had something specific?\
    \ I've lost the chat window. Okay? I found it again. hey? So a thought. Oh. I'm\
    \ just wondering if maybe we could have a someone post to the Forum about things\
    \ that are things that are mentioned that aren't clear. or the needle the yeah.\
    \ URL, to go with it. I will try and come up with a way to do that in in a more\
    \ reasonable way or more clear way. hey? Anyway, I don't want to spend all day\
    \ thinking about this. Stop sharing that. Okay? So the 2 user experience golfs,\
    \ evaluation and execution. So the gulfs are related. So we can think of a golf.\
    \ Here's the Graphic that's in the textbook as well from the source. So the gulf\
    \ of evaluation. Where, when we're trying to address or assess? What's the current\
    \ system state and the gulf of execution? We went to answer the question, how\
    \ do I use a system? So if it's clear. if there's if it's a good design. the interface\
    \ is designed well. so the information, the the state of the system is clearly\
    \ displayed, and the person using the system can can look at the interface and\
    \ say. I understand how this is laid out. I based on that. I expect that if I\
    \ click here it's going to have the desired effect. And if that works. then the\
    \ golfs are minimized. So we. if, on the other hand. you know, you want to do\
    \ something. but it's hard to figure out if that thing can be done in the interface.\
    \ maybe try something, and there's little feedback. or it's not clear what happened\
    \ when you clicked the thing that you thought would do what you want done. So\
    \ you're not sure how to use a system, and you're not sure how to make sense of\
    \ what happened or what state the system is currently in. Then the gulfs of execution\
    \ and evaluation are very large. and it's difficult to bridge them. So we might\
    \ think of Grand Canyon large. or some other other examples you can think of.\
    \ So this is a nice selection for cookies. and I think I just selected the one\
    \ that I didn't want to choose. I went, as say only necessary cookies. anyway.\
    \ So the example from the book they talk about here is the Bluetooth settings.\
    \ So, looking at the right. the left image. Pardon me. So how? How do we tell\
    \ whether the Bluetooth is on or off? Okay, so let's if we look at the right image\
    \ as well, then we can see what the difference is. But how could we just looking\
    \ at the left image? How would it be possible to interpret that as Bluetooth being\
    \ on? Yeah, it shows off. But off as on the other side of the switch. So if the\
    \ off position is to the right. the on position is to the left. Does that make\
    \ sense? Yeah. So let me see if we can add, here we want off. And here we want.\
    \ Hmm, hmm! So that would be one. One way to do it. another way to do it might\
    \ be. Let me see if I can get another one. Bluetooth is off. and then here we\
    \ could also add. we could move the message. is that an improvement? Hey? One\
    \ person says, yes, that's good. Anyone else care to venture a comment. So the\
    \ idea is. we can we can use the idea of the goals of execution and evaluation\
    \ to improve the design by thinking about how? How do we improve the the information\
    \ display so that it's clear what operations can be done. And so the title of\
    \ the screen, Bluetooth. Other devices. is all right now. I just wonder maybe\
    \ we don't need the ad bluetooth or other device unless it's on. Or we could change\
    \ this message. Add Bluetooth or other device. Turn on Bluetooth to add a Bluetooth\
    \ device. So we get the sense that we're in the right spot to do the thing we\
    \ want to do. But then it's not clear with the feedback. So the golf evaluation\
    \ is. it's not communicating the system's status. Very well.  so I'm having to\
    \ resolve this technical difficulties. Excuse me for a minute. Have a look at\
    \ this screen from my board vehicle, and tell me what you think. what what the\
    \ status is and what to do. If I want to change the temperatures in the vehicle.\
    \ Okay, I'll be right back any thoughts. Yeah. Okay. So so if you look at the\
    \ bottom. Here, there's let me see if I can. Let's squish this a little. I have\
    \ to figure out how to save that with the image. so we'll just put it off to the\
    \ side. For now can you see me moving that the text and the overlay that I just\
    \ did?"
  persid: S00
- desc: Yep.
  persid: S01
- desc: so the can. The thing about about this display. So the question is. okay.
    So auto auto is on and auto is on here as well. So if I clicked off auto on the
    button. Then this would change here. The thing that I can access from the buttons
    is whether it's duel or not. so it's hard to see. Let me see if I can zoom in
    a bit. There are minus and plus buttons here. so each side can control their temperature
    if they want. So the question is so dual is active, so I can have different temperatures
    on the driver's side and the passenger side. But it's not clear where I make a
    mistake with this, and I have to think about it is his dual. I'm controlling both
    temperature. Both temperatures are set to be the same. Well, in this case, when
    they're different. it's I should have taken a picture with the duel on was a duel
    turned off. I apologize. I'll do that for next meeting.
  persid: S00
- desc: Sorry is this for a car, or is this like a van? Because I know some vans have,
    like the dual setting for people in the back.
  persid: S01
- desc: No, this is well, it's not a. It's not a car, it's a it's a Ford edge, which
    is kind of a
  persid: S00
- desc: crossover. Okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: it's a big vehicle, anyway. but it's just is passenger side and driver's side.
    Soon. The label duel to me is yes, so the prevalence of touch screens is concerning,
    I think, as well.
  persid: S00
- desc: I know some vehicles have like warning systems in place that you're not supposed
    to touch the touch screens while driving.
  persid: S01
- desc: But anyway, so just to think about these gulfs of execution and evaluation.
    So it's not duel is on. But what does duel mean? This duel mean? I'm controlling
    both sides. We're not. And just the whole. This whole display is is confusing.
    I think it's just takes a lot to figure out what's going on. So some things. Some
    of these things are on buttons like the recircuting the air. And I think that's
    a rear defroster. Yeah. I will take a few more pictures, so I can give you the
    whole. I will do some homework there, so that I will put these pictures in in
    this meeting's pictures. and I will also figure out how to get the screenshot
    with my annotation on it as an image that I will put into our meetings today as
    well. But I am on the meeting for today. Okay, so a couple things I wanted to
    mention, there's a questionnaire for 4, 28 students. but a future course offering.
    So there is an opportunity, for there's a little preamble about the questionnaire.
    So this is only for people in 4, 28. So I've given you a few days for that Thursday
    at at after class. Let me just check that. I've done that properly. So. February
    eighth to one pm. So I think these courses are going to be offer co-scheduled
    because they'll be available and spring and summer. So it's just a question of.
    or they'd be interested in taking them. Does that make sense? Okay? So here's
    an and a use for Wiki that I came up with. So it's in the meetings, Wiki. But
    this is the home. No, it's not the home page, it's it's a link on the on the wiki.
    So students looking to find others to work within groups. So here's a page, and
    if you want to. if you're not in a group yet. do you want to be put into a group?
    Add your name here, and I will. I will facilitate that. Does that make sense about
    groups? So physic. So under assignments, there's a couple things that are more
    assignment related. and then there. So be 2 things that are classify as assignments
    than 3 things that are going to be not associated with the project. So I'm asking
    for groups of 4 for the project. We may need to have 2 groups of 3 for the project.
    but were looking for groups of 4 for the project and for the assignment you can
    work in groups of up to 4. So if you form a group of 4 now we can use I unless
    you specify differently. I'll use that group of 4 for the project piece as well.
    But if you have a group of 1, 2, or 3, I will add people to to make a group of
    4 for the project portion. Does that make sense? Okay? So we talked about Apollo
    13 the other day about how. when the Apollo. 13 Mission had to abort landing on
    the moon, but just getting people back. and they had. You're running out of oxygen
    because the CO. 2 filters were getting depleted, and and they had extra filters,
    but they didn't fit into the system, they into the into the housing where this
    crew were living. so they had to make do with that. So to me, this is how it's
    working for the the groups, so let me alright put my foot make myself less clear.
    Let me go back to the course page, and I'll show you an example. So I asked for
    group numbers to be put together. So I've done many of them already. or I've done
    the ones I received until last yesterday. So I asked for group numbers. So it
    seems like there's not a great process to use for this. I think it's going to
    be easier than so I want one with an overview. I apologize for sure showing information
    here. I won't show it very quick. Let's look at. So here I can get based on the
    group I know who's in the group. and then I can go here. And so let's say 1011,
    12, and 13. We're going to. We were working together, so I would pick the the
    one that's first in the list. and I would add and remove users. So then I could
    say there would have to go and look at my list again. and then. so I won't go
    through this in great detail. But I couldn't. I can't. There's no screen to do
    it a consolidation. So I have to go and find the groups, and then after that.
    if I go back to groups. then I can select the group numbers, I added, and I can
    delete them. So I'm not going to do that now. But the reason I said it was like
    Apollo 13 is because the information there's no easy way to convert from user
    the user id like. from your email address to the names of the students in the
    list. So let me. And then I have to go back, and there's lots of clicking here.
    anyway. I don't know if I made my case very convincingly. I'll try and spell it
    out more clearly, and with some screenshots. So here's the first assignment. So
    this goes well, it worked on my laptop, and so I thought it would. I would just
    publish it. I have to figure out what went wrong. Okay. I don't see what the problem
    is. Maybe there isn't a problem. Yes, there was no problem. So here it is. So
    you've been made a teacher. Well, you're not really a teacher. You're a beta teacher
    for learning role. Now, I think this. But you actually have a role of beta teacher
    for learning. So if you can confirm that I would appreciate it anyway. So what
    I'm asking you to do is so what I want you to do in your individually or in groups.
    is to experiment with you. Our courses so describe an activity that a teacher
    could create for their students. That includes one. your courses activity. and
    allows a grade to be assigned upon completion. and when you are Course's resource.
    whose access is restricted based on the grade earned in the activity. As you complete
    your activity with viewer courses interface. reflect on your experience. So that
    gives you a bit more detail. So it's 8 marks. So I want you to. The idea is to
    focus on what opportunities for design there are in the activity. So you can think
    about what goes well and what doesn't go well. And so the things that I mean you
    don't ignore the things that go well, but focus on the opportunity the things
    that could be improved or problematic. So I I was going to have this due on Friday
    before the break. But since I had some issues with you are courses that course
    which you're enrolled. I've made it now Tuesday, after the break. so before the
    break, we'll have the other assignments in place. So you know what to expect or
    the rest of them. Okay, any questions or concerns as we're at the end of our time
    here to day. Okay? Well, seeing no questions. Let's call today, then thank you
    very much, for to day. Take care, and we'll see you on Thursday.
  persid: S00
- desc: Perfect. Take care, Darryl.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah, thanks, Darrell. Have a good rest of your day.
  persid: S03

  persid: DHH
- desc: the slider and the colour change
  persid: DHH
- desc: The toggle is either greyed out or in colour and is paired with the word "on"
    or "off"
  persid: DHH
- desc: slider shows off
  persid: DHH
- desc: while the slider shows off, it still shows a device that has previously been
    connected which can be confusing
  persid: DHH
- desc: Ah, I see why someone could get confused. If they assumed directionality mattered
    then they would assume that the rightmost position would mean off.
  persid: DHH
- desc: the off should be labeled on left side whereas on should be right side
  persid: DHH
- desc: yea off should be on the left side, they moved it to the right side for the
    pleasing aspect.  Having it on the left side would look not uniform
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Improve a lot
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'My first question is: why is there a digital display when there are buttons
    below? What is the purpose of having both?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Also, are the temperatures under Auto and Dual referring to different purposes
    or the sides of the car?
  persid: DHH
- desc: My car looks like this too, there are more options on the display than the
    buttons
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: but the buttons are easier to access while driving, especially if you have
    apple carplay on the screen or are in a different display section like Audio
  persid: DHH
- desc: I'm honestly shook that so many cars have touch displays anyway, to me that
    seems weird and dangerous, because you get no tactile feedback. Analog means that
    I can make adjustments without looking, whereas touch screens mean I have to look
    away from the road to adjust them.

  persid: DHH
- desc: not sure how the climate control works since i haven't been in this car, but
    if the screen gives the option to select your own combination of airflow (eg.
    lower air + windshield fan thing) that seems easier to use than just cycling through
    the different options by pressing the button multiple times like many other cars.
    however, i would still prefer to use the analog dials/buttons while driving, the
    slight convenience doesn't override that for me.
  persid: DHH
