- desc: Good morning, everyone. How are you doing today? Do you have a good Easter
    weekend? I had a nice weekend. Thanks for asking. I'm glad the snow is melting
    again. So I apologize for the problems with my website over the weekend. So I
    realized. this is a technical explanation. But I had. So I can run my website
    on my laptop to to check it out to make sure it looks. It looks the way I want
    it to look before I publish it to the web. But I had the the preview software
    running. So every change it detects it remakes the website. And so I think when
    I post it to the web it had changed a few files to be local host, which is what
    other my laptop. So I and then I made sure I quit that. And then I remade the
    website and published it. And I think that solved the issue. So if you looked
    at the website again from Sunday evening he should have been able to see it correctly.
    But I sent a note with the date of April yesterday, April first at noon. So did
    anyone do any practical jokes before noon yesterday for April Fools' Day. So does
    Eminem still still record. I haven't. Oh, he pranked. Okay. okay. I know who Eminem
    is. anyway, I'm not that old even know why April Fools Day has that name. April
    first is known as April Fools Day. Anyone? Well, my understanding is that the
    New Year used to be on April the the new calendar year began on April first at
    1 point. and then when it's switched to people who still marked at on April first
    were set out to be foolish, I guess. anyway. so did everyone get a message from
    me just a few minutes ago on your courses. Do you get an email? Okay, that's good.
    And a couple of people did, anyway. So if you so I just want to show you what
    I've done on your courses here to facilitate the last bit of the project. So I've
    made you okay. This is shared now, right? So I've made 9 groups. Happily, there
    were 18 groups. So it's that made it easy to make pairs. So I made 9 groups. So
    there's an item here prepared groups for testing group membership. And so for
    me, I've added my own group. I didn't test that. I've gotten everybody. So let
    me. Let me test this by adding a an assignment that requires a group. hey? So
    I'm going to. Maybe I better have a due date in case that complains later. I noticed
    that if you don't have enable on the if you don't enable the dates, the calendar
    doesn't work. So if can you see that. So the calendar isn't disabled. It doesn't
    work, but here it does. because I have enabled that date so a little frustration
    there. anyway. So I've got it set up. I don't want to bother with those things.
    Submit in groups. Yes. require a group to make a submission. Yes. require also.
    No, don't want to do that student grouping, grouping for student groups. testing
    paired groups. So it doesn't show any problems here. So I guess I've I did correctly.
    Okay, so I can delete that. Now people see. The other thing I don't like about
    navigation here is that there's no way to go just to the section I have to go
    back to the top. although it consistently remembers things like this goes. So
    it did go back to assignments. So I just want to delete this assignment. Okay.
    so would you like to see how I did the I made the testing pair groups. So I went
    back to so participants. So I started out by making. So I made this grouping,
    testing paired groups. But then I didn't. But then I realized I couldn't make
    a grouping with groupings in it. So it had to be grouped. So what I did was. and
    I created these other groupings. and I call them Test Tp for testing pair one
    through 9. And then I did auto create groups. So I have to go back to groupings.
    Our pardon me, groups and I did auto create. And I said number left number of
    groups. So I made that one. So just to show you what happens here. I turned on
    group messaging. and then I said, select hours from grouping. And then let's say,
    Tpu, testing pair one allocate members randomly doesn't matter. The thing is here
    I need to do is it's hidden. But this is important because it's not going to work
    like this default settings because you have to specify a grouping name. But I
    want them to be in testing paired groups. So just preview it because we've already
    created these groups. So here we have a group with 8 people in it. So 2 groups
    of 4 together. So that process worked any critiques or comments about how I could
    do that better. So what are some advantages and disadvantages. any ideas about
    that. Yeah. So it's a lot of navigation. So the I guess maybe the advantage is.
    So let's cancel this. So I don't create another group here to muddy, the waters
    so under groupings. So I guess an advantage is then I can say, well, here are
    the pairs that I made. So each of these are project groups before, and there's
    one group of 3, so I can preserve that information. So if I wanted to make groups
    of 4, I could do that. but there's no hierarchy of group grouping, so I can't.
    I can't easily use this to regenerate groups. If I needed to make a change. I'd
    have to go through and pick the pick, the the pair that I wanted, or the group
    that I wanted to combine. the groups that I wanted wanting to edit them. so I
    don't know. It would maybe be. Maybe it would be nice to have a what's the word?
    Have an auto? Well. have an automated naming convention so that I could say. or
    I guess if I could have a wild card to match things like if create one group from
    each of these groupings that might be better or recreate them. and if I could
    have support for hierarchies of groupings that might also be good that way, I
    could. instead of instead of having to go through manually to pick each grouping
    to generate the group. I could just say. generate groups in this grouping from
    these groupings. And maybe we need better language to talk about groups set of
    groups and groupings. anyway. Does that make sense anyone who's still with me,
    with the. with a demonstration of creating these testing paired groups so and
    other disadvantages that I've created the groups. But there's no indication of
    who's from which group anymore. Well, I can only see my group here. but in your
    group you have. You're listed as Group One through 9. You're listed as one group
    from one through 9. So you don't know who's from which group. By this point you
    may know your group members. I hope a little bit. But so we we lose some information
    and combining groups this way, and it'd be nice to maybe have them available in
    a more. Have have them with more information. So I want to share something for
    CS. 4, 28 students. So I don't know how many of you are registered for those spring
    and summer classes. but we've noticed that there are 25 students registered in
    this July, August 4, 90 DG. But only 5 registered in the 4 90 A. P. Which is in
    May and June. So I just want to encourage any students who are interested in Hci
    in designing building interfaces to take the 4 90 A. P. The one in in May and
    June. getting experience building interface in May and June be a good tie into
    evaluating the interface in July, August 4, 90. DG. Any thoughts about that. 4,
    8, 4, 28 students. anyone taking? Dg. but not yet sure about Ap. No, I wasn't
    sharing anything. I was just reading an email message. So the spring summer one
    is about implementation. And this summer one is, pardon me, the spring one in
    Maine, June is about implementation, and the summer one is about evaluation. anyone.
    and DG. Now reconsidering. and not yet an ap. considering adding A. P. Well, I
    invite you to encourage and consider it all put something in the class discussion
    as well. Okay. So the quiz quiz question was about the video. So how many people
    were able to watch the video. So new thing I've noticed about Youtube, this didn't
    happen to me or but it's happened to me a couple times just recently is that Youtube
    inserts ads, not just at the beginning. the part way through the the video as
    well. And it's not clear whether they're stopping the video or not. it would seem
    that they would be stopping it. But it's not quite apparent. And I guess that's
    maybe a setting in Youtube. Now that you can monetize the videos? Or is that a.
    I don't know anyone do a Youtube have have experienced doing videos on Youtube.
    Yeah. So it's not so the facade of this grade free services starting to crack
    and peel a little bit, I think. Hmm! Well. I may have. I don't recall it happening
    to me until this week or last week. Perhaps. So. anyway. just an observation.
    So that video isn't new. But let's take a look at what there is for a new Zipcar
    website current line. So it looks like I might be in the Us. Would you like to
    update your location? I feel happy about that. I don't feel happy that it's I
    can't click on the dialog box. Let's first look at the cookies. We use cookies.
    so manage cookie settings. targeting cookies. No. so usually they have a few different
    categories there I can some of our functional cookies and performance cookies
    as well. So I've turned off what I can. So let's confirm my choices. Okay, so
    I've got the Canadian website. And it still shows me Boston. That's interesting.
    We'll meet some of our cars. That's let's see if we can find Mini must swell.
    I don't feel like I went where I thought I was going. Let's go back. Let's try
    that again. Search for a car. Okay? So I seem to. by not allowing the tracking
    cookies. I've seemed to have broken the website. Let's see if that helped at all.
    you know, I'm still in Boston. Let's try and search for a different city type
    in the address of the University. Oh, there it is! Let's make it a bit later.
    Actually, let's make it Friday. There was an option there, but I've clicked on
    it several times. and it didn't help. Okay, let's pick a place in Toronto. Oh,
    what's it? I don't know if this is really an address. Have a Nissan Centra named
    Shredder and a Nissan rogue named Mark. So for an hour with a car, it cost me
    1582. And let's see what else it was. So there's an option for university students.
    Oh, also faculty. Okay? So I noticed, anyway, the question from the video was
    about the car's name. The Austin Mini, named Muswell. who has a fully stocked
    fridge and loves it to entertain anyway. So it seems like even that video is old.
    He's still stuck. The the website hasn't changed that much since the test. And
    the video. So I thought, maybe we'll we'll see how well we can do with our paired
    groups for testing. Let's I'll make 9 breakout rooms. So then you enter the enter
    the room. correspond to your group number in the paired testing groups. Okay.
    I'll put that in the chat as well. So let me go back to your courses here so you
    can see where. Oh, that's not it. that's it. Okay. So if you find this link on
    your own, your courses, page. Then you'll see which group number you're in. So
    I will check on so possible make an initial contact to arrange your testing meeting.
    Okay, so I'll do the breakout rooms. Now. does that make sense any questions about
    it before I so open the breakout rooms? Okay? So the breakout rooms are open now.
    so please join the one that corresponds to your paired group for testing.
