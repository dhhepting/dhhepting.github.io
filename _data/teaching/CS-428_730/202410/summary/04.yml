- desc: Good morning
  persid: S00
- desc: in mourning. How's everyone today?
  persid: S01
- desc: Good
  persid: S02
- desc: doing good?
  persid: S03
- desc: Fantastic!
  persid: S00
- desc: Oh, that's great to hear. So I'm sorry about having to cancel the meeting
    on Tuesday. so I've I didn't give you the reason exactly, but my mum passed away
    on Monday morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: My condolences. Sorry to hear that.
  persid: S00
- desc: Thank you. She was almost 93. Her birthday is. would have been on January
    20 seventh. So it seems fitting that we're going to have memorial service for
    her that day. So did the quiz and did the quiz work. Okay, today.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yes, it did it and never had any issues.
  persid: S00
- desc: Good. Okay. so let me share my screen and we'll get going here. So I'll show
    you a few updates. I've done so. I've my office hours into the schedule. and the
    office link takes you to my zoom office. I'll try and be diligent about opening
    zoom at the start of my office hours at one Pm. If you. if you find that I'm not
    there. Send me a note. a course email, and I'll get that and will get connected.
    So here's my website. And I'm going to get things sorted out over the next couple
    days. But here we are as today. So there's a link for attendance. I have to set
    up the quiz for today for next meeting. and I'll update the link there. There
    should be a question mark after what you think of the assigned materials. So the
    first point. Actually, let me show you the yeah courses page before I get into
    this. So I've added some more links. and I think I've tested them all. So there's
    the UR. Course's student guide. There's the academic integrity Hub and the student
    wellness center. Then we have the announcements that Forum that only I can post
    to. And then here's the link back to my page for our floor. 4, 28, 7, 30, this
    semester. Here's a link to the syllabus. So today's schedule that goes to that
    page teaching slash today. here's the Zoom office link. And then class discussions
    and course email is anything missing. But let me know if it is. and I'll address
    it. Okay. Now, back to. I have to say it was interesting with Zoom today. I don't
    know what the what a change with the configuration! Maybe I quit Zoom in a certain
    way. But when I clicked on the link to start to start the meeting it it didn't
    recognize me as the host. but I could log in as the host, so that took me an extra
    little bit of time. I guess I had I been logged in to zoom, to begin with. it
    would have started the meeting without an itch. but because I wasn't logged in.
    I had to do that extra step. Okay? So I wanted to go through some examples. Well.
    here, let's let's talk of about. Let's let me bring up the. This is a page we
    looked at Last Day. So we have 10 heuristics that have stood the test of time.
    I think they were first in published in 90 94. So we have visibility system status.
    It's one thing to check match between system and real world user control and freedom
    consistency and standards. error prevention. recognition rather than recall flexibility
    and efficiency of use. Aesthetic, aesthetic and minimalist design help users recognize,
    diagnose and recover from errors. Open documentation so let's we can keep those
    in mind. As we look at some examples to date. So from the Interaction Design Foundation
    Encyclopedia. they have this definition of interaction design interaction design
    is about shaping digital things for people's use. So that so that means as designers
    were dealing with shaping things more than building things. And it's also it's
    also more about looking into the future is thinking about how things could be
    rather than how things are at present. So what if any thoughts about the Interaction
    Design Foundation Encyclopedia. Chapter one.
  persid: S01
- desc: I found it to be a good read
  persid: S00
- desc: A, that's good to hear. Okay. what about the A. Ted talk. then? Okay, let
    me.  I'm going to lunch.
  persid: S01
- desc: Poll, from the other day.
  persid: ???
- desc: and I'm going to create a new one as well. Let me see if I can do that. So
    this is funny. Maybe I should just share the screen with you. and maybe when you
    see what I have up here you won't think it's so funny, but I'm trying to create
    a new bull and quiz so. and big letters the top it says polls and quizzes. Then
    it says this page is no longer available. Go to surveys.
  persid: S01
- desc: Now.
  persid: ???
- desc: how do I turn off the annotation? Let's try that. Okay, got it surveys. So
    I want you to think about those heuristics as a guide, perhaps. but as you see
    me going through using this interface. think about if there's room for improvement.
    Oh. now I think I can do this. Polls and quizzes. Okay, now I'm oh. yes, simplified
    flow of polls and quizzes you can with with a simplified flow. You can organize
    your polls and quizzes better, and use them in your meetings or webinars. So in
    theory it's a better flow. But in practice I'm not sure. But shall we see what's
    new? All in one place? Have integrated library for all your created poles and
    quitters? Yeah, I notice that's a difference. And it's helpful. Okay, launch them.  okay,
    there we go. So now we'll launch the new or. okay. So we have 60 of you in class
    today. So three-quarters 78% have replied to the poor, so can the rest of you
    do that. I'll give you another minute. Let's say so. Any thoughts about the interface
    proposals and quizzes. So again about the chat. please don't send me a direct
    message. Write to everyone in the chat. otherwise I get so your comments are not
    going to be shared with everyone else. and then I'm if I'm writing, then I'm writing
    back to you that make sense. Hmm! So you don't see the poll for those who are
    having troubles. if you if you can see it. But you can't record your responses.
    Okay, so let me end the poll. Then. okay, so is that full result being shared?
  persid: S01
- desc: Yep, I can see it.
  persid: S00
- desc: Okay. So most people are at. So people with. first question is, how is your
    creative confidence? And the answers? The choices were high. So 32% of respondents
    said, Hi. medium. that was 56% low is 11% and nearly nonexistent. There's one
    respondent or 2%. So are you ready to touch the snake? Quote unquote? Yes, or
    60 was 60% of you. No, was 11%. Of you am not sure what kind of snake question
    mark. That was 30%, 30% of you. So would anyone like to explain the snake reference.
  persid: S01
- desc: I mean, I guess I could try to give it a shot.
  persid: S00
- desc: sure.
  persid: S01
- desc: Basically, I can't remember the man's name, but he did a test people who had
    phobias of snakes and more, unless he started off by getting people close to them
    through a window. Umhm, and then he would open a door and they'd become more comfortable.
    And then he would basically give him a glove, and at the end of it they would
    touch the snake and basically conquer their fears. Yeah.
  persid: S00
- desc: okay. so for the 60% of you who are ready to touch the snake. So it's about
    overcoming. you're aversion to creative creative activities or making creative
    choices in design. So I'll ask this question again later on. But so in design.
    So it's if we're looking at, designing an interface. It's not just a matter of
    doing whatever that the person want the the client wants. There's a great story
    in. Then I'll put a link to about. Well, actually, it was David Kelly. If the
    man from the the Ted Talk. and so he was explaining the design process. you know
    it said, suppose so. He's with Ideo, which is a big design firm. He's also with
    a design school. I want to say I'm not. I'm not sure where it's located. but it's
    a univers, well established and well known university in California. I'm going
    to say Stanford or Berkeley. Anyway, I'll figure that out. let you know. But he
    talked about. you know. Say, a client comes to him and says. II want you to design
    a new toaster. It needs more curly cues on the side. So. and he would say, Well,
    that might be true. But as designers, we're going to do our own investigation.
    and and we'll look at the history of bread crisping. you know, from Renaissance
    France to the space Shuttle and all the ones in between. and once you've done
    that, then we'll make a decision about what we think will be the best design for
    you. So it may be that will agree with your assessment that you need more acrylic
    use. But it may not be so. The design is a process. and the design design or engage
    in that process is shaping the interaction. Usually we're thinking about digital
    interfaces, but it could apply to non digital or physical interfaces as well.
    So that's the shaping part. So it's always better to have people engaged in the
    process. so that the users have buy-in and feel like their voices being heard.
    so they may not know exactly what they want to begin with. but if we can engage
    them in the conversation. then then the design will be better. and a way to engage
    them to do things that encourage them to make creative decisions or think creatively
    about what might be a good way to proceed. Does that make sense? Okay. so let's
    go back to the another screen. So I have a macbook, a new macbook air now. So
    I have a bigger screen than I used to have. but it still gets crowded and all
    of it. The managing the windows with zoom is a challenge. Sometimes it's an M
    2 chip. I like it a lot. Okay. okay, so we're back here. So I thought I was going
    to have that. This is a picture from my rental car. which I no longer have, because
    my regular. My vehicle's been camp was finished on Tuesday, so I got to pick it
    up. But here's here's a display for the tire pressure being low. so what I think
    I'll do is I'll just introduce these pictures that I have. and then I'm going
    to create some breakout groups and we can discuss them. or you can discuss them.
    And then let's try and have someone making notes. I can go into the wiki for your
    group discussions. Okay? And so it's a question to you also whether you want to.
    This is these are just groups. For in class activities do you want? We need to
    set up groups that will continue from day to day, from meeting to meeting. Or
    do you want me to just do random breakout rooms. anyway? Okay. so here's the first
    one. So it says, low tire pressure so tells me the pressure in kilopascals which
    I understand that it's a unit. what it is. but I don't know how to think about
    it in terms of psi. So how is how is that display for conveying information? That's
    the question I have. And could it be improved.
  persid: S01
- desc: Oh.
  persid: ???
- desc: I was, I thought if this one showed up, everything would show up but it it's
    not the case I'm gonna have to. I'll have to fix this. But in the meantime I'll
    show you the pictures. So these this is from my phone. I just wanted to point
    out. So my son is living in Latvia and working. He's a ballet dancer with the
    Latvian National Opera and Ballet Company. and so we're trying to get him home.
    And so looking at bereavement travel. So these are the first 2 screens on my phone.
    Basically, it says, the book bereavement travel step one. please contact us by
    phone. and then they'll need some documentation after the fact. So if I click
    on contact us by phone. I end up here the general contact us page. But if I do
    a search here. There's no phone numbers listed anywhere. And then here's the other
    one from London drugs. So this is the app on my phone again. So I'm a London drug.
    Ld extras fave. and I'm earning 15 points per dollar. So I don't know what that
    is in the cotton context. anyway. So this is what I see. And then I notice that
    really there's a little bit extra down there. The frequently asked questions is
    hidden below the fold. so to speak. Yeah. So just reacting to the comment in the
    chat. So I anyway, my feeling is, I don't know whether these 3 bullet points are
    helping me to understand how to use the app or not. Rewards are waiting. Redeem
    your points now. So if I go to the next screen, then. if I click on so I'm going
    to click on Umhm. so you can't see this on the screen. But I'm getting a menu
    on. Let me share the whole thing. See if that helps. See if you can see that.
    Do you see the menu bar on the left side of this screen?
  persid: S01
- desc: I just see the previous page that you had going.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah, okay. So I'll take a picture of this and share it. Okay? So I click
    on rewards and vouchers. So then I see that I can get a $5 reward voucher. or
    a $20 reward voucher. and the $25 is no, not available to me. but I can get a
    20% off purchase protection plan for 250. Excuse me, please. So the the process
    is to go to redeem a voucher, so it creates a voucher at the bottom. and then
    when I scan the card it comes, it so becomes available for redemption at the cash
    register. So it just seems that's it's not it. Not a super easy way to redeemed
    points, but maybe they don't like you don't want to make it too easy to redeem
    points. That's just my observation. anyway. before we run out of time here. I'm
    going to create those breakout rooms as promised. So we have 60 people. So let's
    say, we make 7 breakout rooms. So that's about 8 people in a breakout room. So
    you'd be assigned automatically. And what I want you to do is discuss. Since discuss
    the the dashboard. low tire pressure image that you can see for yourselves. and
    sit what's good and what's bad about it. Does that make sense? And you can think
    about the other examples I showed. But I can't get you to see those pictures right
    away. but I'll make them available soon after class that make sense what I'm asking
    you to do. Okay? So here we go. Okay. how did that go?
  persid: S01
- desc: I think it went well.
  persid: S00
- desc: good! Glad to hear it. So if you can. Anything you want to share from your
    conversations.
  persid: S01
- desc: Sure. I mean with our group, we kind of looked at the pros first. and what
    we came up with is, it's nice that it shows that you have a low tire pressure
    and which tire it is. It's a large and clear message that you have a low tire.
    Cons. It comes down to the Kpa. Everyone feels like it should default to psi.
    just because you have to do the conversion, or you have to go through your manual
    and check to see what the proper tire pressure is  we also came up with, it'd
    be kinda cool like. if it was a, if your tires were good, they would show green
    yellow would show that you have a slow leak. and then Red would show that you're
    below threshold.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah. So another way occurred to me a way to get around the the units of measure
    is just to indicate maybe a percentage or a way to communicate what the full tire
    would be. Maybe. Yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah. I mean if you look at every tire pressure gauge that you use to fill
    up your tire like 99% of them are in psi. you know. So when you're filling up
    your tire, you're constantly checking to make sure you hit that proper psi mark.
    So, in my opinion, if you had a percentage, you would have to fill. Go back to
    the car, see what the percentage is. Go back and kind of rinse. Repeat that that
    mechanism. I guess
  persid: S00
- desc: I'm about 99% sure that if you switch the car to using imperial instead of
    metric as a unit of measure, it would show up in Psi. To me. It's more of a problem
    of living in a world like in Canada, where we like mix metric and imperial so
    much that people know Imperial more than they might know metric, even though in
    Canada we're supposed to go by metric units of measure. So I actually like what
    Daryl said about having the percentage instead of just a unit of measure. Because
    if you are inflating the tires you should have like a separate gauge that you're
    using, you shouldn't be going off what the car tells you, because again, you don't
    know how accurate the sensor is on the car, because every time you know, you strap
    a new tire on. It's not like you're connecting a sensor that plugs directly into
    the tire and tells you that accurate psi reading. I would imagine it's just like,
    based on vibrations while spinning at certain speeds. It can tell how much pressure
    is in the tire. So it it's not a hundred percent accurate. I'd go by like a different
    measuring system, and not whatever the car is using to measure it. Anyways.
  persid: S05
- desc: Hmm!
  persid: S01
- desc: I think it should have a like a the range like 40 to 45 psi is, you are in
    good range.
  persid: S06
- desc: Yeah, I think there's some room for improvement. So
  persid: S01
- desc: it's definitely like a complicated thing, though, because the screen right
    now it shows just enough information to be helpful. and it could show more information.
    But as soon as you start, so showing more information, it becomes extremely cluttered,
    and you lose, like the good, the nice simplicity of it, and you lose like the
    entire ease of telling, you know which tire has the pressure like, which which
    tires low pressure and everything like that. So II think it's a pretty good compromise
    as long as it doesn't come up while you're driving. It comes up like once you've
    parked, or something. It's on. When I was driving, and I noticed
  persid: S05
- desc: that it started out breeding, 1, 68, and then by the time I finished driving.
    it was up to one 85, or something like that.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah, that's another problem with Canada in general, with our cold weather,
    I mean air condenses as you drive or as it sits. and as you drive it heats up,
    and then you get more pressure right? That's why they always state to be careful
    when filling tires in the wintertime. Because you could blow a tire.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yeah. it was 1977 when we switched to metric system. I remember that being
    in school. and that was a big deal then. And it's sad that we're still stuck.
    anyway. So if you can make some comments on the Wiki page for today, that would
    be great. I will let you know when I've got things updated on the web page and
    thank you for today. Have a good weekend. and we'll see you on Tuesday.
  persid: S01
- desc: You as well, Darryl, have a good one.
  persid: S00
- desc: Thanks. Take care, everyone. Oh, yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: Professor, I want to talk to you regarding something.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay. just stick around.
  persid: S01
- desc: Take care, Professor.
  persid: S08
- desc: Thanks. You, too.
  persid: S01
- desc: Take care, Professor.
  persid: S09
- desc: Thanks. Have a good day.
  persid: S01
- desc: Take care, bye.

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: me*
  persid: DHH
- desc: I link concept of parallel approach of problem definition and generating solutions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I liked the Ted Talk
  persid: DHH
- desc: the ted talk was pretty interesting
  persid: DHH
- desc: Ted talk was good as well
  persid: DHH
- desc: Really liked it
  persid: DHH
- desc: i liked the psychology side of it
  persid: DHH
- desc: Ted talk was good
  persid: DHH
- desc: It was nice I really liked it
  persid: DHH
- desc: I enjoyed the Ted Talk, the idea of basically inoculating yourself against
    fear of failure is a good approach.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I thought the ted talk was interesting!
  persid: DHH
- desc: The Ted Talk highlighted the need to understand your customer better in order
    to design successful product.

- desc: "\U0001F605"
  persid: DHH
- desc: "They are in the middle of a website update I guess \U0001F605"
  persid: DHH
- desc: Wouldn't one's creative confidence be based on how they are approached with
    a task? In a way where if you are demotivated then your creative confidence would
    be low but if you are motivated then you would feel that your creative confidence
    is high.
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: "Let\u2019s see what\u2019s new"
  persid: DHH
- desc: I can't access the poll
  persid: DHH
- desc: Seems clunky at best
  persid: DHH
- desc: Seems unfriendly to new users
  persid: DHH
- desc: I agree with Braden, clunky could of went about it a different way
  persid: DHH
- desc: Seems far more difficult to create a new poll then it should be
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think introducing any kind of new "improvement" to an audience can always
    be challenging, especially if they're used to the old interface.
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"Seems unfriendly to ...\" with \U0001F44D"
  persid: DHH
- desc: So in the pursuit of giving new information with popups and tours and tutorials,
    it can break up the flow of the process and frustrate users further.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It really helps to engage and a feeling to be there present and attentive
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't like that they initially had a tab for polls and quizzes but when
    you went there it asked you to traverse to the surveys tab. I see that as unintuitive
    and not user-friendly.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Quizzes and polls being moved to surveys is an interesting move, makes it
    a lot harder for anyone who was already using the feature. While it does point
    you in the right direction, it seems like a bit of a unnecessary move.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Who is having trouble accessing the poll?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Replying to "Who is having troubl..."
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: The snake refers to fears, and was used in an allegorical manner in the video
    to represent the fear of criticism in relation to creative endeavours.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It means to conquer our fear to do something creative.
  persid: DHH
- desc: '"Touching the snake" means overcoming your fears.'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Get out of comfort zone and try something you have fear of
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yep, makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep

- desc: I've always found the zoom windows to be annoying lol. Can't tell if that's
    a failure on my end or poor design.

- desc: What device did you own before the MacBook?
  persid: DHH
- desc: See I like that display... my car has the same thing however it doesn't tell
    you which tire is low
  persid: DHH
- desc: I like the tire feature as well
  persid: DHH
- desc: Reward programs usually have a tier list that you progress through as you
    spend, maybe that's one of the tiers
  persid: DHH
- desc: Nothing really translates your points to the amount of value they hold
  persid: DHH
- desc: Ah well it looks like they do on the next screen though.

  persid: DHH
- desc: It was fun
  persid: DHH
- desc: went good
  persid: DHH
- desc: pretty good
  persid: DHH
- desc: It was a nice discussion
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'About the tire pressure:'
  persid: DHH
- desc: The only big issue we found is that it uses kpa instead of psi. But overall
    it gives you the problem, the solution and which tire has the problem
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think if it shows all the tire pressure rather than the low tire pressure
    only then it would be a nice
  persid: DHH
- desc: For the full tire, you would probably have to read the sticker on your car,
    it usually lists the pressure in both units.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Percentage is a good idea for people to understand
  persid: DHH
- desc: In my car there are proprietary tire sensors that have to be attached and
    if you don't use the branded car mechanic they can't attach them for you so you
    don't get to know the stats on your tires LOL
  persid: DHH
- desc: very stupid and annoying
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah to much more information could easily get confusing
  persid: DHH
- desc: W answer
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Reacted to \"W answer\" with \u261D\uFE0F"
  persid: DHH
- desc: The sensor can read the pressure when the car is stationary, so I believe
    it is based on the actual pressure and not on the rotation of the tire.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Being able to cycle through the 4 tires to see the percentage would be nice
    and if theres something critical then it pops that one up
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it should also indicate how much the car can travel with that tire
    pressure or before the tire gets flat
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe they could add to the text which tyre is low
