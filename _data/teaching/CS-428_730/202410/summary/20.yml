- desc: Morning I was ever in doing. To be doesn't feel like spring has arrived yet,
    does it? We're not getting more snow yet. Knock on Will. But the temperature's
    like minus 8 this morning. Wasn't it emptied and got snow? Okay, that's good.
    They're still a bit further north than us. anyway.  Let me just get organized
    here for a second. Yes, Saskatchewan, but the weather here is always variable,
    but now, with the climate in its in its dysfunctional state. A dozen are getting
    much more. Variability didn't used to be that we'd have rain and melting in the
    middle of the winter. creating large skating rinks on sidewalks. anyway. Okay,
    let me share my screen to the okay. Ok, sorry. There were a couple people talking
    outside my office. Did anyone hear that? Okay? Well, I've shooed them away. There's
    a couple colleagues in the department. Okay? So in preparation for the last assignment
    which I will get on. I'll get the description of today.  so I have the proctor
    track onboard and quiz available now. So I think it seems like many of you have
    done already for other classes, but if you can go through it again here, so then
    we get be verified for the final exam. I let me show you the links that I have
    on the page now. so I haven't forgotten completely about the midterm so we'll
    I'll have it sorted neck by next week, and we can discuss it. Then. Okay. sorry
    for the delay. Here's the final exam information. So it's April 20, third. and
    we'll have it here online to the 5 PM. Regina time, which is U. Tc. Minus 600.
    And the nice nice thing about time the time in Regina is it doesn't change during
    the year some people might disagree whether that's a good thing or not. So I have
    the Proctor Track Student Manual. which is a link to your courses. Guide for students.
    a remote proctoring Fa. Q for students. And here's the proctor track onboarding
    quiz. so the assignment will be about comparing your experiences with using the
    Zoom breakout rooms for invigilating, and your experience with Proctor Track.
    Well, at least the onboarding quiz. If you haven't done Proctor track before has
    anyone had it experience with Proctor track before with the final exam. Okay,
    well. will discuss it in in more depth next week. When, after we talk about the
    midterm. or when we talk about the midterm. Okay. But I just wanted to draw your
    attention to view this additional material I've added to the your courses web
    page. So, depending on whether you're in 4, 28, or 7, 30, you should see one of
    these, too. Exams that are open  during the 2 to 5 timeframe on April 20. Third.
    Okay. okay. so will the file exam be openbook. So let let's talk about that next
    week. Think about how that worked for the midterm. And what? Yeah, sort of it'll
    be comprehensive. So less on the midterm. less on the stuff that was covered on
    the mid term more focus on the last half of the semester. Okay, so think about
    what you. What you would like to see is what you think. This would be a good final
    exam. and we'll talk about it next week. Okay. you can post sample question or
    suggestions for questions to our class discussion Forum. So I mentioned. Maybe
    you just joined us that we'll talk about the midterm next week. I'll have the
    grades done then. Okay. so chapter 7, I asked you to begin reading it. So it's
    it. So it's not meant to be read straight through. but to dip into it from here,
    and that here and there were Eve. So this is the I've taken. I've found a I've
    entered the links. the box on page 2, one on in the sixth edition. and I've debugged
    some of them or tried to debug some of them. Some of them aren't available any
    more, so I don't know when this list was checked. anyway. So I thought we'd watch
    a few of them and discuss them. Okay. you won't watch the whole thing because
    some of them are a couple hours long. So the first one. the list is Sketch pad.
    Does anyone heard about sketchpad before? It's from 1963? So is anyone heard of
    sketch pad? Or maybe. Do you recognize the name? Ivan Sutherland? Okay, let's
    take a look at this for for a few minutes. Okay, so let me go to theatre mode.
    Hello, I'm John Fitch, Mit science reporter. We're at Mit's Lincoln Laboratory
    in Lexington, Massachusetts, a major research organization which has played an
    important role in developing this nation's defense system since World War Ii.
    And although Lincoln Laboratory is perhaps best known for its work in radar and
    advanced warning systems, is also seen the beginning of the computer era, and
    has made many important contributions to it to learn about some of its recent
    work in improving the relationship between man and this important machine. We
    talked with Professor Stephen Coons, an associate professor of mechanical engineering
    at Mit and co-director of the Computer aided design project. Ron, we're going
    to show you man actually talking to a computer in a way far different than it's
    ever been possible to do before. Surely not with his voice. No, he's going to
    be talking graphically. He's going to be drawing. And the computer is going to
    understand his drawings. And the man will be using a language or graphical language
    that we call sketchpad. that started with Ivan Sutherland some years ago, when
    he was busy working on his doctoral degree. and you will see a designer effectively
    solving a problem step by step. and he will not at the outset know precisely what
    his problem is, nor will he know exactly how to solve it. but level by level,
    they will begin to investigate ideas and the computer and he will be in cooperation
    in the fullest cooperation in this work. Well, now, how does this differ from
    the way the computer has been used in the past, the soft phone, all the conventional
    way, the old way solving problems with the computer has been to understand the
    problem very, very well indeed, and, moreover, to know at the very outset just
    exactly what steps are necessary to solve the problem we saw the computer has
    been in a sinks nothing but a very elaborate, calculating machine. But now we're
    making computer be more like a almost like a human assistant, and the computer
    will will seem to have some intelligence. It doesn't really only the intelligence
    that we put in it, but it will seem to have intelligence in the old days. To solve
    a problem it was necessary to be have to write out in detail on a typewriter or
    in punch card form all of the steps, all of the ritual what it takes to solve
    a problem because it computer so literal mind and cause. It's very little minded,
    if you, for example, in the old days, made so much as one mistake of a comma in
    the wrong place or a decimal point that was omitted, the entire program would
    hang up and wouldn't run. But nowadays, if you make a mistake, you can correct
    it, as you'll see

- desc: "We met next with Mr. Timothy Johnson, of the design division of the Department\
    \ of Mechanical engineering and asked him to show us this computer and its sketchpad.\
    \ We're at the lab. This machine is a large computer. It was built by Lincoln\
    \ lab in 1,956 as a a research machine. How does this paper from a computer to\
    \ use to run your bank account or something like that. Well, it's designed specifically\
    \ for study of manual intervention where the man can command a computer to take\
    \ different courses of action while the program is running, since we have several\
    \ unusual pieces of input output equipment. Here we have a a, a scope, and now\
    \ these are unusual at the time. And push buttons, toggle switches. We have several\
    \ other related devices. This made it Tx. To apply candidate for the sketch bad\
    \ developments back in 1,961 and remain a program, this machine. So I would become\
    \ a coherent partner and graphics. So the man can communicate with the machine.\
    \ What do you actually go about communicating with a computer in the graphical\
    \ sense. Well, we are using oscilloscope here, which is much like a TV set, except\
    \ it's being driven by the computer. In order to get the information into the\
    \ computer, we have to draw somehow on this display, and we use the live panel\
    \ well in order to construct a meaningful engineering drawing. We have to have\
    \ several graphical manipulations. Ivan's Sutherlands programs can draw straight\
    \ lines and circles. So that's about what you do in the drafting equipment. Anyways.\
    \ in order to do this, we can position this right spot in the middle middle of\
    \ the closet. You notice that a desired rotation, and we press the button to command\
    \ the computer to draw a line. It will draw a line from this position where I\
    \ am now in any subsequent position of my life, and this is much like a rubber\
    \ band stuck in 2 pins. One is nailed on the the screen here and the other isn't\
    \ my life PIN. So I can position this anywhere I want. But now I lost tracking.\
    \ There. I've moved a pen too fast. and that's all. The computer stopped drawing\
    \ the line. Well, he noticed that bright dot or jump onto the line as they get\
    \ close to it. Well, the.in the center of the cross when you get close to the\
    \ line jumps over onto a crack. But why does it do that? It's much like a gravity\
    \ field at end point. It is even a higher gravity field. Allow us to position,\
    \ point exactly on the line, or in this case, exactly the end point. This allows\
    \ me to move my pen quite partially sloppy while I'm going and get a precision\
    \ drawing at the same time. So now I'm gonna draw a second line. third one. Now,\
    \ I don't know. Nate. pencil and paper drawing. All we have is this particular\
    \ picture, but the computer understands the geometry of the dawn. What do I mean?\
    \ I mean that if I point at this particular point and tell the computer to move\
    \ that point by and by, another push button command. they will move not only that\
    \ point, but all 3 lines are attached to it. and the delay between it's doing\
    \ what wanted to or is them. because computing all these changes. But that's correct.\
    \ Now, if I made a mistake, I could delete my mistake by pointing at the line\
    \ in question, for instance, and passing the appropriate button. It's gone now,\
    \ I mentioned before we could draw circles. Also. in order to do this, I must\
    \ first indicate the center of my circle. Let's choose to be here. and then I'll\
    \ move out to an initial radius. Let's say this point right here. and I press\
    \ the second button to start drawing the circle. Here's a circle. Let me reduce\
    \ the drawing size on the computer. So you see, as I move, the PIN is ignoring\
    \ the radial position. I've just gone off the smoke screen here. the radial position,\
    \ and only looking at its angular position. So I shouldn't be very sloppy as you\
    \ like it all the time. In other words, the computers supply the company so you\
    \ can see the first sketch of Pac-man. Anyone get that? Yeah? So I don't. Anyway,\
    \ there's another 12\_min of this video. We can come back to it. If there's interest,\
    \ let's go. Let's take a peek at the other ones. So Ivan Sutherland was a is a\
    \ big name in computer graphics. Yeah, it's so I don't know if it's I would say\
    \ trivial now. But it's much more commonplace. and the ideas are much more well\
    \ established. Dia.  okay, let's go to another one. So the dyneabook video that\
    \ they've listed in the text is not available. So here's a Google search for other\
    \ videos. So I'm just gonna play this. Well, that's about a minute. We can watch\
    \ this to give you, and a sense of what the Dyer book was. If you're interested,\
    \ you can look at some of the longer ones by trying different size of things.\
    \ To realize it should be really thin should be light."

    \ keyboard and all that stuff. So this is kind of the thing I used to hold up\
    \ back then, and what computers should be like kind of if you. If you could have\
    \ what you wanted, what should it be like? And my image here was the children\
    \ would be able to play collaboratively games on it, and especially games that\
    \ they could make themselves. and I wanted to be to for it, to be able to do all\
    \ the things you could do with a book, but be dynamic. Okay, so that gives you\
    \ a little taste of what don't go in there, they're having the  so does that dinobook\
    \ concept from 1968. Does that seem familiar? So here's a link to an the 1\_h\
    \ and 40\_min of the mother of all Demos. So this was done in 1 68 for a live\
    \ audience. So they're showing, I think this is in San Francisco. and they had\
    \ participant. Some of the people demonstrating were in Menlo Park at Stanford\
    \ Research Institute. And so it's about an hour and 40\_min long. So that's the\
    \ full one. But over here on the side is one that's 5\_min. It kind of gives you\
    \ a bit of an overview. So if you're interested, what we've been pursuing for\
    \ many years. If in your office you, as an intellectual worker. were supplied\
    \ with a computer display backed up by a computer that was alive for you all day\
    \ and was instantly responsible. responsive. Okay, every action you had, how much\
    \ value could you drive from that? Well, this basically characterizes what we've\
    \ been pursuing for many years in what we call the augmented Human Intellect Research\
    \ Center at Stanford Research Institute. We're going to try our best to show you\
    \ rather than tell you about this program. Okay, there's Donna Anderson Mineral\
    \ Park. And in a second we'll see the screen that he's working, and the way the\
    \ tracking spot moves in conjunction with movements at that mouse. I don't know\
    \ why we call it a mouse. Sometimes I apologize. It started that way. We never\
    \ to change it. This characterizes the way I could sit here and look at a blank\
    \ piece of paper. That's the way I start many projects. So with my system, that's\
    \ a good start. I'll sit here and say I'd like to load that in. So I'm putting\
    \ in an entity called a statement. and it was all of other entities above words.\
    \ if I make some mistakes, I can land up a little bit. So I have a statement with\
    \ some entities, words, and I can do some operations on these copy, or say that\
    \ word like copy after itself. Let's make more statements, and I'll say copy about\
    \ statement. Behold, I have another one copy that one another one. I can even\
    \ copy groups of statements. I can say after that one copy the group from there\
    \ to there. It does. So let me jump back to the head of the list, and I can do\
    \ things like begin to reorganize it a little bit while I say, after the man is,\
    \ it's more likely that I'll take the carrots there. so let me organize it by\
    \ saying,"

- desc: "This is generally providers also bananas. Fact, I could move it there. Oranges.\
    \ Also. I'm going to do something called jump on a link. and the link is something\
    \ that will go between files. So what it's going to do. It says I'm going to go\
    \ to your file name Cnr, so here's what I do with a picture drawing capability.\
    \ Here's a slight lamp if I start from work. And here's the group. I seem to have\
    \ to go to pick up all the materials, and that's my plan for getting home tonight.\
    \ but if I want to, I can say the library. What am I supposed to pick up there?\
    \ I can just point to that. you know I see overdue Brookson while there was a\
    \ statement there with that main one over. So on his display, he sees my text.\
    \ I'll execute it, sure enough it does. But what's that running around? Well,\
    \ he's looking my text. He'd like to have something to say about it. So we put\
    \ on a marker of tracking spot that he controls. So he's sitting in the Middle\
    \ Park looking at this text, and he can point to it. But we carefully reserved\
    \ for me the right to control and operate on this. So my bug is more powerful\
    \ than yours. Hold on. But we can have an argument. Yeah. that's a telephone fight.\
    \ So we set up now, audio coupling, and we're both looking at the same display,\
    \ and that'd be very handy to work. We can talk to each other in point, and maybe\
    \ later I can hand you the chalk on this blackboard like saying, Here, you control\
    \ it. But let's say this mode now, and add another feature that hardware wise\
    \ is available to the kind of display we have. I'd like to see you while I'm working\
    \ on it. We're going to go for a picture down in our laboratory in Menlo Park\
    \ and pipe it up. Come in the apartment. I don't. That's great. Now we're connected.\
    \ Audio. You can see my work. You can point Alex. I can see your face and we can\
    \ talk. So let's do some collaborate and a forthcoming involvement is this computer\
    \ network experimental network that's going to come into being in its first form\
    \ in about a year and end up sometime later with some 20 experimental computers\
    \ in a network which would be enough so that I could be running a system in Cambridge\
    \ over network and getting the same kind of response on a CRT, and it may be that\
    \ people there. and the next time we have a conference in Boston I'll try those\
    \ from there, and in that network we're going to try to develop a special service\
    \ to provide network information. Well, network patient for people, for the kind\
    \ of information that it takes to operate such a network? Who's got what services?\
    \ What protocol do I use to get there? Who's up today? And what was the user's\
    \ guide? What can I find a paper that describes this system. It so and so offers.\
    \ That's going to be a very interesting challenge for us to utilize our are tools\
    \ for organizing and retrieving information. So that's the 5\_min version of the\
    \ of the hour and 40\_min demonstration. So the comment was about how it's strange\
    \ to see people seeing the first demonstrations of technology that's that's become\
    \ commonplace for us now. And so, as Arthur C. Clarke is often quoted as saying,\
    \ any technology sufficiently advances, indistinguishable from magic. so that\
    \ this was very cutting-edge technology and 1968. But you notice the one shot\
    \ where they had the keyboard in the center. The keyboard wasn't being used, they\
    \ had. and for this right hand he had a mouse. and on the left hand an according\
    \ keyboard. That's that's what was used that's used by court reporters or stenographers.\
    \ So I don't. I don't. I've never tried to use one of those. I'm not sure. Yeah,\
    \ I I'll have to look into a bit more. I'll see if I can find some information\
    \ and share it with you. But if you think of the Gam's keystroke level model.\
    \ We don't have a a distinction for that kind of input device. because I would\
    \ say, because it's a little bit to to advance for most people to who are not\
    \ dedicated users to take the time to learn how to use that keyboard. That input\
    \ device. So that makes you think of the of the keyboard that we have the courty\
    \ keyboard layout. So how many people are touch typists? How many people know\
    \ what being a touch typeist is anyone. So that means being a touch. Typist says\
    \ you're not looking at the keys you have. You put your fingers in the home position\
    \ and you know how to reach them. reached the keys, and I remember my mom took\
    \ a typing class and she got me to go through the exercises. And so I am fairly\
    \ good of typing without looking at the keys. but some people. after years of\
    \ typing they still hunt and peck, so to speak. So the qwerty keyboard layout\
    \ was designed so that typing in English wouldn't. because the typewriter. an\
    \ early typewriter, had arms that would come up and strike the paper. strike a\
    \ ribbon with some ink, and then that that hat, that arm, would strike the ink\
    \ onto the paper. they would come up individually, and so qwerty was designed\
    \ so that common letters were. we're not so easy to type quickly together. So\
    \ it's kind of as a way to so to slow down the speed. Yeah, so II have suspicion\
    \ that the keyboard on my new macbook air is a little bit different than my old\
    \ macbook air. and I'm like the escape key is bigger is longer. and I'm not sure\
    \ about the variability of keyboards.  but there's a keyboard design called Dvorjac.\
    \ That's better organized for English for typing English words based on how how\
    \ to move here and and increasing the speed of typing. But then it's a question\
    \ of and learning that, and soot and switching between a Dvorjac and the Qwerty\
    \ keyboards. And so that adds a a lot of cognitive load. And so it used to be.\
    \ I haven't tried this for a while. You could set a the input keyboard to be different\
    \ layout. So you could. You can try a Dvorjac keyboard on the Mac and I I am not\
    \ sure about how to do that on windows or Linux. Anyway, they're interesting \
    \ options. So that make sense. Okay? So the next one. but that there, as described\
    \ in the textbook, is not available. But I found an alternate. So this is from\
    \ 1979. So this isn't. This is an actual demo. So in the sketchpad view, they're\
    \ talking about talking to computers. So here's actually someone talking to a\
    \ computer VHP. Is partnering with Saskatchewan to build one of the world's largest\
    \ and most sustainable potash mines in Canada, because the world needs more Canadian\
    \ potash to support sustainable food production. It's happening now at VHPA. Future\
    \ Resources company pay attention. So I've had Rhoda Mapo, the Caribbean value\
    \ with. I know that we are turned out. welcome to Satara. We and I'm waiting for\
    \ you. Pay attention. Do I add. create a red oil tanker where we have but a blue\
    \ cruise ship. where east of the Bahamas make a yellow sailboat. where north of\
    \ that create agreement later. there, east of the sailboat. create a magenta trawler.\
    \ where. where. with that where? Where move the freighter? Where? There. where\
    \ is Havana? West Andrell? Where is Jamaica? South central move the Brater? What\
    \ a land move. Claire Salado, Jamaica. move the trawler. Where east of the sailboat\
    \ move, that where? Where it was. copy that where there change, that to yellow.\
    \ what a land! Change! Copy the cruise ship what I'm adding to copy where Salvo\
    \ Havana make that small. make that what it was. Move back where there copy that.\
    \ What command? Copy Claire. south of Jamaica make that yellow make that blue.\
    \ Well, Chris looks like we're back here in the Caribbean. Sure done, Eric. Let's\
    \ put some ships in it. Let's give it a try. Pay attention. Dog had create a red\
    \ oil tanker where? Where? So speech generation is. Now let's take a look at the\
    \ video. That moaz posted. is it gonna make? Is it gonna play? Let's see. because\
    \ alright, we should be streaming. Live here. Hello, world! How's it going out\
    \ there? My name is Bliss, and I'm an engineer at Nerling. and I'd like to introduce\
    \ you to the first ever user of the Nerlink device. and I think you're my only\
    \ telekinetic friend that they have. Yeah, also, not many more of those out of\
    \ there. You want to introduce yourself. Yeah. My name is, Nolan are 49 years\
    \ old.  about 8 years ago I was in kind of a freak diving accident, and just located.\
    \ My, so I'm a complete so I'm paralyzed from below the shoulders no sensation\
    \ or movement below my level of injury. So below my shoulders. Yeah, that's what\
    \ about dogs all over the place? Yeah, that's Montana. The one want to buy screens.\
    \ Crazy? Tracy, come here. How's it going? Tracy? Yeah. alright. This is what\
    \ we've been. Yeah, just here for the dogs. Alright, yeah. So while he's been\
    \ introducing himself. let me just let the camera so you can see what no one's\
    \ been doing. You want to explain a little bit what's going on here? Yeah. So\
    \ I love playing chess. And so this is one of the things that you all have enable\
    \ me do something that I wasn't able to really do much the last few years is especially\
    \ not like this I have to use like a mouse, stick and stuff, but now it's all\
    \ it's all been done with my brain. If you often see the person on the screen.\
    \ That's that's all. Me all. It's pretty cool, huh? As you keep pause this on\
    \ just for the and that was also done with your brain? Yeah, so very cutting-edge\
    \ video. Thanks for sharing that. So there's that would fall under the brain-computer\
    \ interface type category that's in the book. So this, the multi-touch interface\
    \ design is the Youtube channel for Ted talks. And it's a 2,007 Ted Talk, by Jeff\
    \ Onm. So the So we've seen some examples of historical or pioneering video interfaces.\
    \ Here is a vision of the future from from the past. Here are a few visions of\
    \ the future from the past. The first one is 87. So you think you know wigs? Do\

    \ challenging Jill projection and amount of carbon dioxide being released to the\
    \ atmosphere through deforestation. I'd like to recheck his figures. Here's the\
    \ rate of deforestation you predicted. And what happened? Hmm! He was really off.\
    \ Give me the University Research network show only universities with geography\
    \ notes for Brazil. probably the last 30 years at this location one month intervals.\
    \ Excuse me. Jill. Gilbert is calling back. Great! Put it through. Hi, Mike, what's\
    \ up, Jill? Thanks for getting back to me. Well, I guess that new grant of yours\
    \ hasn't dampened your literary abilities. Rumor has it that you just put out\
    \ the definitive article on deforestation. Is this one of your typical last minute\
    \ panics for lecture material? No, no, no, no, that's not until 4 15. Well, it's\
    \ about the effects that reducing the size of the Amazon rainforest can have outside\
    \ of Brazil. I was wondering. it's not really necessary. But yes, it would be\
    \ great if you were available to make a few comments. Nothing formal. After my\
    \ talk you would come up on the big screen. discuss your article, and then answer\
    \ some questions from the class, and bail you out again. Well, I think I could\
    \ squeeze that in. You know I have a simulation that shows the spread of the Sahara\
    \ over the last 20 years. Here, let me show you nice, very nice. I've got some\
    \ map area during the same time. Let's put these together. Great. I'd like to\
    \ have a copy of that for myself. We'll have these if we bring down the logging\
    \ rate to a hundred 1,000 acres per year. Interesting! I could never use this.\
    \ Thanks for your time, Joe. I really appreciate it. No problem. But next time\
    \ I'm in Berkeley. You're buying the dinner. you know. Right? Yeah, 4, 15. Bye\
    \ bye. while you were busy, your mother called again to remind you to pick up\
    \ the birthday cake. Fine! Fine this article before I go. Now, thinking. Okay,\
    \ I'm going to lunch now, if Kathy call teller I'll be there at 20'clock. Also\
    \ find out if I can set up a meeting tomorrow, morning, if doublet. enjoy your\
    \ lunch  Hello, professor Bradford, is away, at the moment. Would you like to\
    \ leave a message, Michael? This is your mother. I know that you're there. I'm\
    \ just calling to remind you any thoughts about that one that seems a bit more\
    \ seems like a fairly accurate prediction in some ways. although the display is\
    \ still quite low resolution. And I was just thinking about the example they're\
    \ using with the deforestation in the Amazon. I wonder how if we could do the\
    \ the analysis? They yes, it helped. It helps when we can just relax scriptwriters\
    \ to create the dialogue instead of algorithms like Siri and so forth. So there's\
    \ also HP. Cooltown. And there's in a short video from Intel 2,012. But I thought,\
    \ maybe we'll skip to the Cmu on. That's the most recent. I realized I was. I\
    \ was skipping over videos instead of ads. You know what? I never thought I'd\
    \ love planning our group trip this much. The phone is there are over a hundred\
    \ 1 million phones that can tell. If you are using your knuckle or finger to touch\
    \ the screen as well as whether you are lifting the device to your ear. They are\
    \ examples of projects that started here at the future Interfaces Group lab at\
    \ Carnegie Mellon University, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The lab has been around\
    \ since 2,014, and counts Google Intel and Qualcomm among its sponsors. Every\
    \ year they develop hundreds of speculative ideas, all to do with how we communicate\
    \ with machines beyond the mode of keyboard, touch, screen, mouse, or even voice.\
    \ We came here to see some of their latest ideas, and what they might have to\
    \ say about the future of human computer interaction. I came to see me as faculty\
    \ about 5 years ago and founded the Future Interfaces Group, and they set up shop\
    \ in this building a little bit off campus. So we have lots of space to build\
    \ crazy prototypes and put things together. I wanted to build on my Phd thesis\
    \ research, which was looking at how to use the human body as a like an interactive\
    \ computing service. So we extended all of those themes. And obviously, I took\
    \ on master students and undergraduates and Phd student researchers to extend\
    \ that vision and help them sort of explore new frontiers in human computer interaction.\
    \ A grand vision that the whole lab is, has bought into is the notion of having\
    \ intelligent environments. You know right now, if you have a Google home or an\
    \ Alexa, one of these smart assistants sitting on your kitchen countertop. It's\
    \ totally oblivious to what's going on around, and that's true as your small watch,\
    \ and that's true of your smartphone. We want to make them truly assistive. and\
    \ they can fill in a lot of context like a good human system, would be able to\
    \ do. They need to have that awareness like when humans communicate. There's these\
    \ verbal and non verbal queues that we use like, you know, gaze and gesture, and\
    \ and all these different things to enrich that conversation in human computer\
    \ interaction. You don't really have that. A lot of my current work is all about\
    \ increasing implicit input bandwidth. So what I mean by that is increasing the\
    \ ability for these devices to have contextual understanding about what's happening\
    \ around them. So a a good example of this is up sounds. We have this project\
    \ called you the acoustics that listens to the environment and tries to guess\
    \ what's going on. If I teleported you into my kitchen, but I blindfolded you,\
    \ and I started blending something or chopping vegetables, you'd be able to know\
    \ that Chris is chopping vegetables, or running the blender, or turning on a stove\
    \ or running the microwave. And so we just asked ourselves, well, if sound is\
    \ is so distinctive that humans can do it. Can we not train computers to use the\
    \ microphones that almost all of them have? You know whether it's a smart speaker\
    \ or even a smart, give all these sensors that other people have created, that\
    \ are at your disposal, and questions. How do you put them together to do this\
    \ in a low cost and practical way. We have 12 messages sending it 12\_min. I think,\
    \ of smart watches is like really capable computers. It's they should be able\
    \ to almost like transform the hand into like an arm. 2 as opposed to just extensions\
    \ of the phone, typically accelerometers in the watch around a hundred hertz.\
    \ So here what we did is we overclock? The accelerometer on the watch so that\
    \ it becomes high speed. So you can see here. When I interact with this copy grinder.\
    \ I could actually see the micro vibrations that are propagating from my hand\
    \ to the watch. You can't see that effect from the 100 Hertz accelerometer, because\
    \ it's 2 force the vibrations when I tap here and when I tap here, actually quite\
    \ different. So I can basically transform this area around the watch into like\
    \ an input platform. You could also combine this with the motion data. So when\
    \ I like Snap, I can basically either snap to turn on the lights. Then I can do\
    \ this gesture and then twist you know, adjust the lighting in that house, and\
    \ then I can do like a flat gesture to turn on the TV and do like these types\
    \ of gestures to navigate up and down. These are only a few of the hundreds of\
    \ ideas that pop up at the lab every year. A couple of them turn into real start,\
    \ ups. One of them is Kikso, which is behind the touchscreen technology we saw\
    \ at the beginning. Another newer one is a computer vision start up called census.\
    \ one of the technologies that we did for smart environments was a camera based\
    \ approach in a lot of settings like in restaurants or libraries or airports,\
    \ or even out in the street. There's a lot of cameras these days, and and what\
    \ we ask, you know, could we turn these into essential fees? So you don't have\
    \ to have someone in the back room looking at 50 screens. But can we smell action\
    \ wise? And that's what we did in Zeners. Here's an example how we can go make\
    \ a question. So we have a camera. It's actually right above us. You can see us\
    \ here right now. This updates, you know, once every 30\_s or once every minute.\
    \ So the first thing you do is we select a region of interest in this case. these\
    \ 2 servers. It's gonna be a let's say how many you know Lily is? Gonna ask many\
    \ people are."
  persid: S00
- desc: That's it.
  persid: ???
- desc: And right not saying there's 3 people here, and we're not as limited to these
    sofas, I could ask, Is there a laptop or phones on this table? Is there food on
    this table? Anything you can ask? You could do it so like, I think, though, the
    model of the company kind of is, if you can see it, we can sense it. So we're
    doing a real time parking pilot right now with the city. And and what we're using
    is existing cameras along a stretch to basic count cars. So we can use that as
    a real time model, potentially like real time parking. But also this help, people
    find parking spots if you can direct them to adjacent parking to be much more
    efficient, reduce congestion, air pollution, and so on. Deploying that sort of
    technology. City scale requires a huge capital investment at the end, as a number
    doesn't matter if it's produced by a video camera or by physical sensors in the
    pavement. So in order for technology to be adopted downstream past the research
    phase into the engineering and commercialization phase is they have to be practical.
    Feasibility is obviously critical. We like to tackle problems that we know we
    can make progress on, and then we'll be balanced. That with this impact and value.
    the research is undoubtedly exciting. But what else happens when a security camera
    doesn't just see, but understands any technology can be misused. What happens
    to an idea after it leaves the lab. It is a gray area sort of like cars. You'll
    never gonna make the 100% safe car. But that doesn't mean we should eliminate
    all cars. And we should think about that for technology that no technology is
    ever going to be 100% secure or 100% privacy for serving. And so we always try
    to think about how to make these technologies that make the right trade off. We
    have a vision of how they're gonna exist. We can think about in our mind. All
    this would be so cool if I had this in my kitchen. But we're too close to that
    domain. We think everything is cool. All of the technologies that we build are
    put in front of users, and if you can get people to buy into the vision, then
    maybe they'll accept that. Oh, but there's a microphone on this thing that could
    be listening to me in my kitchen. If you make that value proposition right, they'll
    accept it. If you get that value proposition wrong, then it will just fall down
    and it won't be adopted. Know what hut's different? 50% off pizza hut favorite.
    So what do you think about the the Cmu stuff. So we have, well. I just yeah. So
    it's an interesting comparison safety of a car. I'm just gonna play a minute or
    2 of this cool town video, because I think it's just give you a taste of it. There's
    this place called Cooltown today. This is from 2,000 sciences, engineers and other
    researchers at HP. Lamb. It's a vision of a world where every body and every thing
    is connected wirelessly through the world. Wide web and people, places, and even
    objects have websites. beacons, beam out their web addresses. People connect to
    a wide variety of smart, wireless information, appliances that can know who you
    are where you are and what's going on around war. And it all comes together to
    provide services people need when and where they need, especially when they move.
    Play voicemails. Message one this day is not delete. Message 2. Hello, Mr. Carlson.
    Your reservation request for stop delete. Message 3. Yeah, Terry. That meeting
    in 4 is moved up to do. Call me as soon as you. Parkland recommends immediate
    service. Oh, no, my name is. they're only in your narrow service station. Senior
    Norm for one mile and rapidly, virtually proceed 2 miles to adult surface station.
    Hi, I'm Mary Carlson.  yes. car track alerted us. You're on your way. We've got
    your paperwork ready to go. We'll just sign right here. Great! I guess. All I
    need now is a cab contract has arranged for a cab pick you up, Mr. Carlson. I
    guess all I need now is a million dollars. Can't blame the guy for trying right
    new found technology will transform how we conduct business, think Morse, the
    presentation's almost ready. So there are a few issues with that. Maybe having
    a heads up. Display is not. And the best way to keep people's attention on the
    road. But then, again, neither's having a big screen in the middle of the dashboard.
    Anyway, we're out of time for to day. So keep you can dig into Chapter 7 a bit
    more. maybe focus on those interfaces that we've interface types that we saw today.
    And that's it. Have a great weekend. Take care and see you on Tuesday.
  persid: S00
- desc: Perfect. Have a good weekend there, I'll see you Tuesday.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, thanks. Bye.
  persid: S00
- desc: Hi, broccolis love.
  persid: S03
- desc: Hello.
  persid: S00
- desc: I have a question about the project.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S00
- desc: okay, so can you elaborate more about this? Then?
  persid: S03
- desc: Sure.
  persid: S00
- desc: okay. And this one I have. I didn't quite clear about this.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay, let me bring up the
  persid: S00
- desc: so is that for the next part of the project, yes, Nesba.
  persid: S03
- desc: hey? So so I want you to think about 2 different metaphors for what I want
    you to create, 2 interfaces, 2 sketches of interfaces. low fidelity, pencil and
    paper. So no, no code behind them. And I want you to do an interface based on
    2 different metaphors. So whatever you're you picked in the first part. say. say
    that this is like. or may maybe think that the metaphor there is a metaphor, a
    bit of a metaphor, or a conflict. If it's conflicting, conflicting. If it's not
    clear it's not helping users you to understand how to use the feature. So maybe
    one of the metaphors is so yeah, so there's a question about weather. I have to
    use Pen's pencil and paper or use a graphics program. So you can do a graphics.
    You can create a document in Powerpoint or some other drawing program. But no,
    there's no coating involved, so don't. Don't go so far as to write some code to
    make the buttons work, or something like that. Just sketch the interface. Okay?
    All right. So we take, we want 2 metaphors. So. however. so say, there's a metaphor
    that isn't fully developed. That's in the present interface it for the activity
    you've selected. and then think of another way to say the this activity or performing
    this activity is like using blank. The way we've talked about online shopping
    is like getting a cart. When you go into a a store or a basket. go through the
    aisles, pick out what you want and quoted trackout. So that's a metaphor. That's
    not. It's not precise. Maybe we're not making a exact comparison between online
    shopping and going to a bricks and mortar store. But it helps people to understand
    what that is so thinking about. If we have different interface types or interaction
    types to think if we have a direction, if we can drag student names from one place
    to another. would that create a different metaphor, for example? So if the way
    that we can interact with to display. Does that give us access to some? Are there
    ways to to interact? And maybe even different metaphors that would inform the
    interface design. Does that make sense?
  persid: S00
- desc: I'm not quite sure. So you mean, we first, we have to provide 2 meter for
    2, 2, meter 4 for 2 problem, right? No. Same problem. the same programs.
  persid: S03
- desc: So what you submitted on Tuesday. that should be, yeah, if focused on one
    aspect of
  persid: S00
- desc: okay
  persid: S03
- desc: of have groups in New York courses.
  persid: S00
- desc: Hmm. so yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: and once you think about 2 different metaphors. So like the metaphor for online
    shopping is one thing. and maybe online shopping is like maybe going through and
    checking off a list. So maybe you have a list. the shopping list, and you're trying
    to find the items in the list. So is this, but going through the list, not not
    using the basket, but just thinking about getting your items on your list set.
    So the 2 different metaphors. So maybe the metaphors. If you think about the different
    ways to interact with it. different interface types. there are different interaction
    styles. There's the there's the way that you you can. You interact with the display
    information possessed? Give you ideas about the metaphors and the interfaces you
    would design for them to to deal with the
  persid: S00
- desc: So we have to create. 2 2 meter falls and and the integration type interface
    type based on the same program from the project. Where? Right?
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah? So from the understand. you've identified an aspect of the group's interface
    or the group's capability in your courses. And so now you want to focus on that
    activity and say. performing this activity is like. and then you fill in the blank
    for that.
  persid: S00
- desc: Do you specify any? How many interface time we have to do? Can we have? Can
    we only need to do 2 in the fifth dice, same as metaphor.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah. So I want you to do a a low fidelity prototype. a sketch with pencil
    and paper that you scan in, or, if you use a drawing programme to sketch what
    the interface would look like. As you complete that activity. So I want you to
    do a low fidelity prototype for each of the 2 metaphors. So I want you to pick
    2 different metaphors and then do an interface prototype for each. So so you're
    just doing one interface prototype, low fidelity, interface, prototype for each
    metaphor. So if you think about again on line shopping being like going to a Brix
    and mortar store. then what are the ways? You can encourage the user to see that
    metaphor and organize their plans around it. Does that make sense?
  persid: S00
- desc: And yeah provision?
  persid: S03
- desc: Hello, sir, this is Rushi. I also have one question I just want to clarify,
    as you have given the example of the online shopping problem. Right? So if we
    take it as let's take it as a problem. So that's one problem. And for that problem,
    we have to choose 2 different metaphors for the that same one problem. And after
    choosing the 2 metaphors, we have 2 design, 2 different optional interface for
    the same problem. Right?
  persid: S04
- desc: Yeah. So the problem that you've identified is an aspect of the groups. capability
    or interface in your courses.
  persid: S00
- desc: Okay, so, for example, if we choose any particular problem from the group
    interface. So for that, we have to choose 2 different meta course. And for it's
    for the same problem, we have to work on a 2 different prototypes. Right? The
    optional one.
  persid: S04
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S00
- desc: okay. So we cannot choose 2 different problems and make one metaphor each.
  persid: S04
- desc: No same problem.
  persid: S00
- desc: Okay? Sure. Sure. So got it. Yes, sir. Thanks, Professor.
  persid: S04
- desc: you're welcome. Okay.
  persid: S00
- desc: yes, sir, pretty clear.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay. okay, I'll say goodbye. Now take care. Have a good weekend. and let
    me know if you have more questions.
  persid: S00
- desc: Sure, sir. Thank you so much for have a good day.
  persid: S03
- desc: Thanks, Youtube.
  persid: S00
- desc: Bye, bye, thank you, sir.

  persid: DHH

    nonetheless to make sure my fingers are landing on the right keys
  persid: DHH

    sized keyboards
  persid: DHH
- desc: QWERTY doesn't help much when the keys are smaller/bigger and spaced differently
    than I'm used to
  persid: DHH
- desc: Getting used to the tactile difference between keyboards is so annoying. My
    laptop has a more squished keyboard than my desktop so I feel like I have to smush
    my fingers closer together to type.
  persid: DHH
