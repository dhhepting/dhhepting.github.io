Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: "Good morning. So is there any questions about the questions I am asking in\
    \ the poll? So 3 people haven't responded yet. so I'll give you another few seconds\
    \ here. Well, I guess people are coming in still. so maybe we'll leave it open\
    \ for a little while. So a couple things to report about zoom is that even when\
    \ I'm so, when I have the zoom open for my office hours. it doesn't give me the.\
    \ There's no dialogue box to say, Are you still? Are you still there? It just\
    \ sense. It just tells me my zoom room was closed after 40\_min of inactivity.\
    \ So that's not so great. I think so. The other thing I notice is when I have\
    \ my zoom office open and I have my microphone on so that I can hear audio. It\
    \ doesn't. doesn't automatically tell me when people are entering the waiting\
    \ room. I thought I had a doorbell set, but I must have turned it off somewhere.\
    \ Okay, so let me end the poll and we can. I'll share it and we can talk about\
    \ it. I realized I should have asked one more question, so I'll make another poll\
    \ for that. See how quickly I can do that. I bet I can't do it until I let's see.\
    \ Is that still being shared? Can you still see the results? Okay, cause I had\
    \ to. I had to go away from the display to make another quiz. So anyway.  okay,\
    \ I can't have the second pull open while I'm sharing the first. Okay? So any\
    \ thoughts about broadcast message. may I stop the stop sharing, so I can start\
    \ the other one. So that was the first time on Tuesday that there jeez it was\
    \ the first time that I I've individualated an exam using breakout rooms. I'm\
    \ curious. Well. I didn't ask this and pull, but and that says there's 2 questions,\
    \ but you can tell there's not really a second question. There is just one. And\
    \ I'm surprised. That choice one and question 2 is slightly ahead. Well, it's\
    \ it's it's got a substantial lead, I think. significant lead. Wait for another\
    \ few minutes to see if other people are going to reply. We have about 78% of\
    \ participants participating in the in this poll. Okay, let's end it. And we'll\
    \ talk about it. So only 5 of 36 saw the email when it arrived. Yeah, okay. So\
    \ we had a bit of an issue before the exam. And so I just okay. So you notice\
    \ the timer changed when I had with the cutoff time at at one Pm. Instead of 1245.\
    \ So that was helpful. So what I realized. So I apologize for causing stress for\
    \ people. I tried very hard to get the instructions right. But then I realized.\
    \ after I had opened the meeting. that I had not made the exams visible. so I\
    \ had to do something there. but I didn't leave the meeting, so I was getting\
    \ help requests and trying to send broadcast messages. and then I finally left\
    \ the meeting for a minute to get that sorted out, and then then I hope it was\
    \ fairly smooth sailing from there. Okay. we'll talk. We'll talk about the midterm\
    \ next week. and I just wanted I wanted to talk about that one issue, about communication,\
    \ that getting the broadcast messages in having a way to communicate to everybody.\
    \ So I'm I'm not clear whether this is a feature that zoom markets or not. Anyway.\
    \ let's talk about. So I if you've noticed, I've got some the project details\
    \ on the website. Oh, I didn't do that. I didn't update. There's bit of information\
    \ on the website. There'll be more in a second. Okay. so I don't have all the\
    \ assignments here. But the first part of the project has a description on the\
    \ website. So I've spaced the due dates about 10 days apart. So I know this is\
    \ a there's other things going on at the end of the semester. so I propose that\
    \ some flexibility for the due dates. So I've made them the fifteenth of March.\
    \ the 20 fifth of March and the fifth of April. I'm not sharing my screen. Sorry.\
    \ Okay. so understand your project. So they understand. explore and materialize\
    \ phases of that design thinking process from the Nielsen Norman group that we\
    \ talked about recently. So we'll we'll do a targeted version or a light version\
    \ of that over 3 asant installments, 3 pieces. So I want Egypt. Use the experiment\
    \ with your courses, course. of course and look at a single aspect of the groups\
    \ within moodle or yeahr courses. So we'll look at some examples of that again\
    \ in a minute. So remember, just to choose one use of or interface to groups.\
    \ you will find groups under the participants menu on the main course page and\
    \ under and under participants. You'll find selections for groups, groupings and\
    \ overview. So there occur in the assignment setting assignment setting page and\
    \ on the submission page for assignments in the group members resource. That's\
    \ what we've used on the your courses page in the enrolled users list. That's\
    \ also under participants. And it's not an exhaustive list. I think so. I will\
    \ be happy to provide stories about using groups in your courses. You may also\
    \ check moodle documentation and moodle forms for information. You might identify\
    \ issues with consistency, efficiency, or missing functionality to name cannot\
    \ make an exclusive, exhaustive list. So here we are the understand all right.\
    \ So your group will describe a sufficient detail to be related. relatable in\
    \ activity and a user wanting to complete that activity. So each member of your\
    \ group will create an empathy map for that activity for that user. So then, as\
    \ a group, identify with all the members in your group, identify specific aspects\
    \ of the current interface. Cause problems for the user and look to examine the\
    \ roots of those problems identify would ever use. These may be unmet. Remember\
    \ that this stage is concerned with understanding the opportunities for redesign.\
    \ Your selected aspect of groups of the newer courses don't provide solutions\
    \ or fixes right now. that'll come in the next piece that seem okay. Okay, so\
    \ there should be a a link shown here. So I'm going to edit the settings. So I've\
    \ made that link. But I have to make sure that Austin says display description\
    \ on page. So groups are mentioned in the group submission settings. So the student,\
    \ you'll submit in groups. require a group to make submission. Yes. don't require\
    \ all group members to submit. No grouping for student groups project. So that's\
    \ set up. But there's also groups here. and this may be a little confusing. add\
    \ group grouping access restriction. So if I say, add a group access. add a grouping\
    \ access restriction here. click on it, then then it's not clear what happens\
    \ if this isn't open the the feedback and this is not great. and if it's not open,\
    \ you don't realize that it. Something's been added here. I can click on this\
    \ again to remove it. So let's save that and return to course. So think of for\
    \ the explorer part. Then we want to think about metaphors that would help to\
    \ help users understand activities. the kinds of types of interaction that would\
    \ best support the activities and and whether different interaction types suggest\
    \ alternative design insights or options. So we went. So think of 2 different\
    \ metaphors. and design an interface for each of the metaphors that you choose.\
    \ So for both interfaces create a low fidelity prototype and write. A scenario\
    \ includes the detail of the information presented and interaction undertaken.\
    \ So analyze your scenario for positive and negative aspects. then include your\
    \ findings. So setting up a group is like or creating a group for assignments\
    \ is like assigning a marker to a group is like. and so on. So think about 2 different\
    \ ways to think about what it might be like, 2 different ways to conceptualize.\
    \ but activity, so that the user and make sense of it. So blue fidelity, prototypes.\
    \ paper and pencil. Well. I made a mistake there. I only Yasha, the 4 things should\
    \ be worth 2 marks each. So together with your in your group, you create 2 sketches\
    \ and 2 scenarios that describe how it's used. And then what are the positives\
    \ and negatives you can see in your sketches? I'll fix that up. Okay, let me go\
    \ over this last part of the project. So. and then I'll talk about metaphors so\
    \ based on your designs, test and refine. So so I want you to do a bit of testing.\
    \ So divide your group evenly into 2 into 2 subgroups. There's only one group\
    \ of 3. So everybody else is gonna have 2 2 subgroups with 2 each. So you have\
    \ 2 interfaces, so each subgroup of test, one will conduct one test with one of\
    \ your 2 low fidelity interface prototypes. so that you have both of your low\
    \ fidelity prototypes tested. Use your courses to coordinate a subgroup on it.\
    \ The different project group focusing on a different aspect of your courses.\
    \ Each subgroup should run a test and be the subject for the other's test. So\
    \ what I mean is so for 17 of the 18 groups we'll have 2 pairs in each group.\
    \ So one pair from Roger Group one, let's say. coordinates with another with a\
    \ pair from Project Group 2, and then the coordinate, and one does a test project\
    \ the subgroup from Project Group one have. I'm mindful of saying, group every\
    \ 2\_s here the subgroup from Project Group one test the interface with the subgroup\
    \ from Project Group 2. So the people in the subgroup from Project Group 2 act\
    \ as participants and then the switch roll. So Project Group 2 subgroup is testing\
    \ their interface. either A or B with the subgroup from Project Group one acting\
    \ as participants. We can discuss that in a bit more detail as as you have experience\
    \ with it. So we'll talk about testing and having a script. So you I'm asking\
    \ for a scrip that you'll so the scripted materials. So that's 2 marks. data and\
    \ notes from test sessions. So there'll be 2 sets of data and notes. and then\
    \ 4 marks. So based on your tests. together with your group members. decide what\
    \ would be your next iteration based on your interface? A and B, so that can come\
    \ from the the tests, but also from year own experience and insights about and\
    \ thinking about the interfaces, so so that I didn't say this. So a sketch of\
    \ the single interface that combines the best ideas from your 2 low fidelity prototypes\
    \ and any other sources. Okay, so so what I think about that, maybe after we decide\
    \ on after you decide on which aspect of the group's interface you're going to\
    \ focus on. Then we can identify groups to work with. So maybe to make it simpler.\
    \ because there's 2 subgroups in each project group. and there's one there's going\
    \ to be one subgroup with one person in it. Only I'm sorry for to single that\
    \ person out. I don't know who it will be. but based on the aspect of your courses.\
    \ Group interface that you choose to work on. We'll try and pair up the groups\
    \ so that you're not dealing with the same aspect. the same aspect of the interface.\
    \ So you're bringing bringing a bit of some fresher eyes to the problem. The other\
    \ group is tackling. so if I pair the groups. then the subgroups one subgroup\
    \ with 2 interface. A and the other subgroup will do interface B, and they'll\
    \ test it with the subgroup from the other, from the paired sub project group.\
    \ and then switch. So I hope that I'm gonna figure out a way to to write this\
    \ out a bit more clearly. Okay, so based on what you choose to do in the first\
    \ part of the project will make a will. Set up some pairings of the project groups\
    \ for the testing phase. So then you can. We'll work with that other group to\
    \ evaluate your low fidelity prototypes. Does that make sense? Okay? So metaphors.\
    \ So have I told, I think I feel like I've told you the story about my experience\
    \ with Twitter some years ago. and I didn't understand. I guess the the metaphor.\
    \ the mental model that I developed from my experience was based on email. So\
    \ I was sending the same tweet to different people. I was mentioning where I sent\
    \ like send naming people in the Tweet. So now that Twitter is called X. What\
    \ do you call messages. do you say? X's just curious. This is probably a sign\
    \ that I'm not meant to use Twitter, or what was formerly known as Twitter. Anyway.\
    \ I had. I had an incorrect model. I was thinking about email. So I was sending\
    \ tweets to people. and before long my account was disabled. because it seemed\
    \ like I was sending spam to Twitter. That's what Twitter detected my pattern\
    \ of tweets to be so posting on X, where Twitter is like. it's like something\
    \ else. It's not email. So how would you describe? So are any ideas about? So\
    \ how would you describe Twitter, or for what was formerly known as Twitter? If\
    \ you say to me. Darryl, it's not like email, it's like. and how would you film\
    \ that blank. Would anyone like to take a stab at it? Okay, so we have a cesspool\
    \ as a metaphor for Twitter. So that helps me understand that I should avoid it.\
    \ which I have been for years, although. So I stopped using it. I still get emails\
    \ from Twitter. which I ignore. Okay, so so maybe it's like broadcasting text\
    \ message to the world. Does that seem like a good metaphor? So, aside from the\
    \ content for those who use it, what? What might be a good description for somebody\
    \ who's never used Twitter before. Okay, so that's about reading Twitter. I think.\
    \ So. We have some nice ideas about what reading Twitter is is like. So that helps\
    \ to understand how to to read it. But what about posting messages? So maybe a\
    \ public form with limited post length that's getting  a chat room for the world\
    \ to see. Okay. so something about these are getting to be more helpful. I think\
    \ maybe something about. Don't repeat yourself. Don't send the same Tweet. because\
    \ they all end up in the same place. It's like the website where it says, Don't\
    \ press this submit button more than once. You might be charged more than once.\
    \ So, anyway, just to bring this back to our discussion of metaphors. So I didn't\
    \ have. I didn't understand the metaphor for Twitter. I didn't have a metaphor\
    \ for Twitter that helped me to understand that what I was doing was going to\
    \ get me suspended. So the idea of a metaphor is to help people connect the new\
    \ experience with through previous experience. So the one that I think that I\
    \ like to think about is online shopping. So you might think.  a place where you\
    \ can do online shopping has the metaphor or makes the connection. or many of\
    \ them do. makes a connection with going to a brick and mortar store. You go in\
    \ and you get a cart or a basket. You go through the aisles and pick out what\
    \ you want. Then you go O, the check out. So that process isn't quite the same\
    \ in an online store. But the idea of putting things in a cart and then going\
    \ to checkout helps the new user to understand how to interact with the website.\
    \ Does that make sense. They're kind. Okay? Yes, metaphors are a bit subjective,\
    \ I suppose. So we might think of a desktop metaphor on a computer. So we think\
    \ about files and folders and trash cans. so that might help to organize that\
    \ that might help people to understand how to operate that interface. That's quite\
    \ an old one now. But the idea is you designed the interface so that it's and\
    \ so you you're consistent in in reinforcing that metaphor, that idea of how to\
    \ operate things. So if we have a an appropriate metaphor for the interface, then\
    \ we develop things that are consistent. Yeah, okay? So so when you've started\
    \ using things from a young age. So this is what you know. Then you might use\
    \ these apps or services as metaphors for other things as you develop new as new\
    \ things are developed. So just like I was saying, it's like. it's like email,\
    \ or it's not like email. The metaphor that might be appropriate for new messaging\
    \ applications are. It's like Twitter. Yes. the graphic of the floppy disk, the\
    \ 3.5 inch floppy disk. It doesn't. The connection with a floppy disk. There's\
    \ long since gone away. But the the icon just comes to mean, Save that's in. You\
    \ are courses as well. I think so. being an older person. When. So when video\
    \ editing first became or nonlinear, video editing on computers first became a\
    \ thing. So the applications and metaphors that related to the physical process\
    \ where you'd have we store film clips and you'd splice them. And so everything\
    \ related back to the the manual physical process of editing film. But now many\
    \ people don't have that knowledge. So to to use that metaphor, to continue using\
    \ that metaphor. it's not appropriate. So now we see in video editing applications.\
    \ I use Imovie mostly. so we don't have. So we have the idea of clips or media.\
    \ and it's a drag and drop interface. And so we don't have a connection with the\
    \ physical editing process. It's just more of a direct manipulation kind of approach.\
    \ I think so. They're only the metaphors are only as good as Brazil. Well. they're\
    \ not. They're not the silver bullet that's going to solve the problem. But they're\
    \ a help help to get the new user partway there anyway with the new application.\
    \ So if we make that so in and working with metaphors, we don't want to make them\
    \ too specific. because maybe then we're not going to be able to generalize things.\
    \ So in a parking machine where it had pictures of coins. So the message there\
    \ was that though only those coins are accepted, the loonies and twonies and quarters.\
    \ but if we wanted to just indicate any coins, so you could have nickels and dimes\
    \ as well. then we will have a more general picture for coins. and if we make\
    \ it too, general. then it's not clear where the if we just but a currency sign.\
    \ ascent sign, or a dollar sign? Maybe that's not specific enough to indicate\
    \ what kinds of things could be put in. Used to pay for parking. Does that make\
    \ sense? Okay? So cadence had a comment about the first part. And why are we doing\
    \ it? Cause this is an awful like the empathize assignment. So yes, it is. but\
    \ I think it's useful to go through the process of thinking about that or focusing\
    \ your your efforts on this different aspect of the interface. So could we not,\
    \ just to the understand assignment as as a class. So I'm thinking about the dot,\
    \ everybody's gonna be focusing on the same aspect of the group interface. That\
    \ was the thought. So we can have a discussion. And on the in in the this class\
    \ discussion Forum about who's choosing what? Perhaps. So here's my. this is my\
    \ group membership. So I had to add myself here so I could see the assignment\
    \ because I clicked on that add access restriction. So let me quickly. well. very\
    \ quickly show you the problem here. If I take myself, if I take my student self\
    \ out of that group. So here's the group, and I want to remove this student. So\
    \ I click on it. But I can't do anything with their I have to add, remove users.\
    \ flip it over. then remove. and I was expecting a message to come up here that\
    \ there's a problem. because not everybody's in the in a group. But I'm out of\
    \ time here. So did that make sense the reason I want you to do the okay? So we\
    \ can. We'll have discussions about this and cadence if you can let me know if\
    \ I've answered your concern. and we'll have discussions about this  in the Forum\
    \ before club. Our next meeting. Okay. thanks. Everyone for today. Take care."

    they didn't capture my attention right away
  persid: DHH

    "search engine" lol which I didn't find particularly helpful.

  persid: DHH
- desc: This is unrelated, but I have a suggestion about the assignment I'd like addressed
    before the end of class, whenever you have a moment. The "Understand Your Project"
    assignment seems very similar (if not identical) to the first "Empathize" assignment.
    I'm curious why we are doing it again? Is there a specific reason? Could we, as
    a class, not do the "understand" assignment and just have Explore and Materialize
    to formally hand-in? Especially since these assignments are being given to us
    fairly late in the semester and we need to coordinate time together as a group
    (and with other groups??) for them.
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
