- desc: "Good morning. Okay, let me share my screen and let's begin. So meeting 2526\
    \ today. anyone watch the does anyone safely watch the partially clips yesterday\
    \ around noon. Okay? So today. I wanted to just continue a little bit about privacy\
    \ and security and then talk a bit more and both humane interfaces. Let me get\
    \ the chat open here. I was sitting by a window in Ridell. anyway. So one comment\
    \ from yesterday was our last meeting was. it was a little difficult to understand\
    \ the concept about usable privacy and security. Does it mean websites can be\
    \ either highly usable or highly secure. and the developer must find a compromise\
    \ between the 2. So we'll talk about that today. So another comment I didn't include\
    \ here was. Can we make the last assignment due on Friday instead of Thursday.\
    \ and that's fine. I'll make that change. So Thursday will. We'll? So we'll focus\
    \ on review. We'll try a We'll try out a sample final exam and answer any questions\
    \ about the exam. So we'll handle that on Thursday. Okay. so I wanted to point\
    \ out a couple results from the participation items I set up the other day: one is
    \ about the breakout room broadcast trial we did at the end of our last meeting and then there\
    \ is the formative feedback for me. so I'll go through both of them. So here's\
    \ the link to the first one about the zoom room, broadcasting zoom breakout room\
    \ broadcasting. So I had asked you to rate the effectiveness of the following\
    \ modes for broadcasting to breakout rooms. So notice I had the rating scale be\
    \ symmetrical around the middle. very ineffective, very effective. ineffective,\
    \ effective. neither ineffective nor effective. So message got an average rank\
    \ average rating of 3, and the voice got 4.3. So there are 17 respondents 16 who\
    \ used the breakout rooms last day.\
    \ But what this summary doesn't show is the relative ratings. So that's how. Here,\
    \ let me show you list of responses. So start at the beginning here. And so one\
    \ person rated both as effective. Another person voted said the voice was more\
    \ effective. So I recorded that as a plus one for voice preference. and here both\
    \ were effective. so I won't go through all of them. But I did that so that\
    \ I could get the the numbers here on the page. So people who preferred message.\
    \ There were 2 people who preferred voice. There were 11. So I'm not sure what\
    \ that Emoji is. Okay. Thanks for the explanation. So, going through of the 16\
    \ responses to people from people who joined the breakout room on Thursday 2 preferred\
    \ message 11 preferred voice, and 3 had no preference. so that means they rated\
    \ no preference means they rated them the same. I didn't look at who rated. I\
    \ think some people who said no preference right. read them both as ineffective.\
    \ So I'm really looking at the difference. So they said. One said very ineffective.\
    \ and the other one said. so. So say message was very ineffective, and voice was\
    \ ineffective. They still preferred voice, and then gave a score of one. So I\
    \ looked at the difference between the 2. So is this. plus 24 score of the plus\
    \ 2 and the plus 24 scores? Are they helpful? So what might be a better way to\
    \ analyze or make sense of that data. Anyone have an idea about that. So I'm thinking\
    \ of a word with that many letters anyone make? Want to make a guess anyone want\
    \ to request a letter filled in? Okay, let me view them in order here. So first\
    \ was a V, so that's then a yeah. So I think it was Julia who who guessed average\
    \ first, and Kartek got it as well. anyway. So maybe making an average is helpful.\
    \ So so we had us a plus 2 score for those who preferred messages. So an average\
    \ is one. So it's maybe a slight preference preferred voice. So the score was\
    \ 24, divided by 11 equals. let's say about 2.2. I know it's more than 2. So another\
    \ way I could do this is to look at. So maybe this is help was maybe helpful,\
    \ because the people who third message add a slight preference for message. People\
    \ who who preferred voice had a bigger preference for voice. any thoughts about\
    \ that. So did I answer your question. Dane, about? Oh, this was. and yes, so\
    \ I could make an announcement. If I'm if I'm doing breakout rooms in the future.\
    \ Now that I have the voice option, I could say, Attention, Students! Prepare\
    \ for an important announcement. get everyone's attention. So it's important to\
    \ get the attention to begin with. because we can only put our attention in one\
    \ spot at a time. So especially with the messages. If we're not expecting messages\
    \ to come up. it takes a minute to realize there, there's some text flashing on\
    \ the screen. but then it's gone before they may be gone before you realize what\
    \ happened. So I thought there was an answer that was given on the midterm about\
    \ improving the interface involved storing the broadcast messages so you could\
    \ review them. So I thought that was an interesting idea for dealing with the\
    \ problems of of communicating in a more stressful environment. any thoughts about\
    \ that. Okay? So I want to also go over the feedback. So we had 20 responses.\
    \ So you can look at this yourself. I wanted to deal with what you'd like to\
    \ change about this course. Any thoughts about response and quiz required.\
    \ Every class is too much. I'll create a feedback activity for that as well today.\
    \ So I'm not. I've mentioned this before. I think I'm not requiring it for every.\
    \ So there are a couple of times when we didn't have something set up. and then\
    \ there were times when well, and I'm going to not use all of them. So it's not\
    \ required for every time. So I just wanted to make that clear. Okay. any thoughts\
    \ about that. Okay, the course is very messy on the look side. It's not organized\
    \ well, and it's so confusing to go through the course material very poorly handled.\
    \ So this. So I take that to heart. I've I'm trying working on organizations.\
    \ So if you have suggestions about the organization. let me know again. I'll ask\
    \ some more specific questions based on this. some more instruction. So this is\
    \ another setup comment. If I could, I change the way the course is set up more\
    \ instructions to know what to do. Okay, so I've I've not help some things by\
    \ by copying the assignment and inadvertently taking your submissions from assignment\
    \ one and putting it into the last assignment. and that caused some issues that\
    \ are still dealing with. So I know I've had some issues there. So thoughts about\
    \ having the midterm be worth more. There should be no assignment. Instead, there\
    \ should be this discussions midterm and final. So when you. using the breakout\
    \ rooms with a bit more structure and the use of class time can be improved. Yes,\
    \ so the the group. There could be better tools in your courses to support that.\
    \ And I think one of the one project is dealing with that topic and the grading\
    \ and the feedback. This was not helped by my error with the copying and moving\
    \ the assignments that I just talked about the mode of information, dispensation.\
    \ clear information for assignments. So I'm dealing with. I'm trying to deal with\
    \ the issues about assignments by letting you Reese Reese revise and resubmit\
    \ earlier parts. if there were some issues in those. so I know another issue with\
    \ communication was me posting to class discussions and believing that I had set\
    \ the class discussion Forum to notify you when posts were made there. But I realize\
    \ that's not the case. So that that's certainly an issue of the designer model\
    \ user model and the system image system image not communicating my intent. And\
    \ so this feedback is important. And I could. I can work. I will work on communicating\
    \ those things more clearly and using the announcements for updates. important\
    \ updates and pointing to class discussion posts that are relevant. relevant and\
    \ timely. So as an example, I'm I'm working to provide information in only one\
    \ place. So I'm putting things on my website. And I'm looking to my website with\
    \ your courses. So yes. I'm guilty about the short comments on the midterm. So\
    \ I will provide more detailed feedback about what I expected for the questions\
    \ this week. So this is the first time I've been doing 4, 28 was 7, 30. And so\
    \ there been a few issues there. I've tried to be responsive to comments about\
    \ the material and the readings. I'm my intent was to have information be centralized.\
    \ So I'm not. I haven't been successful in that. So this is very good feedback\
    \ for me that I can improve. So yeah, the readings could be improved. I realize\
    \ that I've tried to be responsive to that. Those comments that came up earlier.\
    \ you know, and in our discussions. and just read material for exam. I'm not sure\
    \ but that is. anyway. I don't want to take all our time talking about this. I\
    \ wonder whether I've lost anyone for doing that. anyway? So is Canada weird?\
    \ That was the question I asked. yeah. So Western, educated, industrialized, rich\
    \ democratic. Yeah. So it's not necessarily a good or bad thing. But it's important\
    \ to acknowledge that we have a certain perspective, and that the perspective\
    \ that we have isn't isn't the perspective of everyone. And we need to consider\
    \ that diversity. Yeah. So I didn't put. I'll put this link in later. But I'll\
    \ show you now. So the Acm has book a page about welcoming all to computing. So\
    \ there are some problematic phrases. and well. so some some terms may be more\
    \ or less troubling to you. but there's a case to be made for all of them. and\
    \ perhaps some more. So instead of a board terminate child process, maybe cancel\
    \ force, quit, stop, end, or finalize average user. When used to describe less\
    \ experienced users of technology. This term may come across as pejorative. So\
    \ an average user is is hard to define. Each of us has our own our own individual\
    \ differences that make us unique. I'm not sure that common standard or typical\
    \ user is. those are better. Black and white box. Self-explanatory term. such\
    \ as opaque or clear box might be better. Black hat, white hat, blacklist. Wait,\
    \ list blind and double blind lines. Review. Byzantine. and this is the one that\
    \ talks about the trip. The the non-western cultures term reflects a prejudice\
    \ against it. an erasure of cultures associated with and drawing from Byzantine\
    \ civilization, and endorses an exclusionary and denigrating stereotype of against\
    \ people of such cultural background and dark pattern is maybe better described\
    \ as deceptive or manipulative. so usable privacy and security does it mean the\
    \ websites that we design should be either highly usable or highly secure? Or\
    \ do we? How do we find a compromise between the 2? Any thoughts about that. So\
    \ if we give the user too many choices. so maybe it's not a bad thing to give\
    \ people choices, but it. It's about also making it clear what the impact of those\
    \ choices is. I would say that usable privacy and security is is making sure that\
    \ the impact of selecting a configuration in the interface is clear, so that people\
    \ using a system have access to to the information, and they can make an informed\
    \ decision. So it means. I think. having security available. having perhaps the\
    \ most secure and most privacy, preserving settings configured by default. and\
    \ then allowing the user to make changes only if they understand well. pet. in\
    \ such a way that make changes such a way that. huh! The that the impacts are\
    \ made clear. So it's not a question of in Facebook with with the dark. with the\
    \ deceptive pattern. Pardon me. of privacy, zukering where the privacy. negating\
    \ choices are easy to make. and the privacy preserving ones are difficult to find.\
    \ So things that are helpful to the user have much more friction. and the ones\
    \ that are helpful to the company. So a question of can? Does it website have\
    \ to be usable or secure? I think it can be both. And it needs to be both. So\
    \ what would be a happy medium. Yeah. So we need. we need to make it make things\
    \ clear. So we go through the process of we need to spend time designing the interface\
    \ to security features. so that they're presented in an understandable way. So\
    \ we can think of the heuristics as a guide. and we design things consistently\
    \ to reinforce a metaphor that encourages users to adopt appropriate mental model.\
    \ We're dealing with this. the issues that are presented in the interface. So\
    \ I just wanted to point out the center for Humane technology. So Aza Raskin is\
    \ a son of Jeff Raskin. who was a designer on the Mac project on the first Apple\
    \ Macintosh design, and he wrote a book called the Humane Interface. So he talked\
    \ about some laws for humane Interface design. And he said. the first law that\
    \ the computer shall do no harm to a user's work or through an action, allow harm\
    \ to come to the user's work. which is maybe familiar to science fiction fans\
    \ and regard related to Isaac Asimov's laws for androids. And the second law that\
    \ he proposed was the computer shouldn't should not let the user do more work\
    \ than is necessary. So, on the one hand. that's maybe advocating for automation\
    \ and artificial intelligence. But another way to think about it is. we need to\
    \ involve people in the process and keep people in the loop. So we can maintain\
    \ our humanity in a more philosophical sense, but in the more practical sense\
    \ keep people engaged in the process so they can recognize when conditions occur\
    \ that required their involvement to problem solve and to take over from the automated\
    \ system. So there is a story about a plane crash in Florida Everglades years\
    \ ago. So it was a very dark night. and a plane was coming in for a landing, and\
    \ the the pilot set out to put the landing gear out that the light didn't come\
    \ on to indicate that the landing gear had been properly deployed. so they sent\
    \ somebody down to look to see whether the landing gear was deployed. but it was\
    \ so dark they couldn't tell. So then they focused on checking whether the bulb\
    \ was burnt out. They had set up autopilot. but in the process of adjusting. trying\
    \ to get trying to test whether the bulb was burnt out. they nudged the control\
    \ and turned off the autopilot. but there was no feedback that the autopilot had\
    \ been disengaged. and so the alarm came when they were at a very low altitude.\
    \ But the crew, the cabin. the pilot, and the copilot we're working on the late.\
    \ and they had they were under the impression that the autopilot was still on.\
    \ and by the time they realized that the autopilot had come off they could not\
    \ pull the plane out of the dive. In it. It crashed in the Everglades. So that's\
    \ a case where maybe they put too much emphasis on the autopilot. Maybe that's\
    \ like the Tesla system. where people put too much faith in the autopilot. the\
    \ auto driving feature. but by not keeping the pilots engaged in the the readout\
    \ of what was happening. The plane crashed. So it it turned out that the landing\
    \ gear had been deployed. Just that message wasn't communicated. Did you like\
    \ my story. So thinking again about analyzing numerical data. so we can do averages.\
    \ So I had request for breakout rooms. So I'll get you started there. So the Zoom\
    \ versus Proctor track is a group assignment. If you did the empathize as a group\
    \ assignment. So there was a request for breakout rooms to do some communication\
    \ about the assignment. That's why I opened them. So I'll keep the meeting going\
    \ for 5\_min. So people who want to can cut get into their groups can do that.\
    \ otherwise we'll see you on Thursday. So thank you very much for today. Take\
    \ care."

  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, thanks. You, too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So can we have a special breakout room to discuss the grades that you gave
    us for us? Understand assignment. My group and I are having some discrepancies
    about the grades that you gave us.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And yeah, my group is here in the meeting. So if you can just create one breakout
    room for us, then it would be great. So.
  persid: S02
- desc: How about you? Join room 2.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Alright, so my group will join through them. Thanks.

  persid: DHH

    watch
  persid: DHH

    from how many people voted.
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
- desc: Educated is never a bad thing I think
  persid: DHH
- desc: Some may argue other of the points though
  persid: DHH
- desc: It's not bad on its own, its the lack of diversity that's the problem
  persid: DHH
- desc: "Some may say Western culture eclipses everything else and kinda doesn\u2019\
    t take into accounts other perspectives"
  persid: DHH
- desc: It can definitely be tricky, since you honestly can't give your user too much
    granularity, otherwise they might end up messing with their settings in a way
    that they don't actually want or aren't in accordance with privacy or security
    laws
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can a website be usable  and secure? What does usable privacy and security
    mean?
  persid: DHH
- desc: informed consent basically
  persid: DHH
- desc: There should be a happy medium
  persid: DHH
- desc: useable and secure
  persid: DHH
- desc: What would be a happy medium? Defaults set to a reasonable level of security
    and privacy (not the most restrictive?)
  persid: DHH
- desc: should be easy to use for the user but security shouldn't complicate that
    process
  persid: DHH

  persid: DHH
