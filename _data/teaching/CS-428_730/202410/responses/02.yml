difficult:
- desc: The list of heuristics was fairly easy to understand.
- desc: 'Everything that was talked about today was easy to understand. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Not really
- desc: All the material today was easy to understand, the concepts were well explained
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'I think it was all easy to understand. '
- desc: Today I did not found anything difficult but from the very first lecture I
    found that engaging and writing our responses on the white boards was next to
    impossible and I was not able to bring that up in the first response as i missed
    the first one.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: I was a bit confused on the format of the exam and how it is going to work
- desc: No everything was simple and easy to understand.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: The heuristic visibility of system status
- desc: Honestly, because most of the lecture was covering the syllabus and fixing
    the zoom transcripts, there were not any topics that we ran into that I had a
    lack of understanding of.  Once we get deeper into the course, I can imagine there
    will be more things that I have difficulty understanding.
- desc: Not difficult to understand, but the example with the vehicle was something
    I personally never seen before in a car.
- desc: N/A
- desc: everything went well
- desc: Why GMC would put the buttons there for car shifting
- desc: 'No, everything was easy to understand. '
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No I didn''t find any topic in todays lecture which was difficult to understand. '
- desc: I understood all concepts.
- desc: Nothing today too difficult to understand, was jarring to see transmission
    buttons in the car though that is very funny to me and hard to understand why
    that was preferable to the regular stick transmission.
- desc: No it was all perfectly explained and well elaborated.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Why did the car manufacturer make such a strange adjustment? Was it just to
    stand out?
- desc: 'Not at all, the lecture was easy and insightful '
- desc: Usability requirements could have more clearly and throughly
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No, not really just would self study the key concepts explained today and
    that should be fine.
- desc: I think for me the way it started with an example of car's gear box was tricky.
    Later with the concepts it was clear.!
- desc: I found the "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design" a bit difficult
    to understand, so I will read the article on my own to hopefully gain a clearer
    understanding.
- desc: No, it was precise.
- desc: Nothing at all.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: We encountered a difficulty to solve how to post the questions into a quiz
    on the instructor's view of URCourses.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I think user interaction design is very broad. There are so many things to
    learn and understand on my own. I wonder what the questions will look like on
    exam for this HCI course.
- desc: it was all good but i want to talk more about whiteboard , overall it was
    interesting but there was some difficulty to operate it.  Navigating the Interface
    was difficult as an individuals i found it challenging to navigate through the
    features and tools available on a digital whiteboard, especially it's a new or
    complex system.
- desc: White board is interesting but we could not able to add our opinion. So, please
    make it available next time respected Dr. hepting.
- desc: 'Whiteboard '
- desc: Not at all, great class!
important:
- desc: The concept that was discussed today was Usability Heuristics for User Interface
    Design.
- desc: 'How a bad interface could be dangerous in situations like the car that killed
    someone due to bad interface design. '
- desc: Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design
- desc: Went over the syllabus
- desc: Today it was interesting to see how bad car design can actually be. the picture
    we looked at was a great showcase on bad design
- desc: How important design is. Daryl showed us the vehicle dashboard where the gearbox
    system was located on the Dashboard of the car and was difficult to recognize.
    It is a very odd place for your gear shifter and it makes you take into consideration
    how design and user-interface is very important
- desc: Different types of usability goal. Main usability goal is simplicity and efficiency
    . Like the car gear shifters . If the gear shifters are in unusual spot it's hard
    for user to find out and adopt the newer ones.
- desc: 'User experience, adapt to changes in digital technology. '
- desc: 'Today we got to know more about the course syllabus and the tentative dates
    for the Midterms and the finals, also we learned a the basics about Human interaction. '
- desc: 'The most important concept we learned today was the ten usability heuristics '
- desc: the syallbus document and dates
- desc: How trying to simplify something can lead to bad design eg the gear shift
    being removed and implemented as buttons
- desc: Evolution of UI
- desc: User design is everywhere, like in the car as one example.
- desc: The usability heuristics such as user control and freedom
- desc: The article on 10 heuristics for usability was a new concept to me. Having
    learned about heuristics in prior computer science course, I never really realized
    that they can apply to more than just sorting algorithms like I had done in CS
    320, 340, and so on. Heuristics can exist for many problems, and do not have to
    take the form of finding the shortest path from one node to another.
- desc: 'Today in the latter half of the course, we encountered some examples of usability
    heuristics that aid with interface design and implementation. Now, we didn''t
    go into extreme details about each heuristic, but it''s important to know that
    each heuristic is valid and all of them should be seen as a general rule of thumb
    rather than strict guidelines that one must follow. '
- desc: 'Usability heuristics as a principled means for ensuring human-focused design.
    Having a clear list to consider when making a product is very helpful when attempting
    to achieve a pleasant user experience. '
- desc: 'I got to learn about what is good and poor design as well as interaction
    design '
- desc: user centered design
- desc: 'The important concept I encountered is usability heuristics, where I learnt
    about different types of usability goals and a short description of it.  '
- desc: I got to see the class's majority agreement on how the gearshift in the car
    is a bad design. It was interesting to see how some designs can be universally
    classified as either good or bad. This brings up the question of whether enough
    research was done before the product was released to gather people's opinions
    on the design.
- desc: 'Today in the class we went over the full course syllabus and discussed grades
    weightage. We also went through a topic of interactive designs. We studied a car
    control panel example and tried to figure out it is easy for humans to understand
    that design or not. And what kind of design one should create which is simple
    to understand. '
- desc: "Today, we learned how important it is to design things in a way that makes\
    \ them easy for people to use. The design and usability requirements play an important\
    \ role in user\u2019s experience. The example of the car controls showed how even\
    \ small changes in where buttons are or how they look can affect how easily users\
    \ can use them. This class made it clear that when we design things, we need to\
    \ think about how people will interact with them to make sure it's a good experience\
    \ for them."
- desc: 'The concept of solving problem by different method by example of car transmission
    change from a rod transmission to button transmission. Example: PRND '
- desc: I thought the car visual in today's lecture was a great illustration of usability
    requirements. The car is not learnable if the user cannot find the drive mode.
    It also suggests that the car's learnability is impacted by the design, which
    takes longer for the user to grasp the controls.   We also discussed ten usability
    heuristics for user interface design, but just provided a high-level overview.
- desc: The importance of design on user's experience, whether is be cars or programs,
    the user experience can almost always be made better.
- desc: Digital Systems
- desc: We went through different examples of bad design in class like the rental
    car that uses some kind of a button gear shift instead of the regular stick shift
    and the LD Extras app. I, personally, also enjoyed learning about the different
    usability goals from Chapter 1 of the textbook.
- desc: User friendliness and making things intuitive
- desc: I encountered the interesting perspective that improving one functionality
    can make other functionalities worse, like that car with a great spacious middle
    console area, but accident prone gear buttons. Good design is a balancing act
    in this way.
- desc: People driven development as opposed to user driven development
- desc: 10 Usability Heuristics for UI Design
- desc: The most important topic of this lecture was an extended introduction to the
    course syllabus and there also a car interior pic and asked us about its usabilities
    and changes over the years.
- desc: How design changes when situation changes
- desc: The important concept for this lecture was about usability heuristics for
    user interface and design article shared by DR. Hepting during the session.
- desc: 'Usability goals in interactive design (example of poor design with the gear
    box) '
- desc: The professor discussed the impact of car design on user experience and also
    talked about the "10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design," which I
    found important.
- desc: ususability heuristic and importance of it.
- desc: Usability goals
- desc: Usability heuristics for User Interface design
- desc: We looked on the syllabus, including grading, academic integrity, etc. In
    addition, we learned about 10 usability heuristics for interface design. A good
    visibility design, for example, would clearly inform the state of processes with
    feedbacks and show the next steps to users.
- desc: The understading of 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design.
- desc: Designing
- desc: An important concept/perspective I learned is there is a lot more that goes
    into interactive design especially when it comes to people-centered design (user-centered
    design) the more we as designers/developers get proper engagement from the people
    who use our products the better these products become for the public to use.
know-more:
- desc: How to create minimalistic but at the same time flexible and functional design.
    What methods and programming languages are more suitable and for which purpose.
- desc: The London drugs app that was designed for people to redeem their points,
    Professor said it actually does not encourage people to redeem their points. Was
    this purposefully designed? Considering a big company like London drugs, I think
    they can afford to design a good interface.
- desc: Final and Midterm Exam Dates
- desc: The car gear was interesting to know about
- desc: Ways to improve the bad design we look at would be interesting!
- desc: How usability affects different sector of computer science.
- desc: 'I would like to more about characteristics of interaction design. '
- desc: I would like to know more about the Basic Human interaction and also all the
    sub topics covered in it.
- desc: the design reasonings you started towards the end of class
- desc: I would like to know more about how to do proper research to correctly design
    and implement things
- desc: 'How digital systems are changed for people '
- desc: I would like to know who designed the GMC gear shift and what they were thinking
    when they made it.
- desc: Which chapter on the encyclopedia
- desc: I really enjoy the real live examples that you used to show us how good/bad
    design in your own life. The GMC was a great example, and it makes the class feel
    a lot more real when you bring in aspects of designs you run into in every day
    life that are either well designed or poorly designed. I look forward to see what
    other things you can integrate into each lecture from a real life experience.
- desc: 'Definitely interested in learning more about design concepts and intuitive
    design that can help novices quickly become experts. Understanding the theory
    behind the intuition is always interesting.  '
- desc: 'how interaction design is advancing '
- desc: Difference between people centered and user centered design
- desc: 'I''m excited to learn more about designing good software and about Human-Computer
    Communication '
- desc: 'Yes I would like to know more about the interactive designs and how can me
    make it simple for people who are using it so that they can understand it properly. '
- desc: About user interface design similar to 10 rules that we learned today.
- desc: What engineers thought that transmission buttons in the car are okay or satisfying
    to use? Did test users rate this higher than a transmission stick?
- desc: Digital systems is a topic of which I want to know more about.
- desc: I personally would like to know more about the design decisions to make the
    gear shift a series of buttons and if more cars companies will adopt it
- desc: 'Usability requirements '
- desc: digital materials
- desc: Yes, I'm interested, regarding the usability concept overall and the upcoming
    key concepts for the course.
- desc: I would like to know more about difference between user-centered design vs
    people-centered design
- desc: I would like to learn more about Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and its
    impact. Additionally, I would like to know more about the usability heuristics
    for user interface design with real-life examples.
- desc: about the design principle of the car you mentioned.
- desc: Usability goals
- desc: I would like to learn more about Usability heuristics for User Interface design
- desc: I would like to take a look more on example of how the 10 usability that we
    learned apply in daily life, especially on software products. That would be a
    great plus in terms of my future career.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: yes ,  i would love to know more about whiteboard.
- desc: 'i like way to understand concept with help of car thing which is new and
    surprising to me. However, it is good to learn in new way of teaching which make
    student to take part in smalls debits.  '
- desc: Design
- desc: 'I would love to know who designed that GMC and what their thoughts were in
    doing so.  Would be interesting to see if that was a collective agreement between
    many groups involved or a decision based off one persons opinion or idea. '
