- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: Nope
- desc: No. everything was good
- desc: 'The difficult part I found today was that like the object which are used
    everyday such as  doors why did it end up to be undesigned. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No I understood everything discussed in class today
- desc: the difficult part I think was that why the simple object door was discussed
    and why t was poorly design
- desc: No everything was clear and consise
- desc: 'nothing that i know '
- desc: The U of R academic schedule was very difficult to understand at first. It
    also had a ton of blank space and just really did not look nice, which made me
    think people would struggle to read it without having to sink time into trying
    to decipher what information was put on the cluttered and busy page.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'Honestly, I feel like the U of R has a lot of poorly designed elements and
    resources and I find it difficult to understand how they have not been improved
    over the years. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Not Really
- desc: The table was difficult to understand what it was trying to convey, but once
    I understood it it became much easier
- desc: No, there wasn't anything difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No'

- desc: 'No every topic was understandable '
- desc: 'No I didn''t find any topic which was difficult to understand. '
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'how to make syllabus better, need all info but its so cluttered '
- desc: The concepts were pretty fair and easy to understand and they carried a clear
    concept and explanation.
- desc: Today was very easy to understand!
- desc: No everything was good
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No.
- desc: The concepts were easy to understand.
- desc: 'Mostly it was easy to understand '
- desc: Not really, for today's lecture my conceptual understanding was aligning to
    the main idea.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No, it was a interesting class.
- desc: 'NO'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There were no difficulties to understand in today's lecture. However, the
    U of R academic schedule would be the only thing that is hard to understand its
    content at first sight.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The topic was a bit difficult to me
- desc: not particularly
- desc: Nope, another great class.
important:
- desc: I learned about Norman Door concept, which is a door that was not designed
    very well, so that people are constantly making a mistake about which way it opens.
- desc: Design is rewarding and fun.
- desc: "I learned the concept called \u201Cnorman doors\u201D and I encountered many\
    \ of these doors before in my life and was also at fault sometimes for pushing\
    \ a door instead of pulling."
- desc: The importance of designing an object such as a door to be intuitive
- desc: problem with Academic Schedule
- desc: Discussed whether to extend deadline for response quizzzes or not
- desc: Se;ective Attention
- desc: I learned how something simple as door can be designed so poorly. It was interesting
    to think how much study it take for everyday design
- desc: 'I actually found the video regarding doors quite insightful. The video talks
    about doors and something as simple as doors doesn''t get thought about often
    but doors is something we encounter everyday.   A well designed door is quite
    important and interesting. '
- desc: The readability of certain calendars and data
- desc: 'Important concept or perspective we encountered today was the principle of
    human-centered design. This approach emphasizes understanding the needs and behaviors
    of users and designing solutions that meet those needs effectively. Like the usage
    of push or pull door can be confusing if it not use consistently across the country '
- desc: I encountered in todays class was the concept of norman doors and how poorly
    it was designed which showed me the importance of intuitive design in everday
    objects.
- desc: Perception and sensation . Also how door at fox building 10 floor had issue
    of opening weirdly. Causing issue with people not knowing whether to push or pull.
    Also how we sense and percieve information provided and make decision after considering
    it
- desc: the inherentent bad design of doors
- desc: How doors have been improved throughout the years
- desc: the important concept that I encounter today  was the video discussing about
    Norman doors and user centered design also discussed about importance of designing
    objects
- desc: Although I personally noticed the gorilla in the video, I showed some of my
    friends, and even some classmates that said they completely missed it. I was surprised
    to see that this was possible.
- desc: Potential better designs for the school calender
- desc: talked about bad doors by norman and design concept of academic schedule of
    UofR
- desc: The idea of poorly designed doors has been a thing for longer than we would
    think, and that is mostly because they are functional and are not required for
    safety reasons, so there have been few door redesigns. Despite this, there are
    still some doors that are really hard to use.
- desc: We were separated into breakout rooms to discuss the design of the academic
    schedule document. Upon the first look at the document, it appears to be somewhat
    unreadable and unorganized as you search for different dates. We talked about
    different design improvements, which included categorizing the dates in months
    or terms to make it easier to read and navigate.
- desc: 'ui and ux design is important for user interaction '
- desc: 'Today we discussed in detail what makes poor design, and how that can guide
    us into making better design. By using the U of R academic schedule as a case
    study, we are able to conceptualize what can make a document inaccessible or poor
    at realizing its purpose. '
- desc: fire door
- desc: The Gestalt Principles
- desc: That feedback is one of the most crucial parts of design but it is the hardest
    to gain
- desc: 'I found that the concept of the "door" in the video was very interesting.
    Also, I liked the discussion about the UofR academic schedule. That gave me so
    many good points about how to create a great design for users. '
- desc: 'I learnt about norman mirror and calender designing. '
- desc: "The videos about the bad door design and the selective attention test were\
    \ really interesting to watch. I\u2019d seen them before, but in the context of\
    \ this class, they were really interesting to see different ways of thinking about\
    \ designs."
- desc: 'Attention to detail about push and pull doors '
- desc: 'Today in the class we watched Norman door video and through that video I
    learned how can a design in door cause a problem. What happens if the visual and
    written instructions don''t match. As discussed in the video a door got a pull
    bar but to open the door they have to push. '
- desc: Today, I learned about Norman Doors design, which teaches the importance of
    user-friendly design in everyday things like doors. It's all about making handles,
    signs, and interfaces intuitive to enhance usability and prevent frustration.
- desc: The concept i encounter today from the video of door was attention to detail
    as the instruction on door was not matching to its function. Also it was good
    discussion about academic schedule and its visuals.
- desc: Designing is among the more difficult undertakings. And the clearest explanation
    of the designing process was provided by Don Norman in plain language. It follows
    that, in the process of designing, we should consider the user and if the design
    is user-friendly enough.  We had a fruitful conversation on the academic calendar.
    It ought to be divided into one semester each page, in my opinion.
- desc: 'Obvious design, designing doors so its obvious if its push or pull '
- desc: We talked about the user readability and how impactful it is in designing
    concepts. We also talked about the academic calendar and the flaws it has.
- desc: I learned that the design of doors is much more complex than I would have
    even though!
- desc: Lettermens video about velcro
- desc: We watched, as a class, a video discussing the concept of "Norman Doors" which
    I really liked and thought that it was very entertaining and informative. We also
    participated in a class activity and discussed the design flaws of the University's
    2023-2024 academic calendar which I thought helped me personally in spotting some
    of the design flaws like date format inconsistencies and use of small text size
    which makes it difficult for some users to interpret the data from the schedule.
- desc: norman door, how if many people encounter the same issue, its likely not just
    user error
- desc: 'Looking at commonly used items, like the semester schedule or doors, and
    realizing even these simple things require design strategies to be useful to humans '
- desc: Norman doors - Video
- desc: 'That even products/ objects that are used in our everyday lives are probably
    not design to be optimal. The door was a great example to something that has been
    around forever but does not have a single uniform design. '
- desc: Discoverability and feedback form the basis of how designers and engineers
    work today.
- desc: Don Norman's concise explanation highlights how important it is to put user-friendliness
    first. We talked about organizing the academic calendar 2023-2024 and the possible
    changes that make it more readable and for more readability, we can separate the
    important holidays section in to a separate page or segregate it from the rest
    of the calendar.
- desc: 'How different objects were designed and created '
- desc: The important concept that I understood about today's lecture is the Norman
    door, where we do the opposite of what is required in terms of designing and that
    it is rewarding and enjoyable.
- desc: Principles of Human-centered design, Example of door and academic calander
- desc: 'Norman Doors and we had a group discussionon design of 2023-2024 Academic
    Schedule. '
- desc: we had a group discussion about the schedule calendar and we comes up with
    some idea how we can better this one like  clustering the portion and adding different
    color in important parts also about the font.
- desc: Door Design
- desc: Norman doors and the possibilities for new ways to design the academic calendar
    for UofR
- desc: 'We watched a video of the concept of the Norman door, which is a confusing
    door that requires a sign of how to use it. Moreover, we encountered a couple
    of principles in the video: Discoverability and Feedback. Lastly, we discussed
    possibly redesigning the U of R academic schedule.'
- desc: What makes a design good or bad
- desc: what makes a design good or bad
- desc: 'The importance of discoverability: when designing a product, consider what
    actions are possible.'
- desc: After the breakout room discussion about academic calendar, i came to realisation
    that many individuals encounter difficulties in fully understanding it contents.
    It often fails to clearly demonstrate its own purpose and struggle to effectively
    deliver its message to users at first glance. This highlights the critical importance
    of implementing a user-friendly design. However, achieving a truly effective design
    is no easy feat.
- desc: Designing things
- desc: Learnt about Norman doors and the concept of clear design decisions that don't
    require instructions
- desc: 'The Norman doors concept has got me looking almost at everything I come across
    out in the world, looking at the different affordances and signifiers people use
    and what they could do better on. '

- desc: why is it that so many doors have this issue; minimalism vs user friendliness?
- desc: Confusion doors are called Norman doors
- desc: Why all the push doors with handles are not being replaced. was there excess
    manufacturing, is it for aethetic reasons? Just get rid of them!
- desc: 'No. '
- desc: User readability issues in the designing concepts.
- desc: The theoretical aspect of design
- desc: Yes, I would rewatch today's video about the Norman door and would like to
    take more deeper pointers from it.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Not really!
- desc: 'NO'
- desc: Details about design of doors
- desc: 'I would like to brainstorm and come up with even more ideas for calendars
    because of how common the use of calendars are in our daily lives. '
- desc: According to the video, the iteration of Human-Centered Design, which starts
    with observation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing, is an interesting
    topic to explore further in details.
