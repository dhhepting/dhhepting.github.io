difficult:
- desc: The content of  today's class was fairly easy to understand.
- desc: Everything was very clearly laid out in today's class so there is nothing
    for me that I was unable to grasp. Everything made sense.
- desc: Everything discussed today was easy to understand and well explained.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: not really
- desc: ''
- desc: Not really , everything was loud and clear
- desc: 'I think it was easy to understand. '
- desc: the limiting options in design and why we should add more options, in refernce
    to the car tire unit of measurement
- desc: I was a bit confused on the talk of the tires being kph and psi the units
    confuse me
- desc: No it was easy
- desc: It was difficult to understand how to organize the breakout room
- desc: No, nothing was difficult
- desc: The most difficulty I had understanding today was the snake references, and
    the willingness to be creative. I did not keep a good enough eye on the website
    and was unaware that we were supposed to watch the TED talk and do a reading prior
    to attending class, which explains my poor score on the quiz. Once I unrderstood
    what "touching the snake" meant though, things became a lot more clear to understand.
- desc: The only minor issue today was when the polls were being created as many of
    the students were having issues with the polls in Zoom.
- desc: N/A
- desc: 'No'
- desc: ''
- desc: The concept that we talked about in the lecture was pretty straight forward,
    so I didn't find it was difficult to understand
- desc: Nothing in particular
- desc: s there anything today that was difficult to understand? No, there was nothing
    I found difficult to understand
- desc: ''
- desc: No i understood everything
- desc: There was lot discussion, so I didn't find anything that was difficult to
    understand.
- desc: What kPA was, I use psi so much that I had no idea that kPA was a thing haha
- desc: ''
- desc: ''
- desc: ''
- desc: 'Not at all. '
- desc: ''
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No everything was easy to understand '
- desc: Yes, the last discussion regarding the picture of the car dashboard was little
    confusing because i did not understand it properly.
- desc: No all good.
- desc: 'I am still little confused about the syllabus and what will come in the assignment,
    mid and finals. '
- desc: No... it was clear
- desc: The sensor on the car.
- desc: None
- desc: The Zoom interface on Polls/Quizzes is moved to the Surveys section. This
    may cause confusing to old users and question about unnecessary move of the Polls/Quizzes.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Yep. I don't drive and not familiar with car. But the other students from
    breakout room discussion helped me manage to understand about the low pressure
    tire (unit measure). So i'm able to get it today.
- desc: ''
- desc: Industrial Design
- desc: no - there was nothing in todays lecture that was difficult to understand
- desc: Was a great class.
important:
- desc: That design of the software should meet the user's expectation and be easy
    to navigate. As an example was London Drugs application that did not clearly show
    how to redeem points, and was not very helpful in general. Tire pressure example
    on the other hand was better with the exception that units of measure were not
    familiar.
- desc: An important perspective I encountered today was that how small design changes
    on various things that we use day to day makes a big impact and why it is important
    to understand design fundamentals to make things better for everything. It was
    great to hear about other's perspectives in the class as well as the team members
    in the breakout rooms. The examples discussed in the class were great and I felt
    engaged in the content.
- desc: One important concept I encountered today  was that people need to be engaged
    in the usability process, so users have a sort of buy in.
- desc: touch the snake
- desc: Went through couple design examples and breakout session
- desc: 'The importance of properly structed and designed user interface. Daryl showed
    us an example of Air Canada interface and a good example was that it showed a
    section for "contacting us" but when clicked on that section, the section didn''t
    provide a phone number whatsoever. This can be very frustrating and confusing  for
    users.  '
- desc: The main concept we learn today is about how we can build our creative confidence.
    We can achieve this by doing the things we like, performing better repeatedly
    without hesitation or shyness. If we shy away or stop doing things based solely
    on others' opinions, we might miss the opportunity to shine in that sector.
- desc: 'User experience and Interaction design. '
- desc: creative confidence and beverement travel. I did not know beverement travel
    was a thing
- desc: The poor design of Zoom again with the questionare being difficult to set
    up and not showing for some people
- desc: 'User interface and how it can affect overall experience '
- desc: I learned that some people will need to take the time to try to be creative,
    to overcome their fear of expressing creativity
- desc: That the metric system in Canada was changed in 1977
- desc: Are you willing to touch the snake? I learned this today because I failed
    to realize the TED talk was supposed to be viewed prior to this class. I also
    learned the importance of not only making a product that fulfills a clients wants,
    as generally the list of requirements does not specify that the product must be
    easy to use.
- desc: 'The main point of discussion today was on the image of the tire pressure
    indicator in the vehicle. We discussed the pros and cons of the design. Some pros
    is that it clearly indicates which tire is affected by lower tire pressure. A
    con was that most of the general population may not be familiar with the conversion
    to kPa. Some improvements can definitely be made but it''s a good general design. '
- desc: 'Today we discussed interface design examples. A classmate mentioned that
    sometimes the way that things are designed is based on consistency and not convention
    and that can make things inaccessible for users that follow convention (which
    will likely be most). '
- desc: 'Today we did a poll regarding how to take risks and be fearless and be creative '
- desc: That since Canada is so messy with its combination of metric and imperial
    that it is hard to account for when designing something
- desc: I have realized the importance of user interface in the product. It plays
    a vital role of the product. The interface should be easier for user to understand,
    but still needs to contain all the necessary information.
- desc: 'During the lecture the conversation the class was having with the regarding
    the car and other online applications and how its design and development could
    be improved and made better for the user '
- desc: I found the TED talk really interesting; I found the structure differently
    interesting from the usual formats of TED talks. The stories about the snake and
    the MRI designer were really good, especially in showing how to think of approaching
    designs. I enjoyed that we got to talk about it in class today and see others'
    opinions.
- desc: ''
- desc: the car example which got understood the importance of a perfect design. Also
    10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design for creating new design for
    software.
- desc: 'We talked about how unhelpful the Air Canada website is for traveling after
    a bereavement. Additionally, the London Drugs App Rewards program was discussed,
    which was really beneficial because the GUI wasn''t functioning properly. In the
    breakout room, we had a fruitful discussion regarding the advantages and disadvantages
    of tire pressure images. '
- desc: In the group discussion we were talking about pros and cons of the layout
    of the rental car, I think this analysis was smart way to make design objective
- desc: We went over the concept of "creative confidence" that was discussed by David
    Kelly in the given Ted talk and reflected on our thoughts, as a class, by participating
    in a poll activity about the concept.
- desc: I liked the snake perspective we discussed. How slowly opening yourself up
    to things that scare you makes it easier and that it is important to build creative
    confidence.
- desc: Canada changed unit systems, I didn't know that
- desc: I got to know how important is the interactive design of digital products
    surrounding us like the Car example from todays class.
- desc: I learned today that while it is important to have enough information visible
    for the user, it is important to not over complicate or crowd a space for the
    sake of having maximum information on the page. Information and navigation should
    be clear but there is a fine line between informational and too much information.
- desc: I encountered that having that have a simple interface that displays all the
    information necessary to the user is key to an excellent interface.
- desc: How important UI and design is
- desc: The important concept was about Interaction Design User Interface- shaping
    digital things for people's use.
- desc: Interaction design and refining design of a speedometer/dashboard in a car
- desc: The professor showed us a picture of a car that displayed low pressure in
    the front left tire. He asked us to discuss this during the break, and when we
    did, we discovered some new concepts and perspectives on how to improve it.
- desc: About the design interface in more details. In the group discussion we discussed
    two topics about it one is about tire pressure and another one is about point
    redeem.
- desc: Design can be perceived differently,based on different reactions to the car
    sensor.
- desc: I encountered some tricky designs and had to ponder how to improve them.
- desc: "We have learned about the interaction design concept that is about \u201C\
    shaping\u201D things rather than \u201Cbuilding\u201D things to people\u2019s\
    \ usage. Moreover, design is to make people feel participated and also to consider\
    \ the possibility of future before shaping things. Lastly, we looked at some examples\
    \ of interaction design, such as tire pressure low popup on a car\u2019s dashboard.\
    \ This example has a clear design on showing which tire pressure is low, but the\
    \ pressure unit could be improved by adding the unit options."
- desc: the important of creative confidence
- desc: ''
- desc: 'the concept about user interface and way of describing with help car wheel
    pressure detection method which is something that i can co-relate with our theory
    knowledge. Last but not least the group discussion which clear all my doubt and
    help to reach other people perspective.  '
- desc: Interface Design
- desc: had a good ime discussing design of Tire pressure display with classmates
    and hear different opinions
- desc: Design and ethics, I was working on a project can't go into detail because
    of the NDA I had to sign but I can explain the idea behind what happened.  I was
    basically told to create form data but I was to remove the "optional" field identifiers
    which I felt was not right nor proper when it came to UI/UX design.  It felt like
    the project was more focused on taking data from the consumers then it was to
    give them a proper experience.
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more how to improve my creative abilities and confidence
    in terms of designing software. Some people have artistic touch, for them design
    comes naturally, for me not so much.
- desc: 'I would like to get into the habit of analyzing basic designs into my day
    to day life on how can I improve them or try to understand the justification as
    to why the designer would have designed it in a way they did. I would like to
    atleast do this for the tenure of the class. '
- desc: What goes in the process of a company choosing to use the KPA measurement
    instead of the standard PSI measurement?
- desc: 'no'
- desc: more about future assignments and work in general
- desc: ''
- desc: No , everything was good and clearly understandable
- desc: 'Specific UI Design principles to get more understanding. '
- desc: 'how to actually become creatively confident '
- desc: I want to learn more about good design, so far we have seen a lot of bad designs
    but not discussed any good designs
- desc: More details of UI based on different applications types
- desc: I would like to know more about the idea with the people touching the snake,
    if there were any cases where the experiment didnt work
- desc: More about the phrase ready to bite the snake
- desc: I continue to enjoy the car examples given in class. While the tire pressure
    indication was overall more helpful than not, I found it interesting to know that
    people would have liked it in PSI. Does that also mean they want their speed in
    miles rather than kilometers? It was certainly a good topic for discussion today,
    and I'm glad we had the opportunity to explore whether or not it could be improved
    upon or not.
- desc: ''
- desc: Excited to learn more about the processes of engaging users in the conversation
    when it comes to design.
- desc: Would like know more such real life examples like LD reward points
- desc: The links were initially hard to find for the test but they were quite interesting
    and informative!
- desc: 'Yes, I definitely wanted to know more about the effective way to create a
    meaningful interface for users. '
- desc: ''
- desc: I'm excited to learn more about designing good software and about Human-Computer
    Communication
- desc: I wanted to learn more about the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface
    Design, particularly the principles outlined by Jakob Nielsen. These heuristics
    provide valuable guidelines for creating user-friendly interfaces, covering aspects
    like visibility of system status, match between system and real world, user control
    and freedom, and more.
- desc: about creative software design as well as would like to discuss more about
    the car example design.
- desc: ''
- desc: If the car dash looks like that for low tire pressure, what else does it show
    that is semi-advanced?? How low the oil is? Does it show battery charge %?
- desc: ''
- desc: ''
- desc: ''
- desc: 'I wanted to know how our Midterm would be, like what kind of questions would
    be asked. '
- desc: ''
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Maybe how UI works on different type of devices and how type of devices can
    also affect UI
- desc: Yes, the interaction design user interface and the heuristics about it, would
    like to know more on that topic.
- desc: No everything was relatable.
- desc: Not really!
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Does each item in the everyday world have standards to be followed when they
    are designed.
- desc: I'd like to understand more about how to make changes and improve bad designs.
- desc: It would be nice to have some exercises to apply those 10 usabilities in practice.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: ''
- desc: i gain more interest to know about this subject and other people perspective
    and ideology towards this subject.
- desc: Industrial Design
- desc: yes - would like to learn about better design and more about minimal design
- desc: 'I would like to know more on design, the ins and outs and how I can become
    a better designer. '
