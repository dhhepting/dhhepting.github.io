difficult:
- desc: Not really.
- desc: 'Everything was well-explained. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'Nope all my questions were answered '
- desc: No but I am confused on how the upcoming assignment is going to work so some
    discussion on it would be helpful
- desc: 'no'
- desc: When the card sorting relates to interaction design
- desc: everything was straightforward
- desc: No, I was grateful for the extra time with the group though.
- desc: On when we are supposed to know what groups we are paired with
- desc: No, everything was easy to understand
- desc: No there was nothing I found hard to understand
- desc: nope
- desc: Nothing today!
- desc: Everything was perfectly explained
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No.
- desc: I really understood everything
- desc: Not really, but just a bit concerned about the midterm grades as it was really
    difficult.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: none
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There were no difficulties today.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No, nothing is difficult to understand and something that I got interested
    is group discussion with group member.
- desc: noting difficult to understand
important:
- desc: How to create a low fidelity prototype using metaphors.
- desc: low fidelity prototype
- desc: Card Sorting
- desc: Understand better how to do low fidelity prototypes
- desc: I enjoyed what Daryl was showing us during the zoom meeting with the whiteboard,
    and I found it important that our professor broke us into breakout rooms to make
    sure we're understanding everything.
- desc: 'The low fidelity prototype '
- desc: 'Fidelity maps got shown and described helped me know that I was on the right
    track for what I did in the assignment '
- desc: I now have a better understanding about how mobile-specific design is so important,
    and different form any other type of design.
- desc: The card sorting being as a metaphor
- desc: Talked about card sorting for interaction design and card sorting for grouping.
- desc: I learned that the zoom whiteboard can be used for a low fidelity models,
    which was an interface that I would have never thought to have used. I thought
    it was much easier than drawing it out like my group did
- desc: 'Daryl asked us to look at the video "Choice, Happiness and Spaghetti Sauce",
    which I watched directly after class. The thesis is that embracing diversity will
    lead to true happiness. Humans are variable, and no one product will appeal to
    everyone or accommodate them in the same way. '
- desc: What the low fidelity prototypes are meant to truly look like
- desc: We have discussed about card sorting for interaction design and applied that
    in using whiteboard feature of Zoom
- desc: The optional video shared in class to watch at our free was interesting
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about Card sort metaphor. Also, in breakout
    room, our team discussed plan for upcoming assignments.
- desc: The importance of mobile perspectives and how users may benefit from accessibility
    options!
- desc: Card sorting metaphor
- desc: card metaphor + organizing, project clarifications
- desc: How to make a lofi prototype and the metaphor of sorting a deck of cards
- desc: Low fidelity prototypes, stacks of cards example
- desc: An important concept I encountered today is card sorting and their use to
    uncover users' mental models of the information architecture of a digital product.
- desc: Just discussed about concept, as per course syllabus
- desc: In today's lecture we discussed about Card sorting for interaction design,
    Card sorting as a metaphor for group creation (whiteboard), Breakout rooms created
    for project doubt solving and other discussions.
- desc: 'Card sorting as a metaphor, and discussion about assignment '
- desc: Nothing much!
- desc: Card sorting for interaction design
- desc: Card sorting as  a metaphor
- desc: Different ways of using metaphors for approaching a design problem
- desc: We looked at the card sorting and built a low-fidelity prototype for group
    creation from the metaphor on the whiteboard of the Zoom.
- desc: card sorting
- desc: Today's concept was about card sorting for interaction design, and the professor
    prototyped a grouping interface using the card sorting metaphor, and discussed
    the project in the breakout room.
- desc: learnt more about metaphors  , especially the cards metaphor
know-more:
- desc: How to write scripts for the materialize part of the project.
- desc: 'high-fidelity prototypes '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'More about the next assignment and how the testing phase will work and be
    gone about '
- desc: I would like to learn more about how the real app-development process works,
    and how designers are involved.
- desc: Its low fedility prototype
- desc: not at all. Maybe some reading would help  understand in depth
- desc: Not really, other than maybe some better digital ways to build low fidelity
    and possibly even high fidelity models.
- desc: 'I''d like to know more about how the concept of horizontal segmentation could
    work in terms of software design. Is the answer to provide multiple different
    interfaces? Multiple different options of doing the same thing different ways?
    How is it possible to do this when making a single product? Is it possible at
    all? '
- desc: No, there wasn't anything
- desc: I would like to know more about our performance on the last assignments. Since
    the assignments build on each other, feedback on the previous assignments would
    be nice so we know if we are on the right track
- desc: nope
- desc: 'If we need to pair up with other groups for the next assignment? Ans how
    would that work '
- desc: What importance do views play in relation to interaction design?
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No.
- desc: More about assignment and final exam.
- desc: I would request that we submit the last project part sooner than the due date
    because in april there are more finals exams, so that everything won't get more
    piled together and more difficult also.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Metaphors
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I would like to know more about the other metaphors that can work together
    with the card sorting. Also, the pros and cons of the card sorting.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: yes , learning more about metaphors to apply into group project
