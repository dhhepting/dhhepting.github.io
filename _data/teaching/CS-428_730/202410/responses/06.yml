difficult:
- desc: Where to draw the line when designing something. How far out of the ordinary
    should one go, or all ideas, no matter how ridiculous may seem, are acceptable
    during the design phase.
- desc: None
- desc: Everything today was easy to understand.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: No everything was rather clear today
- desc: Everything was good
- desc: I think I found it easy..
- desc: 'No'
- desc: How to go about the quizzes with long readings
- desc: No it was all understandable
- desc: Altering the design
- desc: Not at all.
- desc: The only thing I had difficulty understanding is how designers can appear
    to have such a fun job. While some people may view it at work, based on the video
    we watched in class, everyone at the design firm was having fun. While it wasn't
    exactly the perfect idea of fun, it was even said that in order to be more innovative,
    one must be having fun. Why can't more professions be like this?
- desc: 'How, even though there are obviously innovative ways that we can improve
    things like shopping carts, many of those innovations have not taken place. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: i found everything to be good
- desc: How a company could charge ~$200 for a 20min documentary that is available
    for free online

- desc: Nothing
- desc: Nope
- desc: 'is it reall common for designers to reinvent common things? shopping cart
    and toaster '
- desc: Why the shopping cart looked the way it did haha
- desc: No everything was well explained
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No.
- desc: "I don\u2019t think \x10doing, it was pretty straightforward "
- desc: some of the methodologies and strategies
- desc: Not really, just the content of this course is a bit more about articles,
    videos and sources like that, which is really interesting so far.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No!
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There was no difficulties to understand on the topic today. It was pretty
    clear.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: no- not particularly difficult to understand
- desc: Nope, great class enjoyed the conversations we all had
important:
- desc: It was interesting to learn about the shopping cart design process. What methods
    were utilized and to which conclusions the designers have come to.
- desc: The chapter on Sensation and Perception was a great read.
- desc: Mental models of systems we already have in our minds because of past experiences.
- desc: Shopping Cart
- desc: Went over the shopping cart example
- desc: Aspects of design
- desc: It was interesting to watch the IDEO shopping cart creation process. Watching
    how a process such as reimagining a cart goes from an initial idea to the full
    creation was really interesting
- desc: The concept of what designers find useful and what the user finds useful
- desc: Today, I encountered the importance of the integration of theory and practice
    in industrial design, as discussed in the lecture. This perspective emphasizes
    the multifaceted nature of design, requiring a blend of technological, functional,
    aesthetic, business aspects and strong collaboration with team member. For example,
    while the designers were asked to create a shopping card idea, they come up with
    various design while sharing their thought in the team.
- desc: History of Velcro
- desc: We encountered about cart designing video which talked about changes that
    was done on cart and there benefits and loses for people
- desc: 'The creation of the shopping cart and how the ideo team work together '
- desc: creative concepts of media and technology
- desc: The shopping cart design process
- desc: 'talked about the shopping cart design and also design concepts of everyday
    things and industrial design. '
- desc: Corporate America will generally hate the structure of highly successful design
    firms primarily due to the fact that there are no big names, no real leaders based
    on seniority or time spent working at a place. It goes against the corporate work
    environment
- desc: IDEO's unique design process, and the interaction between the designer, the
    user and the system image.
- desc: Mental model and conceptual model
- desc: the designers model
- desc: That when considering design, one needs to consider all possible design concepts
- desc: I found it's very interesting the way people decide how to create a shopping
    cart. The process was involved by many people so there would be so many ideas
    about how to design a shopping cart.
- desc: 'I enjoyed watching the video on the IDEO shopping cart design process. During
    the video, I encountered a new phrase or statement which I found interesting:
    Try and ask for forgiveness rather than ask for permission. This shows a different
    way of innovating in a bureaucratic environment. '
- desc: the way a product is designed and the steps the designer has to go through
    to make a successful product. There will always be room for improvement. A fresh
    set of eyes would always provide a new perspective.
- desc: The video we watched today was really interesting. It showed me how thinking
    differently can make ordinary things awesome! There was also this unique idea
    of "trying and asking for forgiveness rather than asking for permission." Our
    discussion after the video was great too, hearing everyone's different thoughts
    gave me a better understanding of the pros and cons of the new shopping cart design.
- desc: The process a product designer has to go through in order to make a product
    successful. A product can never be perfect there could be improvements made everywhere.
    It depends on the perspective of a person.
- desc: The statement "Apart from nature, everything else is designed by us" by David
    Kelley has a deeper significance. He also said that a design approach ought to
    be applied to everything. The phrase "try and ask for forgiveness rather than
    ask for permission" was another intriguing statement.   We talked about the design
    of the cart; in my opinion, over-designing or complicating things would be ineffective
    because modern consumers like basic things. Additionally, a cart with a complex
    design would require upkeep
- desc: 'That while some design(Shoppingcart) Might seem brilliant to some, it does
    not work for all situations. We found many flaws with it '
- desc: I encountered the concept of affordances and effectivities from the readings,
    which is a nifty way to organize concepts as they involve the focal items.
- desc: Video was important in todays class.
- desc: We watched a video, as a class, about the design process of the shopping carts
    which documented the process done by IDEO to redesign the concept of a standard
    shopping cart. After the video, we participated in a class discussion to further
    talk about our opinions regarding the redesign of shopping carts made by IDEO
    and whether or not it was a good idea.
- desc: designer concepts and intentions vs user application, how the designer intends
    their design to be used may not be clear to the user
- desc: It was interesting hearing the opinions of the IDEO CEO, his ideas on group
    discussion made a lot of sense.
- desc: 'It was interesting to hear everyones thoughts on the gaps in the shopping
    cart desgin. It is interesting to think that even if something is desgined over
    a long time and by many people, it seems quite difficult to design something that
    doesn''t have some issues with it. '
- desc: An important perspective I learned is that trying stuff and asking for forgiveness
    instead of asking for permission is the way people come up with new ideas.
- desc: 'Design and importance of theory and practice '
- desc: designing new technology and implement in our day to day life
- desc: For today there was the video of IDEO- shopping cart design processes, and
    further discussion carried on during the class about designs of wheels of cars
    and furthermore.
- desc: We went through how cart was designed and talk about design flaws
- desc: 'We watched a video about designing a shopping cart, it was very inspiring. '
- desc: 'Shopping Cart Design '

- desc: The redesign of the shopping cart by IDEO and their design process.
- desc: "We looked at the design process of a shopping cart at IDEO and discussed\
    \ the good and bad of their design. After this, we learned about the concept of\
    \ the designer\u2019s model, the user\u2019s model, and the system image, which\
    \ briefly about designers want users to be identical to their model by designing\
    \ a clear system image."

    is now over 20 years old, I think it would be very interesting to see what a modern
    day redesign might look like.
- desc: 'I would like to learn more about whether or not design processes like that
    of IDEO are actually becoming more industry standard, and if not, why there might
    be more pushback against that kind of workshopping and teamwork. '
