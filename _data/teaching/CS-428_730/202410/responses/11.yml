difficult:
- desc: Nothing comes to mind.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'Everything was easy to understand '
- desc: The dark patterns was a little difficult but still an interesting topic, once
    I got over the hump was an esay topic to learn
- desc: nope
- desc: 'NO'
- desc: 'No. It was easy. '
- desc: Everything talked about today was clear and I understood it all
- desc: No everything was understandable.
- desc: I had a difficult time understanding the differences between the classification,
    because it seems that sometimes designs will fit into multiple categories.
- desc: The add phone number design
- desc: not at all
- desc: I was a bit puzzled about the quiz answers, but thankfully the first one was
    changed and accepted for my answers, as I genuinly thought I was correct.
- desc: Why would anyone in their right mind design a Postal code finder like that
    on a website
- desc: Yes, I found that sometimes it would be hard to point out what we can do to
    improve the interface, so it could be more user-friendly and easy to understand.
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: No I didn't  find anything difficult to understand in todays lecture.
- desc: No. I understood everything.
- desc: 'No there isn''t anything that is difficult to understand. '
- desc: Why the floral shop decided that Postal code navigator was a good idea haha
- desc: 'No everything was pretty well explained '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No, things were pretty clear to me. '
- desc: No.
- desc: N/A
- desc: 'No '
- desc: I would not say difficult but the web design photos for interaction of the
    car dashboard and the parking pay station ticket counter machine picture, just
    need more research, interaction, and practice I would say for designing or redesigning
    them.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing!
- desc: 'No'
- desc: None
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There was nothing difficult to understand in class today.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: no , it was all great!
- desc: 'No nothing is difficult as usual all good '
- desc: N/a
important:
- desc: There were several perspectives discussed today. First one was about flower
    website, and the importance of making the order process user friendly. Specifically
    what was mentioned is the postal code field should be able to detect the postal
    code being entered, instead of providing large number of suggested ones. Similar
    for a phone number input field. Programmers should not be lazy when implementing
    such things. Another one was about parking payment machine, and the instructions
    that are placed on it.
- desc: Discussing Zoom Layout and Dark Patterns
- desc: 'Interaction types '
- desc: Dark patterns was an interesting topic of discussion and intersting that there
    is research into the topic
- desc: The importance of empathetic design over apathetic
- desc: 'Today we learn "normative perspectives" in the context of analyzing dark
    patterns in user interface design. This concept highlights the importance of considering
    ethical, legal, and societal norms when evaluating the impact of design choices
    on individuals and society. '
- desc: 'AI in day-to-day life and as we know anything as its own advantages and drawbacks. '
- desc: the new heater design and the bad flower site set up for address
- desc: Not clear enough instructions on Zoom when entering the number
- desc: 'AI Assistance '
- desc: Today I learned about classifying the different types of interactions, allowing
    me to speak about design in a more academic and professional way.
- desc: Type of interaction regarding the ticket system
- desc: talked about parkade problems and also dark patterns
- desc: I learned that I might need to take a closer look at the readings, as I had
    incorrect answers for the quiz response despite genuinely doing the readings.
    I also learned the different ways in which users are informed on using a specific
    interface, regarding mostly that of the U of R pay to park machine located in
    the KIN building.
- desc: We looked at another interface, this time it was a pay station for parking.
    We addressed the 5 cases of interaction and in this case it was instructing. However
    there were some issues with it in terms of organization and ease of use so there's
    room for improvement there.
- desc: 'Today the general theme was responsibility: is it the designer''s responsibility
    to ensure that wrong input is handled, or is it the user''s responsibility to
    input correctly? We discussed how a designer might handle taking on more of that
    responsibility with various in-class case studies. '
- desc: That instructions on how to do something may be clear to some but very confusing
    to others
- desc: 'Some websites have a really bad user interface, which is not user-friendly
    and functional. The reason is mainly because of the developers of the website. '
- desc: I enjoyed learning about concepts like constraints, discoverability, feedback
    their differences and the different interaction types. I also enjoyed reading
    about the Lego motorcycle from the book, The design of everyday things.
- desc: 'In todays lecture we studied and discussed about a online flower ordering
    website in which we found some design issues and discussed how we can improve
    it. We also discussed parkade problem and did a poll for that problem. '
- desc: 'We discussed parkade problem which was a informative part of lecture as well
    as did some discussion on weather control settings. '
- desc: 'Balance between ensuring correct input and bad interface for user '
- desc: About AI assistant that replaces customer service representative.
- desc: I encountered the idea of how important validation is for the user so they
    are not wasting time!
- desc: AI assistant not helpful.
- desc: We talked about a few more design concepts and we discussed, as a class, whether
    or not these design concepts are done in a good or bad way. In addition to that,
    the professor also mentioned, at the end of class, that we will discuss the assignments
    and projects' groups next class and that we will talk further about the first
    assignment in more detail
- desc: interaction types, how to know what to do
- desc: An important concept was how responsive feedback is a great fallback if the
    other modes of communicating how to use something fails. Like the phone number
    format example.
- desc: dark patterns and type of interactions
- desc: 'I learned that dark patterns are user interfaces that have been carefully
    crafted to trick users into doing things. '
- desc: 'Ordering flowers for delivery in Canada AI assistant not helpful Dark Patterns
    being used Parkade problems Dark Patterns research paper Page '
- desc: Patterns like dark patterns and what there are important to know about
- desc: 'In today''s lecture, we fist saw the teleflora''s website page for ordering
    flowers in canada, the web page design was just normal like any other online shopping
    site. Then we discussed about the AI assistant not helpful due to quality of interaction
    decreases. Also about dark patterns being used, photo on the Parkade problems,
    dark problems research paper, the page in ACM DL user login and account create
    web page, also the Microsoft example which shows the ask AI web page.    '
- desc: Dark Patterns with examples of FTD, parking payment and Car dashboard
- desc: Dark Pattern
- desc: ' Interaction types'
- desc: Dark patterns
- desc: Dark patterns
- desc: "We discussed some examples of interface design, including the poor interface\
    \ of the ZIP code within the flower for delivery website, the indistinct phone\
    \ number format of Zoom\u2019s form, the payment instructions of a parking machine,\
    \ and the redesign DUAL mode of the climate dashboard."
- desc: AI assistant not helpful
- desc: AI not helpful
- desc: Instructing the interaction type in parking kiosk design.
- desc: i found that flowers shop website has poor user interface design and did not
    handle error (phone number) properly which made user confused.
- desc: No matter how much "effort" is put into a products design there will always
    be something people disagree with.
know-more:
- desc: About different validation tools available for address or phone validation
    in the input fields.
- desc: Looking forward to reading Dark Patterns Paper
- desc: 'No'
- desc: More about dark patterns and more examples would be nice to learn more about
- desc: not really
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'I don''t think so. '
- desc: the group assignment and project
- desc: Yes, I am enjoying more now that we are discussing about bad design in software
    I want to learn more of it.
- desc: Parkade problems
- desc: I will learn more about the way interfaces I use in my life can be categorized
- desc: More interaction type examples could possibly help me grasp further
- desc: probably doing some reading and research should help
- desc: Diving a bit more into the pay by park machines, I think it would be interesting
    to not only look at their UI and design, but also their locations around campus.
    As I had mentioned in the chat, not all of them accept coins or cash, which has
    caused me trouble when my credit card was flagged for fraud and I was unable to
    pay for parking until clearing it up. I had to run around the campus looking for
    a machine that would accept coins, all the while I could have been getting a parking
    ticket.
- desc: 'I''m curious if the responsibility is heavier on the designer for specific
    interaction types or if it is the same no matter what the interaction type is. '
- desc: Yes, I wanted to know more about many more ways that we can do to improve
    the interface of applications.
- desc: 'I''m excited to learn more about designing good software and about Human-Computer
    Communication '
- desc: 'I would like to know more about Dark patterns. '
- desc: Yes, I was having hard time finding material for the quiz. I want to know
    more about where can I find link to reading material for the quiz.
- desc: 'Dark patterns '
- desc: 'Better ways to ensure correct input without compromising interface design '
- desc: Want to know more about Dark Patterns.
- desc: Was there a real good reason why the floral shop did that or did they just
    not know how to implement properly??
- desc: I would like to know more about Dark Patterns.
- desc: "with poor designs, what was the ultimate goal of the designer (besides apathy)?\
    \ is it laziness? or is their idea of good design just objectively bad and they\
    \ aren\u2019t aware?"
- desc: 'Dark patterns: Here is a site I found, that has list of dark patterns of
    popular websites:   https://www.deceptive.design/hall-of-shame'
- desc: No.
- desc: N/A
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Yes, as I mentioned above regarding the pictures of different machines and
    editing or designing them, learning about the key concepts of the core of designing
    the machines and then softwares.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Not Really!
- desc: 'No'
- desc: More about dark patterns
- desc: Dark patterns
- desc: I would like to know more about the Dark Patterns and some examples that are
    applied by each interaction type principle.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: Dark patterns.
