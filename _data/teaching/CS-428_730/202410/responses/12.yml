difficult:
- desc: At the end of the class Dr. Hepting was showing us the group formation steps
    in UR Courses. I'm not quite sure what I need to do with this information. Are
    we supposed to create groups as part of the assignment for imaginary students?
- desc: 'Everything was easy to understand '
- desc: not really
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Nothing, everything was clear
- desc: nope, everything was easy to follow
- desc: 'no '
- desc: 'Why do we allow dark patterns '
- desc: Going over the assignment groups was confusing I thought the groups were already
    decided
- desc: 'The project submission was a bit difficult today but need to read more about
    it '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: What is nessacary for group work and the option to work individually
- desc: not at all
- desc: The only difficult I had today was trying to sympathize for users who are
    unwilling to familiarize themselves with their cars, like in the example that
    was spoken to at length among a few classmates and myself. While its easy to blame
    the manufacturer for poor design, it's also easy to gloss over the fact that users
    generally do not familiarize themselves with their vehicles and fail to understand
    what certain things might mean.  I think both sides have responsibilities, so
    no one group should be blamed.
- desc: 'No '
- desc: Why on earth would Trivago not just hire actors to read lines???
- desc: No, everything was straight forward.
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: nope
- desc: Nothing today!
- desc: Nothing too difficult today!
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No, things were pretty clear to me. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No.
- desc: N/A
- desc: 'no but some more responsibility of developers. '
- desc: 'For today''s lecture heuristics not followed: dark patterns, apathy? was
    a topic I was a bit confused about, because dark patterns theory also relate to
    the fraudulent activities which rises a question about missing design part for
    the understanding.'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There was nothing difficult to understand in class today.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: We need understand what to do in assignment and we are confused about that
    please help us student are facing this issue.
- desc: nothing particularly difficult to understand - will go through the paper a
    couple of times
- desc: Nope, great class enjoyed the discussions.
important:
- desc: Today the discussion continued about dark patterns, and whether it is a developer's
    responsibility to design interfaces with the most vulnerable people in mind. Also
    the concepts of Slips and Mistakes were introduced.
- desc: Dark patterns
- desc: The use of ai being helpful from a business perspective (cheap and easier)
    but people might not respond to advertising with it which could be seen as more
    of a waste
- desc: 'Preventing User Errors: Avoiding Unconscious Slips'
- desc: The trivago ads were a really interesting topic, It's something I was not
    aware about,
- desc: How to recognize dark patterns and see how they are used by corporations to
    potentially manipulate users.
- desc: shopping website design and how they affect buyer's mind
- desc: 'That overtime we became compliancent with design choices and new technology '
- desc: Dark Patterns and how companies can be misleading with their information
- desc: 'The important concept I encountered was Keystroke Level Model which is user
    for interface analysis and how this tool is important and functioning '
- desc: Today I learned about dark patterns, and ho they can be used to trick users
- desc: Dark pattern types
- desc: Design for vulnerable potential users, about slips and mistakes
- desc: Dark patterns. Prior to the reading for this class I was oblivious to dark
    patterns, and honestly I thought they were referring to dark mode UI settings,
    which had me genuinely confused for a bit.
- desc: One concept we looked at today is the vulnerability of users when accessing/using
    a particular piece of software/system. For example, the dark patterns method is
    often deployed to deceive the user into doing things they didn't initially plan
    on. Such as adding additional items to shopping carts, downloading additional
    software, bait and switches and there's many others. This raises issues and is
    unethical because the end goal for a lot of these companies is profit and they'll
    do whatever it takes to gain.
- desc: 'No '
- desc: 'Today we went into more detail on whether or not the responsibility falls
    on designers or users when it comes to dark patterns. Also, Daryl spent time doing
    a live demonstration of the URCourses interface to help us conceptualize how we
    could think about approaching the assignment while doing a task (considering the
    empathy map, heuristics, etc).. '
- desc: That many people will go somewhere else when a website or service is poorly
    designed
- desc: I have realized the importance of the trustworthiness and reliability of the
    applications to users. Developers shouldn't trick users by using dark patterns.
- desc: ' The concept of dark patterns was really interesting to learn. '
- desc: 'We talked about assignment and project. Also we had chat about trivago new
    ad. '
- desc: 'Design problems '
- desc: Those Dark Strategies to encapsulate the user were important!
- desc: 'the ads and how developers  uses tricks. '
- desc: We discussed the use of AI in marketing campaigns and/or material such as
    the difference between the old and new Trivago ads and whether or not it is beneficial
    to use AI in such a way. In addition to that we discussed the topic of dark patterns
    and its use and whether it is the responsibility of the developer or user to mitigate
    and be aware of its downsides. Finally, we discussed groupings for the assignments
    and projects that will be used for the rest of the semester.
- desc: dark patterns, ai in advertising, slips and mistakes
- desc: An important perspective was what while using dark design methods may make
    your design more successful in the short term, it can make cause a loss of trust
    from the users in the long run.
- desc: Dark patterns seem especially scary to me. I wonder how many people see these
    as a set of tools rather than something to avoid
- desc: ' should developer to design interface for most vulnerable potential users'
- desc: 'It was interesting to consider that the responsibility to keep developers
    accountable for good design (and non-manipualtive design) should be the users.
    I had always thought that it was soley on the developers and designers to make
    design ethical and user friendly. '
- desc: 'There are two types of user errors: slips where users intend to perform an
    action,  but end up doing another; and mistakes where users have goals that are
    inappropriate for the current problem or task.'
- desc: 'Dark patterns, trivago ads, responsibilities of the consumer and the developer
    for dark patterns, discussion on how to reduce user errors and how to prevent
    slips  '
- desc: Errors and how output depends on them
- desc: In today's lecture, we discussed about responsibilities for developer and
    person using system, there was a poll about the new and old Trivago ads. Also
    the Teleflora website was just like any other shopping web page design. Discussion
    on preventing user errors and preventing unconscious slips. Efforts are never
    supposed to be considered in any type of way, because the outcome is not in our
    hands but the putting the amount of efforts is.
- desc: heuristics for design patterns, Keystroke Level Model for interface analysis
- desc: "dark patterns, Trivago\u2019s AI Design"
- desc: Slips and Mistakes
- desc: dark patterns
- desc: We discussed the responsibilities to the system whether it is developers or
    users. For developers, they should make easy and safe applications for users.
    On the other hand, users need to take their responsibility to be familiar with
    the system. Moreover, we looked at an example of using AI from Trivago ads that
    use the AI to generate multiple languages with the ads. Finally, we learned a
    concept about Slips and Mistakes from users.
- desc: 'Keystroke level model for interface analysis '
- desc: Keystroke level model
- desc: dark pattern
- desc: learnt more about dark patterns and how they affect the user
- desc: It's almost like as we become more and more technologically advanced in society
    we seem to become more complacent and lazy, we expect the technologies we use
    to do everything for us without thought.  We seem to be creating more problems
    then we are fixing.
know-more:
- desc: 'Trivago is using AI now, and the class discussion today showed, that majority
    of students are complacent when it comes to AI, and they compared the dangers
    of AI to dangers of Email when that came out. But as pointed out by Dr. Hepting,
    the dangers are very different. I would like to know more what kind of dangers
    can we expect in the future from AI. Is it going to turn against humanity similar
    to Terminator movies or in a more subtle manner. '
- desc: Project ideas
- desc: The use of ai and how it can be effective and other times not be effective
    for it
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The class project and its requirements
- desc: I actually would like to know more about dark patterns. It is a very interesting
    concept.
- desc: I'd like to further explore what responsibilities lie on a manufacturer or
    a user
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'Hotel? Triviago '
- desc: More about design!
- desc: 'todays class just needed more detail information about the projects ,groups
    and assignment '
- desc: I would like to learn more about the legality surrounding these techniques.
    Especially the one example from Virgin Active, it seems like there might be some
    laws against design in such a way.
- desc: Maybe more about the keystroke level model for interface analysis
- desc: everything was upto mark
- desc: I don't think so, though I also find the user slips and mistakes an interesting
    area of discussion.
- desc: 'No '
- desc: 'I would be curious how much (if at all) regulatory bodies are doing to address
    dark patterns and whether or not there are industry standards or regulatory practices
    that discourage (or encourage) the use of dark patterns. '
- desc: 'No, I believed we have covered lot of topics in the lecture. '
- desc: I'm excited to learn more about designing good software and about Human-Computer
    Communication
- desc: Nope
- desc: 'Dark designs and how ethical they are '
- desc: What other maybe morally questionable design decisions are within our everyday
    applications that we don't always catch?
- desc: 'no'
- desc: more on dark patterns and how easily we can miss them, what manipulation tactics
    are used to trick us
- desc: "Trivago\u2019s AI-Powered Ad Campaign"
- desc: No.
- desc: 'I would like to know more about how to we are going to work on group projects
    and what they actually going to be about and the submission requirements for the
    same '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: I would like to know more about project group formation in the interface and
    the Keystroke Level Model for interface analysis.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: "Trivago\u2019s AI"
- desc: More about dark patterns
- desc: dark patterns
- desc: I would like to know more about the heuristics not followed the dark patterns
    and apathy that you mentioned within the class.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: always eager to learn more about better design and user interfaces
- desc: Dark patterns, design the list goes on.
