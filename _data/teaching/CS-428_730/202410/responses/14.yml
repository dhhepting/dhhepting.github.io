difficult:
- desc: Whether midterm would cover all material that was presented in meeting or
    mostly questions will be from the textbook that we can use during the test
- desc: 'Everything was easy to understand. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: not in particular
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'i did not found anything dificult today '
- desc: None
- desc: is the midterm date still march 5 or is it the 7th
- desc: I was a bit confused on the vending machine recording, how does it work? Is
    it recording at all times where is the camera is it attached to the machine or
    overhead?
- desc: 'There was nothing which i found difficult '
- desc: Not at all.
- desc: Some people had trouble understanding that being recorded in a public place
    is not exactly something you can stop people from doing. There is no expectation
    of privacy when in a public space, so the company does not need your consent to
    record you.
- desc: No, everything was very straight forward.
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No I didn''t find anything difficult to understand in todays class. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing today
- desc: 'no'
- desc: I'm concerned about the details of the midterm, I feel unsure what material
    I should review.
- desc: "No, today\u2019s lecture was easy."
- desc: 'Nothing was difficult understand when Dr. Hepting was our professor '
- desc: No.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Yes, I had this question if we are going to be asked about the privacy related
    to vending machines/ other machines, as we also brought up the topic of privacy
    and personal space.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing. I understood the KLM approach a bit more
- desc: There was no difficulties for today.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: All thing is fine and I am enjoying lectures day by day also getting interested
    in new designing approach.
- desc: not particularly
- desc: n/a
important:
- desc: Vending machines now have facial recognition, and are not labeled to inform
    the user about it.
- desc: 'A facial analysis vending machine in Waterloo that students did not know
    about. Which is pretty scary. '
- desc: 'midterms '
- desc: The use of cameras in vending machines
- desc: 'The important concept we learn is : The Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) is a
    method used in human-computer interaction to estimate how long it will take an
    expert user to accomplish a task on a computer system, provided that they make
    no mistakes.'
- desc: 'AS last class the klm was discussed and i found that as a important concept '
- desc: Design
- desc: the midterm arrangement
- desc: Today the midterm was discussed so that was important because now I know what
    to study
- desc: 'the important conecpt i leanred was KLM calculator and working '
- desc: 'talked about the content on midterm and also some design concepts '
- desc: Learned a lot about vending machines and the cameras in which they use for
    what might be considered shady business practices, such as facial recognition(?)
- desc: Today we talked about interfaces and their role in misuse, such as for facilitating
    abuse or for covert data collection.
- desc: I have found it was very interesting when we were debating about the camera
    in the vending machine
- desc: I got to see the class's different points of view on the news about the surveillance
    and data analysis done by the vending machine. It was an interesting perspective
    to see different views on security cameras, privacy in public and data recognition.
- desc: 'In todays class we discussed about a news article which was not vending machines.
    We had a class discussion on whether using face recognition in a vending machine
    is right or should the company need to provide a warning to the customer that
    they are been recorded. Also we discussed previous responses and its answers. '
- desc: Face ID recognition and its use cases.
- desc: Todays class we discussed about midterm and Vending machine news.
- desc: The midterm will be up to the things we learned over the break!
- desc: 'midterm clarifications, vending machine surveillance '
- desc: When discussing the vending machines, an obvious camera is needed so people
    don't feel deceived. But this is still a case where a machine, that does not need
    to collect data about us, is collecting data. A vending machine just needs to
    dispense snacks locally, it shouldn't need any more input than money and snack
    selection, and if it does more the design should reflect that.
- desc: important concept for me was segregation and integration
- desc: From a business perspective it makes sense why vending machines use facial
    analysis technology, it's to determine what products should be put in the vending
    machines.
- desc: Outlining of systems impacting users
- desc: 'Today''s lecture was good however we discussed about the upcoming midterm
    and what and how would it be. We discussed about the vending machines with facial
    analysis. '
- desc: Vending machine face recognition example, midterm discussion
- desc: The KLM approach
- desc: We discussed personal privacy of the vending machine that has a camera to
    detect the face of customers, and then we looked at the keystroke level model
    example.
- desc: Keystroke Level Model
- desc: Group interfaces
- desc: Regarding the midterm exam and the topic of vending machine face recognition.
- desc: learn about not every machine is not trustable.. like they may install some
    software to collect the information
- desc: learnt abut cameras in vending machines and dark patterns
- desc: 'As we advance in technology, our privacy seems to be more and more non-existent.  Companies
    are using new techniques to gather data on their customers whether they are aware
    of it or not.   '
know-more:
- desc: A summarized study guide for the midterm would be great to have.
- desc: 'I would like to know more about the midterm format. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: How companies will further their use of analytics to further collect data
    on the customer
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no everything was on point '
- desc: None
- desc: I want to learn more about privacy laws, is it legal for a camera to be attached
    to a vending machine what kind of public monitoring is legal and whats illegal?
- desc: 'I dont think so '
- desc: everything was upto the point.
- desc: I thought the E-transfer article was interesting but I wish we talked about
    it in a bit more detail during the class. Personally I found it very crafty, and
    I have to say I wouldn't have thought of such a unique way of reaching out to
    somebody.
- desc: 'I will likely look more into that Online Harm bill that has been proposed,
    because I hadn''t heard of it. '
- desc: No, there wasn't anything.
- desc: 'I''m excited to learn more about designing good software and about Human-Computer
    Interaction '
- desc: 'No, the information provided in the class was sufficient. '
- desc: I want to know more of the format, material and timings for the midterm. Additionally,
    I believe having an open-book exam would greatly benefit us because it allows
    for a deeper understanding of the material and encourages critical thinking rather
    than rote memorization.
- desc: 'Face ID recognition architecture '
- desc: What are these vending machine companies doing with the facial data of the
    people?
- desc: What will the midterm look like in terms of length?
- desc: reasons behind vending machine cameras, data for marketing? sold to other
    companies?
- desc: I would like to know more about risks of AI
- desc: 'Internationalization '
- desc: No.
- desc: 'No today it was easy going '
- desc: I would want to know about the midterm format, total number of question, total
    marks and even a practice midterm would help a lot.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Trying out the KLM approach to see where it's limits lie
- desc: I am still unclear how the KLM calculator works. It would be good if I know
    how to apply it on the real world practice.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: midterm exam
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'will explore more dark patterns '
- desc: What are these companies are using this data for? How they are using it? How
    it's being protected?
