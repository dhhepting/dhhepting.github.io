    all well
- desc: 'No'
- desc: The sketchpad video
- desc: not at all
- desc: The neurolink stuff was a bit hard to follow, but it just feels like it's
    so crazy that it's hard to believe sometimes. I was not aware they had moved on
    to human trials.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: How did we move backward on so many of these ideas
- desc: No, everything was interesting and not too difficult to understand.
- desc: No, today's class was really fun, we go to know a lot interesting inventions
    and functions and applications.
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'Nothing '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: "No I didn\u2019t find anything difficult to understand."
- desc: No.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: I understood everything till todays date
- desc: Not difficult but now will have to prepare for final exams and there is a
    lot of course material to cover so just need guidance for the same, so we can
    achieve good grades.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There were no difficulties.

important:
- desc: Interactive design, sketchpad, assistive technologies including neuralink
    chip. Apple navigator and future of computer-human interactions using smart devices.
- desc: Sketchpad
- desc: Sketchpad
- desc: assignment
- desc: learning about the origins of qwerty
- desc: All the video and the neurolink news
- desc: 'I found the videos Dr.Hepting was showing us were important as back then
    it was cutting-edge technology and it was cool to look at the history of how things
    have evolved. '
- desc: All the various interfaces and how more are being developed
- desc: Today, I encountered the concept of interactive and cooperative computing,
    where users collaborate with computers in problem-solving, marking a significant
    shift from passive to active engagement with technology. Additionally, the importance
    of constraints in graphical manipulation highlighted how flexibility and precision
    enhance the design process, reflecting a fundamental principle in user-centered
    design.
- desc: 'We discussed interface design and it was important since it is on the next
    assignment '
- desc: I see how categorizing interfaces can help experts become more specific about
    concepts, to allow them to dive into more depth in discussion about design topics
- desc: Mostly about the apple knowledge navigator
- desc: 'Talked about proctortrack onboarding quiz, Pioneering and Future Interfaces,
    Sketchpad '
- desc: The evolution of human computer assistants was a very interesting topic to
    explore today. I really enjoyed the videos that we got to watch today, putting
    into perspective how much a virtual assistant has evolved over the past 60 years.
- desc: We watched videos about the history/discovering of certain technologies and
    interfaces and put into perspective how it all progressed/developed to where it
    is today.
- desc: nothing
- desc: 'Today we looked at multiple different "pioneering" interfaces from the past
    to look at new novel ways of interacting with technology. '
- desc: All the video were really good
- desc: That technology was substanially more advanced in the 80s than I thought it
    was
- desc: 'The change of technologies and how people could interact with technologies
    were very interesting topic. '
- desc: WE encountered about sketchpad and how it was invented and what it could do
    with old computer systems. I just thought that was really interesting.
- desc: The Ivan sutherland sketchpad video and the other videos we watched in class
    were really interesting.
- desc: We talked about proctortrack on-boarding quiz and future interface
- desc: The videos we saw in today's class was very interesting and engaging. I really
    find the ideas unqiue. It was great experience watching them.
- desc: 'We watched few videos. I personally liked the video Ivan Sutherland. '
- desc: Pioneering and Future Interfaces
- desc: 'The concept of integration of UI via other systems '
- desc: 'sketch pad, keyboard (qwerty), talking to computer to give instructions '
- desc: Considering the ethics of design and making comparisons to cars never being
    100% safe, but that does not mean we no longer use cars - and this concept can
    be applied to other tech designs.
- desc: demos of futuristic, new, or advanced technologies
- desc: We talked about future interfaces like multitouch interface design.
- desc: An important concept I encountered today is the Computer Sketchpad that understood
    drawings at a high intelligence level back in 1963.
- desc: Today we learned about the concept of sketchpad created by Ivan Sutherland
- desc: Nothing important, just discussed about assignment
- desc: 'In today''s lecture we discussed about proctortrack onboarding quiz (and
    assignment), Pioneering and Future Interfaces. We also watched a youtube video
    in class on Ivan Sutherland Sketchpad demo 1963. '
- desc: Different types of interface types, videos about sketchpad, mother of all
    demos, HP cool town
- desc: Design
- desc: How to build a presentation for interfaces
- desc: We looked at some examples of historical interface.
- desc: Discuss pioneering and future interfaces and view videos such as Sketchpad
    and Apple Knowledge Navigator.
- desc: learn and check out videos about Pioneering and Future Interface
- desc: Learned about sketchpad , dynabook etc.
- desc: I found it interesting in the videos we watched on how back in the day we
    had these idea's for technological advancements which most people thought were
    crazy.  Look at where we are today a lot of these things we saw made it to market.
know-more:
- desc: Negative aspects of the new interactive technologies.
- desc: Proctortrack onboarding quiz.
- desc: Not at this time.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: More video like the computer voice and commands from the past
- desc: 'More about neuralink and whether it will be beneficial or detrimental to
    people '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I wish to learn more about how the designs of interfaces came about and how
    they evolved over time
- desc: I would like to learn more about the professional world of design
- desc: Do we have to do onboarding if already done it
- desc: nope
- desc: 'I think learning a bit more in depth about neurolink and the different things
    that may impose on every day life if it were to become a large scale operation
    would be really interesting to explore. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'Definitely curious about more of the types of interfaces we''re looking at
    right now in technological development and what we would consider novel or pioneering. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Yes, I definitely would like to watch more videos that have been shared in
    the class today.
- desc: 'More information on final exam would be really helpful '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'About DynaBook '
- desc: What UI does a smart fridge use??
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Do we need to onboard protortrack again? If already done for midterm
- desc: No.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Maybe more about final exam and assignments
- desc: Yes, about the sketchpad and other links mentioned on the Dr. Hepting's website
    for today's lecture.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Midterm rubrics
- desc: I would like to know more about the Proctortrack because this is my first
    time working with it.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: today video lecture is good and that is something that take me to new interesting
    side of mine.
- desc: Would explore more about interfaces
