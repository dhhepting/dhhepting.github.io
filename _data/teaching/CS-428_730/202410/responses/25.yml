    be used to understand user groups better
- desc: The meaning of WEIRD
- desc: talked about the quiz and topic is Canada Weird, tradeoffs, etc.
- desc: Canada is in fact WEIRD, though this was encounterd more during the quiz.
    I was also introduced to secure application design and the implications that will
    generally have on a user.
- desc: Went over breakout room feedback and course feedback, then dove into more
    interfaces and concepts
- desc: 'I learnt that canada is weird '
- desc: 'Today we went a bit more into detail on Usable Privacy and Security and what
    a happy medium might look like in terms of providing security and privacy for
    users in a way that is uncomplicated and user friendly. Overall the consensus
    was that it should be easy and should keep users informed but shouldn''t be too
    complicated. '
- desc: That apparently a decent amount of people had issues with the course layout

- desc: some responses about the course, response data about zoom broadcasts and how
    to possibly calculate, privacy and usability

    to allow for better usability, and a balance is required rather than completely
    prioritizing security over usability '
- desc: Discussion about WEIRD, discussion of student feedback on the course structure
- desc: I learned about the Center for Humane Technology and how the advancement of
    technology can have dire consequences.
- desc: Today we learned about some AI, and discussed about the assignments in the
    break out room
- desc: msotly about the assignment
- desc: In today's meeting we discussed about; Is Canada WEIRD, Tradeoffs, Centre
    for Humane Technology and Humane Interfaces, these seem to be important topics
    for the finals.
- desc: WEIRD, Centre for Humane Technology, Humane Interfaces

- desc: Design and exam things
- desc: WEIRD
- desc: The laws proposed for computers, including "do no harm"
- desc: We looked at the survey results of breakout room broadcasting and formative
    feedback. Also, we looked at some terminologies, such as user average. Lastly,
    we discussed a system's usability, privacy, and security that has to be compromised
    to achieve the easy and secure system.
- desc: Usable Privacy and Security
- desc: 'Unable privacy and security '
- desc: We discussed about WEIRD, Usable Privacy and Security, and Humane Interfaces.

- desc: To have and equal balance usability and security when it comes to development.
know-more:
- desc: When and where AI should be used and when/where it should not.
- desc: 'I would like to know more about WEIRD and humane interfaces. '
- desc: the final exam. im not sure how to prepare
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Not about today, but I was wondering about the feedback about assignments.
    We received our grade for our assignment but didn't receive any additional feedback
    to see where we went wrong. Feedback is important in order to constantly improve
    and not make the same mistake in the future.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: I dont think so
- desc: mental model
- desc: 'Want to know a few more details on what will be on the final exam and what
    to study '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I wonder how WEIRD demographics are measured, and used for the development
    of software
- desc: Human interface
- desc: everything was upto the point
- desc: I wish we could have had a better or more substantial conersation about the
    airline design flaw with the landing gear that resulted in a crash. Having a conversation
    amongst the class would have been nicer than just hearing the story, but that
    is a shared responsibility among the students and nothing to do with Daryl.
- desc: 'no'

- desc: The problem with security is it falls not only on the user (sometimes were
    forced into situations we don't want to be apart of) but how the company deals
    with this information and how good they are at keeping it safe.  When it comes
    to security no ones safe there is only a matter of time before something happens.
