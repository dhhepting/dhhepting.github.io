- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No i had confusion on the assignment but it wa cleared up today '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The seperation of groups
- desc: Not at all.
- desc: The most difficult part to understand is how we are going to test the other
    group on our interface and time them to see how long it takes. While I think it's
    a great assignment idea and is really interesting for making the class more interactive
    and fruitful, it is a bit of a confusing process.

- desc: No, everything was easy to understand
- desc: 'NO'

important:
- desc: Learned a bit more about group creation process by watching Dr. Hepting make
    paired groups for testing. Also that ZipCar service is still alive, but be careful
    if you decline cookies, your location may not be correct after that.
- desc: 'Great discussion. Its interesting how small design differences have much
    effect on the usability. '
- desc: Paired groups for testing
- desc: Today I learnt , the significance of usability testing in web design, revealing
    how it serves as a crucial tool for uncovering user experience issues that might
    not be evident to developers or designers. This process highlights the importance
    of viewing a website through the eyes of its users, ensuring that it not only
    meets design expectations but is also intuitive and accessible to those it aims
    to serve.
- desc: Groups for the next assignment and discussion on how the testing will go
- desc: Today I learned about the assignment we will be working on this week, where
    we will be testing interface prototypes from other groups.
- desc: More in depth description on materialize assignment
- desc: Talked about the testing and debugging techniques for the groups and assignment
    groupings
- desc: I learned a good amount about how the next group project will be completed,
    which was very helpful as it involves multi-group interaction.
- desc: Productive breakout room!
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Today was mostly focused on discussing the upcoming final part of the project
    and groups.
- desc: We have discussed about the Zipcar website and Materialize assignment
- desc: testing and debuggin for group settings was what was spoken and demonstrated
    to us
- desc: We discussed about the materialize project and discussed about the website
    on the video we saw
- desc: 'In today''s class we had a discussion about Materialize assignment. As professor
    mentioned all the groups were divided into groupings and this assignment should
    be completed in that groupings, and each grouping consist of two groups. And then
    we had a discussion about the assignment in breakout rooms. '
- desc: The Zipcar website was quite unique. Also the process of forming groups through
    grouping was interesting
- desc: 'We discussed about Zipcar. We also had a chat for upcoming project "Materlize",
    which includes collaborating with other groups. '
- desc: 'The guidance technique in usability tests '
- desc: How much thought must go into design philosophy to make a product that not
    only works but generates satisfaction
- desc: testing website ui/ux, script for that, project groups
- desc: An important concept was seeing how testing Zipcar is similar to how we need
    to test our lofi prototypes
- desc: Group pairing on URCourses, usability/design, zipcar's updated site
- desc: An important concept I encountered today is that there are functional cookies,
    which allow for certain features to run or improve site behaviours, and performance
    cookies, which collect anonymous data on the user's actions.
- desc: Today we learned about MINI MUSWELL
- desc: how user based thinking affects UI
- desc: 'In today''s lecture we discussed about paired groups for testing membership,
    about the video of the previous quiz of zipcar, and then lastly had breakout rooms
    for doubts and questions which really helps a lot for further clarification. '
- desc: Finding and Fixing Usability Problems - Zipcar website, UR courses  - assignment/group
    discussion
- desc: 'Design Metaphor, and Guss '
- desc: Usability
- desc: How to merge groupings
- desc: We looked at how to create paired groups in the UR Courses, and then we looked
    at the Zipcar website from our quiz. Lastly, we went to breakout rooms to discuss
    paired group testing.
- desc: Today, we discussed Mini Muswell, explored the Zipcar website, and had a discussion
    with the testing group for the project in the breakout room.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: We discussed about final exams and next assignment atthe breakout rooms at
    the end
- desc: Explored website , zipcar , discussion about group testing
know-more:
- desc: In what format the Materialize assignment should be. What counts as quantitative
    and qualitative feedback.
- desc: 'About assignment groups and the materialize assignment. '
- desc: The final exam
- desc: 'No'
- desc: More on the final and what will be on it and how i will work
- desc: I would like to know what the other group I will be working with thinks about
    the prototype I will present to them
- desc: Who to work with on final part of project
- desc: Maybe some reading would help understand and comprehend more
- desc: A little more on the assignment would be nice, but the guidance that was provided
    today was much better than that of what I had understood just from reading.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: What do we do if we have difficulty getting the other group in our final project
    to engage?
- desc: No, there wasn't anything

- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: More about usability
- desc: An easier way to merge groupings
- desc: 'I have no questions about the lecture contents. However, I would like to
    know more about the collected data during the testing stage of the Materialize
    assignment. Do we have to record during testing, or taking notes are enough? '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: we discuss about the progress of materialize project and will discuss more
    about testing and script after that
- desc: 'No'
- desc: will exlore more about usability testing
