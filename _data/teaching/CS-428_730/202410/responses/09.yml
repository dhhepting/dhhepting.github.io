difficult:
- desc: Still a little unclear about the first assignment.
- desc: Great discussion.
- desc: 'Everything was easy to understand. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: nope!
- desc: 'I think it was very simple. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'How the groups are set up and what are the assignment requirements '
- desc: The assignment format is sort of difficult and need more clear format
- desc: No, everything was easy.
- desc: I am still having a difficult time creating a group for upcoming assignments
- desc: What exactly to take from the Ford Edge picture
- desc: not at all
- desc: 'The multiple screens/displays to show the temperature controls in the ford
    was massively confusing. It seemed like they wanted to make things more difficult
    for the viewer by adding two different spots to control the vehicle climate. '
- desc: 'Nothing difficult to understand. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'At the beginning of class you started going over some "course feedback",
    and at first I didn''t know what course feedback you were talking about. I figured
    out that I missed a form to fill out under Participation that was put up last
    week, and I was a bit confused on how that slipped past me. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Not really
- desc: What the assignments and projects will entail
- desc: No, nothing was too difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: 'NO'
- desc: 'No I didn''t find anything difficult to understand in the lecture. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No there isn't anything difficult to understand.
- desc: 'Nothing today! '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: I'm still not entirely sure about the assignment and project information.
    It would help me greatly if clean, simple instructions for dates, group sizes,
    and expectations were posted somewhere
- desc: No.
- desc: N/A
- desc: 'Everything was clear to understand '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'Yes, it is 4th week probably and i''m still not clear with few designing
    and altercation about the car dashboard temperature discussion. However I''m still
    working on it after attending the lectures, and would visit office hours for more
    clarity. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Not really!
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There was no difficulties to understand today's content.
- desc: assignment
- desc: No - not particularly anything difficult to understand in today's lecture
- desc: Great class.
important:
- desc: User perspective when it comes to Bluetooth toggle switch in Windows and touch
    controls for climate control in Ford vehicles. What is working wall and what improvements
    can be made to them.
- desc: How a car dash can be improved.
- desc: 'gulf of evaluation, gulf of execution. '
- desc: Evaluation and Execution
- desc: There are courses beign oiffered that build on CS 428
- desc: Learned more ab out the upcoming class assignments and the grouping structure.
- desc: The concept of having either a touch screen or tactile dials and buttons on
    a car dashboard
- desc: 'I always found topic on cars are interesting. '
- desc: We talked about groups and then about design of auto function of car temperature
    control also about bluetooth on and off button which will make it easier to know
    whether it is turned on or off
- desc: UI that can be misunderstood on what the user changed (I.e the bluetooth and
    car heating)
- desc: About how one design flaw can expand and cause bigger issues throughout the
    entire system
- desc: Car Dashboard
- desc: I get to see the perspective of the teacher, creating the URCourses webpage.
- desc: About peoples deliverys about the course organization
- desc: talked about the picture from the dashboard display of ford edge and features
    of it. also talked about the group assignments
- desc: 'The first assignment is going to be working with UR Courses, which I think
    is an awesome opportunity as a student to learn how to use a tool which we use
    and take advantage of as students on a daily basis. '
- desc: We looked at the interface in Daryl's Ford Edge in one of the segments. I
    wanted to make a quick comment about it. All the necessary features from AC to
    temperature are present, however I feel as though some of the features would be
    hard to identify/navigate as you are the driver. M
- desc: 'user interface is important '
- desc: 'Today we talked about the gulfs of evaluation and execution, and looked over
    a couple of case studies in order to analyse what these gulfs can look like in
    practice. '
- desc: About two gulfs
- desc: Information being stored in the world being used as a part of design
- desc: It was interesting to see all the behind the scenes of URCourses
- desc: The important concept was improving the UI so that it can be easier to understand.
- desc: We discussed about what was wrong with Dr Heptings car and talk about moodle
    groups.
- desc: I enjoyed learning about the concepts of  knowledge in the head and world
- desc: We learnt more information about the assignment 1. We discussed about the
    changes made in the ford edge control panel.
- desc: 'In the lecture I learned about our first assignment and professor gave us
    brief description about the assignment and explained how we are gonna work in
    groups. '
- desc: I learned a lot today! The anonymous feedback we did was really helpful for
    making our class better organized. Also, I found the details about two gulfs to
    be interesting.
- desc: The main thing we discussed was gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution.
    The mismatch between our internal aims and the expectations and availability of
    information describing the state of the environment (or an artifact) and how we
    may modify it are referred to as the "gulfs of evaluation and execution."
- desc: 'How design can be confusing to some and simple to others, ex: the blue tooth
    button '
- desc: Dealing with gulfs
- desc: While doing the quiz, encountered the concept of where Knowledge comes from
    that was very interesting! I would have said it was found in a library myself
    haha
- desc: "the ford edge climate controls, does innovation sometimes get in the way\
    \ of user friendliness? the screen in a car is fairly new and innovative, but\
    \ having the climate controls mainly on the screen makes things more difficult\
    \ for when you are actually driving. with analog dials/buttons, you can feel your\
    \ way around. you can\u2019t do that on a screen. "
- desc: Looking at how digital displays can be more informative and user friendly,
    like the Bluetooth settings or car climate controls
- desc: Course organization still seems to be a bigger issue than I thought
- desc: Its interesting that it is so normalized for touch screens to be readily avaliable
    to drivers even though it can be very dangerous. Although some might aregue that
    buttons are easier to use while driving and that you dont need to look at them
    while driving, you still need to search for the right button or knob just as you
    would on a touch screen. Its just interesting that a touch screen is now standard
    in a vehicle even though it is distracting
- desc: 'I encountered the gulf of execution (people try to figure out how it operates)
    and the gulf of evaluation (people try to figure out what happened). '
- desc: 'The important most important topic the professor explained was the assignment
    1 that needs to be done. '
- desc: Today we encountered the concept of gulf of evaluation and the gulf of execution.
- desc: 'cars are always interesting for me '
- desc: 'The important concept I understood in today''s lecture was regarding two
    UX gulfs: evaluation and execution. The other was about windows 10 Bluetooth switch
    look. Also about the car dashboard picture regarding the temperature fluctuations.'
- desc: Assignment groups,  Apollo 13, and Design discussion on Ford Edge dashboard
- desc: It was a review some concept and reviewed picture from prof's Ford Edge
- desc: Ford Edge design and apollo 13 concept
- desc: Norman knowledge source
- desc: Potential options for improving the design of a car infotainment display
- desc: We discussed Gulf Evaluation and Execution. Gulf Evaluation refers to users
    assessing the system state after users do action, and Gulf Execution refers to
    an action to be executed after users plan and determine the system state; this
    occurs as a cycle. In addition, we looked at a couple of examples, the on/off
    position of Bluetooth and the climate dashboard of a car.
- desc: the two gulfs- execution and evaluation
- desc: When Professor Hepting showed us the design of Bluetooth settings on a Windows
    computer, which I had seen before, I initially thought the original design was
    okay, but it still took me some time to grasp the concept from the past. However,
    when Professor Hepting changed the design of Bluetooth settings, I immediately
    understood how they worked at first glance. This made me realize that if something
    is difficult to understand, it's due to the fault of the design, and I can make
    it a lot better to improve.
- desc: Came across different perspectives from other students regarding design of
    Bluetooth buttons and ford car ac controls
- desc: 'The people who make vehicles really need to step back and get more human
    interaction in their designs.  They seem to get more and more complicated each
    time I see one. '
know-more:
- desc: New design related classes that may be offered in the future.
- desc: Looking further for followups.
- desc: 'There is nothing I would like to know more of. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: More about the courses that are going to be added and who is teaching them
- desc: Just more of new topics
- desc: 'Overall, I think what should be talked about in future meetings is assignments
    and exam expectations. '
- desc: 'Why car manufacturers are opting for much more dangerous touchscreens than
    just having analogue controls '
- desc: 'No. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: More about the assignment and upcoming group project
- desc: Temperature changes thing
- desc: I will read more from the textbook to gain more perspective on the content
- desc: About when we might be required to be in groups for a project
- desc: everything was upto the point.
- desc: 'No, I think today was a good and self explanatory '
- desc: 'I want to delve into more complex interfaces, the Bluetooth example was quite
    simple and I''m interested in assessing other designs. '
- desc: 'ford explorer '
- desc: 'I will likely want to know a bit more about the first assignment after I
    have some time to look over it. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: How to better incorporate this as a part of UI design
- desc: Yes, I would like to know more about how to create or improve the UI to be
    more meaningful and easy to understand for users.
- desc: I'm excited to learn more about designing good software and about Human-Computer
    Communication
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No I don''t need any more information on any of the topic we discussed in
    the lecture. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'Can you explain more about the assingment, how will we be marked etc '
- desc: No there isn't anything that I would like to know more.
- desc: I want to know what kind of car you have that these pictures are coming from
    so I can avoid buying that vehicle bahahah
- desc: I would like to start planning, with my group members, how we are going to
    start working on the first assignment and how we are going to distribute the work
    among ourselves.
- desc: more on the testing process for things like the climate controls in the ford
    edge. who was the primary tester? was it designers or general public? were any
    suggestions from the general public taken into consideration?
- desc: No.
- desc: 'I would like to know more about the projects. '
- desc: no things were easy today
- desc: The same issue about the car dashboard picture discussion during class and
    also need more clarity on the assignments and project. Would request Dr. Hepting
    for further discussion and explanation over the assignments and projects in this
    course.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The Assignment given
- desc: None
- desc: I would like to know more about whether we have the format for the assignment
    or not. It would be very appreciated if we have an example of the expected final
    result.
- desc: 'assignment. '
- desc: No- Today was mostly regarding case study type scenarios for windows 10 Bluetooth
    button and ford edge car
- desc: I would really like to be a fly on the wall during the development of these
    newer vehicles, just so I could understand their madness.
