difficult:
- desc: Whether each member of assignment group should submit the same PDF file, or
    only one member should submit for the whole group?
- desc: very engaging
- desc: No.
- desc: 'Sympathetic design was a little harder to understand but I feel like I do '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: not in particular
- desc: 'NO'
- desc: 'No, It was straightforward. '
- desc: no it was easy
- desc: I had to do a little bit of reading to understand the difference between sympathy
    and empathy
- desc: How the map could relate to the assignment
- desc: No, the only difficulty I had understanding was ways to improve the climate
    control system without practically remaking it. I find it fairly difficult to
    use and somewhat backwards that there are two different places to control the
    climate. One should display the current settings, and the other should modify
    the settings. With both of them doing the same thing, it seems redundant which
    is not required in this scenario.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No, there wasn't anything to difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: No I didn't find anything difficult to understand today.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothign today!
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No.
- desc: N/A
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Not really, just need some self study for the discussed topics in the class
    and it should work.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Not really!
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There was no difficulties to understand today's content.
- desc: 'no '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Yes. I am not quite familiar with car climate control system because i don't
    drive. Need to learn more about it.
- desc: allover it was understandable !
- desc: not particularly
- desc: Nope
important:
- desc: Today we  have encountered the concept of Empathy in relation to design. And
    how emphasizing with potential end user and understanding their point of view
    can help in generating useful and intuitive design ideas.
- desc: I liked the idea that the professor asked students for suggestions on the
    mid term questions.
- desc: 'Empathy '
- desc: The empathetic design aspects of designing an interface for a user
- desc: Midterm issues
- desc: Design of the air conditioning on the ford
- desc: The empathy map
- desc: ' Dr.Hepting listens to feedback such as course organization complaints and
    works with students to make it work better. I appreciate that and to me that is
    an important concept because it shows that our professor cares.'
- desc: The difference between sympathy and empathy in regards to design
- desc: the important concept or perspective we learnt today is, even seemingly minor
    aspects like font size can have safety implications, especially in modern vehicles
    where controls are often displayed digitally.
- desc: 'Proper attention product design with example of Tesla''s recall. '
- desc: The empathy map and why designer should use it
- desc: design in technology specially cars
- desc: I see the perspective of designers, to try to have empathy for users while
    designing
- desc: The four quadrants of the empathy map was particularly interesting
- desc: Today I learned about the importance of Empathy rather than sympathy in the
    design process. I also learned about the two diamond design principals, and thought
    a little more about the design of the climate control in the Ford Edge.
- desc: 'nothing '
- desc: 'Today we discussed Empathy vs. Sympathy vs. Apathy in design, and how to
    properly use an empathy map to assess problems in design, because being apathetic
    or only sympathetic aren''t enough in terms of human-centered design. '
- desc: The example that you explained
- desc: That the automotive industry sucks at intuitive design!
- desc: I have realized the importance of user interface, as well as how do we name
    things on the interface, so that users can easily understand.
- desc: We leanr tabout sympathy, empathy and epathy and and discussed about the car
    board designs.
- desc: I got to see the class's thoughts on the car's design. I also really enjoyed
    learning about empathy as it relates to designers.
- desc: 'In todays lecture we learned about a technical designing issue which called
    a tesla recall, we also revisited car climate control and tried to correct some
    of the designing issues and tried to make it more user friendly for that professor
    started a class discussion. '
- desc: Today, I learned about empathy in design. It's all about understanding how
    people feel and what they need when creating things like apps or products. By
    focusing on empathy, we can make designs that really connect with users and make
    their experiences better.
- desc: Evolution and evaluation for perfect design as well as climate control discussion
    and group project as well as group assignments
- desc: About empathy
- desc: I encountered the concept of how important good planning is in designing anything
    technology based
- desc: using empathy when coming up with designs
- desc: Looking at the Ford design and considering how this major car brand could
    change their climate design based on empathy
- desc: Concept of empathy maps, how to make them and how they can help
- desc: An important concept I encountered is that design thinking should follow an
    overall flow of understand, explore, and materialize.
- desc: 'gulf of execution and evaluation, Tesla Recall, design thinking 101, Framework
    for innovation '
- desc: 'concept of empathy in designing '
- desc: how much technology cars pack and how they can be recalled for simple thigs
    as well.
- desc: 'In today''s lecture the discussion on empathy that designers have and put
    in everytime during their work. Tesla''s call regarding their front size being
    too small for the brakes. The car climate control revisited, design thinking 101
    and design council double diamond. '
- desc: How a car dashboard (climate controls) can be improved.
- desc: we discussed about the design.
- desc: Empathy Map, Tesla Recall
- desc: Empathy
- desc: The concept of Empathy map
- desc: We discussed the value of empathy of how to help designer to understand user
    needs. In addition, we looked at the Tesla recall case and the car climate controls,
    and we ideated to improve the climate controls. Lastly, we briefly looked at a
    couple of design processes, including Design Thinking and Double Diamond.
- desc: The capacity of design thinking to improve a particular area of the end user's
    life is what makes it successful.
- desc: Design thinking's success comes on its capacity to alter an element of the
    end user's life.
- desc: The concept of empathy and the car climate control design
- desc: map and structure (flow)
- desc: 'Learnt good opinions regarding the Ac Controls and ideas to improve it -
    learnt about the  importance of empathy '
- desc: 'Design and empathy '
know-more:
- desc: How decisions are made about which design to accept and take into production.
    For example who decided to name the button DUAL.
- desc: looking forward to the mid term questions discussion.
- desc: How can we prepare for the midterm? The readings mentioned in the syllabus
    are not all brought up in lectures.
- desc: 'If there is any real checks or a checklist that one can use to ensure a design
    is more empathic rather than sympathetic '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: More about how emotions are used by designers to design better products
- desc: im content with what i learned today
- desc: Everything was good
- desc: 'Evolution of product design. '
- desc: What kind of design counts as a sympathic design and does that kind of design
    belittle the user?
- desc: 'no but just wanted to know how designs fails '
- desc: I wonder about how current software is tested for usability to gague the experience
    of the users.
- desc: mostly about our midterms
- desc: Nope, I think everything that was covered today was in good detail.
- desc: 'no '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No, there wasn't anything today that I would like to know more.
- desc: 'I''m excited to learn more about designing good software and about Human-Computer
    Communication '
- desc: 'No all the topics were well covered in the class. '
- desc: Ideas to make perfect design.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: More about the midterm please!
- desc: more on example of how apathy, sympathy, and empathy come into play with common
    designs
- desc: No.
- desc: 'I would like to know more about midterm exams and projects.  '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: more or different companies similar to framework for innovation
- desc: Yes, the designing topic about the council double diamond will study about
    it and let know if there are any further questions.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No. '
- desc: Tesla Recall
- desc: More about empathy
- desc: Empathy maps and Frameworks for innovation
- desc: I would like to know more about other design processes that might be applied
    depending on different design scenario.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: a little guidance on assignment .
- desc: we talk about car user interface and something which increase my ideas .So
    overall, i got interested toward this new approach of learning.
- desc: will learn more about design process and double diamond process via internet
- desc: 'I want to do a little more reading about the Tesla recall seems very interesting '
