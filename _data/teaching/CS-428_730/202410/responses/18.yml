- desc: 'Mental models and how they affect our perception differently, so designing

- desc: The mental models and their importance pertaining to interaction design!
- desc: More project discussion, breakout rooms
- desc: An important perspective I learned today is that for UR Courses groups, the
    metaphors are that students are bookmarks and that groups are folders.
- desc: 'In today''s lecture we discussed about Metaphors, Mental Models the Project
    doubts session at last. However the project was understandable after today''s

- desc: No, all the topics were thoroughly discussed
- desc: how to approach the upcoming project
- desc: 'I would like to know more about project '

- desc: I would to know more about mental models
- desc: Still working on bringing the group together to get started

- desc: I want to know more about research credit
- desc: More about the grouping feature on UR Courses

- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: yes would explore more about groups on ur courses
- desc: Metaphors when dealing with design and how to establish better ones everyone
