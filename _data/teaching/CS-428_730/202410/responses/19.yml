    the next part of our project.
- desc: Daryl guided us through the requirements of the group work and put us in breakout
    rooms to discuss with our team members.
- desc: 'Today we looked at the URCourses functionality for shuffling groups and noted
    how many steps it took to do shuffling tasks, along with the lack of feedback
    and consideration of difficulty debugging. This helps contextualize how we should
    be thinking of what can be improved when working on the next parts of our project. '

- desc: It was interesting to speak about the assignments
- desc: We were sent to breakout rooms to discuss about the project
