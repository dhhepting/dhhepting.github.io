difficult:
- desc: Material was fairly easy to understand.
- desc: 'Everything was well layed out and it wws interesting to have those discussions
    in the class. '
- desc: Everything covered today was easy to understand.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: not really
- desc: Nothing, class material was easy to follow.
- desc: I found that the class flowed well and that there wasn't anything too difficult
    to understand
- desc: It was easy to understand.
- desc: Nothing
- desc: why the time of the quiz was difficult for others
- desc: I struggled to understand why the software issues were not discovered in testing
- desc: I think the tire pressure warnings were difficult for me
- desc: Design modules
- desc: everything was understood and upto the point.
- desc: The only difficulty I had today was people asking for the quiz to be reopened
    during class. It's week 3 and I figured people would have it figured out by now.
    Aside from that, what we discussed during the lecture was all good.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: How 17 hours isn't enough time to write a 2 minute quiz
- desc: What was difficult to understand was that a company could overlook dangerous
    levels of radiation due to poor design choices!
- desc: No, there wasn't anything too difficult to understand
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No I feel I was able to understand everything. '
- desc: "No I didn\u2019t find any topic hard to understand."
- desc: Nothing content based that was hard to understand, I do not understand why
    students are complaining that 17 hours to complete a one question quiz is too
    little time!
- desc: Everything was adequately explained.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No.
- desc: 'no everything was easy to understand and good '
- desc: Yes, this time the article about the designer's stance and the question about
    toaster was mainly and deeply about creativity and design perspective but the
    quiz did confuse me and made me rethink about the same from a different perspective.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'I was not able to catch up with the last things which were discussed. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing at all
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I found that the case studies of interface issues are the difficult part to
    follow for me because I do not have background knowledge on those stories, so
    I think it would be better if you could provide us materials or videos to get
    some general ideas about the stories.
- desc: 'No '
- desc: 'No '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: I am not quite sure about the last thing "Apollo 13" which Professor Hepting
    mentioned. May be i google about it later.
- desc: no - not something particularly difficult to understand
- desc: The only thing I found difficult to understand was the quiz answer,  I felt
    like there were a couple different "possible" sources of inspiration
important:
- desc: That design phase of the project is important, it's best to analyze the design
    and come up with the best solution before committing to the work on other aspects,
    such as writing code or building prototypes.
- desc: 'Reading through the article mentioned in the class enabled me to be a whole
    different thought process which I was otherwise unaware of. I learned how designers
    need to take risks and make creative leaps into uncharted territories and differences
    between designers and engineers. '
- desc: I did not know Apollo 13, and Therac-25 had interface issues, I just thought
    it was programming errors!
- desc: About the timing of the quiz
- desc: went over the course calendar and upcoming events as well as a bit about the
    article
- desc: I llearned more about hinking critically especially when it comes to design.
    Tire pressure warnings are not always 100% accurate and there are some patterns
    that can be followed to improve these warnings.
- desc: That although we design layouts for the user, we are not the user
- desc: I found Tire pressure monitoring system very interesting. As in a better UI
    way of representation it provides accurate, timely info. , continuous and reliable
    monitoring. Its better for safety and user experience.
- desc: Today we learned about toast
- desc: the course calender
- desc: Software failing and the reasons it didnt work
- desc: The important concept i learned today was interface design issues regarding
    patients
- desc: Broad and diverse teams working smaller is a better way to approach a problem
- desc: 'talked about designer stance and calendar on urcourses '
- desc: The importance of having feedback on a design - Generally the designer cannot
    think of all the possible uses for a product that many different consumers might
    have. I also learned about the Apollo 13 and the radiation-therapy mishaps that
    took place that showed oversights into the oversight that can often take place
    during the design phase.
- desc: 'having a schedule/routine  is important '
- desc: 'I did enjoy learning more about what went wrong with Apollo-13, because I
    knew only that it happened, not any specifics about what went wrong. It is really
    interesting how the desire to make a task more efficient by breaking it into pieces
    among teams can create issues with compatibility and interoperability. '
- desc: nothing much
- desc: Nothing really that dificult
- desc: That poor design can be solved and remedied with ingenuity and perseverance
- desc: After reading "The Design's stance", I have realized that creativity is not
    a matter of talent but it's a thing that can be trained and developed. Successful
    design depends on a design mindset that is open to possibilities and ready to
    take risks
- desc: 'I really enjoyed leaning about creative ideas and how motivation works with
    the creative ideas of new tools and applications. '
- desc: "This section of the passage that we read was really interesting, and it showed\
    \ me a different way of creative thinking when making designs. \u201C\u201CLook,\
    \ our job is to begin by looking at the history of bread.\" Maybe we want to see\
    \ whether they had a better way to make toast in Renaissance France or on the\
    \ Space Shuttle. We don\u2019t want just to design the curlicues on the side of\
    \ the client's next toaster. Maybe what we\u2019re going to find from looking\
    \ at this history is that the best solution is to put more curlicue\""
- desc: 'case studies of famous interface issues. Eg: the tire pressure sensor'
- desc: 'Today we discussed about the big interface issues. I got to know what big
    projects have faced this kind of interface issues. And checked how the issue was
    solved by Apollo 13 astronauts. '
- desc: ' We discussed about couple of things in today''s lecture.  We talked about
    zoom ui. How zoom link for upcoming events appears when you hover on it, when
    you are already in a meeting. I found David Kelley''s take on design to be quite
    interesting in the Toaster article, particularly the way his teams approach a
    fresh project. Your suggestion to design the screens before programming them was
    also a good one, as it makes it difficult to separate the code later on. '
- desc: 'nothing for us, without us. the importance of including and considering those
    you are designing for '
- desc: The concept of looking at design not just on the small scope but looking at
    the design history of the thing and see if the past had something better.
- desc: 'Important concept was the case studies of famous interface issues: Therac,
    Apollo 13'
- desc: "We discussed the assigned reading \"The Designer\u2019s Stance\" and shared\
    \ our opinions on it, as a class. In addition to that, we talked about some of\
    \ the case studies that involved technical/practical failures such as the Apollo\
    \ 13 and the Therac-25. "
- desc: approach to design, the mindset of it, applying diff perspectives
- desc: It was really interesting learning the more practical/serious importance of
    this sort of stuff, particularly with the Therac and Apollo 13 cases
- desc: That designers need to be confident in making mistakes and need to tons of
    research about users and use cases to make a product that serves its function
    well but also is accessible in the way that the user is most comfortable with.
- desc: I learned that designers create solutions which creates a lot of uncertainty
    while engineers solve solutions with certainty.
- desc: how important  are car features like tire pressure system and how better UI
    will create overall batter customer saticfication.
- desc: The important concept about today's lecture was about tire pressure warnings
    and also interface design issues regarding patients.
- desc: 'We looked at some famous interface issues like Therac, Apollo 13 along with
    the toaster examples form the reading '
- desc: We met with the TA and the professor to discuss the toaster's tire pressure
    warnings and famous interface issues such as Therac and Apollo 13 case studies.
- desc: Tire pressure warning, case study of famous interface like apollo 13
- desc: Middle point between engineering and design
- desc: I discovered about the THERAC 25 incident as well as the implications involved
    with bad design.
- desc: We looked at the case that if we need to design an interface, we have to talk
    to the people who may use the design in order to get trusty information and avoid
    misleading information in the design. In addition, spending time in design to
    look broadly and then narrow down to get a solution is the idea of analyzing problems
    and understanding design opportunities. Lastly, we looked at some brief examples
    of interface issues, such as Therac and Apollo 13.
- desc: small design changes have big impact on various things on our day to day life.
- desc: Small design modifications in different objects can have a significant impact
    on our daily routine.
- desc: The concept of product design - using the example of a toaster. Prior to designing
    a new toaster, it is essential to understand the history of bread making to enhance
    the quality of the final product
- desc: 'concept of tiers and it directly related to designing ,which is something
    i like go through like this type of discussion  '
- desc: learn about user playing an important role in design decisions as the are
    the ones who will actually use a product or service
- desc: No matter how much information we have there will always be some who are uninformed
know-more:
- desc: Possibly about how to analyze the potential design and understand if it meets
    the future users' needs.
- desc: 'I appreciate how professor created an example out of his course design when
    the students were mentioned they miss quizzes, he asked the question as to how
    everyone likes his design, I felt its the small things around us that we can improve.
    But it was interesting how it turned out that the design was good on the professors
    part but the lack of usability on the students ends who missed the tasks. '
- desc: From the topics covered today, there is none I would like to know more.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: '-'
- desc: I think it would be interesting to learn about more case studies of famous
    interface issues such as the therac, Apollo 13
- desc: I would love to know more about the Apollo 13 interface issues. I feel like
    that is such a huge event that may be overlooked by some people and it is something
    that people may not even be aware of. It is a very interesting topic.
- desc: I would now like to read more about the Apollo 13 incident
- desc: 'I would like to discuss more on case study of Apollo 13.  '
- desc: Not right now
- desc: 'no'
- desc: More about the testing phase and what goes down
- desc: i need to get more details regarding the workings of making CO2 and apollo
    13 case study
- desc: More about what to pay attention to in regards to the article
- desc: 'read more about the topics '
- desc: I would like to learn a little more about the radiation therapy design issue
    problems - I know there have been numerous issues, especially in 3rd world countries
    where poor management and operational practices have led to over-exposure of patients.
    It's a very interesting topic in my opinion, because radiation is a silent killer.
- desc: We discussed briefly near the end about the Apollo 13, and more specifically
    the malfunction/demise of it. I would like to know more about this and what specific
    interface errors caused this.
- desc: 'cs flim and alumni night '
- desc: Looking forward to hearing about how Harasis will be supporting the class.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Nope
- desc: Is there other designs throughout history that were exceptionally bad?
- desc: Yes, I would like to read more articles, interviews like this so I can understand
    more about the importance of creativity
- desc: I'm excited to learn more about designing good software and about Human-Computer
    Communication
- desc: More case studies would be good. It will help us understand better.
- desc: I would like to know more about interface issues and would like to learn more
    about this kind of failures.
- desc: 'how to come up with or develop the ability to come up with new ideas, how
    to become more creative if you are not creative '
- desc: I would like to explore design history of some things as well! Maybe go over
    iterations of tire pressure on car dashes and see if they used to have better
    at some point!
- desc: I would like to know more about the Therac, Apollo 13.
- desc: it would be cool to see more into the design process at IDEO
- desc: I would like to learn more about how to prevent deathly mistakes in computing,
    like Therac-25
- desc: 'I would like to further explore the perspective of how an engineer solves
    problems and how designers solve problems. It''s interesting to think that the
    training we get in school has determined if we solve problems in a more mathematical
    sense or if we are well rounded and can do both. '
- desc: No.
- desc: 'no we have got enough information about UI if we include previous classes '
- desc: The accident in the space occurred, that was discussed in the last part of
    lecture, about conserving power and making CO2 scrubbers work, also more to the
    Apollo 13 case study.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: A summary of the last topic.
- desc: yes about the apollo 13
- desc: Approach to design
- desc: I'd like to know more about the THERAC 25 and Apollo 13
- desc: I definitely would like to know more about those two stories of interface
    issues on the problems and solutions.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: want to know more about collaborative design discipline
- desc: 'I would like to know more about the Apollo 13 mission, I''ve seen the movie
    and I don''t know if they followed it to the exact events that happened. '
