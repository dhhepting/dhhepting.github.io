difficult:
- desc: Not at this time. The structure of the course seems relatively straightforward.
- desc: The Zoom whiteboard did not work for me in today's meeting. Everything else
    was clearly relayed in the class and I was able to understand what was explained.
- desc: Don't know much about syllabus.
- desc: The zoom link wasn't working so couldn't join until a classmate with the proper
    link gave us.
- desc: ''
- desc: The use and necessity of the whiteboard was confusing. Not sure how we are
    supposed to use it and how it bee helpful in this class
- desc: I was honestly a bit confused on how to use the Wiki and the structure of
    it. Being the first day of class I am not too worried.
- desc: Everything looks good
- desc: ''
- desc: when exams are and their weight
- desc: The zoom link was difficult to understand as when I first tried to use it,
    it was asking me for a meeting passcode
- desc: I had a hard time using the whiteboard tool in zoom
- desc: The whiteboards tools functionality
- desc: Trying to figure out the zoom whiteboard was difficult, as I believe I only
    had viewer permission and I was unable to actually add any text or writing. While
    this was a setback, I was able to use the Zoom chat box.
- desc: Near the end when we attempted at using the whiteboard to answer the prompted
    question, most of the students didn't have access to the whiteboard and some even
    encountered some bugs/glitches. However, that is just a technical error and had
    no impact on the course material itself.
- desc: 'I wasn''t sure how best to interact with the class to ensure that my contributions
    were recorded or useful. I couldn''t use the whiteboard (perhaps due to permission
    limitations) and found it a bit busy to navigate with other people using it at
    the same time. '
- desc: HCI definition was not clear
- desc: Everything presented in class was easy to understand
- desc: 'The layout of the website is a little confusing '
- desc: No, I understood what was said in the class today.
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: During todays lecture I found hard to understand the class syllabus and what
    will be the flow of the class topic wise.
- desc: Some part of course outline i found difficult to understand such as meetings
    wiki. Would like to understand better.
- desc: 'logging in to zoom was difficult and I couldn''t get the white board to work
    to participate in the discussion in class '
- desc: It was kinda difficult to understand how to get into the zoom meeting itself
    since you said the link was pasted twice on accident, so I had to rely on my friend
    who got an email I think to give me the zoom link that works!
- desc: Using the interactive whiteboard
- desc: The whiteboard. I couldn't use it since there was no toolbar, I assume since
    I didn't have the correct permissions.
- desc: I am not sure if we answer all 3 of these questions or just one of them. Could
    you clarify?
- desc: ''
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: ''
- desc: 'Nothing difficult to understand. '
- desc: Yes, there was difficulty with the white board thing as not everyone could
    write in it. Also the UR Courses site for the course should be a bit easy for
    use of the course.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I was having difficulty understanding how to give attendance, complete the
    after-class review questions, and the quiz before the next class. These were all
    new concepts to me, so I had a hard time figuring out what was expected from us.
    But as the lecture progressed, I gained a better understanding and it became clearer
    to me.
- desc: Nothing at all,Dr Hepting was very concise.
- desc: There wasn't anything particularly difficult to understand but navigating
    the UR courses system as explained and shown by the instructor appears to be something
    that may take a while to get used to.
- desc: It is not quite clear to me how to use the Meetings Wiki and what it uses
    for on our class.
- desc: lty usinNo, there was nothing that was difficult to understand but I had some
    difficug the whiteboard tools, as it was unable to type.
- desc: No - as it was an introductory session with Dr. Hepting, I did not find anything
    difficult to understand.
- desc: Not at all, everything was explained well and was easy to understand.
important:
- desc: As this was our first meeting and mostly the structure of the course was covered,
    we did not get a chance to dive into many concepts. However the main concept that
    will be covered in CS 428 class is Human Computer Communications.
- desc: Everyone's insights on what makes a good design and what makes a bad design.
    It was great to dive into everyone's opinions and compare them to my own.
- desc: Attending meetings is important for this class
- desc: The prof introduced himself and went through his link and urcourses structure
- desc: ''
- desc: What the classs is gonna be about and the overall structure, with textbooks
    and lecture organization explained.
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today was you get from the class what
    you put in. Daryl mentioned about giving thoughtful answers to meeting responses
    and talked about class engagement so to enjoy and do well in the course you have
    to put in what you want to get out of it. '
- desc: The general idea of Human Computer Interaction and what is good and bad design
    means.
- desc: An important concept that we encountered was what makes a design good or bad.
    It was extremely intriguing to see other students opinions on what makes a product
    good or bad design
- desc: the class timeline on the website
- desc: I learned about the class and what would be taught and the mark distribution
    and what we would be learning about
- desc: Most important info was about the website with all the class info, and the
    textbook on the computer
- desc: General overview about the course
- desc: Having access to both UR Courses and Dr. Hepting's website are both important
    parts of being able to access transcripts and other class/lecture material that
    was referenced or will be referenced during class. I also learned the mark breakdown,
    and that the syllabus will be available soon.
- desc: ''
- desc: N/A
- desc: Gave me the idea about HCI
- desc: Gained important information on how the class will be run
- desc: The important concept that was really covered was that this class will be
    heavily engagement focused
- desc: I encountered the concept of design in whiteboard.
- desc: I got to see the classes' different definitions of good and bad design, and
    most importantly, I observed how others categorised different software as either
    good or bad. It was interesting to see how various apps were perceived by the
    majority as good or bad, and the differences in opinion I had with some of their
    categorizations.
- desc: Important concept which I came across during todays class was regarding what
    Human Computer Interactions means. Professor gave us the platform to provide our
    own opinion on this topic and got to learn different perspective of other students
    on HCI
- desc: 'HCI is a important concept based on interaction between human and computers.
    This was a important concept that i learned today and will like to know more in
    future classes of the course. Also how humans interact with computers and computers
    that interact with humans for functional and technical tasks. '
- desc: 'How to navigate the different resources on URcourses, the important dates
    and what to expect in the upcoming classes '
- desc: I encountered the concept of what makes a good program, which I think is a
    very important topic to discuss on. I think everyone knows what bad design decisions
    look like in a program, but it is harder to put into words just what those are.
    This is important for the workforce because you will have clients that will try
    and describe to you what they don't like about a program, and you must recognize
    the good and bad design decisions made there!
- desc: Course introduction, things to consider before our next meeting on Thursday,
    examples of things that account for a good and bad design, and important information
    about final exam with relevance to passing the course.
- desc: The concept of the Zoom whiteboard, I've never used it before and did not
    know it was something that was collaborative.
- desc: An important concept when discussing the requirements for this class was that
    there are quizzes before and after every class to complete. This is important
    to note since I do not have this type of assessment in my other classes.
- desc: The different definitions people were writing in the chat and on the board
    about what they think good/bad design is
- desc: mostly it was a introductory class today.
- desc: The difference between good and bad design. We saw in the zoom meeting that
    many people were having the issue of not being able to write on the whiteboard
    feature. I was also one of those people. Even with a google search, it was difficult
    to get it working. So difficult that I and many others gave up and used the chat
    to respond to the question. This was the perfect example for bad design. It was
    interesting to feel the pains of bad design as we were discussing it.
- desc: 'Introduction to the Course, What is a good Design and poor design if there
    are any examples in your mind tell them. '
- desc: In the first day of class, the important point I marked was passing the final
    for the passing the course and understanding the ley concepts that will further
    come in the course for better understanding.
- desc: What a good design is by reading other's answers (inclass activity)
- desc: It was an introductory session where no concepts regarding HCI were discussed.
    However, there was a discussion on the whiteboard section about good and bad design.
    Apart from that, the professor walked us through the syllabus, our course, and
    his website.
- desc: The Importance of attendance and assignments as requirements to get a good
    grade was an important perspective.
- desc: The important concept I encountered today which stood out to me was the concept
    of good and bad design. Lots of people had quite interesting opinions about it
    and it gave me a new perspective to consider when thinking about good and bad
    design.
- desc: We looked through overall of the course, including respond to meetings, quizzes,
    assignments, textbooks, etc. At the end of the class, we discussed about the differences
    between a good design and a poor design, which in my opinion, a good design would
    help users to easily navigate through the information or solve the pain point
    of users.
- desc: Today, I encountered the important concept or perspective of understanding
    the course outline.
- desc: Today Dr. Hepting walked us through UR Courses for this course and Website
    for important textbooks to refer
- desc: Communication between classmates is a great thing to have, I was having issues
    in the beginning joining the Zoom meeting and low and behold a classmate came
    to the rescue with a new link that worked.

    access to the Syllabus, as well as the textbook requirements and so on. Aside
    from that, I think I got enough out of todays introductory lecture.
- desc: The meeting today was generally very informative and it helped me navigate
    through the course material and resources. However, the syllabus PDF didn't seem
    to be working, so I hope that the syllabus is uploaded soon so I can assess the
    course in detail. As we barely touched the surface of this class, I look forward
    to the upcoming topics and learning.
- desc: 'I am looking forward to the Syllabus becoming available as it will tell me
    more about what the focus of this class will be and how this class will be structured. '
- desc: Application HCI in real world
- desc: ''
- desc: I would like to know the official grade breakdown as well as how many assignments,
    quizzes, and tests (midterm &amp;/|| final) there will be and what they are worth
- desc: not anything in particular.
- desc: I'm excited to learn more about designing good software and understanding
    what makes a design good or bad. Also, I would like to know more about Human-Computer
    Communication and what the class will be about.
- desc: I would like to know more about Human computer interaction and would like
    to know its exact definition and its application in real life.
- desc: HCI fundamentals. This topic i would like to know more in future classes.
    How the interaction of humans with computers work for functional tasks.
- desc: 'I would like to continue the conversation on what makes good vs bad design '
- desc: We were just on the cusp of discussing what a good or bad program looks like,
    and I think I would love to know more about the reasons behind certain design
    decisions.
- desc: I would like to know more about the course's syllabus
- desc: I would like to know more about the syllabus and how the assignments will
    look. Additionally, I would like to know if there will be any groupwork (I would
    prefer to work alone).
- desc: What types of assignments will we be doing? I've heard from past students
    that there is a group project. Will this be the case this semester?
- desc: ''
- desc: I would like to know what book we are using this semester and is it mandatory
- desc: ''
- desc: I would like to know more about the course schedule and also want to know
    more about what the course is actually about ?
- desc: I'm more interested in the assignments part as the professor discussed that
    it will be shortly available and that will be for the key concepts of understanding
    the course as well.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I would like to learn more about the syllabus, assignments, midterms, final
    exams, and the professor's expectations from graduate students (CS730 students).
- desc: How to use the whiteboard
- desc: One thing I would like to get to know more about are the principles behind
    good and bad design as well as why those principles are established the way they
    are. I would also like to know key points to easily spotting good and bad design.
- desc: Since we have discussed about a good design and a poor design, I would like
    to know more about the criteria and methods that are used to evaluate a design.
    Moreover, I would like to know the best practices to follow to design user-friendly
    software.
- desc: I would like to know more about attendance registration. Is it a self-registration
    process?
- desc: Yes, I am excited to learn about HCI in the coming sessions
- desc: In general, yes it is always great to learn new ideas and concepts.  I am
    a new student to the U of R, previously I was a student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic
    in Regina and graduated from the Computer Systems Technology (CST) diploma program
    so I am in the process of understanding how the U of R systems work as they are
    greatly different then what I am used to from Saskpoly.
