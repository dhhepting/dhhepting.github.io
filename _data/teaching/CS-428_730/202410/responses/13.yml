- desc: nope
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'the class was all good and everything was on point '
- desc: Nonr
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Everything that was talked about in class today was made clear to me and I
    understood it all, it was well laid out and taught well
- desc: 'I think todays class was good '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'I was a bit unclear on the final project discussion and what that would look
    like in the amount of time remaining for the semester. '
- desc: No, everything was easy to understand.
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No I didn''t find anything difficult in todays class. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Why there are so many bugs still after so much maintenance?
- desc: 'no'
- desc: it was difficult to understand in the beginning but when professor Hepting  started
    explaining then it made sense
- desc: No.
- desc: Not much I remember of the previous lecture but the KML part was about revising
    and researching by self for students so that we gain more knowledge regarding
    the same.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: The KLM approach
- desc: There is no difficulties.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: KLM calculator
- desc: 'no'
- desc: no particularly
important:
- desc: KLM Modeling concept where you can time how long it takes a user to do a certain
    action
- desc: I learned about keystroke level model.
- desc: 'The introduction of AI '
- desc: 'The important concept we learn today is: The Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)
    is a method used in human-computer interaction to estimate how long it will take
    an expert user to accomplish a task on a computer system.'
- desc: 'the perspective that i got to know today was the Keystroke Level Model and
    its structure '
- desc: It was regarding design
- desc: final explanation of the assignment and a section to add questions for the
    midterm
- desc: 'More about the assignments and midterm was discussed and that helped me because
    I was unsure of what the midterm would be about '
- desc: 'The important conecpt i learned was Keystroke Level Model it helped me to
    understand thefuctioning and other specifications '
- desc: The key concept I learned about today was the keystroke level model
- desc: 'Today we looked into the Keystroke Level Model, which is a method used to
    approach analysis of design by measuring how many actions and how much time it
    takes for a user to complete an action. '
- desc: 'I enjoyed reading about concepts like visceral, reflective, and behavioural
    models of emotion and dark patterns was interesting to learn. '
- desc: 'Important concept which I learnt in the class was Keystroke level model(KLM).
    We also discussed about the assignment. '
- desc: We discussed about assignments and midterm exam.
- desc: 'While making the assignment: using moodle is hard haha'
- desc: keystroke level model, possible harm of ai
- desc: Pig-butchering is an important concept that links to dark patterns in a more
    obviously malicious way than in most game and website design. But in the end all
    of these tactics are used to trick people.
- desc: The assignment clarification was very helpful.
- desc: Centre of humane technology
- desc: The key-stroke level model is important for improving human-computer interactions.
- desc: In the previous lecture, we discussed about the the keystroke level model,
    KML calculator, KML example and mostly assignment discussion as well.
- desc: Pig-butchering, aided by app stores, KLM Calculator
- desc: The KLM approach and the importance of an interface
- desc: We looked at the grouping workflow in the URCourses. Next, we have learned
    about a brief Keystroke-level model.
- desc: Risk of AI
- desc: Keystroke Level Model and KLM calculator
- desc: I know about exam scope
- desc: Learnt about KLM models a little bit
know-more:
- desc: Curious to see what type of questions will be on the midterm
- desc: I would like to know more about the project and when assignment 2 would be
    available
- desc: How AI can adversely affect certain careers and also be used maliciously
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'I need to know more about KLM '
- desc: None
- desc: More information about the midterm, when it is and what it will be on etc
- desc: THere is nothing i found which i need to go in depth
- desc: I wonder how some systems will define an expert user for their assessment
    of KLM, because some systems require different levels of knowledge and skill to
    control
- desc: No, there wasn't anything.
- desc: I would like to know more about the midterm
- desc: 'I would like to know more about KLM. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Is there a better tool for hosting urcourses?
- desc: "where is ai headed? what are some things we\u2019re overlooking?"
- desc: keystorke level mode was quite interesting for me and i would like know more
    about that concept
- desc: No.
- desc: 'I feel the assignment submission was really untidy because we as group of
    only 2 students tried to submit then it was allowing other students as well who
    are together as a group for the project, I feel this glitch should be fixed as
    soon as possible. Even mailed the professor but did not receive any replies. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: The KLM approach and how to use it in a research
- desc: I would like to know more about the Keystroke-level model concept in details.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I want to know more about the Keystroke Level Model, how to use it, and when
    it should be used.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: yes would explore KLM more
