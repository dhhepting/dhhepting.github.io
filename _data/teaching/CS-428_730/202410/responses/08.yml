difficult:
- desc: I was a little confused on the structure of the assignments, how groups would
    function and what exactly is the goal of the Experimental Class. What do we need
    to accomplish with it?
- desc: None, great video discussions to have.
- desc: Everything was easy to understand.
- desc: Some of the frameworks were initially hard to understand
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I am a bit unsure on what the requirements will be for the project
- desc: nope
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No I think today''s lecture was straightforward. '
- desc: The urcourses teaching role
- desc: No everything was made clear
- desc: 'The most difficult task I encounter was the discussion about don Norman ted
    talk video because I still did not got about the juicer working '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Maybe about the cognitive frameworks
- desc: No at all.
- desc: The only thing I had any difficulty understanding at first was the groups
    for the assignments and project. While I thought it was confusing at first, by
    the time class wrapped up it all managed to make sense and I understood. It seemed
    to me like UR Courses might need a bit of work when it comes to making random
    groups.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'NO'
- desc: No, there was nothing I found difficult to understand.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: "No I didn\u2019t find anything difficult to understand"
- desc: 'Nothing. '
- desc: It was tough to understand group creation for assignment and project, but
    discord channel helped to pass it.
- desc: 'I would like to know more about the group projects and assignments '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing today! I understood it all well!
- desc: Formation of groups was a bit difficult for me to understand at first, but
    after the professor clarified some of the doubts I had, it became clear to me.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No.
- desc: N/A
- desc: 'No '
- desc: No just it will take sometime to get useto
- desc: Yes, the site for experiment with the ur courses is still a bit not in parallel
    with the other context provided on the site.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No. '
- desc: About the assignment
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There was no difficulties to understand today's content.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'Nothing is difficult for todays lecture. Moreover ,It seems interesting to
    have group assignment in this subject which help us to grow new possible thought
    related to our subject. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: A little unclear with the assignments, assuming more info to come in the upcoming
    days.
important:
- desc: That tool tips and warning messages are important when it comes to software
    design. An example of this was when Dr. Hepting created new UR Courses experimental
    class, then removed his role as a Teacher, which complicated things. A warning
    message would have been helpful in this situation.
- desc: Very interactive session.
- desc: 'Gulf of evaluation '
- desc: The mention of the cognitive frameworks was an important concept
- desc: assignment group
- desc: How to create groups on Ur courses
- desc: I learned about class assignments and project
- desc: how some designs, while elegant, are not friendly towards someone using it
- desc: Today, we understood the perspective of course design and evaluation from
    the standpoint of user experience on URcourses. It's crucial to consider how students
    interact with course materials, navigate through online platforms like UR Courses,
    and process information to optimize their learning experience.
- desc: I found UR courses interesting to interact with..
- desc: Explanation of assignments
- desc: 'The important concept I encounter today was the new experiment with ur courses
    and its features and is it convenient to us or not '
- desc: A key concept from class was relating functionality and appearance. Like the
    juicer made of gold, the appearance was improved, but at too much cost to the
    functionality.
- desc: Mostly about Gulf of Execution and Evaluation
- desc: talked about assignments and project that will have groups in it. In terms
    of class, we talked about quizzes  and Chapter 4 of design and frameworks
- desc: Today I learned that I am losing more and more hope for Moodle (UR Courses)
    every time I watch Daryl try and use it for something. It seems poorly designed
    for general use, and should really be easier to use and have appropriate warning
    when it comes to making administrative decisions, such as removing one's self
    from the teacher role of a class.
- desc: 'We talked about the gulf of evaluation and execution near the end of the
    class and how it impacts interface design and how to design better user interfaces.
    Essentially, evaluation is whether the system is functional is providing accurate
    feedback/responses and execution refers to the complexity of usability of the
    system (how easy it is to use/run). '
- desc: 'nothing important for me '
- desc: juicer (design with sustainability in mind)
- desc: 'That the course layout on URCourses could perhaps be optimized '
- desc: we discussed about assignment and group projects.
- desc: An important perspective that I encountered was learning about the Gulf of
    Execution and the Gulf of Evaluation and their differences. I also enjoyed watching
    the TED talk.
- desc: We discussed about assignment 1 and assigned groups.
- desc: We discussed about first assignment and we also discussed about how to form
    groups for the assignment and project.
- desc: Today in class, we talked about assignments and how we can approach them.
    I learned that we have the option to work on assignments either individually or
    in a group. It was interesting to know that we have flexibility in how we tackle
    our assignments.
- desc: 'Ux gulf: execution and evaluation. Also got to know teammates for the project
    and assignments.'
- desc: Today's class was all about assignment and project discussion
- desc: "Dan Norman\u2019s concept on different daily products and their usability."
- desc: I learned that this class will have group work in it actually! i did not know
    that when signing up for this class but it was a pleasant surprise!
- desc: We discussed information about assignments and projects and began our group
    formations, to be used for upcoming course activities.
- desc: cognitive frameworks, ways to predict user behaviour
- desc: An important concept I learned today is that knowledge is both in the head
    and in the world.
- desc: 'We encountered important information regarding the assignments and working
    on assignments in groups or individually.  '
- desc: "Design concepts and the Dan Norman\u2019s emotional design book, different\
    \ perspectives on using innovative methods."
- desc: The new ur course was nice to know
- desc: "For today\u2019s meeting experiment with ur courses was done, a poll for\
    \ assignments and projects was given to students for choosing unanimously for\
    \ the further assignments and projects in groups and included with their weightage."
- desc: About Assignments, cognitive frameworks, and insights on Don Norman's juicer
- desc: 'It was more of a making groups and discuss about the assignment. '
- desc: Gulf and execution of design process
- desc: The flexibility of the UR courses platform
- desc: I learnt about new features available on UR Courses.
- desc: We discussed the assignment details and grouping. We also looked at the quiz
    answers and a brief detail with Gulf of Execution and Evaluation.
- desc: Navigating UR courses
- desc: I think I was only be able to see how to do assignments and projects
- desc: Teamwork makes the dream work.

    be reduced.
- desc: I would like to know more about the assignments and projects, I didn't quite
    understand the details that we'll be touching on

- desc: I'd like to learn more about features available to students on UR courses
    and how that can improve my productivity

    framework.
