      So can everyone hear me all right?
      Come on yeses. Okay.
      How's everyone doing today?

11h29:

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So just as we're getting people into the meeting,
      Maybe you didn't hear the notice about this meeting being recorded.
      In my own attempt to record last day's meeting,
      my recording cut out partway through and I've been experimenting with
      zoom to have it produce a transcript, so that a transcript is available
      of each meeting.

11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      To begin with, you can see beside my name in the list of participants
      is a little cloud with a dot on it that says it's recording.
      So the idea is that we can have an audio recording and a transcript
      of it for each meeting.

11h35:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Alright, so there are lots of things going on here.
      What I want to do first of all is to start sharing my screen
      and we can look at the (my) website for this course.

11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Alright, so here's the updated version that should be
      published on the public website soon.
      This screen is from the chat recorded during Thursday's meeting.
      I'm experimenting with the display so you can let me know what you think.
      So DHH, that's me.

11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      In case you're wondering,
      the DHH is Daryl H. Hepting.
      You can call me Daryl or Dr. Hepting
      [or, as Zoom transcribed it, Dr. Happening],
      but I'd like you to pick one of those two.
      So this is the way that I presented the chat and anything that was sent
      to me privately has been excluded.
      The identifiers are consistent throughout the chat session.
      For example, any contribution from the student who typed 'hello!' at 11h29
      during Thursday's meeting will be labelled as S03.

11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      We can keep track of people, but not by names.
      This is a good thing or a bad thing in different situations.
      It is an example of a tradeoff.

11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Student, who points out that everyone should have gotten a note that the
      meeting is recorded, I just wanted to let you know why I'm
      recording it.
      We are not going to share (I'm not going to share the video with you)
      but I'll make the audio recording available and accessible.

11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Then I can also get a transcript of the audio
      and the zoom text chat for each meeting.

11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      OK, so now it makes sense that I can ask a question again about any
      thoughts about the display the chat transcript.

11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay. I think we have everybody in the room now.

11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      A couple of comments and chat transcripts.
      Let me say a few things about recording the screen.
      I'm not interested in the video recording.
      Maybe I will look at it and see if it's possibly helpful.
      But that's not my reason for recording. My reason for recording
      is the audio and the automatic transcript generation.

11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Although the documentation says that the transcript will be ready
      shortly after the video is ready.
      But in my case, with the tests that I did on Thursday and Friday.
      It was a long time. Hours.
      So maybe you can expect to see the transcript of the audio
      tomorrow, sometime.
      So when we have a transcript of the audio,
      it might be helpful for the audio transcript to give context to the chat
      so you can see what things are going on.

11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      And so regarding the de-identified students,
      I was thinking of doing some editing on the chat transcript.
      But then I thought to let it go ahead and be an 'accurate'
      representation of what happened.
      So, if a few people wrote 'hello' and one person wrote 'good morning'
      at 11h30 on Thursday,

11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      then I would just be fine to represent that.
      So I'm making the public version of this chat transcript available
      to help start class discussions.
      I still have the names of people who contributed even
      though the actual names have been removed from the public transcript.
      This seems like it could be a helpful feature.
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      We can close parts of the transcript as well.
      And what about the times?
      Is it better to represent the passage of time?
      This is something to think about.
      Could we increase the usefulness of this transcript
      in terms of the timestamps?
      Would it be helpful to have a visual representation of the
      passage of time?

11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So there is activity at 11h29 and then a gap
      until 11h33 then activity each minute until 11h38.

11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So instead of time stamps, perhaps the question
      that prompted the responses?
      I think that's a worthy goal to be able to have that connection.
      It may be a little bit hard to do.

11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I'm going to hope that the transcript will help
      provide that context, by grouping together things
      that happened at the same time.

11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I didn't. I thought that it might be
      helpful to have some grouping of them.
      Rather than just have each each timestamp, comment,
      or chat message on its own.

11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Think about how to use this transcript,
      and we can talk about it some more on Thursday.
      How can we use this data, or how can this data be
      made as helpful as possible?
       "

      Think about for next day.
      How could you present the chat data so that it is as helpful as possible?
       "
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Is that enough information?
      So something that happens happening here is that there's a delay in
      the chat.
      Answers coming up on the chat are responses to something typed
      (much) earlier.
      Chat is an asynchronous communication form.
      And that's both positive and negative because
      we have to try and put things back together in terms of a thread.

12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH

      " But that's not unlike doing an interview instant messaging.

      OK, so I'll post my artist's rendering of the concept
      of gulfs of execution and evaluation.
      And we'll have a look at the first 2 chapters of material from the textbook
      'Interaction design: beyond human-computer interaction'
      And we didn't talk about my 'impolite robot attack' video --
      all 13 seconds of it. So if you can have a look at that video and
      we'll talk about that too, on Thursday. Okay, thanks very much for your time.
