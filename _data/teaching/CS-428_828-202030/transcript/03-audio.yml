      So I'm trying to use a separate app (otter.ai)
      that I think Zoom is using for its audio transcription.
      I want to see whether I can get the transcript more quickly
      if I have the app on my phone.
      I see that I have 40 minutes of transcription available with the
      free account, but it seems to be transcribing okay.

      And it looks like I'll have to upgrade to a premium
      subscription to get more features that we can try
      next day.
      I want to talk about Zoom and these remote classes.
      This isn't the easiest thing in the world for me and I don't know
      how you feel about it.

      I've turned on polling so let me see if I can add a question to
      the poll.

11h45:

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I'm actually going to launch the poll
      now to see how it works.

11h46:

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so 90% is a pretty good response rate
      so I'm going to end the poll now.
      The 3 people who haven't voted,
      now's your chance!
      Last person.
      Great. So I end the poll.

11h47:

      So this seems like a good way of asking questions.
      Well, it's also good to ask questions of users,
      so that we don't pretend to know what they want,
      just because we're the interface designers, right?
      The question one eye is a Likert scale question.
      It's named after the person who first developed it.

11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      And so the idea is that we have the statements be
      symmetrical about the middle.
      So there is 'Very well' and then 'Very not well'.
      'Well', and 'Not well'.
      In the middle is 'Okay'.
      Here in this case I've given a 'fence to sit on' so to speak.
      Is anyone familiar with that idiom?

11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I'm using
      the waiting room and so as soon as I see that you're in the
      waiting room I'm gonna admit you. So,
      never sure. Well, not.
      I'll, I'll let you in as soon as possible.
      Okay, so does that make sense so lacquered quest Likert scales.
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So the idea is.
      So that's symmetrical so that we have.
      So we have matching items so we have a strongly agree and we
      have a strongly disagree. So that that's one part. So, and the
      other thing is that they're perceptually equidistant.
      So it's symmetrical
      the meet the middle is, it's okay so the the fence to sit on so
      to speak is,
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      sort of,
      no strong opinion.
      So something that would be equal to, not equal to. So, if I said
      it's going. First one is going great.
      It's going well. It's okay.
      And then, I'm a little.
      It's not going as
      well as I hoped.
      Or it could be better. So,
      for example, those aren't.
      Those aren't equally distant equidistant around. So, if they are
      equidistant, we can
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      assign these numbers and
      and go from
      and make some comparisons and
      and gather some data so this is a way to get some
      empirical data
      from users.
      So I've also turned on an exit survey now, so you can give me a
      thumbs up or a thumbs down about what goes well and what doesn't
      go so well.

      So I want to do.
      And an icebreaker.
      So I'm gonna
      ask you the question.
      And then I'm gonna. Well,
      I don't want to put people on the spot, either. So my question
      for you today is
      what what
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      what is a good or bad interface experience that you've had

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I see nobody's putting their hand up to talk.
      And I guess that's okay.
      I'm just wondering if there's a way to
      to get for you to feel like you're engaged in the discussion.
      Because it's hard for me
      looking at a screen with a little picture of me.
      And talking to I don't know who or where.
      I know there's an audience out there somewhere,
      but you might be doing other things too.

      Okay, Student, go ahead and share.
  - persid: SAA
    msg: >-
      Good, thanks.
      Yeah, so I had two experiences. One was with Home Depot,
      where, when you scan an item and self checkout it usually
      takes like 5 or 6 seconds for it to pop up on the actual screen,
      which is like a bad connection to the front end from the database,
      and the other one was bizarre or newer courses Student already
      mentioned it in chat. When we log in. It usually produces just
      some image. And then you need to go back and again log in to get
      to the actual page you're searching for the dashboard.
      These two are linked pretty bad experiences I had.
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Anyone else like to share?

12h03:

      and marry.
      Sorry if.
      Yes, sir. Hello everyone, so I wanted to share like I was like
      shopping for Grassi online so that the website. the searching
      algorithm of that website was very bad like if I want to get
      like any item I would like need to insert proper spelling and
      all the keywords they are using for the searching operation. So
      like, I didn't find it reliable to use, like we don't know what
      keywords they have. So it was very difficult for me at that time
      and a good experience was with top hat. So I like the interface
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      of that application and their website was liquid reliable, and
      it was easy to understand and learn like top head is can be used
      as an alternative of zoom also. So like I'm taking using their
      application in the semester for one of the course.
      Thank you.
      So how do you feel about paying for top hat.
      Yeah, I'm paying for it but I think like the money is worth for
      I feel that, yeah.
      So anyone else.
      And let's see if I can.

    msg: >-
      So, a pet peeve of mine
      is when
      this happens a few places they say. Click here for more
      information. And the link goes to a generic page, but doesn't
      take me to the thing that the question to answer the question I
      was wanting to answer. So somewhere on the page there might be
      some information that will help me answer my question, but
      they've not put me in the place where
      I can
      easily answer that easily find the answer to my question.
      And so now,
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      and takes me to another place to to add another poll.

      Okay, so I've gone after some,
      some messing around here, I've

      Okay, so there's one vote for other.
      And if some if you can let me know what the other is or what
      other ones, if and even if you didn't vote for other which other

      Zoom is the

      So it's not not exclusively but.
      So I have heard of, I haven't heard of slate, actually.
      So I have to do some investigation about that.
      And then a colleague Isn't he likes to use Microsoft Teams
      haven't used Google meet either I guess but I've used Google
      things before.
      Okay, so if there's more to add there.
12h22:

      We can, you can add it in the chat.
      Okay, so, who

      fruit of Skype.
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So just reminder a few
      answer privately. If you can say something to me privately, then
      it's not going to get. I'm not going to transcribe that into the
      chat file that gets distributed. It gets put back onto the
      website. But,
      so the the addition was Skype.
      And I use Skype for years. Seemed like years anyway. And that
      was seems like years ago.
      because now it doesn't work on my Mac.
      And even the when I've upgraded to a previous version
      on my Mac it doesn't seem to work.
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So I've given up on it. I think that's mainly Microsoft.
      It's mainly a Microsoft platform.
      can I see yes her nose, in terms of the first two chapters. The

      I guess.
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Alright, so thank you for that. So, we got four responses. And
      so I think an issue there is the, the show up beside the names
      don't say the checkmarks so
      is it better.
      This one so I haven't used these polls before, but they seem to
      do a better job of
      getting interaction because they, they're anonymous, or they can
      be anonymous.
      So I'm
      for next day I'll have pools prepared.
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So you won't have to go through my typing. And the silence of
      like concentrate on typing correctly spelled words.
      And that may encourage
      everyone to
      participate, a little more freely.
      So would you like me to play videos during zoom or have
      or have them
      to do to free to put the links up for you to review. And then
      discuss them in our,
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      our session so that's that's the way the the flipped classroom
      would work
      that we
      have the material to review outside of
      our meeting time and then
      our zoom meeting time would be four
      questions and working on stuff. Working on activities.
12h29:

      Okay, so Did anyone see

      asynchronous and synchronous and we have learning outcomes.

      So if we go to this page here.
      So I'm.
      I'm working on a better way to organize things on my web page.

      so we'll talk about your courses and go through your courses and
      assignments. Next day, and the attendance is not going to be new
      our courses but.
      Which to me was not a great way to do it. But
      through, through zoom, I believe.
      So these are
      a little bit in flux still.
      So it's, it's
      an opportunity to see how we can
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      make clear. The things you the issues you want to talk about,
      and then link them to our discussions and so making the online
      resources available. So the synchronous and asynchronous
      resources available that help
      you feel comfortable and engaged in this difficult situation
      with zoom and COVID-19. So anyway I want to hear because I have
      a link to the video.
      Inside here.
      So don't blink or you'll miss it but here's, Here's the way my

      Okay only,
      Only 58% 64%.
      So this is a question makes sense.
      So I hope it does.
      So it's telling me, so my take on this as it's telling me that
      me thinking of time in terms of minutes
12h44:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      not correct and it's an error that I should
      I should correct my behavior.
      whereas I disagree.
      So if if it was going to convert it to. If it takes 60 minutes
      and converts to an hour. That would be fine. It doesn't have to
      tell me I'm making an error in the process. That's my that's my
      perspective so I'm outraged. So, when I in the comment, or the
      title, the notes about the video I said it's this isn't quite
      Attack of the killer robots but we can talk about that some more
      the next day.

      I'll get Discord set up as well.
