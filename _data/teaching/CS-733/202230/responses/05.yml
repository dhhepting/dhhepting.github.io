difficult:
- desc: I feel little lost and over the place while trying to understand how the codes
    in html work for drawing different shapes.
important:
- desc: In this session I learned about RGB channels and how to create different colors.
    We tested our knowledge on the triangle and tried to make different colors.
- desc: The magic trick was amazing way for leanring bits . Along with that I got
    to know thw working of the WebGL
- desc: I learned much from the first program in WebGL, vertices, colors and shaders.
- desc: 4 bits per pixel mean 16 levels grayscale
- desc: The most interesting topic was magic trick.
- desc: I learnt about how to draw triangle graphics using html &amp;amp; js.
- desc: Magic trick was amazing.
know-more:
- desc: how to operate the webgl and start practicing some code
- desc: Today I learned about different colors, shading and how RGBA works. Later
    on, we continued with some coding from the textbook. I would like to see more
    on coding in the upcoming meetings.
- desc: I would like to know more about  colour code system and the loading the data
    into the GPU
