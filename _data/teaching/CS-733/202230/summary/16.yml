- desc: Okay How's everyone doing today? See no need this. There's no password anymore
    so you can follow the link by yourself you can thanks do you get emails about
    events which no anyway, so he's uh, he was a friend of mine so you're just
  persid: ''
- desc: putting a few things together so hectic these past few days anyway so don't
    be opposed to some stories about him. In the next couple of days.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So. Okay so chapter five we talked about projections and viewing the
    idea of a camera space, looking at an object with an orientation and then
  persid: ''
- desc: finding the transformations that take our space or space or world space with
    the models and put it into the open coordinates.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that we can finally decide what's what's visible. So we get seen correctly
    display so, chapter six deals with. assignment So that's just what we talked about
    last day. So I was gonna write it up. I'll write it up. Today and post it
  persid: ''
- desc: as well. Okay, so what other things help us to create a Believable Scene Yeah,
    well, I'm gonna make sure that caught up on my pictures of the board today as
    well and transcripts so what are the things help us so now that we can find that
    we're displaying the proper services in the model? What can add to our to the
    realism of the images, what other factors in a scene like this? remodeling the
    room this room what other information is important? Think there's no change.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's better for us actually. Okay, but I'm not sure that you will be
  persid: ''
- desc: able to. Right so we can model we if we cannot extend our model to include
    I will see all this research Oh, very good. Because I have the right kind of marker
    for the sport.
  persid: ''
- desc: Game clean the surfaces in performs better. Ink performs better than if you
    only clean the surface. Idea. It was not that much clean.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm sticking to my argument that these pens it's just supposed to be a whiteboard.
    Anyway, I'm just gonna snow What's up
  persid: ''
- desc: he was saying that everything is linked to the topic now like lighting and
    shading.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we've seen orangette We've just added we've had color on vertices So if
    you want to just add light to a scene
  persid: ''
- desc: let's ignore the fact that the projector on so we just have some light in
    the room. How might we describe that kind of light so it makes sense. So we might
    say we have an ambient light source,
  persid: ''
- desc: just that everything in the scene gets a bit of light. So we don't have to
    have the lights turned on. Or maybe when we're in a dark room and our eyes adjust.
    We can or there's some Sure, let's say it's a dark room your eyes adjust then
    we can perceive some features in the room. Without
  persid: ''
- desc: not having a light source on. Say that it's just there Okay, so what what
    other kinds of late are interest to us? So talking about three different kinds.
    So what if we have what how could we model the sun? Legacy Yeah, so the image
    slate, what direction are the rays coming in?
  persid: ''
- desc: Can you distinguish between different rays? of light from the sun? In our
    There are scenes that say we went outside the classroom building take a picture
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah so then on the other lane layers there but it's far away. Okay, so it's
    there. It's there, but it's very far away. So it just just we're getting laid
    from a certain direction.
  persid: ''
- desc: What's another? What if it's not? What if leg isn't far away? Say that we
    have it in the room so it could be a spotlight. So in the book, they talk about
    spotlight. So then we're modeling a surface that's generated that's giving off
    late into the scene.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's not just it's not just a point of late it's it's an area of what's
    the case if it's not? It's not an area but it's just a point of like.
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's just shoot together for our purposes. Here. So ladies, position so that
    we can see that quality of the latest changing leg is interacting with different
    angles in the scene so for example, where do you see the light from the projector
    reflecting off the whiteboard maybe maybe in this side of the room you do you
    see a light from the projector here
  persid: ''
- desc: reasonable but less you feel confirm left side.
  persid: ''
- desc: Right side. Are you saying it is more Right? Right? Just because of okay so
    if you're
  persid: ''
- desc: here you can see it production I can read at the end. Oh probably I can't
    eat Angus let me do this and then I'll
  persid: ''
- desc: be set as reflection
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so my point is over here you can see a reflection the camera is picking
    up the QR code I never get was I try these QR codes on my excuse me. I never get
  persid: ''
- desc: logged in. So if somebody is not using you're just opening that specific page.
    Still, I think instead of
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I try changing the settings a little bit so I put down auto pick for
    the highest one automatically
  persid: ''
- desc: so point slash spotlight. So it's located a find a distance from the scene
    angles change meaningfully
  persid: ''
- desc: across the sea. Thank you. So in this case, I'm seeing the project the reflection
    here so if the cert so it's a surface property that makes it reflective.
  persid: ''
- desc: And so if the angle project the latest coming into this angle, then I'm getting
    reflection
  persid: ''
- desc: okay all right. So if we're looking at the blood, the Blackboard same thing
    doesn't have any hair. Because the surface is different. So we need to indicate
    a surface we can indicate a surface property
  persid: ''
- desc: To add some information about the surface characteristics of us to deal with
    reflections. So we've already done flat shading where we just assign a color to
    a surface.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how can we incorporate the length position? Okay imagine that's a cube
    so then we're looking at it from one direction so we have a light that looks like
    you are looking at scene in this way so what's important what are the things we
    can measure to describe the interaction of the light and surface shadow
  persid: ''
- desc: bottom side will not be visible that much
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, so if we're looking at a point p here you want to see what the direction
    is to the eye
  persid: ''
- desc: to the light and what other information so we can also have a normal resurface
    normal that makes sense in general terms so we're doing calculations at the vertices.
    And then we're doing interpolation of intensities along the edges and then across
  persid: ''
- desc: the surface. We're interpolating from one edge to the other. So we're
  persid: ''
- desc: getting the color that we're going to assign into our color buffer based on
    these interpolated values so grow, I believe, worked for Renault. French carmaker
    years ago this has been around for a long time. I'm not sure if we're no exists
    as its own brand anymore. Anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: so we get some smooth shading and it's it's more than Can you more pleasing
    them flat shading but it doesn't help us to get highlights. Because the interpolation
    if if the highlight occurs in the middle of a surface, then we're not calculating
    it. Directly
  persid: ''
- desc: and our interpolated values on capture Does that make sense? And we also can
    get some artifacts called Mark bands. Where the
  persid: ''
- desc: colors are in perceive colors for bands because of the interpolation that
    we're doing
  persid: ''
- desc: so how can we improve gross shading so the drawback of gross shading is that
    we don't get
  persid: ''
- desc: these right specular highlights are called. So what are some ideas that we
    can? Contest out there so give me an S at the end because it's plural. I'm looking
    for the plural form any anyone want to ask for a letter? Close resumes How about
    some more letters? The factors
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, that's right. So we have vector information at the vertices and if we
    interpolate them, we interpolate the vectors along the edges and across.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I found a squared the original shading algorithm written to prove that
  persid: ''
- desc: it's and some improvements going to show some examples. Okay, so here are
    the program so let's start with start with wires here so in this case we're just
    approximating a sphere with a triangle very few trials so we can subdivide it
    that's Julie subdivision anyway let's look at the shade cube next so that's doing
    a version of shading. Do you think about? So maybe that leaves something to be
    desired because you know flashes somebody
  persid: ''
- desc: says. So we have the vertex shader which gives us the ambient, diffuse and
    specular component components
  persid: ''
- desc: and here we're setting the alpha for the vertex one and then the fragment
    shader is just passing the color zero by the vertex shader. For the notice the
    fragment color. Describe and describe the late position the different components
    and we can describe the material as its different components. We're getting uniform
    variables assigned to products forgetting the color of it looks not bad here and
    I think let's look at some other examples. The shaded cube so, this isn't doing
    very good conveying the state of the system I wanted to show you this first
  persid: ''
- desc: one okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's rotating around so the lights are moving now let's do the cube as
    well.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's a better look at the queue that's a better interpolation of colors
    on the surface than the first example.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's look at a shaded sphere one so here we have the specular reflection
    on the surface of a sphere. So, let's see how that changes. So we can see that
    we get the idea of the reflection. So the surface of the sphere is shiny, but
    it's not
  persid: ''
- desc: it's not very smooth. Let's try and increase the subdivisions. So that's not
    a bad level of detail. It looks fairly smooth as
  persid: ''
- desc: well rotating decreases subdivision so get a sense that we are actually rotating
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're using normals from the surface and per vertex shading now if we use
    normals and per fragment shading
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so it looks better per vertex shading right? So we can increase subdivisions.
    Just one increase in subdivisions makes us look much smoother
  persid: ''
- desc: so, an issue to overcome is the silhouette so we don't want to see the silhouette
    of the object have lines on it so now I believe this this using vertex normals
    and vertex shading so we're calculating the value of the normal vertex and we're
    calculating the intensity based on each vertex so we can see this is not such
    a great sphere so even as we're increasing the subdivisions here you can see the
    structure of the surfaces still visible to another still still not smooth there
    now it's now is to Vertex normals with fragment shader approach fragment shader
    looks fairly smooth Okay, let's look at the last two to share. We don't have to
    reflections on Life Okay. This is using the vertex shader. So here's the code
  persid: ''
- desc: for the vertex shader. So we're passing in throughout through an attribute
    deposition and the normal vector.
  persid: ''
- desc: And we're running out of vertex color so we're we're finding the vertex finish
    and I coordinate so some guy coordinates the turbine. In orientation Solver, we
    have an eye position we're looking at a position and we have an up vector
  persid: ''
- desc: so those are determined in the eye coordinates. So we're expressing the vertex
    in high coordinates and then kind of seeing if there's a directional light. So
    here we're figuring out elimination. So diffuse specular. So the vertex color
    is a combination of ambient diffuse and specular. So, this general setup makes
    sense we're talking about so how time today pretty well so next day we'll talk
    about per vertex per fragment me questions
  persid: ''
- desc: I have one but the soldering because of this in midterm
  persid: ''
- desc: two we had to write programs know but well we can decide though what might
    say what is a fragment of code do so, concepts and how do we express those concepts
    in WebGL or not? Right, right because the exam could be on paper if we had an
    online exam maybe it's reasonable but I think the assignments are giving you some
    experience with writing code and so don't don't need to do that in the exams Well,
    I'm glad that I could
  persid: ''
- desc: and we also move forward
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm surprised I would think an offline exam would be welcome after my much
    online so is there interest in having some things online? What kinds of things
    we can do online. So well, I know we're talking about the exam. What kinds of
    questions would you think would be better suited to online painting
  persid: ''
- desc: scraping describing the content
  persid: ''
- desc: from images, however,
  persid: ''
- desc: it is not convincing me that an online exam would be better.
  persid: ''
- desc: We can write like what we have to write we can write that
  persid: ''
- desc: why would you write the test on paper and then understand I'm glad it's created
    a moment of levity. Our meeting today thank you eminently more sense to have the
    exam online. I will consider it I guess. From my perspective it's more straightforward
    to have it on paper. Anyway thanks for today. Have a good Day.
