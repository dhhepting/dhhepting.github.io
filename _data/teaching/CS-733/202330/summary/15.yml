- desc: Okay, so this is meeting 15
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So last day in October our last

    day October'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so anyone prepared or anyone

    excited about Halloween anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: have experience with Halloween
  persid: ''
- desc: any costumes?
  persid: ''
- desc: This is going to be my first.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. Well, depending how many

    kids I get on, on Tuesday night'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at my house I have I have some

    candy to bring on Wednesday'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we decided to get these full

    size bars and says little treat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sizes. So that''s the first time

    we''re gonna try that. So we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: see how it goes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Morning
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s my attempt at a pumpkin

    thanks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are we talking about

    last day'
  persid: ''
- desc: we started chapter six
  persid: ''
- desc: about the light lighting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have lighting and shading

    in chapter six yeah so what are'
  persid: ''
- desc: some elements of that?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I was listening to the audio

    from last day and there''s a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of nice writing on the board. So

    I don''t know if but I''ll try and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'post a post them I promised on

    your courses if it''s helpful'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what did we start out with?

    When we looked at cubes spinning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'around or triangles, what

    happened? What did we start'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with? The vertex shader or the

    fragment shader was just putting'
  persid: ''
- desc: out a color right
  persid: ''
- desc: so we had a light position.
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry Adelaide stars
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say we add a point light source

    point in space is emitting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light. So it''s emanating from

    that point in all directions. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: if we have an object
  persid: ''
- desc: that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'found object it''s facing away

    from the late it doesn''t get'
  persid: ''
- desc: illuminated by the light source.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s a way that we can tell

    whether we''re hitting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lights? The latest hitting the

    surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have to see this, from which

    angle the light is coming on to'
  persid: ''
- desc: do to make a contract
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a triangle that has this normal

    vector and we want to we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: test whether the angle between
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light source and the surface

    normal is less than 90 degrees.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Angle is less than 90 Only 10 It

    will be'
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that would be we''d have a

    contribution from the light onto'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that surface if it''s less than

    90 degrees'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is everyone clear about normal

    vectors'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s the vector perpendicular

    from the surface. And because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re using triangles then we

    have one one normal vector for'
  persid: ''
- desc: the triangle.
  persid: ''
- desc: Might have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might think of the normals at

    the vertex at each vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: because
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light the light if it''s a point

    source, it''s close. There might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be a difference in the angle

    that the light source is making'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the surface at that at each

    vertex.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Writing to smile again aren't i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s very generous. So look at

    the normal of each vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we can consider the

    angle of incidence of late may'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be different from point sources

    and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do. So we may also want to

    specify other vectors as'
  persid: ''
- desc: normals.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll talk about texture

    mapping and the next and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: next chapter. Or two
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what do you see you''ve seen

    examples in the text where we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolated colors on a cube

    you can see strips of color that'
  persid: ''
- desc: stand out.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s a perceptual

    phenomenon that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Next lines appear where there

    aren''t supposed to be any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so with gross shooting we''re

    doing using the normals and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lighting vector. So we calculate

    the intensity of the or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color at the vertex. So we''ve

    been calculate them to each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex and then interpolate

    those values. So we still have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an issue there. With Mark bonds

    Mark bands.'
  persid: ''
- desc: In limited potential artifacts
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes. Potential artifact after

    that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is after that potential

    artifacts match me see ah'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wish I had a whiteboard instead

    of a chalkboard. And have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: fighting chance than I think
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is what I saying you can

    do in the vertex shader. This is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something we do in the fragment

    shader.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think I''ve got the issues

    sorted out between my old'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer and my new computer and

    I don''t have.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Don''t have everything quite

    organized yet. So please bear'
  persid: ''
- desc: with me.
  persid: ''
- desc: My computer's not today.
  persid: ''
- desc: I must have said something.
  persid: ''
- desc: preferences that mess me up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe I spoke too soon and I

    said I''ve got everything sorted.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Out
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So this is this is doing
  persid: ''
- desc: everything in the vertex shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're setting up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the vertices for the

    cube and then we indicate the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light position which is going to

    be x y Zed 111. And then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: specify an amount of Ambien lake
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s that''s the amount of

    light that''s going to even if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the surface and being hit by the

    light directly will still get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit of light in the scene on

    that surface.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So another component of lighting

    is the diffuse'
  persid: ''
- desc: which comes from
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light and light hitting the

    surface. And specular relates to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we''re getting a shiny

    highlight on the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this these are some next

    variables describe the material'
  persid: ''
- desc: characteristics
  persid: ''
- desc: doing the quad
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as we''ve done before, except

    we''re adding normal calculation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''re adding a normals array

    and we''re doing the color Q'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which has six phases are setting

    up GL stuff we have test'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so once we''ve computed the color

    cue here, then we''re getting a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normal buffer of butter for the

    normal vectors'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we're associating
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the per vertex attribute of the

    normal with one of the shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we''re doing the same

    with the positions array. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertices.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle that we''re using for

    rotation. Your position so the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'person''s off along that axis and

    20 distance or 20. So we''d have'
  persid: ''
- desc: an orthographic projection
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then we''re multiplying the

    ambient characteristics of light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and being characteristics of the

    material same as diffuse and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specular so you get those

    products and then we''re passing'
  persid: ''
- desc: those into the shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then here we''re specifying the

    modelview matrix and passing it'
  persid: ''
- desc: along to shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Finally, we''re drawing

    triangles. There''s 36 vertices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because there''s six faces. Two

    triangles each. So that''s 12'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles and each triangle has

    three vertices. So let''s we get.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we got a position
  persid: ''
- desc: 'x y Zed of a position based on

    multiplying the modelview matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the position stored in the

    vise invert the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, the light, light position is

    passed in the uniform light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position the uniform for spot

    actor with x y Zed and W'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, we got the lighting vector

    based on the difference between'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the light position and the

    vertex L that we''re going to use'
  persid: ''
- desc: later.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You ever again the normal NDI

    coordinates the Ambien So, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'getting that component of our

    color based on the product we'
  persid: ''
- desc: get from js script.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Diffuse is calculated by the

    angle between the light and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: normal
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specular is calculated So,

    notice you''re doing an exponent'
  persid: ''
- desc: here based on the shininess.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Constant Value times a specular

    product based on the interaction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the light and the surf

    material surface.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I get the position based on

    projection the model view and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the original vertex V color is

    the ambient plus diffuse'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perspective and we set the alpha

    the color to one so, this is all'
  persid: ''
- desc: done in the vertex shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The fragment shader we''re just

    passing'
  persid: ''
- desc: the color from the vertex shader
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry for hiding out there
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so ambient background

    illumination diffuse is.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Speculate specular.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something shiny this is kind of

    shiny this door knob'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, it has some highlight

    wherever you see take a picture'
  persid: ''
- desc: posterity
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you can see me in reflection

    I bet'
  persid: ''
- desc: What's something else has.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay that''s enough I think you

    get the idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does depend on the angle so when

    the light is shining down on it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re getting a very bright

    highlight here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light is coming into the muster

    angle. Island is going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: Less
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea of we do Phong

    shading where we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolating. We''re deferring

    the calculations to the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: shader. That means that
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's say the lake if we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we''re thinking about this

    triangle and light shining down'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at this point, only dealing with

    vertices. We don''t we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to get a bright highlight

    on the spot because we''re only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re calculating here at the

    vertex the vertices, so we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not going to get the full effect

    of that late so it makes sense'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s a bit like our sampling

    issue.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So free, if we''re deferring the

    calculation to the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader, then we can get the

    highlight in the middle of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle and get the highlights

    away. From the vertices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s take a look at the source

    here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can see here, difference

    between the split between the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex and the fragment shader.

    So we get to a position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me check whether it''s

    directional light so like the'
  persid: ''
- desc: sun for example.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then we have the eye

    position. Normalizing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get the normal vector and then

    we''re doing the projection or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the position based on the model

    view times of projection matrix.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re doing the

    transformation so we get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we get transformed through text

    position. And then we''re passing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the normal delayed vector and

    the eye position so you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seeing out for those and then

    the fragment shader we''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in for those and we''re giving a

    fragment color.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re calculating the diffuse

    contribution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the the angle of incidence is

    important here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So thinking about the sun, if

    it''s noon day sun that''s going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to be the brightest and the

    Sun''s right above us. And it''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be less than that sunrise and

    sunset'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we''re doing a specular

    calculation and we''re creating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fragment color based on

    ambient, diffuse and specular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are setting that alpha to one

    Again'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That makes sense about the

    division. Between the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: and the vertex shaders.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will get these examples

    cleaned up and documented as'
  persid: ''
- desc: I've done the other ones
  persid: ''
- desc: and we'll go through them
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again on Wednesday, so there''ll

    be Halloween candy on Wednesday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'To be able to come in the

    costumes. Now that will if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get dressed up on Halloween you

    can send send me a picture'
  persid: ''
- desc: extra candies
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I think we''ll stop there for

    today'
  persid: ''
- desc: any questions or concerns so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll just take care of what you

    said following information and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feedback about the tranquil

    oppression on the HTML page.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What do you mean by providing

    information and feedback'
  persid: ''
- desc: rotation?
  persid: ''
- desc: The rotation angles
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well feedback I guess would be

    updating'
  persid: ''
- desc: updating the display
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interface so you can see what''s

    going on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Some information would be

    information and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the feedback would be wanting

    that application run whatever'
  persid: ''
- desc: you'd like.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the feedback I guess would be

    updating so you identify the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information that you want to

    display on the interface and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation angle and then you

    update that information as as'
  persid: ''
- desc: the program
  persid: ''
- desc: runs.
  persid: ''
- desc: Everything good
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks again for today.
  persid: ''
- desc: See on Wednesday.
  persid: ''
- desc: See on Wednesday.
