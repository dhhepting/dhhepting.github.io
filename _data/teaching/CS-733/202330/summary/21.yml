- desc: 'Yeah so open AI the two board I

    was did Sam Altman and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, I should I should have

    more detail read more details'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about it but so apparently Sam

    Altman is now going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Microsoft, and maybe a bunch of

    people are going to go with him'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in Windows Yeah, I don''t know

    how much I trust Microsoft to to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do the right thing with

    technology. I mean'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Did anyone watch the Grey Cup

    game yesterday? Anyone know what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that is? I I was remiss and not

    telling you about it. That''s it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was the 110. Time the chat, it''s

    a championship of Canadian'
  persid: ''
- desc: football. So 100 and 10th.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Time they played for the cup.

    And it was a very good game.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Montreal Alouettes versus the

    Winnipeg Blue Bombers. And seven'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out of eight panelists pick

    Winnipeg. To win and Montreal'
  persid: ''
- desc: and Montreal won.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And it was I was cheering for

    Montreal because the quarterback'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in Montreal. Well the person who

    was the star for Montreal played'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into Scotch played here last

    year. And he was he was treated'
  persid: ''
- desc: poorly
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I was glad to see that he won

    anyway.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh I should also
  persid: ''
- desc: in summary
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so any questions about

    assignment three.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay and assignment two marks

    have been posted'
  persid: ''
- desc: the signage
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I replied You see that I

    replied. Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sorry. I know that he has

    something to say. So, I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: encourage him to Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because I have an issue with the

    grades not happy with'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Everything was working
  persid: ''
- desc: for Marx.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, can I ask a question?

    Sure. Okay. So, the total'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment is eight marks and

    there are two parts to it. So,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then there is finally like a

    part where you''re graded on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whether it works or and if there

    is adequate comments. Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right. So my both parts were

    both my parts were functioning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perfectly fine. The comments on

    the HTML side was perfectly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fine. Is the Jas side which I

    did not basically segregate as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to what I added into the code

    that is because, like I told you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like before the sufficient I was

    not willing to get that RCT done'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and everything so I was doing it

    in a hurry. And I got deducted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 2.6 marks for that out of a 2.4
  persid: ''
- desc: I got six
  persid: ''
- desc: it's one four of the talking
  persid: ''
- desc: submission for comics.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Show so I was talking to him

    sorry. And you''re sure it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something we can discuss in the

    beginning here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was saying that for the second

    part becoming Samsung something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like make your code different

    from that you understand?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So I don''t want to go into

    specifics in class. But if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a question about the

    assignment I will look at them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today. And I''ll talk with the

    marker. And I''ll deal with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'issues Okay. So let''s see. All

    right. Sounds good. Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So
  persid: ''
- desc: anything else?
  persid: ''
- desc: All good.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. So I want to go through

    we''ll revisit the particle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diffusion example that we have

    that I didn''t explain clearly,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on Wednesday. But we''ll also go

    through a couple more examples'
  persid: ''
- desc: here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in the first example, from

    the text, it says cube'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so some services are translucent

    and some are not. So this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about blending and how to manage

    different values of alpha.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let''s look at the source for

    this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the shaders are fairly

    standard but let''s take a look'
  persid: ''
- desc: at what.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re drying the cube so we

    have 36 vertices, two triangles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'per face per six, six faces with

    two triangles each and each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle has three vertices so

    that makes me six. And then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: have the axes of rotation
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and a very helpful name variable

    called flag and then HSR flag,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hidden surface removal flag. So

    whether or not we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'toggle or they''re going to use

    hidden surface removal or not.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re going to enable

    blending here. So that''s going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to allow us to see
  persid: ''
- desc: a combination of colors.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ve seen the colors here

    are.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in the textbook they talk

    about a combination of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translucent and opaque polygons

    and the way.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way we can deal with that in the

    code is to turn on turn on and'
  persid: ''
- desc: off the depth test.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're gonna be enabled
  persid: ''
- desc: then functions I'm good sorry.
  persid: ''
- desc: Ready that smile?
  persid: ''
- desc: A foolish thing to do.
  persid: ''
- desc: Combining
  persid: ''
- desc: selectively apply
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so why do I say that is one

    second?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Select? selectively?
  persid: ''
- desc: Selectively
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so why should I write it again?

    No, no, no, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perfectly fine selectively. The

    word use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use. So what are some possible

    issues'
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to think of a transparent or

    translucent polygon and an'
  persid: ''
- desc: opaque one.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Blending could just make it

    opaque.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Coffee for updating the depth

    buffer for the trans translucent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ones. Then that might come we

    have the risk of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'having a drunk never show

    because it would not be possible'
  persid: ''
- desc: that it goes behind your vehicle
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source Alpha. With reception in

    the code we subtract the source'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'alpha with one minus of source

    alpha'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we don't want
  persid: ''
- desc: to blend function. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We don''t want that''s not the

    case here. We''re we''re dealing'
  persid: ''
- desc: only with
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s about the optical yeah

    know. So this is how we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: blending.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The idea so let''s look at

    running example again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So for for us the depth buffer
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're doing
  persid: ''
- desc: we started
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re gonna get in is we''re

    using we''re getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m having trouble finding words

    today. Sorry. So if we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translucent polygon in front of

    another one we don''t want we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to blend what''s behind it

    so we don''t want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the forward polygon block

    the ones behind it. So we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'selectively we''re doing opaque

    polygons we can use the depth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer as normal but then we can

    make it read only translucent'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. So this example
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t match the textbook. So

    I''m going how many people are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able to get the textbook and

    look at the eighth edition just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the digital yeah that''s

    that''s all there is really.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So they talk about making

    using the selective making it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making the depth buffer read

    only when we''re dealing with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translucent polygon. So I''m

    going to update this code to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the there''s a line there that

    says if HSR flag and GL enable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'depth test is disable the depth

    test.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, so that''s in service

    removal flag.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's
  persid: ''
- desc: okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I went
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sure another application from

    the text'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I don''t know if this is very

    inspired example. But the idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is rendering the triangle into a

    texture at a lower resolution.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can see the jaggies on

    the edges of the of the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s see if we can make that

    more pronounced.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the red triangle is a texture

    that we''re using and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relying on the Render to the

    screen was the other things this'
  persid: ''
- desc: background square
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s an example of a multi

    pass rendering so we can create'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'textures and then apply them to

    our images'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can see we can generate

    texture to different resolution.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll update this one as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a little better

    documented version of the pic'
  persid: ''
- desc: cube so the idea
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be on a pic surfaces so if we

    click on a pixel location here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how do we decide which with this

    brightly colored cube we can''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: really rely on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particular color to get us

    information, what''s been clicked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and can''t look for a single

    color to identify a face and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'keyboard the background so the

    idea here is that we''re using an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'off screen buffer a frame buffer

    object to render a simplified'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version of the queue where each

    face gets a single color so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t have the blending. We

    don''t have the interpolation'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: we click that's background
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m getting colors. So this

    is just a variation. Building on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is code or the author''s code in

    the text sound sample instead of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just relying on a console dot

    log statement putting into a'
  persid: ''
- desc: text area.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re creating a text

    additional frame buffer. A frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer object we set up and then

    what happens is when we click on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this we have things is usually

    here that we add'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is what I''ve added to

    display the text text area'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we attach a listener to the

    canvas so we can see when the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mouse is pressed. So when that

    happens, we bind to this off'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen frame buffer object we''ve

    created.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And we get rotation angles said

    that with a uniform the paths'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are x y and Zed angles to the

    shader. So we''re doing this for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each face. we''re assigning a

    different color then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drawing those two triangles with

    color and then we''re ever again'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the most coordinates and we''re

    reading the pixel value and that'
  persid: ''
- desc: was nice coordinates
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing read green, blue,

    cyan, magenta yellow. As the six'
  persid: ''
- desc: colors and silver converting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for its if it''s a red, and we

    had the we had four to the name'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'index. If it''s green, the Add

    green is set yet to to a name'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'index. The blue said three out

    of one. So that gives us an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'index into the names of the pick

    colors or names of the colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we're using.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So background is zero. That

    means so we don''t we haven''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'detected any red, green or blue

    now. So think about the card'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'game card trick that I showed

    you. So we start with the guests'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero so if you say no to

    everything. You''re You''re my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your numbers zero. So the same

    way if we don''t add any we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t detect any color and

    we''ve hit the background'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to display. This

    line here is displaying the name'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the lowest tech and then

    we''re switching back to our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'regular frame buffer and we''re

    setting the color index to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero. So then we draw our usual

    normal rendering after doing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: off screen rendering.
  persid: ''
- desc: Exposition
  persid: ''
- desc: sewers this way Alex
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the vertex shader is doing

    the rotation'
  persid: ''
- desc: and it's passing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re getting here in the

    vertex shader. We''re passing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through the attribute color that

    we''ve set for the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then we''re using the uniform

    for color index. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defining first with the colors.

    We''re using seven allocated an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'array of seven spots. because

    zero is important and we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to assign it of color

    index is zero, we''re using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex color that''s passed

    through from the vertex shader.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Otherwise we''re using the color

    from from here. So I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: organized them according to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know reg should know blue should

    be first but it''s got red sets.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is actually sciences that''s

    magenta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because that''s why blue doesn''t

    show up and list here. Let''s fix'
  persid: ''
- desc: that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here are index 1001 And next

    to is 010 which is 233 is 0112'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'plus 111011. Read the sets those

    far six.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: No say there's good enough
  persid: ''
- desc: okay let's see All right.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Today we''ll look at the example

    I sent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s two things going on

    here right? I just won the'
  persid: ''
- desc: drawers the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drawers the point at the new

    position so you can see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: the points being drawn and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the color is being

    diffused the neighboring cells'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so those are the two rendering

    or two shader programs.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the volume to diffuse that''s

    that turns into the denominator'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the shader
  persid: ''
- desc: look at the shaders again.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader one is just passing the

    position a 2d position and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making it into a 3d position and

    then we''re doing passing through'
  persid: ''
- desc: the texture coordinates
  persid: ''
- desc: that were set by the.
  persid: ''
- desc: End the attribute
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s the first shader

    second one is doing the point,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drawing the points and the

    positions are determined here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re setting up the drawing two

    points.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In the fragment shader, the

    first one is doing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diffusion. So it''s getting the

    x&y coordinates the texture and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re dividing through by

    this by the scale which is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fusion or the diffuse parameter

    in JavaScript'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have four terms here. And

    defuses set to four so that just'
  persid: ''
- desc: doesn't average
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second fragment shaders is

    taking.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color that we specify passing as

    a fragment, so that''s program'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two is doing. vertex and

    fragment shaders are drying the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points. program one is doing the

    diffusion. So the way we do this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is we''re going to flipping

    between the textures that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: creating.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we said retexture the render

    texture so we''re reading from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture to begin with her

    reading from texture eight and'
  persid: ''
- desc: read rendering the texture B.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we set up the frame buffer we

    create a frame buffer and bind'
  persid: ''
- desc: to it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we set the texture the render

    texture to be the color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attachment. The color buffer

    attachment for our frame buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: object.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Your eyes added some

    documentation about using a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'single array single data buffer

    for the background vertices and'
  persid: ''
- desc: particles and extra cores
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing program to first

    we have to start are saying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things up we have to use do the

    use program.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Otherwise we can connect to give

    an error if we say if we haven''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'selected to use program to what

    are trying to make assignments'
  persid: ''
- desc: to program to.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was gonna say as I should find

    better names for the program.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One program to program one is

    the defusing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so using that we bind to the

    frame buffer. The frame buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is set up to use sorry, set up

    earlier and then we have read'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture. So we''re going to flip

    between texture and texture be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendered texture between extra B

    or texture a so based on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value of the flag which we''re

    changing the reader render we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: going to change that every time
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surviving to the retexture and

    are attaching the render texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the output for that frame

    buffer.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here we are trying to

    particles. So this is using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: off screen frame buffer object.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we draw after them in one

    color, which is draw half and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of a yellowish color to

    draw the first half that way and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draw the second half with a

    bluish color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we start with four because the

    background squares vertices zero'
  persid: ''
- desc: through three
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we diffuse the articles and

    then we render to display'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we''re we disconnect or

    we re establish our connection'
  persid: ''
- desc: to the display buffer here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing is rendering

    where the drawing the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: was the rendered drawn into
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so all it is is redrawing the

    background try background'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'square. It''s a triangle strip

    from vertices starting at zero'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and for more. And then that

    gives us the texture textured'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'background square and then we

    get ready for the next call by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moving the particles. wrap them

    around as needed. We substituted'
  persid: ''
- desc: the data in our buffer
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we swapped the buffers

    swapped the roles for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: textures
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my explanation today so I''m

    seeing better if you have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chance to look at the code

    earlier to make sense'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I'll do those
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll do those modified versions

    of the code that we looked at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today to match up with a

    textbook and they''re better'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''ll look at chapter nine

    certain GPU capabilities. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can do general purpose computing

    with a GPU or we can do other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more complicated effects using

    the facilities of the GPU. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that particle diffusion one is

    an example of doing off screen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering. And because we''re

    using it on the GPU, we''re able'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do it much more quickly than

    otherwise would have been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possible. So there''s a number of

    things that we can more advanced'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things that we can do with the

    GPU, and frame buffer objects.'

- desc: 'So that''s that''s the gist of

    this chapter. So he''s given us'

    right. are right on time. Oh.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you think it''s more

    interesting with more points,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more particles or less

    particles, sorry.'
