- desc: If and if someday it seems like I've forgotten to do this, you can remind
    me these so you can call me
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll give you two choices stuff you have
  persid: ''
- desc: I noticed in zoom September that appears
  persid: ''
- desc: are happening
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: we're gonna meet Mondays and Wednesdays. So we're getting one Wednesday in
    and August here. And then Monday is Labor Day. So it's a long weekend. And so
    we're meeting next time on the sixth. So we're meeting for 75 minutes so our classes
  persid: ''
- desc: so if I'm writing too small or too, illegibly and you have a question say
    what did you just scribble on the board? Please ask me down and I'll try and correct
    so this is our meetings 125 So 75 minutes
  persid: ''
- desc: so the way you divide, schedule is up this is 150 minutes a week. So it for
    me three times a week times three times 50 minutes and once a week, it's one times
    150 minutes. So that's what a week is worth in terms of schedule, so just because
    of the way things go. We're short what
  persid: ''
- desc: if you're all getting if we didn't have any constraints on the schedule, we'd
    have 26 meetings for our meeting two times a week turns into 13 weeks and that's
    how the math goes but because we have a few things like Truth and Reconciliation
    day, some introductory events on campus I see the big tent in the green and then
    our fall break. Anyway, so we have 25 meetings
  persid: ''
- desc: I think I've said about as much as I can save that so
  persid: ''
- desc: I have a hands on activity for you. Begin, so I'm going to do one as well.
    I'm going to turn these into 10 cards. So it's like
  persid: ''
- desc: arts and crafts portion
  persid: ''
- desc: so when it like you to do is first listen to how I'm gonna set this up and
    then there's gonna be a space for you to write your name. Like the name you'd
    like to be called in class. So don't please don't raise your hand Rachel name
    straight name you'd like me to call it. Like other people I like to be known in
    class Yes, I was gonna
  persid: ''
- desc: do a class Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: You're going to fold
  persid: ''
- desc: the paper in portrait orientation. And you fold it in half and then you're
    going to fold the halves into the middle. So it's gonna be a triangle or 10 it's
    gonna stand on your desk or maybe hanging off your lap or some
  persid: ''
- desc: folding twice this we make now okay. So we have the caper lengthwise
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we take open it up and sort of like a book cover
  persid: ''
- desc: when you fold
  persid: ''
- desc: fold into the middle, so you have four pieces like that. And then it looks
    like a 10 pick aside right in big letters remain you'd like to call
  persid: ''
- desc: me Okay, so that's not the only reason we're doing this but I just wanted
    to explain my idea and it is helped me get to know your names because I haven't
    had a chance you
  persid: ''
- desc: just have one face. I shouldn't do
  persid: ''
- desc: that. Morning well I just kind of the right amount. It's like I counted them
    or something. When I didn't.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: now let me
  persid: ''
- desc: don't often say upgrade to a previous version with a Mac but the HDMI video
    adapter from this company
  persid: ''
- desc: works so well.
  persid: ''
- desc: That's a good sign on the screen stayed in place first try
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Guess I really didn't have to do that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well let's close
  persid: ''
- desc: when we try the HDMI
  persid: ''
- desc: that's better
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: the yellow chairs. Well, there's no carpet in the classroom building I guess
    it's a better workout here. Okay, so so far there's just me in class
  persid: ''
- desc: but I believe that I have enrolled you
  persid: ''
- desc: so let me just switch to student or well actually I want to edit one thing,
    since you're not
  persid: ''
- desc: you're not enrolled yet. I don't want to make this unattainable
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so the first one I'm going to explain it but so for each of our meetings,
    I'm going to ask you to write a response. And over the semester, these will contribute
    to your participation mark, which is 10%. So I'd like you to do it by 11pm. They
    have our meeting so then I can go through them and prepare some material based
    on your responses for the next meeting. So I've set this one to now to Friday
    at 11. So you should have the course pop up. If not today, then first thing tomorrow
    morning so you should have time to do it.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, let me save that
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so this is our URL Courses page
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not gonna click on the links in case they're not all working yet. But
    I'll get them sorted out. So by next meeting, all these things will be sorted
    in place
  persid: ''
- desc: so I've got my own website.
  persid: ''
- desc: material will be on my website, but it's linked to here. So your courses will
    do the assignments and the communication so we can have a class discussion here
  persid: ''
- desc: it's a good platform for doing class discussion. So you've just upgraded this.
    You can keep in mind this is a better or worse experience from your previous classes
    with your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: so I just saw I'm teaching 733 the semester. I've got other things on the
    go but that's the class of teaching. This is a class in the future. So that's
    Monday and Wednesday.
  persid: ''
- desc: 10 to 1115 348.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's my office. Are you familiar? With college West Third floor layout.
    It used to be a few years ago that I was in the alphabetical section of the Department
    of Computer Science. Because we have Dr. Hamilton and Dr. Hepting That's me. And
    then it was Dr. Hiltermann and Dr. Haber. So all of us were alphabetized but that's
    not the case anymore. Anyway, so when you go into the department, office, here's
    the menu
  persid: ''
- desc: you go down the hall and then where there's a key
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, So office hours in three Oh 8.22. What do you think about Tuesday and
    Thursday? That's I don't know if that's a University of Regina. Shorthand but
    are for Thursday. seen it before? Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Dr as Thursday Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Key for Tuesday or Thursday.
  persid: ''
- desc: How does that sound for office hours? What's your other class schedule like?
  persid: ''
- desc: Monday and Wednesday again, but what?
  persid: ''
- desc: So we'll try this out and get a hold of me. Not in these hour. This time.
    Send me an email, we can figure it out. So we have an announcements Forum, which
    hopefully I was able to delete. Because I don't want to keep you informed.
  persid: ''
- desc: But only I can post it
  persid: ''
- desc: so you can reply and type of conversation there. So I'm just in the class
    discussions, forum, the course email, I don't think I can get rid of it. And some
    people like it and it's we used it before
  persid: ''
- desc: we discussed it in the first available skills because he was not happy with
    the way that it was because he did not feel like you have to come here to get
    verified especially more like a chat.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so you get you get an email notification that you've received a course
    email. But the top 90% of the message is useless. And this is to read the message
    you have to click here. It tells you who sent it so I guess that's that that's
    something anyway, but some people like to use it
  persid: ''
- desc: hmm, I thought I got rid of announcements. It was hearing me and let them
    complain when I deleted it but now it just snuck it back in. Okay, so I'm not
    going to post it analysis everything I'm going to post class discussions
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so do attendance. And I'll change the date. For that you can record
    yourself after the fact. I'll set up the same date as the other one. So I've made
    a class wiki so.
  persid: ''
- desc: Not sure how to I'm not I haven't mastered the art of getting people to do
    things that are optional. Anyway and even if I say they're not optional, that
    they contribute to your participation mark and still touch and go
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: I will encourage you to but interesting things that came out of our meeting
    here
  persid: ''
- desc: so there are pages for each of our days. Who would like to be to designate
    somebody to update the wiki each day that's a good idea is that can be productive
    or just let it?
  persid: ''
- desc: dealer's choice
  persid: ''
- desc: who feels like they can be responsive?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I can do. Okay, so you can do today's meeting and then I'll
  persid: ''
- desc: actually I think I can share it with current. We can do hand puppets. Yeah.
    Yeah, we can both be responsible for it. Is it okay? Sure.
  persid: ''
- desc: Just say Don't forget, don't be shy about engaging your peers
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: that's thank you for taking that on. The rest of you.
  persid: ''
- desc: Control
  persid: ''
- desc: current and Argus thank you that you're responsible to and you can contribute
    as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, thanks. So the wiki is HTML. So it's kind of
  persid: ''
- desc: it's a little funny
  persid: ''
- desc: because it's their own wiki stuff but
  persid: ''
- desc: the main thing about the wiki is
  persid: ''
- desc: enclose it in double square brackets, then that creates something and you
    can create the page and mostly it's HTML after that.
  persid: ''
- desc: So here are the responses to meeting so I've added a bit more information
    here than I had in the past.
  persid: ''
- desc: So by 11 o'clock on the day of a meeting right about 100 words and think about
    which of these three descriptors for your response so you either
  persid: ''
- desc: most important thing you learned or encountered the most difficult thing for
    you to understand the thing about which you'd like to know more.
  persid: ''
- desc: So pick
  persid: ''
- desc: a descriptor for your response. Then write the 100 words up to 100 words.
    So I say don't write a summary of what we covered.
  persid: ''
- desc: I say that I've done I've done this in the past I've said that
  persid: ''
- desc: and no one seems to understand or that's been a difficult one to get across.
    So then I'm going to record marks.
  persid: ''
- desc: So two marks are a response that is thoughtful and meaningful. Following instructions
    that I've sent out. One mark if you write a response as instructed and no marks,
    she did not write a response as instructed. So if you didn't write a response
    or you didn't, or maybe you wrote about what we did in class didn't follow the
    instructions. So and this is just
  persid: ''
- desc: this is a way to get you involved. And they said I'm going to take your responses
    and use them next time next meeting.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I've set up a choice activity for the date of the midterm. exam. So.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's the breakdown of marks.
  persid: ''
- desc: We did five last five assignments last time. So five that are worth eight
    points. For so if you attend an adventure exam for 10% and that's going to be
  persid: ''
- desc: a formative evaluation. See how things are going. Now then also at that time,
    I'll ask you to
  persid: ''
- desc: not required. But if you'd like to give me some feedback about how the class
    is going, we'll take that as formative feedback for me, our class so and then
    we can discuss so
  persid: ''
- desc: think this should be open now.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I have three choices for the midterm. So my first day back after the fall
    break is Monday the 16th. And I have a feeling that that's not a good day to have
    an exam when you're just coming back. So I've given choices. Wednesday, the 18th.
    Monday, the 23rd or Wednesday the 25th. So when you find yourself with access
    to the class, you can
  persid: ''
- desc: do this
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we'll talk about it next week. I can't remember what Oh does it say
    closes Monday, September 11. So Monday, September 11. We'll make a decision about
    the day for the midterm.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's
  persid: ''
- desc: that's the layout of the course. Any questions? or concerns?
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're going to work with WebGL and
  persid: ''
- desc: textbook?
  persid: ''
- desc: Not sure if there's two or three authors
  persid: ''
- desc: I think that's his name.
  persid: ''
- desc: Give you the precise title. So the latest latest one.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I think there's a range of good online materials so
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not over the I'm not thrilled about this book but I think it's got a nice
    there's some nice features about it
  persid: ''
- desc: but maybe you can find some other some earlier editions or just look at what's
    online.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I thought maybe I'll show you a quick example with this and then we can
  persid: ''
- desc: have 25 minutes
  persid: ''
- desc: so, let me go to the web's their website and I'll put this
  persid: ''
- desc: material
  persid: ''
- desc: on our webpage.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is three jas.org the website for the library. So talks about the installation
    and making use of it so. So basically we have a web page index dot HTML and then
    a JavaScript file and then there's public there's a public directory that's that
    will contain the static resources for the web application So
  persid: ''
- desc: option one to use an NPM and a build tool. I think that fits with your experience
    already. Sorry you.
  persid: ''
- desc: Are you experts with NPM and node Okay. Good. Glad to hear so I'm just going
    to go through the ions I followed the instructions to set it up
  persid: ''
- desc: you can do this on your own computers now.
  persid: ''
- desc: So once you have it set up
  persid: ''
- desc: and px.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: something that isn't crystal clear in the directions it's a you need to create
    an index dot HTML
  persid: ''
- desc: you need to take
  persid: ''
- desc: say this index file and this main.js file and then create the public directory
    as if you don't it won't start the web server
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's maybe an obvious fix but they could I think they could have mentioned
    that or mentioning it would just make it that much easier to get started.
  persid: ''
- desc: Just because we're not in a class about user experience that's not our main
    focus in this class, but it's still important so I reminds me of a I was an undergraduate
    when I took a class math 231 I believe it was called and we studied was essentially
    about wallpaper patterns and and understanding the 17 different ways that you
    could make repeating wallpaper patterns. And then that semester everywhere I saw
    a piece of some wallpaper I would analyze the pattern. So this is the same thing
    even though I encourage you to think about
  persid: ''
- desc: the usability and user experience issues that come up as we go through the
    stuff. Anyway, okay, so we start this
  persid: ''
- desc: move for Open in Browser
  persid: ''
- desc: think we can I'm not sure why
  persid: ''
- desc: so not bad
  persid: ''
- desc: is it they won't have experience with three js implementation
  persid: ''
- desc: but on the products that they've had the paddling the front end has had three
    Gs implemented
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't want to jump too far ahead and I don't want to
  persid: ''
- desc: are going to take a more hands on approach by looking at the code that's gets
    hidden like the three js library calls.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the index html is the same as the first one they had.
  persid: ''
- desc: Almost
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're importing everything from 333 Jas. So we're making a new scene. We're
    adding a perspective camera we're using WebGL renderer. We're saying the window
    size. And then we're using the Document Object Model to locate our display window
    in the web page. So then we're creating a box unit and the unit size 111.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then we have material which is just
  persid: ''
- desc: just a color
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone tell me what color that is.
  persid: ''
- desc: Because RGB Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not trying to make a face there
  persid: ''
- desc: so one hex digit goes from zero. So two goes to zero
  persid: ''
- desc: so two hex digits, four bits, so we have eight, eight bits of color. So this
    gives us three times 824 events which is which has been the standard. Now there
    are more more bits allocated in some formats. So this is read
  persid: ''
- desc: since five.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we'll talk about color different models for color that maybe are a little
    bit easier to work with. It's okay if you want red, green, blue, cyan, magenta
    yellow.
  persid: ''
- desc: We can work with RGB quite easily. But something that's a bit more it's harder
    to move from one color to another in RGB space. So there are some alternatives
    we'll discuss.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, we create the cube with with geometry and the material and then we add
    the cube to the scene. We position the camera and then we animate
  persid: ''
- desc: so each time or we're we're doing the animation we're changing the rotation
    angle and then we send it to the Render less you.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm just wondering whether this is a good spot to stop for our first day so
    if you're so inclined, even get the three Gs set up on your computer. Try the
    basic one under creating a scene
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: and maybe think about what questions come up. What you notice about that first
    steam into the spinning cube and what
  persid: ''
- desc: have you what's missing?
  persid: ''
- desc: We'll frame our discussion for next time. I'll show you some web. We'll start
    with a WebGL street WebGL example on our next meeting on Wednesday
  persid: ''
- desc: won't take long for us to get this many lines and do much less
  persid: ''
- desc: that's really not a good pep talk is that seem okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so can you bring your
  persid: ''
- desc: hand cards
  persid: ''
- desc: next time
  persid: ''
- desc: any questions or concerns
  persid: ''
- desc: welcome Thank you
  persid: ''
- desc: welcome Thank you
