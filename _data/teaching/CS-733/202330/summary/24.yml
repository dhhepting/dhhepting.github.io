- desc: 'Speaking of assistants, I find I

    always find it interesting that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people talk about Alexa and so

    on. As smart speakers no one''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no one calls him smart

    listeners.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would just not say Golden''s

    modern. Definitely not thought.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The other day I was at uni and I

    was just went like my TV turns.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'On if I say Alexa, turn on the

    TV. I reached home and my TV was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'turned on, because my phone sent

    that request to my Alexa and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: turned on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe your phone thought TV had

    to warm up'
  persid: ''
- desc: for the whole day
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so you saw my post

    yesterday where I retrieved all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the animated GIFs from the

    wayback machine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a little presentation today,

    like a five minute presentation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the 734 I was really busy

    with that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Gift count is at the website

    sharing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was replying to your note on

    the class discussions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Did anyone try and clone the

    repository and good to run'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it this was this felt like too

    advanced for me. I didn''t even'
  persid: ''
- desc: go into the code.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, it took me a little bit

    longer to get it running than I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought. But I did get to run.

    So maybe we''ll talk a bit more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the code on Wednesday. On

    pardon. Me on Monday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the repository has a package

    dot json file and package json'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lock file as well. So my first

    attempt was to remove the lock'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'file and regenerate it from the

    JSON the package dot json file'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because something''s missing.

    Well, it wasn''t missing but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there were some syntaxes have

    changed and so I tried to get it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to work. But it wasn''t quite

    there. I got the wireframe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spinning on the website without

    any other anything else in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: cube.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I posted revise URLs in the

    discussion forum.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So who is very fluent with NPM

    and note how do we do? Who knows'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what they are? Yeah. So I''m a

    little I''m a little bit more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'advanced, but I haven''t worked

    with them a lot. But I have NPM'
  persid: ''
- desc: So node version manager
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have to downgrade the NBN

    version.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, but I could install this

    version see I installed an'
  persid: ''
- desc: earlier version so I looked at
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looked at package json and we

    found that aid us 12.0 point oh'
  persid: ''
- desc: says 12 point zero.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So now what version is now 20.89

    or something like that. Here we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go. So toe point 0.0 was a

    little bit a little bit of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'step into the past. But so when

    I use the same version of node,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it didn''t have problems with the

    JSON or package lock file. So it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used that to build to install

    the provided NPM i to install'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the dependencies based on the

    lock file and how to recompile'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some things, but it was

    generally happy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so but I''m not sure how to

    tackle the upgrading'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dependencies to the current

    current version of node because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'apparently some of the packages

    that are used are have secure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'severe security violations. Now

    but anyway I got to keep'
  persid: ''
- desc: spinning
  persid: ''
- desc: surprise
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s never happened to me

    before.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Something that''s never happened

    before. Apparently I have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class with fewer than 56

    students next semester. Wow. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s a bit bigger than if the

    previous record was 150. Where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do you take it? In the theater

    if there''s a big lecture theater'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the classroom building well

    Nice.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so let me
  persid: ''
- desc: so, I've done the install
  persid: ''
- desc: 'watched you can trust me that I

    did that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So those two works in the

    previous version I compiled but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it wasn''t loading the images

    correctly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can see what happens when

    we change the parameter so now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re seeing reflection inside

    The Cube.'
  persid: ''
- desc: It's very shiny inside bless
  persid: ''
- desc: so I think
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have a few thoughts about this

    I guess.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, if we have time on Monday

    I''ll look through the code a bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: more
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the bench manipulation

    managed in the code or is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something that is just because

    it''s in the cube you see how'
  persid: ''
- desc: does it glass effect
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when there''s distortion around

    the edges?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Think if we look at this

    placement see'
  persid: ''
- desc: that how it's changing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna say we can use this

    running demo to recreate videos'
  persid: ''
- desc: that aren't on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wrapped her up in the internet

    Wayback Machine internet'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'archives but there are a couple

    of videos there that aren''t.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Don''t think can be generated

    from'
  persid: ''
- desc: from the display you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one has arrows in it and I think

    that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it I wouldn''t it''s maybe not

    German from the the other ones I'
  persid: ''
- desc: think are anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s I need just show you

    a little bit about this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Is mature progresses
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is my first attempt trying

    to update things to the current'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version of node doesn''t quite

    have the same appeal doesn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Why do they have a WebSocket

    connection'
  persid: ''
- desc: is it dropped
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so I was VS code says do

    you trust the developer not at'
  persid: ''
- desc: work? And they said yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the other thing I was gonna

    mention about nvm on the Mac, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: I use homebrew to install it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is there a home? Is there a

    package manager for Windows?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, and we haven''t done but

    no, not package manager'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like homebrew just chocolate I

    didn''t bring any chocolate'
  persid: ''
- desc: versus actually.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I only knew about it after

    the fact. Anyone use that'
  persid: ''
- desc: website?
  persid: ''
- desc: I could just mentioned to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'somebody over 100 That seems to

    be more than my house'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, no no no. waiting to hear

    and then I''ll tell you because I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'only had nobody I was told that

    it was quite funny'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but so I think everything

    happens in the content there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: always wondering
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, we can talk about the

    quota more on Monday. If you'
  persid: ''
- desc: like.
  persid: ''
- desc: I want to show you an example
  persid: ''
- desc: it's not this one
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, now I can copy things over

    correctly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll fix that and posted
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now let''s see if I can get my

    third example to work. Actually,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe I''ll just depending how

    that goes, I''ll come back and'
  persid: ''
- desc: see if I can fix this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so another example is

    using three js and by extension'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'WebGL to inside of React

    application. So this is the link'
  persid: ''
- desc: describes
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ve included three, the

    React stuff and some testing'
  persid: ''
- desc: packages as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the difference from the code

    sample is I had to turn the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intensity of the point light up

    quite a bit because it wasn''t it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was this is like 1000 times

    brighter than it was originally.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe the syntax has changed

    since this example was written'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so I realized that some of

    the files and in this react'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'project aren''t plagued by junk

    code reading the files so I had'
  persid: ''
- desc: to exclude this from the website
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but you can install on your own

    computer if you like. So you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see. We can highlight you get a

    hover color being different than'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the original. And then we can

    click and make it small, larger'
  persid: ''
- desc: or smaller.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so let's look at this
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in the final version of the

    app we say so, this is using'
  persid: ''
- desc: using fiber
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which provides heat or face to

    three Jas so, we import to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: the canvas from
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the canvas there and then here''s

    a cylinder and we look at we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defined it into a single

    component file called cylinder'
  persid: ''
- desc: 3d
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, the Canvas has started at a

    point later position 1010 1010'
  persid: ''
- desc: sativa 1000.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s change the light color so

    we''re drawing two cylinders so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cylinder 3d And here''s a

    position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the second one we''re doing

    wireframe. So we''re saying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wireframe equals true. And the

    third one we''ve changed the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ambient color ambient light

    color is.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's look at the component
  persid: ''
- desc: tree so we're defining
  persid: ''
- desc: cylinder
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so from react we get these

    reference new state and use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frame comes from the fiber

    package so we can set up the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hover. So these are the states

    whether we''re hovering over it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or not clicked or not. So I''m

    going to add this to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Grandview loop. So we''re going

    to do this we''re going to have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'his soldiers rotate around the x

    axis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so with the mesh we''re getting

    we''re going to scale it based on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whether it''s been clicked or

    not. And when a click happens,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to change the value

    of the status of that state and'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're going to negate it
  persid: ''
- desc: and on Twitter over event
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you said average determine if on

    pointer out event, you said'
  persid: ''
- desc: hover to false.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if it''s hover hovering over

    it, we can turn it on he''s Hot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pink is the color otherwise

    orange.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's the basis of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'getting three Jas into a React

    app. Little bit simpler code'
  persid: ''
- desc: isn't it?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let me see if I can fix up

    another example.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, well, I guess I have to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would be okay, just to put in

    another image but it takes a few'
  persid: ''
- desc: more minutes so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'must still work this out? You

    don''t have to sit in silence and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'watch me fumble with the

    keyboard'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we did
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an example we looked at that

    project'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, the Apple Yeah. So the

    thing about this is there''s so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'many different libraries for

    WebGL. So the the apple Fifth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Avenue Project is using route

    Rakel or EGL. So it''s difficult'
  persid: ''
- desc: to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say there''s one that''s doing the

    best. So we have to be flexible.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the purpose of it. I think

    the opportunity in this class is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just looking at WebGL itself and

    understanding what''s going on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then you can get some

    experience with libraries that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to make things a little easier.

    So three Jas is one of those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'libraries. So we can do lots of

    stuff with him. But there''s some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the examples you find on the

    web at the web site Web GL two'
  persid: ''
- desc: fundamentals.org.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s that uses a tiny WebGL

    helper library. So just hide'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some of the complexity but it

    doesn''t still keeps us pretty'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'close to working with WebGL.

    Because he said if you want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do something serious use three

    js.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s see any questions or

    comments about this?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So are you getting Are you be

    more confident about installing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'react apps and from GitHub

    repositories that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m getting comfortable with

    which you know, by default, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: just know what I got wrong.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Even when I''m reading the code,

    I can see I can understand'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'earlier I initially I was just

    looking for I had no idea what I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would just see life just being

    like a frame buffer. What is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing? Now? Actually, last

    assignment was quite helpful.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The last one, I broke it down. I

    broke it down into really small'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chunks of code. I broke down the

    whole Jas into smaller'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'functions. And that made it very

    easy for me to actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comprehend how it was

    functioning.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, good. So on Monday, we''ll

    do a little review. Look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some, some of the code in more

    detail.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And if you have questions so try

    and bring out some questions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ready for Monday. And we''ll go

    through and I hope I have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'examples to answer your

    questions and if I don''t, I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create some. So the mid at the

    midterm, the final is on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: '13th. So that''s Friday, I think

    that''s Friday the 13th Isn''t it?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Is it no
  persid: ''
- desc: final Friday?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, it''s gonna say well, that

    Wednesday the 13th That''s good'
  persid: ''
- desc: luck. Three hours Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you actually give us like,

    like questions like when you did'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the midterm? I mean,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I think the final exam from

    last year is posted as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But so I invite your suggestions

    for questions. That would be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fair assessment of our learning

    this semester. So you can tell'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me whether you like questions.

    On the final last year''s final'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or not. You say don''t give us

    one like this or something like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that. That would be appreciated

    as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so if you want to think

    we''re out of time here to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, two minutes left. So if I

    can get this fixed in two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minutes, and you want to stay

    for two minutes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''re welcome. To but I''ll

    excuse you for now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve my feeling is that the

    code samples in the text are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good as far as they go. But I''ve

    tried with the examples I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'modified to make them a little

    bit more accessible and the fact'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that they have their he has his

    own JavaScript library that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not in great shape. So maybe

    there''s in the future, maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll adopt something that''s more

    standard or actively developed.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, so I welcome your

    thoughts about that as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, okay, thank you again.

    Take care everybody. Have a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weekend. See you Monday. And I

    have office hours'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weekend. See you Monday. And I

    have office hours'
