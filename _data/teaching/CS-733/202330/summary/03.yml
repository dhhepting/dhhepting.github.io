- desc: Okay, so recording
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone not have one of those or want to make one make a new one.
  persid: ''
- desc: So fold it in half and then fold it again
  persid: ''
- desc: please draped in large letters not in not using a yellow highlighter your
    name the name you'd like to be called so not your full name, just the name
  persid: ''
- desc: that I should work on remembering Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: oh I shouldn't read on this board because I'm gonna pull money
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so wish you Happy Monday
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe it can't be more than one thing at once. So let the display Come on
    then I'll switch to HDMI
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so how many people have been on your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: now, not right now but it would help it wouldn't. If you haven't answered
    the question about when to schedule the midterm go to your courses now. And maybe
    I have to
  persid: ''
- desc: increase
  persid: ''
- desc: damage
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so three people haven't answered yet I'm gonna extend it a little bit
    more
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay you have 10 more minutes if you haven't done it, do it now
  persid: ''
- desc: so can everyone find this
  persid: ''
- desc: I would like to have a brief discussion about your courses because with the
    last meeting response there were only six six out of 13
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is just an easy way to keep engaged with the class and it's an easy
    way to lose 5% of your final grade
  persid: ''
- desc: if you don't do it so I want to make sure that it's clear what's happening
    and where it's located and so on and so forth.
  persid: ''
- desc: How many people do we have here? So we have 10. So it could be that the 10
    of you? Or the 10 who've answered any no shame in this or Has anyone here not
    answered the poll?
  persid: ''
- desc: Know 12 or 13? Either of you.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is my first day first class. I don't know how it goes but today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, well take a minute to do it. Now. You've been in your courses before,
    haven't you? I said your absolute first experience. Yes my
  persid: ''
- desc: last I learned this last night.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well welcome. So do you have you sent me email? So you can log in, gotten
    your account set up so go to your courses duck theory chinese.ca?
  persid: ''
- desc: Sitting there for the first time
  persid: ''
- desc: so your email that should have indicated to your username being set up
  persid: ''
- desc: so what if you go to you you are courses dot Uri child.ca and type in credentials
    you set up your email
  persid: ''
- desc: this page you have your route with us. Yes sir. With the same user ID and
    password for your business your number then you can change it.
  persid: ''
- desc: Meet
  persid: ''
- desc: these groups.
  persid: ''
- desc: On this is
  persid: ''
- desc: it on okay we'll work on that later Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh Mark your attendance either today. Everybody else can you access that on
    your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: if you go to your courses I just want to make sure that I'm not what's the
    word making this more difficult or glossing over some things. So does your courses
    website and then there's my website that links to the URL courses stuff
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is the new art courses website.
  persid: ''
- desc: So when you log in
  persid: ''
- desc: this is what you'll see when you are courses. So go your courses and you'll
    be set and then there's a link to my website
  persid: ''
- desc: so then under meetings so there's a list of meetings. And then in general
    there's a link to my website.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you go to the List of Meetings page you can click on today's meeting.
    And that'll go to
  persid: ''
- desc: my web page with the outline for today. Let's see. Okay. So read the other
    quick link I want to show you or remind you of
  persid: ''
- desc: is happening teaching today and that'll have the link for today's meeting.
    So you can go there first, but to access the attendance and stuff you'll have
    to log into your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not going to make a big deal about this in future I'm going to consider
    that it's been covered now. If you don't want to take your mark your attendance
    or write responses that's your decision. Okay. I just want to make sure there
    wasn't some communication issue
  persid: ''
- desc: I wrote this last night so those 1020 So we'll look at it now.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well I guess Monday the 23rd Has it
  persid: ''
- desc: so one more vote anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: won the popular vote Okay, so Oh, just just make note of the midterm in in
    the outline and stuff
  persid: ''
- desc: So I want to make sure that I write down not quite on the board. So let's
    talk a little bit more about the pixel.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's not a cross product or multiplication sign. It's just an ethics
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. So it's a physical. So you can think of as a container, maybe that stores
    value but it doesn't have to be physical. I mean, we could think about
  persid: ''
- desc: it then it's going to some part of the integrated circuit that's in the computer
    in the computer's memory
  persid: ''
- desc: made maybe it's better as a conceptual a logical container
  persid: ''
- desc: so I found a couple references. This is about a four or five page document
    written in 1995 or 96 by ldra Smith, who co founded Pixar. This is when he was
    at Microsoft pixels not a little square pixels, not a little square pixels, not
    a little square and the box was not a little cube
  persid: ''
- desc: you just
  persid: ''
- desc: saying same construction.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then I realize he's written a book called a biography of the pixel, which
    is sort of a history of computer graphics published by MIT Press so I gave you
    the link to that one as well. That would be interesting to read.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the idea is
  persid: ''
- desc: a pixel is a sample
  persid: ''
- desc: now we just started talking about.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can think about those two things. In terms of images that we want to
    create with a computer so with the starting point
  persid: ''
- desc: what are the
  persid: ''
- desc: How can we describe an image in terms of samples or sampling and quantization?
  persid: ''
- desc: So if we think of a picture we take on a smartphone how do we describe it
    or what information do we have about it?
  persid: ''
- desc: Date and diamond was taken.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have meta data
  persid: ''
- desc: how much every was size size
  persid: ''
- desc: in settings
  persid: ''
- desc: so is that
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe also part of the metadata
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, I prefer image like to BG
  persid: ''
- desc: image format?
  persid: ''
- desc: Joined picture experts group that that's a trivia question. When you're out
    with friends, do you know what JPEG stands for?
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's a lossy compression format. So it's lossy
  persid: ''
- desc: that's
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah. Anyway, that's my joke. So what happens is when we do a JPEG image compression
    then we're taking out some of the higher frequency samples so we're we can encode
    it more compactly so when you're saving a JPEG format, you can say high quality
    or low quality you can have a
  persid: ''
- desc: you can have a say and the amount of compression so you can make a very highly
    compressed image that's clearly not the original image or it can make a somewhat
    compressed image which was a fairly good representation of the image okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: This same thing what pixels when you look at an image so sure
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's the spatial resolution of the image
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so weather try
  persid: ''
- desc: whatever the choice we have about images neither know where this is reflected
    in in the information that's stored presented
  persid: ''
- desc: Good question. Yeah. I was just looking at a picture taken. It has 12 megapixels.
    Are we taught is that also going to be spatial resolution or is that the number
    of pixels in the image in sets? So 12 million. Pixels
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now it's a little bit so it's a little imprecise. Thank you for giving me
    a chair
  persid: ''
- desc: so a megapixel could be a million. So when we're talking in decimal we use
    shorthand of a mega for a million. But if we're thinking about binary it's 1024.
    squared, which is not quite a million. So to be clear about that, if we want to
    be precise, but it's the width times the height
  persid: ''
- desc: that gives you the number total number of pixels so 12 megapixel sounds better
    than 3820 by 24. Or whatever. That's a better shorthand maybe.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have the size of the storage the image takes, and that'll be affected
    by the image format. We could use if we did PNG or if we store it there are some
    savings in a PNG format even though it's lossless. If we just had a raw format,
    the data would be the number of pixels times the pixel bits per pixel. That would
    give us the amount of storage for the image.
  persid: ''
- desc: So when we're dealing with this, it's not we're not in theory, that's how
    we relate the numbers but
  persid: ''
- desc: the math won't work out. Exactly, especially if we have JPEG images. That
    that's the idea that we're storing so what are the bits per pixel represent?
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't know if I have a feeling I took this already been
  persid: ''
- desc: edited in post production
  persid: ''
- desc: So we said pixels a sample. So what is the blank of each sample? And we're
    talking about the number of bits that we're storing with each pixel.
  persid: ''
- desc: That question makes sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: Could you repeat that please?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So pixels are samples. And we're talking about the number of bits per
    pixel that we're allocating. So we're restoring something about the sample that
    is the corresponds to that picture element.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how many values can we store for a sample if we have one bit per pixel?
  persid: ''
- desc: What what binary numbers can we represent with one bit one binary digit we
    can do is zero or one.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it could be a very high spatial can have very high spatial resolution 12
    megapixels.
  persid: ''
- desc: But if we're storing one bit per pixel it's gonna be black and white. So the
    pixel values are going to be black or white.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it doesn't give us a lot of detail I'm gonna say this in a very badly so
    please forgive me. There's a story of someone who did a great service for a king
    and the king said, What would you like for your reward? And he said, I would like
    one grade of race on the first square this chess board and then double that on
    the rest of them. A king thought that was a good idea. But by the end I ended
    up to a lot of race.
  persid: ''
- desc: Laughter where if you can find a nice version of that story, online, but the
    idea is when we were using binary like we're doubling each time somehow that's
  persid: ''
- desc: it. So 24 bits per pixel we get a lot of expressive power in terms of what
    we can represent
  persid: ''
- desc: So, does that make sense? So, we have samples the number of samples is a special
    resolution and then the number of bits we're storing per sample is.
  persid: ''
- desc: is, I guess the resolution of values within associated with that sample?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's not only in computer technology that we have discrete the idea of
    discrete representations. For example, when we see a film.
  persid: ''
- desc: So when there actually were projectors of filming theaters, now they're digital
    projectors. They give you 24 They will be 24 frames per second. So we're taking
    24 still images and we're showing them the high enough rate that we get the impression
    of movement.
  persid: ''
- desc: Think I was doing all of my writing I'm getting worse
  persid: ''
- desc: Have you seen mosaics of tile where the tiles are the same size but they're
    put together in such a way that you get the impression of an image
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'd say
  persid: ''
- desc: That make sense. So we want to sample it twice. The highest frequency that
    we want to reconstruct?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so we looked at some images, we zoomed in.
  persid: ''
- desc: Save real life. is continuous we make discrete approximations.
  persid: ''
- desc: Do one more blackboard here
  persid: ''
- desc: Evening Sorry I just getting two readings being too slow there. So once we
    have a discrete bitmap image
  persid: ''
- desc: and it says it's time for me to stop writing on the board. So once you have
    discrete bitmap images, zooming in will show pixel artifacts. So even though we
    have something that looks very nice
  persid: ''
- desc: if we zoom in
  persid: ''
- desc: that's not supposed to be exactly but gives an impression
  persid: ''
- desc: we can see that.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have been out funds for example, we need to store them in different
    resolutions so that the look at the look at the different sizes we want in which
    we want to use them.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, vector images people are you familiar with
  persid: ''
- desc: was gonna say CSV images but that's not right is SVG. Scalable Vector Graphics
    supposed to comma separated values?
  persid: ''
- desc: Storing a mathematical description of the image
  persid: ''
- desc: and so instead of
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can zoom in with SVG images, for example. Because we're not storing
    the Bitmaps we're not starting to edge individual pixels. We store the description
    and then we recreate the the we sample the mathematical description at the requested
    resolution. So if we were to save that image at a particular resolution, then
    we lose the benefit of the SVG format. In terms of being able to rescale it
  persid: ''
- desc: because that's that's a way that we can get around the limitations of storing
    about bitmapped images.
  persid: ''
- desc: mean if we had if we have I mean they're not always limitations but because
    if we spend two days rendering an image at a high resolution firm moody frame
    we don't need to store that we don't need to store that. That we don't need to
    regenerate a different image at different resolutions so so bitmap images aren't
    bad. You just have to understand what's what's going on with them.
  persid: ''
- desc: Are five minutes left here I wanted to just show you that. I didn't get the
    link made.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is a syllabus that I
  persid: ''
- desc: use are linked to our courses page. Office hours Tuesdays and Thursdays 10
    to 1130.
  persid: ''
- desc: So basically, our outcomes for the class are to understand basic concepts
    of computer graphics and animation. So demonstrate your ability to play these
    techniques in software that you write and understand how to apply the graphic
    animation frameworks in your work. So it will be very with some hands on with
    a good dose of hands on.
  persid: ''
- desc: Here's the information on the text. Here's the link to the website associated
    with the text
  persid: ''
- desc: and we talked about this already assignments 40% participation 10% midterm
    exam now on October 23
  persid: ''
- desc: And the final exam 40% That's on December 13 I believe.
  persid: ''
- desc: December 13 at 9am So both the midterm and final will be written exams in
    person. likely they'll both be in here. If we don't if you don't like this for
    the midterm then we can find a different place for if the comfy chairs are too
    comfy for exam writing. Then we can find a different spot and here's kind of a
    breakdown. We're going to go chapter by chapter
  persid: ''
- desc: so our first assignment due at the beginning of October and we'll talk about
    assignments next week. Get your first assignment sorted out next week. So it's
    basically two weeks per assignment. As a bigger space here because of the midterm
    in here
  persid: ''
- desc: so if you're late and be penalized percentage of your assigned grade. If you
    missed the midterm, that's that way to be put put onto the final exam. So be 50%
    final instead of 40%.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's in your interest to make it to the midterm exam. If you missed the
    final you get an NP so attendance is expected you can record your own attendance
    in your courses. There's about academic integrity, some standard stuff.
  persid: ''
- desc: accommodation. So I'll post that right after we're done here. Let's see. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Doctor the link for the syllabus on the on your website. It's broken. So it
    doesn't yes
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm gonna fix it right? Momentarily so
  persid: ''
- desc: what else do I need to say? So today when I have more luck with three Gs for
    who's got it figured out? Working for that simple example. Okay, so we'll, we'll
    do some programming next day. What else one minute left.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is one of the things I did all weekend was to add links to that slide
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I just got these two lines together so it didn't show up. I'll regenerate
    the file so you get the link for the response will show up and they'll show up
    say, find his name before 11pm tonight. And so just a reminder that I got only
    six last time so I'm going to do that right now. Before I leave here, okay. Anyway,
    thanks for today. See you on Wednesday. If you have questions or concerns come
    see me when office our
  persid: ''
- desc: office hour and a half and we'll see you Wednesday Have a good rest of your
    day. Thanks bye
