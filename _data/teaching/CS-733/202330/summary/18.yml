- desc: fish
  persid: ''
- desc: this is not the actual struggle.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have a candidate here

    today and tomorrow for a job'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk in computer science so I

    was just at her research'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'presentation, which is going to

    have a teaching presentation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tomorrow afternoon at one

    o''clock I believe. So if you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: interested in that maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: the way it's not a requirement,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s going to be in this course

    or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, I''m not sure the room

    number. I can send you a message'
  persid: ''
- desc: if you like. It's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like the very the short list it

    comes in, get there. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s two two candidates who

    are visiting this week. Not this'
  persid: ''
- desc: week and next week.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And most of them will be

    selected.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or maybe they are like they''re

    they''re getting like they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applying for a job here or like

    they''re going to promote jobs.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, they''ve applied for a job

    here. Amongst all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applications you received, you

    identified two people who are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able to come and work here and

    who are seem to be a good fit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with our department with our

    needs. So they so when a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'candidate comes, they give a

    research presentation and a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'teaching presentation and the

    meet, meet the dean and'
  persid: ''
- desc: different things. Does
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it include any survey like how

    did he perform or anything like'
  persid: ''
- desc: that?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well as the dean solicits input

    from people'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: so I wanted to say first of all
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did you get this email about an

    event tonight? Ritual'
  persid: ''
- desc: presentation
  persid: ''
- desc: this morning?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Presenter is an alumna from our

    department she did her Bachelor'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of Science honours in 79. She

    worked for SOS cow for over 30'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'years. Oh, she''s Yeah. Okay, so

    I don''t have to find insanity'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you''re interested, my

    talks about issues. I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'she''ll talk about the issues in

    becoming certified, a certified'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'IT professional in Canada. And

    the benefits and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responsibilities of that, I

    guess. I think she also wrote a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'book. Yes. She did. You read the

    email as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s just not coming into my

    mind.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so let''s talk about the

    midterm.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''ll go through your questions.

    One by one, just talk about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exam questions. And then you can

    ask and we can discuss things'
  persid: ''
- desc: need discussing.
  persid: ''
- desc: think there were 14 questions.
  persid: ''
- desc: 44 marks
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s one question I think

    that most people didn''t get. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m the one former question so I

    decided to mark it out of 40'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I did. A little other nice

    things in your favor.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: you see
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so great scope. So what I did

    for marking so it''s a website'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that lets me organize my marking

    by question. So I scan all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exam papers. I upload them and

    then the software I can identify'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'students so it can it helps me

    to match students with papers.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then I go through I''ve

    marked question one and then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'once I graded so with the

    question, I can set up a rubric.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how I''m going to assign marks

    and then I can select the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'criteria that are met for each

    assignment answer. And then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can jump through the questions

    so I can mark off question one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and mark all of question two and

    so on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, if somebody like if

    somebody had given the answer in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a very good way very

    descriptive. So the rubrics will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be set on the answer of that

    particular student and he will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all be graded with respect to

    his answer. That is it how it'
  persid: ''
- desc: works.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I suppose it could work that

    way. But no. So I have an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer. in mind. So I, I''ve

    identified things that I want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: see in the answer.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But if your answer is

    compelling, but not doesn''t fit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the way that I would have

    answered it still gives you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marks so it''s not I don''t want

    to say it''s not. So the rubric'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a way for me to make clear

    some comments are some a clearer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what''s being graded on and it

    saves you from having to read my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'handwriting which might be a big

    advantage'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I mean we I set up the rubric

    so that we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'according to to my feelings

    about how the answer should be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constructed and then as I

    encounter differences, different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answers, I can add cases to

    handle them. So it''s not a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matter of you have to have all

    checked off to get full marks.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Each of them have a certain

    number of points associated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stuff. It''s checked off and you

    get that number of points. So if'
  persid: ''
- desc: you're six marks for a question,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then you may there may be three

    parts with two marks each. There'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'may be two parts or three marks

    each. So sometimes I also gave'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'full marks but then I deducted a

    point because it was mostly'
  persid: ''
- desc: correct but not quite there.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I tried to explain those

    things in comments. So the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the one nice The nice thing

    for me as an instructor is that'
  persid: ''
- desc: I can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let you finish the sentence you

    think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the instructor like your navy

    great scope as an instructor.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m using grade scope as a

    way to help me help support my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marking. So lets me go through

    the exams because we organize'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them and lets me make comments

    about exams without reading on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the paper that you very capably

    filled to the brim with writing'
  persid: ''
- desc: yourself
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the other thing was a great

    scope. is.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So identify
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s why I have a box with

    a certain number of lines in it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also space was not enough for

    that concerns. You know, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: needed more space or on
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, I would say
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you probably wrote more than he

    needed to for the answers. Maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: you
  persid: ''
- desc: ran out of the space
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it was good maybe for the final

    give you some space, some extra'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interest, some paper to do some

    rough planning of answers if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: like maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one time for each question with

    just one line more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think like that take it under

    advisement. Thank you so anyway,'
  persid: ''
- desc: this is what I'm going to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m looking at what''s in the

    box, or what''s what I can see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what I''m focused on this part of

    the display. Anyway so there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that so the other nice thing is

    if you have questions about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marking, you can use grade scope

    to ask me to look at an answer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again. And then I can manage my

    response to you using grade'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scope. So I think that''s a nice

    way to facilitate because then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you can explain the question

    you have. Say, I think I gave'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you the right answer here

    because of the following. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: look at it again. I'm sorry.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then I can answer and then

    the whole thing. The other thing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I won''t do is I have to update

    I''ll have to trance marks change'
  persid: ''
- desc: enough to update your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that you can but then you

    have evidence to bug me about.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You said that I got an extra

    mark here. Let me see reflected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on your courses anyway, I''m not

    saying I''m not going to give you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a marketing forget about I don''t

    want to create a worst case'
  persid: ''
- desc: scenario for you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So just say that so the grade

    school can be used to question'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my grading. Just say mark the

    whole thing again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Ask you to give reasons.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay CMRA
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually maybe I''ll just write

    on the board'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'probably regret that decision.

    Okay. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so John to the pixel. I let you

    off a little bit with this'
  persid: ''
- desc: because really an answer and B
  persid: ''
- desc: doesn't have any
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s technically sufficient to

    answer the question. So. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think I gave you four marks. If

    you said something like that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So these are some of the things

    that you might include we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking about a pixel I''m there

    were some comments about'
  persid: ''
- desc: physical being physical storage
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would say that''s that''s not a

    productive way to think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. Any questions or concerns

    about that? Is it helpful for me'
  persid: ''
- desc: to go through the questions?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. So the next question was

    about.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Starting from black and going to

    wait'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'save you from having to see

    redraw. So we can locate if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'start with black here then we

    can get to white by adding'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes What''s that look like? So

    you can go from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sophie Have you ever normalized

    values or if we think about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the eight bit colors we can go

    from 000 to 55.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I wanted to not be too strict

    about saying'
  persid: ''
- desc: start with white paper.
  persid: ''
- desc: Was the same car
  persid: ''
- desc: getting CMYK?
  persid: ''
- desc: This that would be white
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I know this is this is black,

    for black and for cyan, magenta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and yellow. We have to have

    history really muddy. Imager for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'printing all four inks of full

    intensity but I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought this was I think this is

    a preferred answer compared to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes where the cyan magenta. And

    yellow Lovers don''t change'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I think I gave some marks

    for saying to go from white to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'black keys, subtract instead of

    add the RGB on the display.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Which I didn''t mean to allow the

    room for an answer when I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realized the question permits

    something like that. So it makes'
  persid: ''
- desc: sense Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the concept of discrete

    continuous sampling and'
  persid: ''
- desc: quantization?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe it''s not enough to say

    continuous is so real world'
  persid: ''
- desc: phenomena are continuous
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m not saying that the

    answer has to be just like this,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but this is the way I was

    thinking about to sample them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Once you sample them like for

    audio CD it''s 44,100 times a'
  persid: ''
- desc: second
  persid: ''
- desc: right
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in order to do that, so what''s

    the most efficient way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reconstruct the samples, the

    phenomenon that we''re sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: some multiple of what
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you repeat your question?

    What is sorry, I wrote sample'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them it''s efficient rate to

    reconstruct them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s this? What''s the rate

    or for sampling at a particular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rate? What''s the what''s how

    accurate can reconstruction be?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for the audio example, we

    sampled 44.1 kilohertz. What do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'humans hear? Generally, what''s

    the highest frequency people can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hear? Yeah, so people can

    generally hear up to about'
  persid: ''
- desc: '22,000 hertz so we sampled twice

    the highest we could highest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frequency want to reconstruct.

    That wasn''t part of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question. I''m just trying to

    connect back to our discussions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in class. Okay, so we''ve taken

    care of discrete continuous'
  persid: ''
- desc: sampling
  persid: ''
- desc: and quantization refers to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refers to the precision with

    which we store the samples.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we have four bits, how

    many levels can we store? No.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One we have one bit, we can

    store two, four bits we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: store 16 levels
  persid: ''
- desc: so adding bits we can store
  persid: ''
- desc: to the end
  persid: ''
- desc: 'easy and distinct values. So it

    makes sense.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have a question about the

    quantization. So the explanation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is what you wrote, right? I, the

    point is, in this question, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ran out of the space and I go

    down the page. I''m not sure if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you saw that or not because

    actually you deduct the grade'
  persid: ''
- desc: for the Constitution from me.
  persid: ''
- desc: And it just Okay, so we like
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this at the end of the page. I''m

    not sure if you saw it or not.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so asked me to look at

    that. Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so far. So good.
  persid: ''
- desc: KT x again
  persid: ''
- desc: next fly W
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so why is that useful? For

    computer graphics?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can unify this, the

    transformations for rotation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: scaling and translation
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perspective transformation. Is

    it the same or not?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so, not so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Whatever the transformation need

    to do if we use a foot three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dimensional trend, we have

    homogenous homogeneous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates of three dimensions.

    So, we have four by four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrices. So, the matrix can we

    have a single matrix that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'includes the scaling and

    rotation translation so, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't have to have a separate
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we don''t have to deal with the

    translation separately'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, in 2d It''s a three by three

    matrix 3d four by four matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's too small.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when doing viewport so the

    text would say the window is in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'world coordinates. Or graphics

    texts will say when.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transpose the same world

    coordinates and device'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates well to text Edward

    Angel says there''s lots of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different ways to think about

    Windows. It''s part of it''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very overused term in computers.

    So I wasn''t I wasn''t focused on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the window part. Just tried to

    get the idea of.'
  persid: ''
- desc: That's displayed
  persid: ''
- desc: okay that care
  persid: ''
- desc: where's the camera?
  persid: ''
- desc: So I was thinking about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because you''re on the web, we

    can use facilities within HTML'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to provide our interaction

    device or interaction controls'
  persid: ''
- desc: do that?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s, we had that

    discussion about the old way of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing interaction was polling

    and the modern ways events, cook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'event callbacks and so on. So if

    people if you wrote something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that was reminiscent of the old

    way and modern approach I gave'
  persid: ''
- desc: you marks for that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'statement like that. You get

    context. So that''s what I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: looking for.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this next one. I wanted you

    to talk about pieces appear in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the HTML files and the

    JavaScript files that we''ve been'
  persid: ''
- desc: looking at from the tax.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hope it didn''t throw you off

    because I met at a table in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question. And then write text

    check checker. Science'
  persid: ''
- desc: misspelled text
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, so what do we have needs

    to know'
  persid: ''
- desc: have to Canvas
  persid: ''
- desc: Canvas
  persid: ''
- desc: interface components
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What else do we have in the

    shaders?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m not sure how prevalent or

    is his use of his style of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'putting shaders into the HTML

    and identifying them as scripts.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So a lot of examples they see

    the shader code is put into a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'text variable. And then that''s

    compiled from there. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking about the text. And

    we''ve talked about the examples'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the text a lot. And they''re

    online, on my website and on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interactive computer

    graphics.com website. So I hope'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it wasn''t confusing about what

    what was intended here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So the JavaScript we have
  persid: ''
- desc: with GL context.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the WebGL context code

    associated with the canvas.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Events twice let me just try

    that again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anything else
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so that makes sense
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see if I have to say no no I

    kept it okay'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So reduces triangles etc so

    vertices.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we specify if we want to

    draw triangles we need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specify three vertices for each

    triangle we want to draw so,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that can be an efficient
  persid: ''
- desc: 'strangle strips are more

    efficient because they string'
  persid: ''
- desc: together
  persid: ''
- desc: right this
  persid: ''
- desc: this is makes
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, you don''t need to see me

    draw and try and write down in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'words. But I can just do it the

    picture there if that makes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sense. So, so if you talked

    about things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talked about each of the four

    things but didn''t say anything'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about relative efficiency then I

    took off half a mark the'
  persid: ''
- desc: efficiency
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data application Yeah. I have

    the same problem with the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: like the other question.
  persid: ''
- desc: You've had another piece of your
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer I think you haven''t seen

    the fans because it says that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s no description for the

    fans but it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay. So add that to the list of

    questions you''re gonna ask me to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look at okay. You''re all seem

    okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So connecting to shaders. I was

    looking for something that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where you send attributes vertex

    attributes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Use them to capture information

    that can change between vertices'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then uniforms
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so don''t change those values in

    the shader. We''re not varying'
  persid: ''
- desc: them with vertices. We're just
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing one supplying one value so

    that''s what I had in mind. One'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or two people. Kind of close to

    that I think. But anyways,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s why I marked it at a 40

    instead of 44.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And to make up for some other

    issues along the way. Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: sharpened over here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I was thinking of something

    along the lines of an advantages'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that lets you do use WebGL

    without getting into the details'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of writing of compiling shaders

    and doing many other mundane'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things that you''d have to do on

    a jet Web GL program. And the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disadvantage is that maybe it''s

    got a steep learning curve or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s only on the web, it''s not a

    desktop environment. So I, I try'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to be open about these. So if

    you said this was an advantage I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'searched I''ve tried to get I use

    Google to help me decide whether'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they really advantages or not.

    And what else so come up with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mentioned about plugins, you

    don''t need plugins. The example'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I had mine was the morbid

    controls we used in that one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example which is an add on that

    needs to be specified. So I took'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that as a plugin. So I may

    deduct deducted half a mark I'
  persid: ''
- desc: think for that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'An H So flatten YFL looks like

    an H two let''s try that again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Close enough to flatten okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think when you change your

    tracking it''s very more better.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Compare these two boards

    together. This is better Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: way too much.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s too much better. Maybe I

    should do anyway. Okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: flatten
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we so the authors are using

    JavaScript features like.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Push elements into view, right?

    When I''m doing positions, for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example, or some other when

    we''re populating the race we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: this so that creates
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the extra info is stored to

    support this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re just using fun so I''m

    really dealing with I can do'
  persid: ''
- desc: better than that
  persid: ''
- desc: so better
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s your agenda second

    line, extra info store to'
  persid: ''
- desc: support
  persid: ''
- desc: support this
  persid: ''
- desc: is provided
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So object coordinates are

    transformed the camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates by the modelview

    matrix. The camera coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are transformed to clip

    coordinates via the projection'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrix.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s the kind of thing I was

    looking for. So I think I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generous in in in grading that

    if the basic structure was there'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then 14.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s not fair. So what''s its

    purpose?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or height? Hidden? Surface

    Removal Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So how does it work?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It is used for depths

    information for 2d rendering. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is choosing which objects should

    be on top of the other one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, but that description is

    gives a little bit is a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vague. So for every pixel every

    item as we''re rasterizing it,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each fragment each pixel we

    generate we get a depth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information with so the depth

    buffer is storing if, if the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'newly generated pixel is closer

    than the one that''s stored then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we replace that the new def

    value or replace the old def'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value with a new one. So we''re

    just keeping track of the depth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of each pixel that gets

    rasterized once we''ve completed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then what we see is just image

    generated by the visible'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surfaces are determined because

    they''re the closest to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'viewer. So that makes sense. I

    know I''m out of time here so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't want to keep you too long.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So keep only the closest that''s

    fine. I''m writing a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: smaller there
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five minutes late here so it''s

    going to tell you about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment three. I''ll put it

    online today. Some supporting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material. And then I''ll give you

    a choice about exit due dates.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are the last Okay, thank you.

    Thanks for today'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can tell people who weren''t

    here that we discussed important'
  persid: ''
- desc: final exam information
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or whatever you would like to

    say to them Okay, so this is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exam is a formative evaluation

    so you can see how you''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: with the material
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and where there might be some

    room to improve and if you have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions, let me know. I''m

    available. Okay. And if you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'free tonight, you might want to

    check out that presentation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about which you''ve already

    received email Okay, thanks'
  persid: ''
- desc: again. Take care
  persid: ''
- desc: welcome. Thank you.
  persid: ''
