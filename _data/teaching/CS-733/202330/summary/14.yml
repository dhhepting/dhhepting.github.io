    may still go away anyone excited'

- desc: to see the snow
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m using something called

    grade scope to do marking up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exams. So I''m going to scan your

    exam papers, put them into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'system then it just helps manage

    marking. And then at the end'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ll get an email with your

    graded copy and comments that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can read because we''ll be

    typed in instead of me instead'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of trying to decide what I''ve

    scribbled on the paper on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: board
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any thoughts about the midterm

    was a reasonably fair assessment'
  persid: ''
- desc: of learning.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I know you''re not going to

    tell me otherwise when I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'asking you to your face but I

    wanted to let you know that you'
  persid: ''
- desc: could be free to do that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Turn that off.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the feedback and I''ll give

    you all the responses from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feedback I''ll post them and

    you''ll be able to see all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: responses.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So common a few times and

    sometimes it came up in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'strength so I''m not sure if if I

    should have efficient'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpreted as a strength or

    still it''s an issue anyway.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I do have a list of slides on

    New York horses'
  persid: ''
- desc: and there's also
  persid: ''
- desc: 'slides on the interactive

    computer graphics.com website'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe I''ll add this as a link

    to my course web page so it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more clear as well where to find

    these things.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This seems to me to be a bit of

    a mess. Anyway.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, I'll track down
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m really feeling old today

    because my back is sore. I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know what I did. So I''m trying.

    I''m trying to not look like an'
  persid: ''
- desc: old man.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can let me know if I''m

    succeeding. Or not.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a common about

    putting audio with not just the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'AI generated transcripts but

    your audio recordings. I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: that would be a hell.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think it''s better than the

    transcript. Because it''s like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'separated in middle of

    sentences. Yeah, hard to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'understand. I think I''ll do it

    okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s not on the public

    website, but it''ll be on our you'
  persid: ''
- desc: our courses. Page.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I wonder if it might be a

    useful thing. For so we have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'raw transcript but then also if

    I create an edited version to'
  persid: ''
- desc: transcript Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay So
  persid: ''
- desc: How to Make it Monday
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is it possible that more two

    days like first of November'
  persid: ''
- desc: events okay Thank you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'End of class we see kind of the

    last ones end of last meeting.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So Mr.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We could do it a couple of days

    after the end of the semester.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Or upper class meeting.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Something to think about I can

    discuss this on on the forums.'
  persid: ''
- desc: In your courses.
  persid: ''
- desc: Right Sophie?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Have you looked at the

    description of assignment to Z'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'expectations are the

    expectations more clear'
  persid: ''
- desc: I think Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Comparison to the first one yes.

    Thank you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay in comparison to the first

    one that doesn''t say better No,'
  persid: ''
- desc: it is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so it''s maybe better but

    it''s not.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s look at it and see if we

    can improve it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay so right to left jail

    programs, HTML and JavaScript'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'proven add functionality in the

    code from attacks'
  persid: ''
- desc: so square m is one of them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the two things I notice about

    this program'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Shut up open a new window. Let''s

    go back.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So allow for selection of colors

    allow for input positions to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'overwritten. So the storage is

    not exhausted so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the points don''t just disappear

    at one point there. And then so'
  persid: ''
- desc: if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we''re doing some other

    structures on the page so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the canvas isn''t at at the

    origin at the top left of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mouse position stuff will still

    work. So one of the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'examples I did in class is in

    the code directory handles that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can use that as an

    example.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s perfectly fine to use

    other code in your solutions,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just make sure that you''re you

    indicate that you''re getting it'
  persid: ''
- desc: from somewhere else. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: Again,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so with these it is to combine

    them and select attorney and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'toggle between them with a

    button on the interface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and just give a bit more

    feedback and what''s going on'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's intent for that part so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I have graphics

    implementation interaction,'
  persid: ''
- desc: implementation, and comments.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'For each of those few programs

    I''m asking you to write'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how does that seem anything that

    any questions that jump out?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Think it''s better if I keep

    moving. Less. Pardon me?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You said it''s better to keep

    moving as fast as it hurt less'
  persid: ''
- desc: to your back.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, let''s just it''s getting up

    and getting started that that'
  persid: ''
- desc: are the problems
  persid: ''
- desc: okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All right so we''ll leave it

    there.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you have something to share?

    My boss'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the next chapter is lighting

    and shading in chapter five, as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a program about shot doing

    shadows, but the shadow requires'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a light so I thought you can

    have a bit of discussion about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lighting and shading and then

    next day we''ll go back to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadow and then some other

    application some other sample'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'programs in chapter six. I''m

    making sure that you know I'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't get
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay so this
  persid: ''
- desc: cube that we have there.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how to describe the cubes so

    that one and other ones we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: encountered
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how would you describe the

    colors and shading?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'MR is the class participation

    part.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have a question about shading

    with me say shading in like in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'terms of like painting and all

    of that you would like to shadow'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the cops. But in terms of

    computer graphics what is'
  persid: ''
- desc: failing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s safely during the shadows

    since'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re computing we have a model

    of the interaction of the Elvis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the scene ultimately will

    give us a more nuanced'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'representation seems more

    photorealistic or lifelike so so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes, we''re adding details that

    make it appear in this more more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'believably in the scene and

    shadows and highlights as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can say this is what we

    see on our screen. On the cubes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today, we''re just seeing flat

    shading so we''re not we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assigning a color without any

    other computation involved. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we don''t always have solid

    colors sometimes if we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assigned colors to different

    vertices, different colors,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different vertices then we see

    those colors get interpolated.'
  persid: ''
- desc: But they're still
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re still using a flat shading

    approach. We''re not getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: other information there. too.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what information is missing

    so that we could have that will'
  persid: ''
- desc: allow us to create richer scenes
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can see. anymore? You are
  persid: ''
- desc: see reflections in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'desks and also a little bit

    chars?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I apologize my writing is

    getting smaller like sort of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lighting, so position and types

    of lights so you can think of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: point like
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we have a bald let''s say

    that''s going to lay it up in all'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'every direction from that ball

    will get some light so it has a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position and has yes so we can

    have a point light. We might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a directional light that

    seem it''s like the sun is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming. Sunlight is coming from

    a certain angle and a certain'
  persid: ''
- desc: cut time of day.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So those are two important kinds

    of legs you can use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and if you want to think about

    if his services are very shiny'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these ones where maybe if we

    have some, like the doorknob is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quite shiny so we want to

    describe the properties of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: material material
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. So
  persid: ''
- desc: I can do better than that?
  persid: ''
- desc: Started out okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can calculate interaction

    with the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: So one approach is to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can do the calculation and

    the vertices within with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normal vectors. So we can get

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we get values for the

    vertices and then we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: interpolate them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'During the calculation of the

    vertices and then interpolating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to interior points on the

    surface that''s called Girl'
  persid: ''
- desc: shading
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, one thing about the

    interaction here was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light and normal vectors so,

    what if we have a light here?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's see intuition about that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what if this is a normal this

    is a lightning vector'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is that circumstance service is

    going to be led by the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s like habit that''s like

    being lit by the noonday sun'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right when the normal and later

    a line like that what if we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: a situation
  persid: ''
- desc: this is and?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This light is just above just

    less than 90 degree angle with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the normal vector that''s maybe

    like sunrise or sunset and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what happens if we have an

    oral vector?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s not I know everything

    looks like 3d. Imagine us 2d. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just looking at the angle

    between the normal and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'laning vector. If it''s greater

    than 90 This is a surface being'
  persid: ''
- desc: led by the light.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is the surface or surface

    and this is in the truck as the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lighting so we go from here

    where the lighting the lighting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vectors aligned with the normal

    vector that''s clearly going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be led by the light and then if

    it''s just above, just less than'
  persid: ''
- desc: '90 degrees we''re getting some

    late in the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then if you have greater

    than 90 degrees design isn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to contribute to the color

    of the surface. Okay that makes'
  persid: ''
- desc: sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in order to get shiny

    highlights'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then other than just say Another

    approach is to'
  persid: ''
- desc: interpolate the normal vectors
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whereas here we did

    interpolating values are going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to interpolate vectors
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the interaction I''m doing

    terrible again the size of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: raining I apologize.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re not just interpreting

    values we''re calculating colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so we''re doing this

    calculation the length width at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the intermediate points along

    the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so because we''re doing a

    calculation of vertices here we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can do this in the vertex

    shader. The following shading'
  persid: ''
- desc: which requires
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not just the vertex information

    but so this is what we''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: a fragment shader
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can understand it''s like

    calculate interaction of light'
  persid: ''
- desc: at unlimited points
  persid: ''
- desc: of intermediate
  persid: ''
- desc: any other words that are
  persid: ''
- desc: 'President wants to retain the

    large shake which kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: pH O N G funk shading?
  persid: ''
- desc: Sure,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the question What about

    intention of intention'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or interaction and the surface

    normal factor'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface normal bacteria is a

    vector perpendicular to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface. So, remember we talked

    about the advantage of using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles as opposed to

    quadrilaterals because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quadrilaterals might not be in

    the same. They all might not all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the points might not be

    coplanar. So, if we stick with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles then then we can get

    the normal from the triangle on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the surface
  persid: ''
- desc: 'makes sense. So we can do a

    cross product'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How''s that for a diagram let''s

    try it again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can get nursing effects

    and more complicated server more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interesting looks that we''ll

    talk about later on in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'semester by perturbing the

    normal vector, so we can pretend'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the normal vector is is

    different than it is for just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the triangle. will pretend that

    we can use we can change it from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the triangles normal vector to

    something else so that we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get a surface that looks more

    interesting. Anyway think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: a time for today
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, have a look at chapter six

    and suddenly code there and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll come back to our shadows

    and other examples from chapter'
  persid: ''
- desc: six. On Monday okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So on my Mac I have it set up to

    like in zoom when the font is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'too small, so it''d be nice if I

    had that capability for you on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good zoom into my microscopic

    writing sometimes because it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wouldn''t be bad if it just

    microscopic. Microscopic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scribbles are the real problem.

    Anyway, I''ll keep working on it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, thanks for your

    attention today. Have a good day'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''ll see you on Monday. And

    I''ll be around tomorrow for'

  persid: ''
- desc: Okay Thanks
  persid: ''
- desc: Thanks, you too.
  persid: ''
