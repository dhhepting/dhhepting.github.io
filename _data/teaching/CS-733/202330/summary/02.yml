Audio-Transcript:
- desc: I just didn't want the floor
  persid: ''
- desc: Did you find it
  persid: ''
- desc: interesting so not this one this is
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: I never had it open the first day or the first hi
  persid: ''
- desc: you don't have to knock to come in
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay doctor
  persid: ''
- desc: is there any way that I can go back and get my attendance oh
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not going to penalize you for the first one for the first one Yeah Is
    everyone in attendance market or is attending
  persid: ''
- desc: you What's up
  persid: ''
- desc: afternoon
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so
  persid: ''
- desc: this is a live website
  persid: ''
- desc: this is my website
  persid: ''
- desc: and once you log in if you're logged into your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: you'll see
  persid: ''
- desc: this come up
  persid: ''
- desc: so, now that
  persid: ''
- desc: we're on to our courses
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's, that makes sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm still
  persid: ''
- desc: so I had the running. I'm building this website using Jekyll. So anyone use
    Jekyll before. It's a static website generator. And I I picked it because I started
    out doing my GitHub Pages website. If I had to do over again, I probably would
    have used a Python exact Python tool.
  persid: ''
- desc: Using the Django framework would have been much faster because it does give
    you everything out of the box like the boilerplate itself gives you an admin token.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, the Django is nice. But I'm not. I'm not talking about putting the Good
    morning sir. Good morning. Have you gotten lost? Yes I've entered the classroom
    so we're still seeing what half of a half of the students have been lost today
    I guess so just a thought you don't have to come in and say good morning to me
    when you're coming in late so I don't want to be too heavy handed about it but
    let's just try and take your place and you're welcome to come in as an undergraduate
    in my computer graphics class and happened to be well this is not just the computer
    graphics class for this was my professor for that class and some others he would
    lock the door once the class time started so then we were out of luck and some
    people would knock on the door and incur His wrath even more so I'm not gonna
    lock the door or anything but just come and join us and if you have questions
    we'll deal with them as they come up no problem there but just so we're not a
    big group even while we're a smaller group today still.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, I just felt I should mention that so not I will want this to be a
    welcoming supportive environment but respectful as well so that makes sense okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you if you go to your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so if you log into your courses and you'll see this screen and if you
    go to CS 733 on Dr. haptens website
  persid: ''
- desc: get to this page
  persid: ''
- desc: because of our meeting for today
  persid: ''
- desc: so, our meeting again on Wednesday, so, Monday is our first Monday coming
    up. That'll be our first full week
  persid: ''
- desc: so let me
  persid: ''
- desc: go through a few things here. So these are your courses links. So attendance
    so it's a short you don't have to go through
  persid: ''
- desc: this page.
  persid: ''
- desc: So here's a shorter thing, or shorter URL to get you.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is today so we're in this first week. Lock of our meeting too
  persid: ''
- desc: so that'll get you to the
  persid: ''
- desc: meeting page for today so you can tell me if this is helpful or not so
  persid: ''
- desc: this is
  persid: ''
- desc: in the participation forum you can make some comments about this and if there
    are problems with it
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway, so to get back click on meeting to then we can get through the attendance
  persid: ''
- desc: you haven't done attendance yet and you'd like to do the QR code take a minute
    to do that right now
  persid: ''
- desc: Please.
  persid: ''
- desc: For most of you arrived asked me how my weekend was. So it was good. Saskatchewan
    Roughriders one. So that's always a good thing as far as I'm concerned. So my
    son celebrated his 21st birthday this weekend. And I remember because the day
    we went to the hospital
  persid: ''
- desc: to for my wife to give birth with riders are playing in the Labor Day classic
    and I I remember because there's a quarterback who's never been heard from again,
    his name is rocky Butler, but he can't he came out of nowhere to win the game.
    So I said that I I'm maybe one of the few people in the world who remember him.
    But that was this very special day not because they won
  persid: ''
- desc: but just
  persid: ''
- desc: the two things the birth of my son and and the winner of the Labor Day game
    are connected. Anyway, so aside from that this is part of what I did. I thought
    I'm going to upgrade Ruby on my computer. And I spent several hours. So finally,
    with no success and I finally came up with this, I decided to ask a question on
    Stack Overflow
  persid: ''
- desc: so that was
  persid: ''
- desc: that was a
  persid: ''
- desc: few times I thought it was close to solution. I thought okay, this time it's
    going to work but
  persid: ''
- desc: no such luck.
  persid: ''
- desc: So me and I realized I have such an old computer that can't be upgraded to
    Ventura, which is the new version of the operating system. So I think I'm due
    for an upgrade computer this year. We have an evergreen program. So I look forward
    to doing that. But anyway, so that was So one thing
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is another
  persid: ''
- desc: your courses link so that tells you what's going on today
  persid: ''
- desc: so I don't mean to make this all about going through links in the class but
    I just thought I'd point out where the links are so people can
  persid: ''
- desc: see
  persid: ''
- desc: what's coming up
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: and here's a reminder about response that opens after class and closes at
    11pm tonight
  persid: ''
- desc: so this gives you
  persid: ''
- desc: not just today but things in the future upcoming so we have that choice for
    midterm date. So you're gonna fill that out if you haven't already
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: senator and brother in 10 cards I just want to make sure I'm just gonna circle
    your names if you'd like to be called.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I found you here I'm just gonna say that's a particularly difficult
    combination of yellow highlighter on white background it's like reading an invisible
    link
  persid: ''
- desc: okay everyone's
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 10 cards and they would like to be called so I'll try and make use of this
    information and see if you can still bring them for next week and I'll try and
    get familiar with that so writing responses so I just want to go back to our meeting
  persid: ''
- desc: so after the
  persid: ''
- desc: meeting happens I'll post pictures of the blackboard green board, chalk board
    whatever you want to call it
  persid: ''
- desc: and then I have the transcript from otter
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: third is if you're doing wikis if you're going to augment the wiki with some
    of the material from the transcript, you can maybe use the transcript as a guide
    to what we discussed.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I have a link to the
  persid: ''
- desc: wiki page from last day.
  persid: ''
- desc: So thank you for
  persid: ''
- desc: putting that up
  persid: ''
- desc: so these are the summary of responses
  persid: ''
- desc: so I've marked a few that I that I didn't get back I'll finish marking the
    ones from Friday
  persid: ''
- desc: so this one
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll give you a mark one out of two for this but still remember the instruction
    so
  persid: ''
- desc: so a couple of things.
  persid: ''
- desc: So pick one of
  persid: ''
- desc: one of the three headings
  persid: ''
- desc: the most important thing that I encountered the most difficult thing for me
    to understand think about which I'd like to know more and in the instructions
    it says don't write a description of what we did just give your impression best.
  persid: ''
- desc: Friends, think of these as questions you're answering. So you pick a question
    What is the most important thing that I encountered or what is the most difficult
    thing for me to understand? Or what is the thing about which I'd most like to
    know more? And write an answer based on that. 512 characters
  persid: ''
- desc: so excited to know more maybe that would fit under here so I don't want to
    make this too difficult. I'm not trying to nitpick here but I just would like
    you to take it on in a thoughtful way
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: a couple of responses to the responses
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's a comment about
  persid: ''
- desc: specifying color as let's take a picture
  persid: ''
- desc: so hex digits go from zero to f so we're letters take over from 10 is a, b
    is 1112 is C 13 is D, 14 is E and 15 is F so that all familiar.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: I thought this is an opportunity for me to show you a magic trick they were
    like magic tricks. Okay, so I like a volunteer and I'd like you to pick a number
    between zero and 15 Don't tell me keep it to yourself. I'm going to ask you four
    questions and based on your answers I'm going to psychically sense your answer
    and give you give you the number you've guessed you've selected
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, who's the volunteer? Okay. Shoe. Yep, that's how I know but you're fine
    there.
  persid: ''
- desc: I just wanted to know that. I can think of today's announcement a profit.
    Okay, do your thinking you have a number. Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: number on this card
  persid: ''
- desc: is remember on this card? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's what the card looks like.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is the first card I showed
  persid: ''
- desc: on this card I guess
  persid: ''
- desc: finds your number in this card
  persid: ''
- desc: sensing psychic energy
  persid: ''
- desc: number seven yes
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone familiar with this magic trick
  persid: ''
- desc: okay to have another volunteer All right
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay is your number on this card
  persid: ''
- desc: is your number on this card
  persid: ''
- desc: number in this card
  persid: ''
- desc: is your number on this card
  persid: ''
- desc: blocking
  persid: ''
- desc: numbers for that is correct
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so Are you sure you're Dr Hepting and not talk to Houdini
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah well I'm not very good at escaping
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway let's so let's any ideas about how this is working who believes that
    I'm using my ESP my my magician's abilities to guess your numbers that's good
    that nobody thinks magical abilities.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so we're gonna pick a number between zero and 15. So what do we notice
    about the numbers that I asked you to pick from? As we go into 115 Yeah, okay
  persid: ''
- desc: this is another way to save zero and 15 right
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's like
  persid: ''
- desc: a VG two quickly here
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so, here we talked about four
  persid: ''
- desc: bits
  persid: ''
- desc: and does the number four come up anywhere in that trick?
  persid: ''
- desc: Just once
  persid: ''
- desc: in your in your guests it did. But is there more generally in this? How many
    cards do I have?
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's write out our hex digits here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Zero is if you
  persid: ''
- desc: write his four bits it's four zeros
  persid: ''
- desc: and ones 15 At
  persid: ''
- desc: the other end
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see right so it's all once
  persid: ''
- desc: they were no
  persid: ''
- desc: joke about how there's 10 kinds of people in the world
  persid: ''
- desc: those who understand binary and those who don't
  persid: ''
- desc: right so that's number two in binary.
  persid: ''
- desc: Mr again, it's 1112
  persid: ''
- desc: think those match up all right so what's the other connection between that
    table? You can Oh, you don't need to correct me. You get the idea, right.
  persid: ''
- desc: What's the connection between ones and zeros? And what I was asking you to
    do?
  persid: ''
- desc: I asked you for a yes or no answer right
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: ''
- desc: so in what I was asking you is tell me your number think of your number in
    decimal and then I'm asking you for questions which you're encoding you're telling
    me the number in binary
  persid: ''
- desc: so when
  persid: ''
- desc: so the numbers here on the one card the first card are all the ones that have
    the Lord or bitset and so that happens to be eight of them and they fit nicely
    on a card like this and then the two card has ones that are next position value
    of two four card has that and the eighth card has just one starting at eight to
    15 So if we say no to all the cards all right guess is zero. So now our algorithm
  persid: ''
- desc: to do this is
  persid: ''
- desc: start with you start with set your guests to zero keep track of the yeses
    and add them to your guests. So if you guess number seven or if if the participant
    said no number seven, don't say yes to the one two and four cards, no to the eight
    card so one plus two plus four is seven and I'm not gonna get in trouble with
    any magicians union for time that story. So that makes sense. So this is a way
    we can think of
  persid: ''
- desc: we can encode values with bits so we can encode 16 values with four bits,
    we can encode 256 values with eight bits and as we talked about last day, so two
    hex digits 256 values that's a common way to represent values for the different
    color channels. We'll talk about color in computer graphics so
  persid: ''
- desc: okay then
  persid: ''
- desc: don't know if I should try and do this again see.
  persid: ''
- desc: So here's a car asking me about my computer graphics work so I
  persid: ''
- desc: this is on my website, a collection of images
  persid: ''
- desc: and some other things I've done related to fractals.
  persid: ''
- desc: I was going to add a link to a newer thing that I did last year. Video
  persid: ''
- desc: For our next meeting
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: a president I'm interested in, right, you can look at the collection of my
    publications if you'd like
  persid: ''
- desc: me to do some
  persid: ''
- desc: updating on that material on the website but useful open data, so linked open
    data and other kinds of other forms of open data.
  persid: ''
- desc: We can make them more accessible and usable for people, for citizens to contribute
    and to use them. Anyway, so here's the countable course structure.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I will post the official syllabus today. My technical difficulties got
    in the way of fulfilling that. I said I was gonna have it done today, before class,
    but I'll get to you today.
  persid: ''
- desc: So here's the textbook link.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's the pure publishers website, the Canadian website for accessing.
    So if you there might be earlier versions available. So it's, it's a reference
    for you. It's not required. And here's the website to support
  persid: ''
- desc: a textbook. So we'll be looking
  persid: ''
- desc: at examples from there. So a question. Oh, great distribution. So we talked
    about this last day. So 10% for the midterm 40% For the final 40% for five assignments
    and 10% for participation. There's a common WebGL versus OpenGL.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have GL is
  persid: ''
- desc: a Javis is a web implementation of OpenGL embedded 2.0 for embedded systems.
    So there are a few differences
  persid: ''
- desc: so I guess the next thing, and I'm not sure what is coming along is sort of
    WebGL that might be web GPU. Because the code we'll be writing this time talks
    about is making use of the GPU
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, okay, so I'll be doing was getting three Gs installed and
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone try that out?
  persid: ''
- desc: Right, yeah. Okay. All right. So we'll talk about that again on Monday.
  persid: ''
- desc: Go through so.
  persid: ''
- desc: We'll go through that example and some WebGL code
  persid: ''
- desc: combination sound
  persid: ''
- desc: fun and quantization
  persid: ''
- desc: sorry
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is the audience participation part and ask a question you can feel
    free to answer or ask another question
  persid: ''
- desc: okay let me talk some more than
  persid: ''
- desc: for all I need to be writing bigger way back in the back back I'll try and
    submit I need a
  persid: ''
- desc: truck in the truck
  persid: ''
- desc: so what are creating an image
  persid: ''
- desc: on the screen so
  persid: ''
- desc: so if it's on the screen we have a final resolution so maybe it's 4k so
  persid: ''
- desc: it's
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not sure what the resolution of my screen is here anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: so when we're talking about what makes up
  persid: ''
- desc: an image
  persid: ''
- desc: is there a word that comes to mind that you're familiar with?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay so what is a pixel
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: it's a physical convener which contains all three goals or GDP
  persid: ''
- desc: the starting point for our discussion
  persid: ''
- desc: we're not actually
  persid: ''
- desc: it's not a single
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see if we can zoom in here
  persid: ''
- desc: now this isn't
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway so they did let me try this me get back to our basic resolution
  persid: ''
- desc: not sure what I'm missing here
  persid: ''
- desc: there we go
  persid: ''
- desc: sooner zooming in
  persid: ''
- desc: it's difficult to see here but the idea is it's it's not a single location
    on screen that has contains the red green and blue red green and blue are separate
    but they're in close proximity so the impression is that we get the color
  persid: ''
- desc: ID each pixel has
  persid: ''
- desc: so you can see each
  persid: ''
- desc: pixel has a value associated with it
  persid: ''
- desc: how do you associate a value with excellent?
  persid: ''
- desc: Something else is as quick as a pixel a square or a rectangle
  persid: ''
- desc: does it have some
  persid: ''
- desc: built in geometry that we're when you zoom into it like this does make squishes
    maybe So it's not inherently a square so if you want things to look nice on the
    screen
  persid: ''
- desc: we'll make them square
  persid: ''
- desc: do much better with a whiteboard and a marker console I'll have to recalibrate
    my writing a little bit I think so when you have issues reading when I'm scribbling
    on the board please let me know
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 1416 by
  persid: ''
- desc: nine so that's
  persid: ''
- desc: it more traditional earlier displays were
  persid: ''
- desc: forced by free
  persid: ''
- desc: read a square one to one
  persid: ''
- desc: does anyone seen bad websites where pictures of people are stretched and contorted
    and imagined so happens too often so not keeping an eye preserving the aspect
    ratio of the image
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's better to think of pixels as samples of this continuous phenomenon
    that we're trying to represent attorney discretize
  persid: ''
- desc: see some
  persid: ''
- desc: smiles are you laughing with me or
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: so the pixel is a sample
  persid: ''
- desc: so since we have
  persid: ''
- desc: a zoomed in image here that's
  persid: ''
- desc: so you can see it's not
  persid: ''
- desc: displaying text or not just
  persid: ''
- desc: producing the outline
  persid: ''
- desc: so, there are some pieces that are darker than we were also
  persid: ''
- desc: let's start here.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's the center so the way to interpret this
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can please forgive my knots square drying here
  persid: ''
- desc: with so this so we're taking a sample of a dot here so it translates into
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: this one in the middle gets full value because it's
  persid: ''
- desc: it's fully covered by the by the auditor sampling
  persid: ''
- desc: and then the other ones get less than
  persid: ''
- desc: two the reason why it's spread out like this
  persid: ''
- desc: okay one minute left. So, anti aliasing
  persid: ''
- desc: never understood what it means.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: Zaven heard the Nyquist Shannon, or Shannon Nyquist.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the idea is if you want to reconstruct a continuous signal, you need to
    sample it twice the highest frequency
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: when we're doing pixels we want to make sure that
  persid: ''
- desc: in this case so what happens if we have an object like that
  persid: ''
- desc: like that
  persid: ''
- desc: so at first sight if we take a sample from the
  persid: ''
- desc: middle of
  persid: ''
- desc: the region so if we say
  persid: ''
- desc: we're going to treat pixels as squares, and we're going to sample in a grid
    like this. So, here we can get a set we're gonna hit for this one.
  persid: ''
- desc: But we'll miss this one. So this is
  persid: ''
- desc: so aliasing because we're not sampling at a high enough rate if you want to
    want to represent this. We have to make the samples close enough together to catch
    that. Thank you A mesh screen that we're trying to if you want to catch for panning
    for gold
  persid: ''
- desc: or something valuable
  persid: ''
- desc: we have segments and sad I want to make use a screen that's bigger than a
    piece of and we're looking for it to be on the safe side you want to make it twice
    as fine as the thing we're looking for
  persid: ''
- desc: so you may have heard about this
  persid: ''
- desc: in terms of audio
  persid: ''
- desc: CD is sampled at 44.1 kilohertz and that's because
  persid: ''
- desc: most people can hear up to 22 kilohertz so sampling at twice the rate that
    makes sense okay, so thank you for your attention today we'll try and
  persid: ''
- desc: pick things up just trying
  persid: ''
- desc: so please
  persid: ''
- desc: look at three Jas get that started and then we'll look at some look at the
    interactive website
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you for today
  persid: ''
- desc: have a good weekend thanks.
  persid: ''
- desc: Says but there might be somebody who computer science officer if you're interested
    in
  persid: ''
- desc: getting the stem
  persid: ''
- desc: myself
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, you're clear you're free to
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, you're clear you're free to
  persid: ''
