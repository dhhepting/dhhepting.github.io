Audio-Transcript:
- desc: If that was the case so I'm sorry I'm not I'm not punctual today either. Because
    my car was calling to me. So here's my new computer
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see if I have all the parts here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Here's the old one.
  persid: ''
- desc: Just want to say
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you
  persid: ''
- desc: this
  persid: ''
- desc: training
  persid: ''
- desc: so I just want to talk about Well, first of all, let me say it's happy. Academic
    Integrity. X day of action.
  persid: ''
- desc: You concerned. So there's a presentation layer today about using generative
    AI and its relationship to academic integrity and so I'm quite interested to see
    that
  persid: ''
- desc: so I didn't so the marker and I had a discussion yesterday and would have
    been better to have discussion earlier. But based on some of the work submitted,
    we came up with a few more
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'm going to revise rubrics for the next assignments based on some of the
    things we found here
  persid: ''
- desc: which isn't so did you find that it was the instructions were clear? So what
    were the instructions
  persid: ''
- desc: GL programs
  persid: ''
- desc: So something I could have made more clear, it's about using the sample code
    but acknowledging it and describing what's.
  persid: ''
- desc: What you've added to it
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I should have also included tomorrow about.
  persid: ''
- desc: More about the submission format. Anything else that was?
  persid: ''
- desc: Missing from.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anything else that could be added to make it more clear
  persid: ''
- desc: so instead of
  persid: ''
- desc: so instead of just making it six marks or implementation and two for comments,
    I'll break I'll break down future one so I'll give you some examples.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how do we indicate this a WebGL program
  persid: ''
- desc: let's where do we specify WebGL?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, required three Jas to code and then see making Okay, that's using three
    js it's not using them to function like to we can watch so let's get context.
    Right.
  persid: ''
- desc: JavaScript prefer single quotes
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so that's because we don't just be with a canvas we can have different
    contexts. Could have a 2d We can. We can have a number of different ones. So we
    wanted WebGL to context
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, anyway, don't be too late. But the point
  persid: ''
- desc: so now we're dealing with viewing. There's two parts, right? We're establishing
    the viewing coordinates where we're looking, we're where we are the camera and
    where we're looking at and the orientation so how do we specify that
  persid: ''
- desc: looking from the eye point? So that's one point. So that that says where the
    camera is going to be now what other things can we can we use to indicate our
    position uniquely?
  persid: ''
- desc: So what other information do we need? If I have my camera here okay, my camera,
    we've established the opposition but I can I can look anywhere from here. So I'm
    not changing the camera, the eye position.
  persid: ''
- desc: Whatever of these information can I use to indicate precisely what where I
    should be looking? With a camera
  persid: ''
- desc: in this scene and the points that it's for,
  persid: ''
- desc: option. So we talked about three. So we're going to have
  persid: ''
- desc: like, I'm talking about perspective.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now. I'm just talking about where I'm going establishing the viewing coordinates.
    So I'm I'm here with a camera. Where should I be looking at Bob's?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so I have a position I need a point that I'm looking at XYZ coordinate
    for Yeah, x y and Zed for good.
  persid: ''
- desc: Right so we talked about this yesterday, last day. Right? So then all right.
  persid: ''
- desc: So now if I have my camera position, and I'm looking at let's say I'm looking
    at two projectors, so that's what was it
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so if I'm looking here with a camera so I have the camera position,
    I'm looking at something. What degree of freedom is Yeah, so I need to specify
    what is the up vector
  persid: ''
- desc: so when we changed so we had the hat
  persid: ''
- desc: and we make this CF factor. Then we see
  persid: ''
- desc: see that picture as we expect what happened when we made the up vector? Like
    this? What happens to the picture? Or what happened to the picture? If you remember
    from Monday
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. So it rotates so that this vector is pointing up. So the picture we
    see then is.
  persid: ''
- desc: I shouldn't
  persid: ''
- desc: so it makes sense. Okay. So if we have two vectors here, if we have the vector
    here between apps and the eye point, and then the app vector how do we make a
    third vector so we have coordinates basis for our coordinate system?
  persid: ''
- desc: So what what are the vectors do we want?
  persid: ''
- desc: Well
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can have
  persid: ''
- desc: a vector that's normal to the other two, and it's perpendicular to the other
    two is a cross from a cross product right.
  persid: ''
- desc: So then if we take this, make a trans transformation from our X, Y and Zed
    coordinates to these UV and n coordinates
  persid: ''
- desc: and we can think about looking down set axis here.
  persid: ''
- desc: We got a matrix transformation to so the neat thing about computer graphics
    is that so we have corn system that we're modeling things. We have a corn system
    we're reviewing things and then we can trance and can transform between the neural
    cell matrix multiplication
  persid: ''
- desc: so we talked earlier about clipping coordinates right. So that I guess what's,
    what makes it into the onto the screen into the viewport? Is is divine minus one
    one minus one to one.
  persid: ''
- desc: Imagine that mind straight this is minus one one.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, if we if we just if we don't do anything differently we can just see what
    will just look straight on to this?
  persid: ''
- desc: So, that's my default stats rejection they have so it's just learing Zed values.
    So that's why we do the Zed Zed test the depth then we're going to only draw the
    things that are closer than things out there things have been drawn.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thinking about our synthetic camera, how do we where we have perspective,
    usually
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have the camera.
  persid: ''
- desc: Then we have
  persid: ''
- desc: far
  persid: ''
- desc: so you can see this being transformed to minus one and one
  persid: ''
- desc: if we have a which which court system is that? Where is it? Where's it distances
    increasing as we go away? Into the screen
  persid: ''
- desc: so left hand is x times y it goes away if someone's pointing in the direction
    of positive Zed.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can relate that back to this clipping volume. Now other thing so if
    we put the front and back of the clipping volume alignment with the front and
    back of our projection here we've got one thing taken care of right but what about
    the other things? So
  persid: ''
- desc: what's going to happen in a perspective projection so if we have somebody
    has the size looks like a letter chi with legs and arms. Anyway let's do it. Again.
  persid: ''
- desc: So they're about the same size. perspective projection. Is this one is this
    character going to be projected any larger than the image what about this character
  persid: ''
- desc: so what needs to happen is
  persid: ''
- desc: that was not right
  persid: ''
- desc: so this guy is still mad big. But then here we
  persid: ''
- desc: go that's not not the scale but the idea is items in the foreground are made
    larger because we're stretching
  persid: ''
- desc: to transform this into normalized coordinates the minus one to plus one coordinates.
    We need to stretch the front need to stretch the whole thing so these aren't this
    becomes a parallelogram or parallel a pipe it is that makes sense? Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can specify the field of view and the y direction that's this angle.
  persid: ''
- desc: seem okay. In terms of a general idea of what's going on okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so we won't go any further than this this would be the last bit of material
    for the exam. And what do you think about exam questions?
  persid: ''
- desc: Found a supercharged turbocharged car. I would have a place like this
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe it would be maybe Cypress Hills I guess that's the highest elevation
    in Saskatchewan in the southeast corner
  persid: ''
- desc: that was insane because there's no connection.
  persid: ''
- desc: Evening was quite a concern
  persid: ''
- desc: I know it sounds up here
  persid: ''
- desc: so I try to link again it says 404 not found. So maybe it's
  persid: ''
- desc: there No, it was like totally fine. Like I
  persid: ''
- desc: didn't even give you an oh yeah. Well, that brings me joy.
  persid: ''
- desc: No, it was totally fine.
  persid: ''
- desc: Dr. Pepper. They talked about him in marketing. He was like they said, Dr.
    Pepper Dyer. I love that. Okay, where are you guys? I don't know how it works.
    For me I don't.
  persid: ''
- desc: Know isn't
  persid: ''
- desc: just an issue
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't
  persid: ''
- desc: know I'm not sure what happened.
  persid: ''
- desc: Just sitting for
  persid: ''
- desc: so long.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I know what happened. I'm just like, these two laptops which I was forced
    to switch between every day aren't in sync.
  persid: ''
- desc: You Okay? I will get that fixed up right after class
  persid: ''
- desc: but for now, let's look at
  persid: ''
- desc: it wouldn't have been a problem. Except I fixed an issue that I was cleaning
    up the files each time I was refreshing the site. So if I had the old version
    of my script, it would have kept once it got up there and stayed there. But now
    I'm cleaning up so when it's not doesn't appear again. It gets removed anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone see this yet? I apologize. I wasn't trying to play a cruel trick on
    you
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone know the peanuts cartoons? wasn't trying to be Lucy with like the football
    for Charlie Brown. Because what she does is she says I promise I'm gonna hold
    a phrase and kick the ball. And he's graduate be against his better judgment.
    believes her and then she pulls the football away. So he falls on his rear. He
    doesn't that happens many times. Anyways, that wasn't my intent
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so what is a pixel? So that seemed like a good question.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone like that as a question? Any variations on the question? That you would
    prefer?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so how would anyone at how would you answer that question was the pixel
    smallest addressable community?
  persid: ''
- desc: Have a sample phenomenon to be represented or reconstructive Do you like that
    no first?
  persid: ''
- desc: Know it's really it's resolving and get extra marks for us
  persid: ''
- desc: extra five not
  persid: ''
- desc: so question is a pixel have geometry.
  persid: ''
- desc: Square and he told me that it isn't three times.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's not necessarily a square. That's right. But if we preserve the aspect
    ratio
  persid: ''
- desc: thing we're trying to reconstruct then then they're equal distance so most
    often associated with squares, I think. They don't have geometry in themselves
    because of their samples even though that's that's not a happy face answer.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: we start from black describer sketch how to get the color weight using three
    parents of colors. When starting from wait and go to black.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what do we do to get from black to white? Do we add RGB so it's added?
  persid: ''
- desc: '1515'
  persid: ''
- desc: the accumulation of the answer to it. Describe prism
  persid: ''
- desc: prism.
  persid: ''
- desc: will find you a plus one with a past
  persid: ''
- desc: cube
  persid: ''
- desc: I should just draw a bigger one light side just a Magento game so if we start
    here with black one direction we can add red we can add blue. Another direction
    you can add green
  persid: ''
- desc: so, blue and green is cyan. Blue and red is magenta and then red and green
    is yellow
  persid: ''
- desc: MS is white so, and then if we look at we looked down axis between white and
    black and we get a shape like
  persid: ''
- desc: this look looking at right from the side and you see something like this
  persid: ''
- desc: well usually we squish it into a corner like this. So round the circle is
    the hue and distance from the center to the edge is the saturation
  persid: ''
- desc: this is the value. So black here and what is the center of it
  persid: ''
- desc: so what happens if you want to go from white to black?
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's so this is a display. Laser additive started from black
  persid: ''
- desc: for printing on white paper, so if we print cyan, magenta and then we're subtracting
    colors from the spec,
  persid: ''
- desc: the light that's reflected from them. So is yellow and black as well. Usually
    because it's easier to get a nice black color if we start with black ink instead
    of mixing cyan, magenta and yellow
  persid: ''
- desc: which can be sometimes very muddy and also paver gets very wet because he
    applied three times
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense? Okay it's not a good question. If we say yes for you
    removed
  persid: ''
- desc: so for the answer, just these things that you said you wrote actually and
    the q will be in our control the cube to describe it. describe our scale
  persid: ''
- desc: test obviously is
  persid: ''
- desc: going to prevent drawing. You can draw on here or you can draw in here as
    well to see you should be able to do the horizontal lines straight absolute joke.
  persid: ''
- desc: Use that to make the cube
  persid: ''
- desc: so is that a fair question? Because we've talked about colors. Right. I could
    also ask what what does Alpha do? That's a great way.
  persid: ''
- desc: Evening Okay, so what about the concepts continuous and discrete? Sampling
    and quantization the thoughts about those
  persid: ''
- desc: so resampling I continuous phenomenon
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we get back from our sampling. We got a discrete representation so
    if we sample
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes. Find that religious organization
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so now it's time to allow us to reconstruct continuous a continuous
    phenomenon that we're trying to represent. Okay, does that make sense? So what
    about because I wrote my writing degree was
  persid: ''
- desc: in discrete come together to form sampling. Is that a correct assessment?
  persid: ''
- desc: We sample a continuous phenomenon. And that gives us a discrete representation
    of it. So what is what are enough samples? One day
  persid: ''
- desc: sir so let's think about the audio CD format
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: I do a CD format samples at 44.1 kilohertz. So what what's the highest frequency
    we can reconstruct? No, we did this
  persid: ''
- desc: that's the highest frequency
  persid: ''
- desc: so a few different thinking about an image.
  persid: ''
- desc: Say we have this shape for some reason?
  persid: ''
- desc: Got let's say they got to. But if we take
  persid: ''
- desc: so here think of having a screen on the window. Do you have screens where
    you live at home to keep up bugs for example.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the screen only works if it's small enough to keep up with the bugs. So
    if you want to be able to represent the bugs or things in the screen, we don't
    want the objects we're trying to represent to be able to fall through the cracks
    so to speak. That's not the technical definition. But does that help make sense
    of it? So if we think about the frequency, the spatial resolution how many samples
    we're taking. samples should be should the distance between samples should be
    half the smallest object we want to capture and what is quantization? We haven't
    talked about quantization yet.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is how many bits
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we have four bits like the card trick, then you can store 16 values.
    And if we have to arrange if we have 24 bits then we can store 24 So pardon me
    16 point 7 million colors.
  persid: ''
- desc: I want to this TLA stands for three letter acronym for three letter abbreviation
    I guess more particularly anyway that that came up in class last year, so don't
    prepare for that. What are homogeneous coordinates and why are they important?
    Window and viewport.
  persid: ''
- desc: What's the advantage of WebGL when it comes to interaction because we can
    but we can also make use of HTML. We just go again to the Document Object Model
    to attach callbacks and so on.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this one was about just how are things organized in the HTML and the JavaScript
    files
  persid: ''
- desc: we did? We haven't been shading yet. Should you have known that? Okay, what
    are triangle strips and why are they important? That's a possible because we've
    talked about that might compare triangle strips and triangle fans
  persid: ''
- desc: Why is the flattened function required in our code
  persid: ''
- desc: and this 13 Does maybe a little bit of what we just talked about. What's the
    purpose of a Zed buffer or a depth buffer? We've talked about that a little bit
    too I think.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's what we did last year. So you can see which ones we're not going
    to touch. If you have suggestions about questions on the exam, that would be a
    fair assessment of learning to date. All except them until Friday at noon. Okay,
    that's CMRA
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. There are no objections will will dismiss for today. Oh, it's one minute
    early. So as my writing the size of my writing, okay, here at the end
  persid: ''
- desc: this is not good.
  persid: ''
- desc: Relation values hue See
  persid: ''
- desc: ya know context is important right
  persid: ''
- desc: we don't have the whole chapter by it's only the part where like you describe
    last.
  persid: ''
- desc: We talked about the beginning of class today.
  persid: ''
- desc: So is it finished? No. It's not. It's not the whole time.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, but we're not gonna. I'm not gonna ask you good stuff. It's in chapter
    five that we haven't talked about. Once no including some of the ideas from like
    specifying the viewing coordinates and and the perspective projection transformations.
    I won't make them
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll make them like our discussion. Not not more difficult. Anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll do my best to be considerate. Okay. Those were some some very good marks
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I don't want you to do badly. That's why I welcome your input. Okay,
    thank you. And I'll make this reappear on the website. Once they get back to my
    office, are you gonna ask questions from this? So
  persid: ''
- desc: I think it's very vital to just ask for the question. Let's do that. On Friday
    afternoon for one hour and one hour will be question people will be late
  persid: ''
- desc: scattering.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I went over that. This is last year's midterm. So it was later in the year
    so it has more concepts than we've covered. So I went through last year's midterm
    as a way to give you an idea of the kinds of questions I would ask and as an invitation
    for you need to do suggest different questions that would be a fair assessment
    of what we've learned in the class. To date.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, now we're over time.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you for today. So when you come, we'll be re examined here. So try and
    spread out if you get here before me, I will be here early. Earlier than I have
    been before you guys Yeah, the car my car. Will be back in good shape by then
    or Yeah. Anyway, so see you Monday. Have a good weekend. I have office hours but
    if you have questions, get in touch with me please. Okay, thanks. Today.
  persid: ''
- desc: I saw your new laptop is missing a sticker went to a developer's conference.
    So got one so what it's a GitHub ice cream
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, Octocat is an ice cream. I thought it was Oh no. Ice cream with whipped.
    Yeah. Thank you.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you have a good day. Thanks, you too.
  persid: ''
- desc: You could just send him to me, just
  persid: ''
- desc: because just because I'm going to study last Monday, I was here but I couldn't
    reach it. I couldn't reduce the attendance. I'm not sure why. Last Monday I was
    here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Right now I saw that you sent me a contact request. Oh yeah. But I don't do
    that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Because you are courses contacts. are really strange, I think. I don't know.
    When I'm gonna get a message from a contact, I don't know, the context and so
    on. So I would just say send me email
  persid: ''
- desc: that would be better. I just, I don't want you to feel like I'm I'm snubbing
    you or anything? It's just I don't do it for anybody.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's okay. Last, last Monday, I was about to ask this, this attendance. So
    I just send request content in your Course.
  persid: ''
- desc: by Professor bye have a good day.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you. Professor. You're welcome.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you. Professor. You're welcome.
