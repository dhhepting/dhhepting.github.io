- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was I was just behind you when

    we came out of that research'
  persid: ''
- desc: presentation.
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: I was in the presentation. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: I understood what you think
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it was. It was good to the dogs

    and the comprehensiveness of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'topic. It was really like,

    complete in their mind. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: what I think.
  persid: ''
- desc: So reminds me of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back in the 60s there, chose

    Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the program Eliza and Dr.

    Was just simulated, which gave'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people prompts as a therapist

    might. And then people would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would tell the computer things

    that they wouldn''t tell anybody'
  persid: ''
- desc: else
  persid: ''
- desc: 'treating them dead pretty crazy

    which like conceding them they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'friend like not sharing with

    someone else but with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: computer Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe. Anyway. So the experience

    of the people using that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'program, convinced reasonbable

    to stop his work in AI it''s more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subtle than that. But these

    issues have been around for a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'long time and she was talking

    about people wanting to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: advice. Morning.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we have including today

    we have six meetings.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So today let''s talk about

    assignments. And.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Do some more texture mapping
  persid: ''
- desc: then
  persid: ''
- desc: morning
  persid: ''
- desc: so the last two meetings
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, Karen had sent a link to an

    example he thought was'
  persid: ''
- desc: interesting with a cue
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the Apple logo. So we''ll talk

    about that and some other things'
  persid: ''
- desc: that are of interest.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then if you have questions,

    we''ll incorporate the questions'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the review.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ll just we''ll have focused

    on chapters one through nine'
  persid: ''
- desc: that seem okay okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Put this down so I don't
  persid: ''
- desc: start writing behind on screen
  persid: ''
- desc: Did you see assignment three
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I thought I had everything

    turned on but the links on your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'courses worried act so I think

    I''ve done that now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Hi good morning
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So my game ending an I gave you

    a link for inspiration'
  persid: ''
- desc: for assignment three but
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that that may be a little bit

    more work than you need to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through that example because

    it''s using a different library'
  persid: ''
- desc: and setting things up different
  persid: ''
- desc: So.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Just thought we''d take a minute

    to go through that'
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe we can even do an example.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any comments for me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay so I did say before, while

    I have this screen on that I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: not showing to you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I said we talked about

    assignments and I give me some'
  persid: ''
- desc: choice
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, I can be a bit flexible if

    you need'
  persid: ''
- desc: a bit more time with this one.
  persid: ''
- desc: I think that can be arranged.
  persid: ''
- desc: Fourth and fifth ones
  persid: ''
- desc: are due on the
  persid: ''
- desc: '12th of December. You can submit

    them earlier but I did the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trials because the 13th is the

    final exam. So this will help'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you in your preparation right.

    So I just I''ll just make sure'
  persid: ''
- desc: that I have things set up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was connected here you are

    courses and center responding so'
  persid: ''
- desc: I will fix that later.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m just deciding what to start

    with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Trouble with clicking and

    dragging.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's try that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, sorry for that pick up

    Okay, so how do you avoid it?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How can we? What''s the strategy

    to a straightforward strategy to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get? Two cubes display at the

    same time'
  persid: ''
- desc: excuse me for a minute please?
  persid: ''
- desc: To do this
  persid: ''
- desc: any ideas about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are we doing to set up

    one display'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'viewport? Well, we create a

    canvas and then we get a Web GL'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to context for the candidates.

    And then we compile the program'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so we''re always dealing with

    or we''re dealing with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'context that we get from the guy

    we associated with the canvas so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what if we just have two

    canvases? You just You think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m sorry. Can you repeat that?

    Can you repeat what you said? We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get really used to volcanoes

    Well, I don''t. So what I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'asking isn''t to have a button to

    switch between them. But to draw'
  persid: ''
- desc: into them at the same time?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s make this a little

    simpler.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s use a descriptive name one

    shall count as one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You have to do some work okay

    but so an HTML file we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: created two canvases.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay so we should be able to see

    a picture by the screen now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t catch all the I didn''t

    check all the references for'
  persid: ''
- desc: Canvas
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so I think that'll fix it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay let''s go back to the editor

    then. So what do we need to do?'
  persid: ''
- desc: To?
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you want to
  persid: ''
- desc: you want to draw on two canvases
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then we need to change the

    graphic GL the context for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'WebGL to that we get from the

    canvas. We want to associate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that with distinguish it from

    the first one the second one'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. So
  persid: ''
- desc: Still got things sorted here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Change declaration
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, what color should you make

    the other Canvas'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you give me three numbers

    between zero and one?'
  persid: ''
- desc: point five?
  persid: ''
- desc: So many guests that color is
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe something like yeah
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of a muted purple and

    magenta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that makes sense. So then the

    other part is we can then give'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our shaders different names I

    don''t want to spend more time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with you seeing watching me

    fumble on the keyboard'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let me create a program.

    We''re doing a shader, the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader and the fragment shader

    so we can name those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'differently. So our sample will

    have four two for each. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we can just apply the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rest I think is straightforward.

    You agree if you have questions'
  persid: ''
- desc: let me know.
  persid: ''
- desc: seem alright for now. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ve I have a fixed version

    of that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll update to the assignment
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so anyway, oh update the link

    for you to this version that'
  persid: ''
- desc: displays the figure
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this gives a way to

    manipulate the remodeling a'
  persid: ''
- desc: figure.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can see
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can control different aspects

    I don''t try this at home'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so basically the assignment four

    and five as they''re together'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re working on this this

    piece of code, take this code'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'address some of the interface

    issues but then first to texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and light the model that''s one

    part and the second part is to'
  persid: ''
- desc: animate the figure.
  persid: ''
- desc: So here's a simple alert.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s a robotic arm that''s gone

    crazy. Anyway, so that gives you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an idea of and I''ll put the link

    I''ll update the link for this'
  persid: ''
- desc: one too.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All right, so as I mentioned, so

    the front flip assignment three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the two canvases. That''s a

    24th that''s the target if that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comes in issue for somebody. We

    can have a bit of flexibility'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there. Then, the last bit figure

    that was December 12, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: your final exam was on the 13th
  persid: ''
- desc: and we a month from today
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so our last meeting I

    think is on the fifth well maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not. Maybe it''s the fourth of

    December.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, we have six meetings

    left. I wrote it down. Post a'
  persid: ''
- desc: picture of the board afterwards
  persid: ''
- desc: okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I want to show you a texture

    more complete texture mapping'
  persid: ''
- desc: sample
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so that''s so there''s two

    textures here. The one is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'checkerboard and the other one

    is this the sign pattern'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you say so let''s take a peek

    at the vertex shader.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re getting our vertex

    position, a vertex color and a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'text texture coordinate. So

    these are all vertex attributes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here and we''re putting out a

    vertex color and a vertex type'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chord and we have a uniform for

    the angle of rotation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here, we''re doing the

    rotation, rotation computation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inside the shader. We''re just

    passing through the color and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the texture coordinate but the

    position is going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplying by the rotation

    matrices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the fragment shader repeating

    the color, the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates or printing out the

    fragment color and then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uniform sampler 2d as well about

    sampling the textures'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re gonna pass are

    different textures as uniforms'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and they''re going to be sampler

    2d. So that means we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample the texture, the two

    dimensional texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are shader GLSL

    commands'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re solving the two

    textures and using that to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'modulate the color and we get

    the fragment color out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing going to

    positions relate to the drawing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to draw 36

    triangles because there''s six'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'faces aren''t we we''re not

    drawing 36 triangles for drawing'
  persid: ''
- desc: '12 triangles but the each so we

    need 36 vertices to specify'
  persid: ''
- desc: them.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so our texture is going to be

    256 by 256 Restoring four bytes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for each element of the texture

    we''re doing that for'
  persid: ''
- desc: for both textures.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here we''re setting up the

    image contents'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m just thinking that it''s not

    this could be written a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: bit more clearly. I've just
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything you want to comment

    about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, so we''re setting up the

    textures. So the type checker'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'squares, we''re doing the image

    and then we''re doing a checkers'
  persid: ''
- desc: in each direction
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s change it for the heck of

    it. Let''s make it 10 No, let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: make it over. To you.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you for and staff
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right so we''re creating textures

    buying the textures like we did'
  persid: ''
- desc: with the buffers.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we''re working on texture

    one start with'
  persid: ''
- desc: this is setting up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the for the display of the

    texture and then we create the'
  persid: ''
- desc: image for the second texture
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then do the same kind of

    thing. We set up the parameters'
  persid: ''
- desc: and create the texture
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have then texture one and

    texture two which are available'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to us to use for text for for

    the shader.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here in our program we have

    the color buffer and vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer and then the texture

    buffer. So the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates are pretty

    straightforward to just zero to'
  persid: ''
- desc: one zero to one.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then here''s here''s a recall

    to configure textures the code'
  persid: ''
- desc: to configure the textures
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we make the textures

    zero so we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we make one texture active

    and set that up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we associate the settings we''ve

    set up earlier in the Configure'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture routine.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in our program we''re dinners

    we''re associating you tech zero'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I say Tech because I''m used

    to saying tech and Latech anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use Latech? Who says latex for

    that program?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, that''s I heard a voice. I

    didn''t I wasn''t misled.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Exploiting? Yeah. No, I thought

    somebody else had some other'
  persid: ''
- desc: comment. Anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the etiquette is to say is

    pronounced as tech and Latech.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s why I''m saying tech

    urine stuff tax anyway that''s an'
  persid: ''
- desc: aside so we're
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're binding the textures
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here and then we''re setting the

    uniform really saying the'
  persid: ''
- desc: location
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then we can reference that

    texture.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let''s change this just a

    little bit by.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in the fragment shader, we''re

    just using one texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so my performance wasn''t the

    best today I guess.'
  persid: ''
- desc: It was in this anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is this helpful to go through

    these examples? Okay. So, as I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said, we''ll talk about chapters

    eight and nine and the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three meetings and then we''ll

    leave our last week for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'examples. If you''d like to

    discuss and some review for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: final
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. All right. Thank you very

    much for today. Have a great'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'day, everyone. We''ll see you on

    Wednesday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You're welcome.
