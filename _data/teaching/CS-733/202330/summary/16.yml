- desc: 'Okay, we''re still a little bit

    we''re not quite on time yet. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: morning.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question the assigned today is

    the last day of submission,'
  persid: ''
- desc: right?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes and one minute to midnight

    tonight.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is there any flexibility on that

    I have a root canal treatment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today oh and I don''t know how

    good or bad that''s gonna be. Are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you going to Doctor fee? No.

    Campus? Dentist yeah what do you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mean by a decision people get

    every page I had already it''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: root canal
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah I've had to
  persid: ''
- desc: this the first time
  persid: ''
- desc: I've never had
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my dentist. So the thing is my

    dentist said oh, I can do this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And he did it but he couldn''t

    get all the routes out. So then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I went to see an endodontist

    who''s in southeast Regina. Dr.'
  persid: ''
- desc: fee.
  persid: ''
- desc: So anyway, are they good?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, they''re good. But I mean,

    this one tooth boy has bothered'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me for 50 years. So there''s a

    time where I''ve just putting it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'off and then I finally got a

    root canal and then a word was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better for a while but then I

    got infected. Anyway so if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the chance. Me some places

    have entered artists who do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: root canals and things like that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for two hours, blocked out two

    hours had they actually so he''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve never had any dental

    issues back home. So I''m from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'India and never had any dental

    issues. I land here four days'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'later, I get a toothache and

    then my insurance doesn''t cover'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dental because I just landed and

    it activates in September so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was living with toothache. for

    like eight, nine months. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then when I went there, he''s

    like, Well, you waited a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'too long. So I''ll try and RCT

    but come ready for an extraction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s not something that I was

    looking forward to.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, we''re not talking it''s now

    10 o''clock we could start no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more talking about root canals.

    I was gonna say that once. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used to go to a computer

    graphics conferences. Like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'SIGGRAPH, the big one in LA and

    is mostly in LA now it''s been in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Vancouver and other places as

    well but it was in LA'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and obviously, in these things

    called Invisalign, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: I have those.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they were recruited ever

    recruiting at SIGGRAPH for'
  persid: ''
- desc: people to do the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics with models of the

    teeth I got cells from scans. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I remember I remembered that for

    some reason, because I didn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have Invisalign when I was had

    my braces. I just had braces in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'high school which were which

    were not fun'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so sorry. Back to where we

    started. Would it be possible to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'extend all right, right. And not

    just for me, I don''t want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everyone else today. So could it

    be possible to extend it for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: whole class by another day?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or we can say two days. How''s

    that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sounds great. That''s a

    Halloween.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Today is All Saints Day, all

    things all things Halloween is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Eve the eve of All Saints

    Day.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s written Hello. The E

    apostrophe en at the end is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: contraction of
  persid: ''
- desc: evening Eve anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so let me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'log into your courses and change

    that right away. So then Monday'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll have a discussion about

    next assignments. Sounds good.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ll fit three of them in

    somehow over the next or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: remaining part of the semester.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So while I''m doing this you can

    all take record your attendance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Don''t forget about doing the

    responses to meetings. I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gotten a bit out of my rhythm

    here but I''ll get caught up.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I should turn this back on or

    put this on the screen so you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can tell them I''m not just

    making it up and changing this'
  persid: ''
- desc: for you.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is there a reason do you

    think that I only have five'
  persid: ''
- desc: to 13 people here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Professor something brought up

    that I''ve lost. People are just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not getting good with the

    weather. Like with the sudden'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'change a few of them felt sick.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was sick I guess it was

    wondering too. About whether'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s if you''re living in

    different parts of the city it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: hard to come to campus or
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway try and
  persid: ''
- desc: make the class time valuable
  persid: ''
- desc: especially today, you can tell
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put a note on our courses they

    should come or'
  persid: ''
- desc: come to see me in my office
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s proof that I changed

    the date. It''s not on yet'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you see that the new date for

    assignment two Thank you'
  persid: ''
- desc: hello morning.
  persid: ''
- desc: To be able to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'communicate across the coffee or

    people suddenly have an'
  persid: ''
- desc: extended.
  persid: ''
- desc: Practice
  persid: ''
- desc: save me shave
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so the two of you came in.

    Here''s the reward. Thank you so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much. Thank you one candy bar

    goes down.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m feeling like I''m writing my

    writing is reasonable size here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'He just can''t get the lower

    right he gets smaller. So maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll just read on the top of the

    board just one line one line.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Next line Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I've improved that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that cube example and we''ll look

    at that in more detail'
  persid: ''
- desc: what are some of the ideas
  persid: ''
- desc: that you
  persid: ''
- desc: that you had that you've
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gotten from the past or previous

    discussion about lighting and'
  persid: ''
- desc: shading
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we had the local light coming

    into view'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can have
  persid: ''
- desc: that's fine
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we sit down to get

    comfortable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my wife pointed out today some

    of them are peanuts in them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah this one Yeah. Peanut

    Butter anyway but you''re welcome'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would surely pointed that out

    after she was there when I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bought them and I said I was

    gonna do get one of each of'
  persid: ''
- desc: these two boxes from Costco
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and, and then yesterday, it''s

    like, well, why''d you do this?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But you''re right I don''t know

    what I was thinking. Anyway. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I hope there''s no one allergic

    to peanuts'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m talking about point lights

    or point light is located in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scene in the world coordinates.

    And directional light is you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think of it as being off an

    infinity let''s say the sun so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have a constant angle of the

    light direction for directional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lights, but the angle of

    incidence of the light from a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point light is going to change

    depending on the orientation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Pardon me.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we talked about the

    difference between calculating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intensities of vertices or

    calculating colors of vertices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then interpolating that

    along the edges compared to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calculating vectors and

    interpolating vectors so that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can do lighting calculations as

    appropriate at each point along'
  persid: ''
- desc: the line as it gets transformed.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you want to do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calculations based on vectors

    between vertices, what do we'
  persid: ''
- desc: have to do? In general terms
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where do we have to put the

    code?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Could you repeat the question?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If we want, we don''t want to

    just interpolate colors between'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertices but we want to

    interpolate more information to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get a more realistic sense of

    highlights on the surface for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example. Where do we need to do

    that calculation? In the'
  persid: ''
- desc: shadows,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re in the shaders. Yeah. So

    in our JavaScript program, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'organizing the data, then

    passing it to the shaders, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shaders are. So we''re doing

    for each vertex we''re getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'recalling the vertex shader. But

    then, for each pixel, we call'
  persid: ''
- desc: the fragment shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if we put.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Following Fung Shui so where''s

    my cut off here? Here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yep, that's it. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All right. So I''m gonna try and

    stick with that. We decided that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m doing fine writing at the

    top of the board. The writing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gets smaller as you go down the

    board. So we''re going to try and'
  persid: ''
- desc: manage to keep
  persid: ''
- desc: writing the top
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to just make clear

    that there''s two different parts'
  persid: ''
- desc: to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this entire board flying so

    there''s shading and reflections.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a modification to the

    farm reflection. model called'
  persid: ''
- desc: the blin farm fun model. That
  persid: ''
- desc: so instead
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of having to look at the

    interaction of so doing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calculation based on the labor

    position vector and the viewer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can approximate it using a

    normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which means we don''t have to do

    that calculation in the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader. We can do it in the

    vertex shader.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let me show you what I did to

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: shaded q1
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so here we are
  persid: ''
- desc: so I put the latest
  persid: ''
- desc: 'API point. Let''s do some

    rotation here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can see they did a once

    the face is facing us. It gets a'
  persid: ''
- desc: highlight.
  persid: ''
- desc: That makes sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yep.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. Let's look at
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this, while it was rotating,

    even on a axis which should not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be directly pointing at me there

    was a highlight. So if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotate it now. So even though it

    should not be because it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'turned on an X, Y and Zed x one

    three of them, so no face should'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be directly looking at.

    Actually, that if you had this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, so this highlights is the

    reflection still accurate.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's look at
  persid: ''
- desc: the card game
  persid: ''
- desc: meant.
  persid: ''
- desc: To be about
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Course the sharing is good.
  persid: ''
- desc: Morning Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what we''re doing in the vertex

    shader here. So first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transforming the vertex into my

    coordinates. So we''re specifying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the view position and the leg

    position in world coordinates.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we use the model view matrix

    to get the new position of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex in world coordinates in

    our model viewport and that''s it'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re like factor is between

    like position and the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and as a viewer position, so

    I''ve added a variable to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'indicate that in the JavaScript

    program so this halfway vector'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we normalize the length vector

    because of your vector'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we get the normal

    vector from the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: which we chain
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put into world coordinates

    coordinates and then we compute'
  persid: ''
- desc: the different terms
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have an ambient, diffuse

    so that''s the main contribution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the main lighting

    contribution. We see when we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a light is a diffuse

    reflection.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So k d is based on ganglion

    between the light and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: surface normal.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re multiplying that by the

    product that we''re getting from'
  persid: ''
- desc: our program
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the specular highlights

    we''re looking at the angle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between the normal and the

    halfway vector and erasing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the power of shininess to get

    the constant that we''re modeling'
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we don't
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to zero raise the bar of shyness

    is not going to give us any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'highlights so we only see

    highlights when we''re facing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light which is about the viewer

    position.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Material is defined in this as

    well so like reflective'
  persid: ''
- desc: materials as opposed to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the material properties are

    defined in the program, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'JavaScript side, okay. And so

    that''s encoded in three years.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In these products. So look at

    that next.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're having
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a defining some storage here

    near the vertices. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing a cube centered at the

    origin minus point five minus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point five minus point 5.5 point

    5.5. So it''s a unit cube'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'centered at the origin so I''ve

    added viewer position in the, on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the website as a position for

    the viewer, but it''s not used.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I made use of it here. And

    here''s the leg position. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve set the leg position to be

    the same as same as if you were'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a physician. So you could change

    that. So the length for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ambient is a low powered light,

    but it''s a white light because'
  persid: ''
- desc: we have
  persid: ''
- desc: light
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intensity, same intensity for

    red, green and blue. And then,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here we have a few sliders, full

    intensity white specks, their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'latest full intensity white as

    well. So here are the materials'
  persid: ''
- desc: for the ambient, so this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blueish and this is red plus

    green. So it''s yellowish and'
  persid: ''
- desc: this is white ish.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And we put material shyness at

    100.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sooner during the cube we do the

    faces. So we''re doing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quadrilateral but then we''re

    dividing those into two'
  persid: ''
- desc: triangles and we're taking
  persid: ''
- desc: finding
  persid: ''
- desc: 'finding the normals based on the

    subtraction so taking two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertices so we get a vector and

    another vector and then we do a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cross product to get the normals

    then we''re storing the vertices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the normal vectors. So

    because the quadrilateral faces'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'playing here, so we can just

    store with the same normal for'
  persid: ''
- desc: each vertex
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we''re creating a normal

    buffer buffer for the normals.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And we''re storing that data in

    there. And we''re making a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connection between the attribute

    normal in the shader with our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their data are doing the same

    with the vertices so we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: projection matrix which does
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the graphic projection so a

    parallel projection and then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ambient product. So we''re

    multiplying the light times the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material ambient properties so

    that''s where the information'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the surface gets fed into

    the shader. Because then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: going to make uniform
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you Ambien product, so that''s

    the place in the shader. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connected with the variables in

    our jabsco program the render'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're doing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplying the modelview

    matrix, start with identity'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix, and we multiply by the

    rotation in x, y and Zed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we pass that to the you

    ModelView matrix in the shader.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s how we transform the

    vertices. into real coordinates.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Tertiary move the light to what

    change would you like to make?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'leg position or the actually

    let''s try it let''s do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'another version of nmbm Lake

    which is.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So he''s a full intensity. Like

    for the Ambien chaining'
  persid: ''
- desc: Save?
  persid: ''
- desc: So we made
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ambient faces blue. So you

    can see that we''re getting lots'
  persid: ''
- desc: of blue
  persid: ''
- desc: and then because surfaces Wait
  persid: ''
- desc: let's make another
  persid: ''
- desc: change. Here.
  persid: ''
- desc: That's that's a big impact
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go back to our original ambient

    light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s see what if we move too

    late to a distance of two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so light position vector this is

    the value of the distance of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light or the angle of this is

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position of the light. Right so

    and so when I do the calculation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and shader comes true. So we''re

    transforming the vertex. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position the pause vector has

    the role coordinate position of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vertex. Okay. And then the

    lake position is there and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to normalize this to

    the late and the position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re calculating the vector

    the lighting vector is doing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: leg position
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the difference from the leg

    position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the vertex so for each each

    vertex are going to do that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calculation. So the angle is

    going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: but I have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to change the source or the

    direction of where the light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming from. Let''s say want to

    be obtuse angle coming on to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object move that also be defined

    in here or is that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well we can change the light

    position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we putting it at the

    same position we start out with'
  persid: ''
- desc: the same position as the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right but how do we change it?

    How do we tell it that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I mean I get it but we''re

    setting it at the same point of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the viewing point like the eye

    and the light is coming from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same point but if you have to

    say the eyes coming straight'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'towards the object while the

    light is shining on the top.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so let's think about
  persid: ''
- desc: where we want that to be
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's change it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s let''s make it not let''s

    make it to it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this will put
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the lady in position above the

    queue fairly close to the queue.'
  persid: ''
- desc: To try that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we got a kind of interesting

    highlight there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s change the lighting

    position a little bit more was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put a little bit towards the

    viewer as well. So to still be'
  persid: ''
- desc: involved but just a little bit
  persid: ''
- desc: see these
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these are fun to play with.

    Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And think about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from from our human side

    computing perspective. I can see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all your smiling faces. If you

    think about human centered'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computing perspective, we want

    to think about the my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frustration with these examples

    as they are is that it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re not the interesting

    things to manipulate aren''t made'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accessible. So that''s part of

    what would be interesting here I'
  persid: ''
- desc: think to
  persid: ''
- desc: just change the direction of
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah so you can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can make the interface work

    more available, so we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: understand, see what's going on.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s some other thing

    websites'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I want to show you as well. I''ll

    do that before too long here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s a time Raven so let''s see

    what we did here. With this and'
  persid: ''
- desc: then.
  persid: ''
- desc: Hear you can see an artifact
  persid: ''
- desc: of two triangles on the surface
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s more noticeable than when

    he added as I said related 20'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because the difference in angles

    between different vertices are'
  persid: ''
- desc: more pronounced.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is from WebGL one
  persid: ''
- desc: but if I was kind of needed
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I need animation so you can see

    in the shader So, we''re passing'
  persid: ''
- desc: the colors
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you have a color associated

    with each vertex and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fragment shaders doing the

    interpolation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s that''s the way this is

    happening here and in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: fragment shader
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specifying the vertex color as

    an out and then in the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader we specify the color

    hasn''t been masking out the'
  persid: ''
- desc: fragment color
  persid: ''
- desc: so the fragment color
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value interpolated from vertex

    colors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: going to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'show you a spotlight example. as

    well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Three Jas
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the lines there are an

    addition or a helper to see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where the spotlights are being

    defined'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the other question I want

    to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: the demo that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we just created. With the cube,

    we are not taking into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consideration any shadow of the

    object. Like with the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source, we''re not changing the

    position of the shadow or or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'showing any shadow on the

    object.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now we''re not it''s nothing there

    to'
  persid: ''
- desc: he's not he's not
  persid: ''
- desc: there isn't anything there. It's
  persid: ''
- desc: like a sort of face should
  persid: ''
- desc: cast a shadow on
  persid: ''
- desc: you like so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make sense? Like not like a

    plane so would it not change'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some areas around the canvas

    itself? Which is being blocked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the light? Let''s say that

    Candice is getting has an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ambient light. And then there is

    light that is coming in from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like you don''t have to Sandy

    will that not be diffused onto'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the canvas as well. For housing

    message that do we not do or do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we just consider the object in a

    vast empty space'
  persid: ''
- desc: basically
  persid: ''
- desc: 'suing so in computer graphics, I

    mean we think we don''t have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same idea of the arrangement of

    so many things are handled for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'us in the real world. You know,

    so there are walls that of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making lunch which we can cast

    shadows and add some realism but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a computer graphics model,

    we have to describe everything.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Everything so if we need to add,

    add a feature we need to add it'
  persid: ''
- desc: add it to the scene so we can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so all I''ll take that on

    as and we''ll we''ll talk about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that. On Monday. We''ll take the

    shader cube example and add'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadows. Add a place for them to

    appear and make sure there'
  persid: ''
- desc: we'll deal with all that okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these web pages here that I

    I''m flashing here I''ll put them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in links for for you to look at

    the meeting. Notes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So this one is using
  persid: ''
- desc: 'her fragment shading I just want

    to just show what''s going on'
  persid: ''
- desc: here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not very well documented

    here. So we have the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: which isn't used
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so he''s making some assumptions

    about think the viewer is at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: origin here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so he is for the eye so the idea

    is we''re getting a GL position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'based on our projection so this

    is in our clip coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of passing out the normal

    vertex lighting vector for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertex
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector which is a viewer

    position relative to the vertex.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So those three vectors are being

    passed to the fragment.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'outputting the vector not

    putting the fragment so here'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're doing
  persid: ''
- desc: calculating the halfway vector
  persid: ''
- desc: during the diffuse
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea here is a missed

    example. We''re doing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: interpolating the vectors for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re at the vertices for

    calculating the normal relating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back here and of your position

    vector with respect to each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex, and we''re passing those

    to the fragment shader, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re doing essentially the same

    computations we did in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shading cube exam example. But

    I''ll create another version of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shaded cube which uses a per

    fragment shading so you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: compare the two of them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I just found a website. When do

    you think we can reach this'
  persid: ''
- desc: level?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Quickly just discuss the code of

    this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'insurance what why once you one

    Can you post the'
  persid: ''
- desc: URL? Sure.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This like when I started work,

    so there used to be this website'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called Code rocks. I''m sure you

    all have it in palace wardrobes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I used to just grow through it

    every day. Like I have a huge'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bookmark for all these WebGL

    things and I''ve always wondered'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how they used to do and I just

    remembered when you showed that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you that I saw one of those add

    that to the to add that to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'notes. Actually, you can add to

    the discussion. Yeah, that''d be'
  persid: ''
- desc: good please.
  persid: ''
- desc: CMRA things getting more clear.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we'll take on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the suggestions, the shadows and

    so on. We''ll talk about that on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Monday and then we''ll also get

    into chapter seven.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, sounds good. Thank you for

    today.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll try and remember to keep my

    writing in the top half of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: board
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and if anyone wants another

    treat'
  persid: ''
- desc: you come
  persid: ''
- desc: and get them as you leave
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you for today.
