- desc: Questions about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions about assignment

    three?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's do tonight.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it did say like, make changes

    to the material like parameters'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the, the rendering. So how

    many parameters were supposed to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be changed because I just added

    to changed the way that the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light diffusers with the cube

    and I also changed the angle of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collect that hits the cube. Okay

    but there are like shininess and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specular or ambient light or do

    we have to we have to change'
  persid: ''
- desc: everything or was to just enough
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I guess I would say it''s up

    to you. So so maybe things that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will highlight the difference

    between the two shaders.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you if you think Gee, I

    wonder what would happen if I'
  persid: ''
- desc: did this?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I did. Most of them were working

    but some of them were just too'
  persid: ''
- desc: difficult. To get them running.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Using a judgment about how many

    parameters'
  persid: ''
- desc: you expose in the interface
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe think about
  persid: ''
- desc: shows off
  persid: ''
- desc: the differences
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it shows up the differences

    between the shaders.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, remember to document and

    explain your code'
  persid: ''
- desc: use Bootstrap and WebGL to.
  persid: ''
- desc: Follow instructions
  persid: ''
- desc: in the assignment.
  persid: ''
- desc: Include a readme file
  persid: ''
- desc: that explains
  persid: ''
- desc: how to use your code
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe we''ll say that a readme

    file is not just for the marker'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for me but for people who might

    come across your code and say'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some make the descriptions clear

    enough and detailed enough so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that people who don''t have

    specific background I was late'
  persid: ''
- desc: to
  persid: ''
- desc: welcome everyone
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I''m going assignment

    three is due tonight. Use your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'judgment about how many

    parameters to expose in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interface. If you think about

    what shows off the differences'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between the shaders. Document

    and explain your code. use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Bootstrap and letter WebGL to

    follow instructions in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment description and

    include a readme file that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'explains how to use your code to

    anyone so people who might just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'come across your your code and

    say so give them enough details'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that they can run your code and

    if you have questions about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the questions about how to do

    avoid pitfalls from assignment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to maybe if you have time you

    can stop and talk to me after'
  persid: ''
- desc: class
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So these are some general things

    to keep in mind. So it makes'
  persid: ''
- desc: sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought about trying to fix

    the tea pot and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I thought that was not a good

    use of my time. Especially after'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reading a common for Americans

    who seems to supply the'
  persid: ''
- desc: the data for
  persid: ''
- desc: every every
  persid: ''
- desc: no skin
  persid: ''
- desc: Changes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Made some major change Isn't.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so these are a couple

    teapot examples which are I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think using Eric Haynes data

    set. Sara Caine''s has a long'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'history in computer graphics and

    he teaches or he taught you'
  persid: ''
- desc: Udacity course.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, so this is using
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so originally the teapot didn''t

    have a bottom Oh yeah. So this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was added color by hurricanes

    was that the bottom is a flat'
  persid: ''
- desc: so there might be not a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcription error by the

    authors of our text but it may'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just be a part of the dataset

    anyway'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s this is one example

    using'
  persid: ''
- desc: this is using three js
  persid: ''
- desc: here's an example in three Jas,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is what the teapot

    looked like originally.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then as a demonstration of how

    they could manipulate the model'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by scaling it they flattened it

    out a little bit and this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decided like this one better

    than the original teapot. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: history of computer graphics
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we looked at last day three

    cubes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Why is not working it wasn''t

    working.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like a couple of designs, even

    for sign for.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The entered shaders weren''t

    available.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I tried it as it was
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I just don''t know. Right WT X

    only created a folder for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: same folder. It's still empty
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so do i do i need to do

    something different to encourage'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'communication about issues like

    this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I did. I did it very late in the

    night'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because I realized the sample

    that I put into the directory'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t wasn''t I didn''t have all

    the pads Correct. Yeah, I guess'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that could be for the robotic

    arm. For example.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you are telling me and I''m

    not responding us another issue.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think it''s set up your course

    and stuff is set up so that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: see everything that comes in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but maybe not make complete

    sense'
  persid: ''
- desc: make the nation
  persid: ''
- desc: humans
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m not sure when I

    introduced that error but I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll post it again after class
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is an example where

    we''re using that cube data'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re just creating different

    instances of the cube where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re creating three separate

    cubes by three separate calls to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cube functions that are in

    the cube data.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'See if this one works better

    Okay, so there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone getting a seizure?
  persid: ''
- desc: I close my eyes. Nice to see you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so what I''ve done here, so

    the text has instance t pods.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But the code for the T pod is

    beyond our beyond what we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'covering so I wanted to make it

    with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to build on the Cube example. So

    what I''ve done here is created'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one so we have one copy of the

    cube and we''re instancing it'
  persid: ''
- desc: several times.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this involves a change to the

    vertex shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what what do we notice? About

    this vertex shader? Can you you'
  persid: ''
- desc: want to say anything that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different from what we''ve done

    before.'
  persid: ''
- desc: About the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex attributes are the

    instance attributes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'protects vertex attributes

    that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so position and color are

    usually the taking the A matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's a new matrix
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so that's one thing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and what else so you have GL

    position that''s familiar. What'
  persid: ''
- desc: about GL instance? Id
  persid: ''
- desc: used here for laugh.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fragment shader doesn''t have

    much to do. It''s just doing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pass through the vertex color

    but certain GL instant ID'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'identify which instance sense

    which instance so we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the instance part will be

    used in the visible here more'
  persid: ''
- desc: clear here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So give me a number of essences

    more than 36 for you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Not nothing bigger than that.

    4096'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, let's try 4096
  persid: ''
- desc: implemented
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much more simplistic, more

    restrained one. This should turn'
  persid: ''
- desc: out to be a cube
  persid: ''
- desc: cube of cubes
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re just we''re not making

    4096 or 216 copies of the data'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re using the same data over

    and over again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we''re setting up the

    cube'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re setting up the callbacks.

    Initializing the ship program'
  persid: ''
- desc: with the shaders.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re creating the vertex

    buffer.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And the color buffer
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creating matrix data. So we''re

    just allocating space. So that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing we''re creating a

    matrix for each instance. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take the number of instances

    multiply by 16. So that''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'number of float values that

    we''re going to add per matrix.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I took this example from a

    modified example for Web GL two'
  persid: ''
- desc: fundamentals
  persid: ''
- desc: and I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'combined it with libraries that

    we''re using what the textbook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, so we''re creating that

    space for beta.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix structure and binding to

    it. We''re using a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'usage here. Same dynamic draw to

    indicate that this data will be'
  persid: ''
- desc: changing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now here''s something else that''s

    new. Because we have seen the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix as an attribute. We need

    to use four indices instead of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just one to encode or connect

    the matrix attribute to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: data.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is when we get these locations

    the matrix lock or the position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lock or the color lock. Those

    are all indices. So those come'
  persid: ''
- desc: up as integers.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re using frozen indices to

    make the connection between the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'program and the shader. So for

    the matrix, we need to have many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to use for indices. So loop is

    dry equals zero, i less than'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four. So then, we''re taking the

    original matrix location based'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the variable names that we

    locate a matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'individually, enabling the

    vertex attribute array for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'logical for the next one

    location or lock'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re setting up that

    connection. And then the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing that we''re doing here is

    using vertex attribute divisor'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're saying
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the attribute changes once per

    instance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here, we''re going through the

    instances and we''re updating the'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrix at random
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we''re we''re updating

    the buffer with the new matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then here we''re going back

    to the vertex buffer. So here we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say, start at zero. Draw 36

    vertices in here the number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instances. So the difference is

    draw arrays instanced instead of'
  persid: ''
- desc: just draw arrays.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so let me show you one

    other thing that we can do.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so this is going to say
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now, we''re going to use one

    color the color that we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to use is going to change with

    every instance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're having an air here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex buffers not big enough

    for the draw call. So we changed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so we''re using one color per

    instance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So what's the issue
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have 36 vertices 36 colors
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's running out of colors
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which took me a little bit to

    put together'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we have 216 instances 36

    colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's change this to six
  persid: ''
- desc: 'six times 36 should be to 16 So

    we should see a result here'
  persid: ''
- desc: this is less seizure inducing.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so that's.
  persid: ''
- desc: It that's drying instanced.
  persid: ''
- desc: Arrays
  persid: ''
- desc: questions rather
  persid: ''
- desc: similar right
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so now I have the robotic arm

    working'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the geometry.js file is not

    in common directory it''s in'
  persid: ''
- desc: chapter nine.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I correct that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it seems like it would be a good

    place to put it in the common'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directory. So I should I''ll make

    a copy of it there as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The figure dot HTML is also is

    not happy you can choose to'
  persid: ''
- desc: choose but
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah
  persid: ''
- desc: bye Okay, let
  persid: ''
- desc: me go to that one first.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thought
  persid: ''
- desc: I posted corrections to this
  persid: ''
- desc: it let me see.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not sure why I didn''t update

    maybe I hadn''t saved before. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'published it posted again after

    class.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Remember the original one to the

    one that I showed you last time.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'These were squares instead or

    cubes instead of cylinders'
  persid: ''
- desc: she'll get to know.
  persid: ''
- desc: So here we just have our usual
  persid: ''
- desc: vertex shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: And fragment shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so here we''re just

    specifying some constants for'
  persid: ''
- desc: the shape of robotic arm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'indicating so we have three

    angles for the base for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: lower arm and for the upper arm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I didn''t change the name of

    my cube Let change into a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cylinder here so we can change

    it back to cube and see.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'John tree we also have these

    materials so we can access let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: look at the geometry js file.
  persid: ''
- desc: So now I have gold to find
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think there''s only one life

    yes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They also have a texture to

    find.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Switching to the cylinder margin

    since we have a different number'
  persid: ''
- desc: of vertices are the object
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we got the length of the

    triangle vertices so this is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: feature of each primitive
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can even change to the

    sphere here let''s try that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Looks better than I thought it

    would.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we''re getting the data

    from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data structure here. Sorry,

    surgery in one cube'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re setting a setting of the

    uniforms'
  persid: ''
- desc: shader
  persid: ''
- desc: 'render we''re doing this rotation

    on we''re changing the angles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'displaying angles on the

    sliders. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'change the modelview matrix to

    be to do the rotation around the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Y axis and then we call the base

    function when you''re under the'
  persid: ''
- desc: lower arm we're changing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re updating the slider and

    then the modelview matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'includes so we''re doing a

    translation and then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation. So situating the lower

    arm on top of the vase and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotating and then drying the

    lower arm. And then last part'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re updating the model view

    matrix again by translating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'floor arm height and rotating

    the upper arm and then the drive'
  persid: ''
- desc: the upper arm.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ve got the modelview

    matrix that sort of sets up the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'base the starting point and then

    we''re drawing in. We''re doing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix to describe the instance

    and that''s based on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameters so the width and the

    height.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then we multiply the

    incidence matrix with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'modelview matrix that''s passed.

    Along that''s current. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we update the uniform matrix in

    the shader this product instance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix and model the matrix when

    we''re drawing the vertices that'
  persid: ''
- desc: are required.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So each time we render we start

    with a ModelView matrix based on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rotation of the base around

    the Y axis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we change the order of

    these drawings, pieces and they'
  persid: ''
- desc: would be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there would be a problem they

    wouldn''t be connected anymore'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's the idea of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of working with matrices to do

    transformation so we can start'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with single primitive and

    transform it and that''s the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'idea that''s in the figure that

    HTML file'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in both those examples today

    with the robotic arm and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instance cubes, we''re working

    with one set of data and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transforming it so we can get

    more complexity.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And when without,
  persid: ''
- desc: with some efficiency as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense? Any

    questions?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, thank you for today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, thank you for today.
