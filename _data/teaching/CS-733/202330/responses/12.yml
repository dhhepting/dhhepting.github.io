important:
- desc: The most important thig that I learned about the solution of previous year
    mid questions paper, in which most interesting solution for the question about
    Starting from black,  how to get to the colour white, using the 3 primitive colours?
    and from white and went to black?
- desc: The relation between the  continuous, discrete, sampling, and quantization
    and the way how go from white to black and the reverse from the cube with the
    colors lines.
- desc: The way WebGL is referenced and what forms a view using the point of view,
    vertices and the up vector.
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about view coordinates and vectors.
- desc: Can I answer that vertex and fragment shader for this question? - &quot;How
    do we indicate that webGL Program?&quot; My understanding is vertex is for the
    geometry data and fragment is for texture of the graphic. So, they indicate as
    a webgl program ?
