important:
- desc: The thing I learned today are different type of displays and how graphics
    work on these displays with them.
- desc: I learned about JPEG compression, image sampling, formats (bitmap vs. vector),
    computer graphics applications, system components, and the graphics pipeline.Among
    them ,most important and interesing thing for me is the working of CRT and raster
    vs vector difference.
- desc: is how the cathode ray tub works and knowing about the graphics pipeline.
- desc: Importance of graphics and visualization in daily life.
- desc: I learned about the grapics system that includes Input devices, Central Processing
    Unit, Graphics Processing Unit, Memory, Framebuffer and Output devices.
- desc: The way that CRTs work was the most interesting thing for me I learned it
    before but totally forget it and also I didn&#039;t know about the image sampling
    and Interlaced display.
- desc: I learned about Interlaced Displays a technique where even and odd lines refresh
    separately to optimize refresh rates, and also about the rasterization and importance
    of depth information.
- desc: How Shadow Mask ensures that the electron beam hits only the correct dots.
know-more:
- desc: as I am new to the subject graphic design, it is both fun and challenging
    to learn, I would like to learn more about from today&#039;s lecture is graphic
    pipeline, the little I know about that is The stages and processes required in
    rendering a 3D scene into a 2D screen are described by the graphics pipeline,
    a key idea in computer graphics and 3D rendering. The conversion of 3D models
    and scenes into 2D images that can be viewed on a computer monitor is a methodical,
    step-by-step procedure.
- desc: Would like to know more about graphics pipeline
- desc: The example with a synthetic camera and the explanation was very engaging
    for me. I am eagerly looking forward to more such examples in the forthcoming
    sessions.
