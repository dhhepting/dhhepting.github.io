difficult:
- desc: The code for graphics
important:
- desc: Learned about the the 2D gaskets as well as graphics pipeline and also about
    the camera coordinates and clipping coordinates
- desc: "I learned how to add a slider in Sierpi\u0144ski Gasket."
- desc: The most captivating aspect of today&#039;s class was hands-on exploration
    of 3D depictions of Sierpinski Gaskets. What made it particularly intriguing was
    the ability to alter the camera&#039;s position, providing with a dynamic perspective
    and enhancing our understanding of the subject.
- desc: I learned about the Graphics pipeline, 2D gasket also learned about the vertex
    shaders and fragment shaders.
- desc: The Depth-Buffer and how it is used for detecting obscured surfaces in a 3D
    space for the Sierpenski Pyramid.
know-more:
- desc: Would love to know about graphics pipeline.
- desc: "is creating 2D and 3D structure of Sierpi\u0144ski Gasket using WebGL"
- desc: The triangle for Sierpinski Gasket with 2D slider made me understand more
    and more clearly. Is there something like 2D slider for the chaos algorithm? I
    found this one (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QK2SJo-AxT4) but it only provides
    a few iterations. What will happen to a very first POINT if we put it in the center
    of the equilateral triangle?
