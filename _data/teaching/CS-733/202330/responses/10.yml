difficult:
- desc: It was difficult for me to understand how can we make cube out of triangle
    fan. Apart from that it was okay.
important:
- desc: The most important thing that I learned toaday is creating a cube using a
    triangles. and also I learn about triangle fan and triangle trips.
- desc: is about the geometric transformation (cube from rectangle)
- desc: The most important thing I learned in today&#039;s class was all the animations
    we can do via rectangle and triangle. More specifically cube drawn using triagnle
    fans in Webgl.
- desc: Discussed the code furthermore as compared to the last lecture and discussed
    the assignment.
- desc: Making a cube out of triangles can be done by using single triangle strips.
    Each face of the cube can be broken down into two triangles.
- desc: I learned about the converting a cube using a triangle in webgl.
- desc: Was about geometries and how triangle strips are more efficient than triangle
    fans
know-more:
- desc: I did notice that when a cube is rotating Y, the lines between vertices seems
    incorrect. Since it is in 3D, I think that the lines (vertical) behind should
    be shorter than the lines (vertical) in front.
