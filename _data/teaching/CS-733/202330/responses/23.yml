important:
- desc: For me the most important thing  for me in today&#039;s class was the difference
    of vertex shaders for the instance cube HTML and the vertex shaders of previous
    programs. Actually we  are using matrix as an attribute in it and for that we
    need to use 4 indices instead of just one to make a connection between program
    and shades.
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about how I can use more indices to make a connection
    between program and shaders because today&#039;s example vertex shader was different
    from the other.
- desc: Robotic Arm&#039;s body has a lighting shininess. Is it possible to add shininess
    in arm as well. The reason is I noticed that tea pot 1 lid has that shininess.
