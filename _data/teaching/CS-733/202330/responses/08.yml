important:
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is how to work with animations
    and how to manipulate interaction to produce different colors to geometrical objects.
- desc: It was good to know how to know when user interacts with the application
- desc: Today I learnt about User interaction with system( original and modern approach),
    input rectangles code and learnt about rotation of triangles code.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned was original and modern approach to
    how user interact with the application plus how to rotate a triangle around it&#039;s
    center in three-day steps.
- desc: Today the code was improved was improved as compared to the last lecture.
    I got to know about users interaction with the help of callbacks.
- desc: the most important thing which I learned today was how to rotate the Sierpinski
    triangle , how to trace the axis point for that and then I also tried to do it
    in 3D which didn&#039;t work because it will have another formula.
- desc: The original approach of using loop inside of polling fir interaction.
- desc: all about vertexes, creating triangles and filling colours
know-more:
- desc: When trying to rotate the 2D Triangle it was so interesting for me and I was
    wondering how we can rotate the 3D sierpensli Triangle. I should be fascinating
    too.
- desc: Modern approach for interaction, I was about to fill &quot;listener&quot;
    in the blanket but the answer was &quot;callback&quot;, because I was doing mobile
    development and normally have been using events and listener. Furthermore, rotating
    the triangle based on different xis is quit interesting.
