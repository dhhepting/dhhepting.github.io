- desc: I learned pixels, they are defined as physical containers with RGB components.
    i also learned about the anti aliasing very easily.
- desc: I learned about the Pixels and Sampling and anti-aliasing more clearly, pixels
    are samples of a continuous phenomenon
- desc: How aliasing is is the effect that creates jagged lines in images and how
    it can be mitigated using the sampling at a frequency higher than the Nyquist
    Sampling Frequency
- desc: 'During today&#039;s meeting, I discovered that the binary guessing game was
