difficult:
- desc: In today&#039;s class, it was hard for me to understand continuous vs discrete.
    I did not get the significant difference between these two. It would be great
    if you could give more example on this. It was also hard for me to understand
    the perspective of continuous &amp; discrete in the field of computer graphics.
    Also if you could tell us before hand or after the class that which chapter from
    the book are your lecture from, so we could do some reading in order to relate
    to the lecture. Thank you.
- desc: I understand what professor wrote on the blackboard up to the explanation
    about mosaic. The rest was a bit difficult for me especially on the parts of svg(vector)
    and bitmapped.
important:
- desc: It was really nice to know the full form of JPEG and what pixels actually
    mean
- desc: is about the discrete bitmap image and how the jpeg image compression works
- desc: 'From the discussion, I grasped more clearly about the difference between
    bitmap and vector images: Bitmap images have fixed resolutions, making them susceptible
    to quality degradation upon zooming, whereas Vector, described mathematically,
    retain clarity regardless of scaling.'
know-more:
- desc: I learned that pixels aren&#039;t squares but abstract concepts in digital
    imaging, and the meaning and working of continuous vs. discrete representations.
    Apart from that I also amazed by the mega pixel by bits conversion which is very
    interesting to me.
