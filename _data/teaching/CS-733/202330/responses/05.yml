difficult:
- desc: As far as the topics for our every lecture is concerned ,I get that well.
    But some times at the end of the class I&#039;m still confused was the end goal
    of today&#039;s class or this whole courses.So it would be better to put that
    one bullet point to add that at the end of this lecture what will be able to know
    or learn
- desc: "Sierpi\u0144ski triangle: difference between the Recursive Method &amp; Chaos\
    \ Game Method of forming it."
important:
- desc: "Sierpinski Gakest (Triangle) was the interesting thing I learned today, though\
    \ the algorithm seemed a bit tricky but I\u2019ll try out the code. Also was wondering\
    \ the triangle is 2d what will happen if it\u2019s made 3d."
- desc: "is you can create Sierpi\u0144ski Gasket by repeatedly picking random points\
    \ in a triangle, finding their middle point, and marking it."
- desc: "I learned the steps involved in Sierpi\u0144ski Gasket: 1. Pick an initial\
    \ point at random inside the triangle [or better yet, one of the vertices (Why?)].\
    \ 2. Select one of the three vertices at random. 3. Find the point q halfway between\
    \ p and the selected vertex. 4. Display q by putting some sort of marker, such\
    \ as a small circle, at the corresponding location on the display. 5. Replace\
    \ p with q. 6. Return to step 2."
- desc: 'the most important thing I learned in today&#039;s class is Sierpinski triangle,
    as it was nee information for me I found it quite interesting what I learned in
    that topic is : how to structure it in a easy way  and that is Start with an equilateral
    triangle. Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles and remove
    the central triangle. Repeat step 2 with each of the remaining smaller triangles
    infinitely.'
know-more:
- desc: I came to know about synthetic camera,difference between raster and vector.
    Would love to deep dive more into these topics soon.
- desc: 'The Sierpinski Gasket, a captivating fractal, can be created using two methods:
    recursion and the chaos game.  A remarkable feature of the Sierpinski Gasket is
    its self-similarity, where zooming in on any part reveals a pattern resembling
    the whole, a property seen in both mathematical constructs and natural phenomena,
    making it a captivating concept in the world of fractals.'
- desc: "I would like to know more in detail about Sierpi\u0144ski Gasket"
- desc: Sierpinski Gasket is a new thing for me. I would like to know more and will
    try to look for example of how complex structures can emerge from simple recursive
    rules.
