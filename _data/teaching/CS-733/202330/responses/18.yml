important:
- desc: I liked how professor cleared out the midterm questions. Now I know how he
    wants the questions to be answered. Hopefully this will be helpful in final term
- desc: The most important thing in today&#039;s class  was discussing the whole midterm
    and it was really informative because I learned Abt my mistakes.
- desc: I thought Q8. from midterm &#039;texr&#039; was a typo. Sorry that I confuse.
