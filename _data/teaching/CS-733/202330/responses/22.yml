- desc: Whole modelling was difficult to understand as I was late in the class
important:
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in today&#039;s class was when we
    started chapter 9 which is all about modelling. In modelling we actually need
    to tell everything about the scene. We need to define material, geometry, lights
    ,cameras etc in order to render something that we want on the screen.
