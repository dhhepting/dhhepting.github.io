important:
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is frame buffer and in the today&#039;s
    code I understand the functions of fragments and vertex shaders.
- desc: The most important thing about today&#039;s lecture was the new chapters itself.
    It was really interesting for me to get to know what we can do more with the Frame
    buffers and not just simple they can also be used to do additional interesting
    effects. So basically it was really interesting and exciting to know that frame
    buffers can be used for interactions as well.
- desc: I found the class active today. The code was explained by shaders and fragments.
- desc: today i learned about the gl.texture and also learned about the framebuffer
    use in interaction.
