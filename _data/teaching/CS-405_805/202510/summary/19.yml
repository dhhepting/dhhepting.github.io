- desc: 'Okay, so this is

    meeting 19. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m supposed to make A point

    of taking attendance today,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because the department head has

    had some reports of absenteeism.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So please do The attendance

    done? Okay? I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I wanted to talk a little bit

    about the gasket from yesterday,'
  persid: ''
- desc: from last meeting, and I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I it''s about the bloat, as

    David called it. So what I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing is taking a sphere or a

    circle for and'
  persid: ''
- desc: it was centered here, oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moving the transforming it. I''m

    transforming this point halfway'
  persid: ''
- desc: here. Do that? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attendance. Yes, please, make

    sure you do the attendance. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I just imagine those are all

    symmetrical. So the idea is, in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the limit, if we apply a bunch

    of transformations, we get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: little sphere. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the vertices of the triangle

    and at all the places in between'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the sphere is so we don''t

    have to worry about the limit.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In the case of creating a

    desktop tetrahedron, we want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make something that looks nice

    so you don''t have to do Millions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of of spheres to get your

    Desktop ornament and'
  persid: ''
- desc: does that seem okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve added some to the

    description for The desktop'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tetrahedron assignment. So Start

    with The image and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve made a link to The

    Python code that I showed in'
  persid: ''
- desc: class. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this will produce a file that

    can be included in the PBR key'
  persid: ''
- desc: input file and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we just have the include

    directive at the top of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: screen there and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I recently discovered ew for

    my I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for water billing, and the

    leader is reporting. So now,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'after I got a big bill, I''ve

    been I''ve logged in and set up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'alerts and things, and now it''s

    telling me that I''m using water'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very substantially, and I''m

    trying to figure out what the'
  persid: ''
- desc: problem is. Your meters are
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not screwy. That may be part of

    it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you should take inspiration

    from the original Image done in'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1990 and feature a fractal

    tetrahedron at some level of'
  persid: ''
- desc: resolution.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in using non diffuse

    materials, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, maybe gold or silver or

    glass,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and put it onto a desktop

    surface. Include more than one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light source, one of which is an

    area light source. You may add'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other objects on the desktop

    surface to help demonstrate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadows and other effects,

    including indirect lighting and'
  persid: ''
- desc: So when you see
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that, Sometimes called color

    bleeding and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so here are Some examples
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the contribution of the of

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surfaces that aren''t emitters

    themselves, but there''s Some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'energy coming off them so that

    color bleeds between the'
  persid: ''
- desc: surfaces and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The final image should be high

    resolution. So this, if it''s if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s square, it should be least

    1024 by 1024 if it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'squared, the smaller dimension

    should be at least 1024 I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five so I want you to explore

    the input options to generate a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'high quality image. So consider

    the samples per pixel and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sampler that you choose Use the

    stats option with pbrt and do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some analysis of the results

    with Image tool diff, for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example. So which combination of

    input parameter, input'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directives, gives the Best

    image, and why so document the'
  persid: ''
- desc: pbrt file and
  persid: ''
- desc: does That make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i Sorry it took me a while to

    find this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this may be a good place to

    look as Well, for Inspiration, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: is that C, VO, K, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so have six marks for creating

    the scene, recreating the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Desktop scene with the

    tetrahedron ornament on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'desktop, three marks for

    documentation and description of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what you''ve Done, and three

    marks for writing it with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different combinations of

    samples for pixels And samplers'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and doing the analysis of which,

    if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we which set of input directives

    gives the Best image and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the Advanced pbrt

    assignment, or I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a little bit more

    detail, if It''s helpful or not.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So pick a feature in pbrt

    version four, see, for example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'changes from version three, when

    they came so when they came up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in our class discussion, or you

    may find inspiration in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exercises from the Book labeled

    with a two and explore its'
  persid: ''
- desc: impact. If
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe if you want to look at
  persid: ''
- desc: some aspects of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the impact of focal length,

    different parameters for dealing'
  persid: ''
- desc: with the realistic camera and
  persid: ''
- desc: exposure of the film
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could do Something with Animated

    transformations. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that seem okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thanks, I''m just going to check

    something. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s talk About our quiz

    from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: for today,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What''s the best choice for post

    days, no purple poor folks. Yes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And pre Egg is sinless.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So pre and post. So when we''re

    talking about reconstructing an'
  persid: ''
- desc: image,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There are these two sources of

    quality problems and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so What is no discrepancy.

    Sadly, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so with the example In the

    textbook,'
  persid: ''
- desc: something like This, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I know, I think, we''re often

    just thinking about the lower'
  persid: ''
- desc: corner. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So based on this, if we have

    four points and one of them is'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the box, we can estimate the
  persid: ''
- desc: size is one quarter.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But if this is point Three and

    point three and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense? Does it

    match with your Understanding'
  persid: ''
- desc: from the textbook Example? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So codi sampling is the idea

    that we''re trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take samples in a way that''s

    reflective of your underlying'
  persid: ''
- desc: structure.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So third question, what is the

    last step in imagery'
  persid: ''
- desc: construction, put
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the whole process in there for

    anyone that was paying'
  persid: ''
- desc: attention.
  persid: ''
- desc: I i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gave you our courses sometimes I

    was I double checked that I had'
  persid: ''
- desc: deleted that I
  persid: ''
- desc: so in this case, it's CS.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: so what's the first step
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Per PS, reconstruct, prefilter

    sample? Okay. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So does this make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the image isn''t can only be

    known by the samples that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: take of it and so
  persid: ''
- desc: when we are
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that goes for when we''re if

    we''re trying to estimate The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value of pi with a Monte Carlo

    approach and'
  persid: ''
- desc: similarly, here we have so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the pixels as the samples of the

    function, and we Need to make'
  persid: ''
- desc: that into
  persid: ''
- desc: Our image. So we're going to
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm still bummed out about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'putting the answer in the

    Question I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get over it. Does that make

    sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so not focusing On the caption

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what do you think about The

    quality of this filter applying'
  persid: ''
- desc: a box filter. It's not very
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good. So there are a lot of

    jagged inches here, not very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smooth. Okay, let''s look at

    Gaussian filter.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So This is blurrier. I think I
  persid: ''
- desc: still, really, jagged.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we look at this area here,

    and this area here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a little smoother, I guess.

    Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I think it's still not
  persid: ''
- desc: good, smoother, I Guess.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so let''s look at third

    example and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would you say this one''s better

    or worse?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Second one, I think it

    definitely works on the second'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one. Colors are a little bit

    clear. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: plus weakness in this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one. So let''s look at this area

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it seems to be a good mix of

    blurring and sharpness, So not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything is blurred. Let''s

    read'
  persid: ''
- desc: The Caption again.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can In looking at our

    samplers, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you We can look at these

    filtering methods as well. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a box filter with a

    step function and with a set'
  persid: ''
- desc: side you saw Ital curve and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it doesn''t do a very Good job

    with a sign you saw, It''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: curve. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is the Mitchell filter.

    You can see it dips into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'negative a little bit here, so

    that helps to sharpen the image'
  persid: ''
- desc: And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it does a Good job With Both

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s white noise, and This is

    Blue noise. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue noise seems to lead to

    better'
  persid: ''
- desc: images and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is two different

    sampling patterns. One is'
  persid: ''
- desc: jittered sample,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'jitter distribution, and the

    other one is Poisson desk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution. So what do you

    observe between the two of them?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Clustering? Yeah, there seems to

    be more clumping in A than B. B'
  persid: ''
- desc: seems to Be more evenly
  persid: ''
- desc: distributed. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So next we''ll look at reflection

    models.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can develop reflection

    models by measuring data.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So measure data, and then we can

    also look at phenomenological'
  persid: ''
- desc: model, phenomenon,
  persid: ''
- desc: biological models, we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equations that attempt to

    describe the qualitative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'properties of real world

    surfaces can be remarkably'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'effective at mimicking them, and

    then We can do simulation and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can use wave optics,

    so we have a detailed bottle of'
  persid: ''
- desc: light and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'geometric optics. We''ve talked

    about a bit. I so'
  persid: ''
- desc: we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t encounter diffraction with

    geometric optic models, so it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: A bit more straightforward and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s take a look at The

    first two sections of chapter'
  persid: ''
- desc: nine for Thursday. We
  persid: ''
- desc: any questions or concerns I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, thank you for Today, and

    we''ll see You on Thursday. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: Thanks, you, too. You
  persid: ''
- desc: do This work. I using fixation?
