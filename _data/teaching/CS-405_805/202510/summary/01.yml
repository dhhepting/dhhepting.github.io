Audio-Transcript:
- desc: I have a question, what
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class starts? Is there going to

    be a group project in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: class? I ask for my
  persid: ''
- desc: mental health.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You would like another one No.

    Or,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if there is one I just need to,

    like, mentally prepare, yeah?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or, like, buy enough Red Bull to

    like, I''ll have to do that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, well, we''ll talk about

    assignments. So it''s one'
  persid: ''
- desc: o'clock. Let's begin. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is everyone in the right

    place? Computer Science, 405805'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s our first meeting. We

    have 26 meetings over the'
  persid: ''
- desc: semester.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think everyone knows me

    what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll give you two choices.

    You can call me Daryl, or you'
  persid: ''
- desc: can call me Dr Hepting.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pardon me. Steve already told me

    off for calling Daryl.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So sometimes zoom transcript, I

    end up as Doctor, happening,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I remember fondly, CS 405, when

    I was an undergraduate Student'
  persid: ''
- desc: here a year or two ago.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I hope this will be a positive

    experience for you. We''re going,'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see, I would say,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to do some new

    Things. CS,'
  persid: ''
- desc: um, and we'll see how it goes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m so happy to have a

    whiteboard after the chalkboard'
  persid: ''
- desc: last semester.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So 405 and 805 we''re doing some

    advanced graphics, so I thought'
  persid: ''
- desc: we would take the question.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will use the Physically Based

    Rendering theory and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'implementation textbook, and

    that comes with software on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'GitHub. So I invite you to get

    that set up on your own'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'environment. We''ll get it set up

    in the labs as well. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the book has been awarded an

    Academy Award,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I once, I once was in the

    same room as the first Author,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two different ends of the

    spectrum, I guess I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS so I have things set up in

    your courses.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The projector is not on. If you

    want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to see it is actually on. I just

    have the picture turned off.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I''m gonna fill in some

    things here over the next couple'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'days. So announcements, those,

    that''s a read only thing that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will send you information. Then

    there''s course email you can use'
  persid: ''
- desc: that to get a hold of me
  persid: ''
- desc: so the syllabus, the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it is here. So here we are in

    our first meeting. So we have 26'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meetings, including April 10,

    and then our final exam is on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'April 17, which happens to be my

    birthday, that won''t be on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: exam.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I propose to have office

    hours Mondays and Wednesdays,'
  persid: ''
- desc: one to 230
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you, if that doesn''t work for

    you, again, for in touch with me'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we work something out. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I would encourage you to come

    and see me in office hours,'
  persid: ''
- desc: because I'm a nice guy. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me Hello, and also, because I

    don''t, if you''re having issues,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t want you to leave it at

    the end of the semester When'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s nothing that can be done

    about it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I used grade scope, any those

    of you have experience with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that, with me? Any thoughts

    about that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I think it's All right. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I have a few links

    here, Physically Based Rendering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from theory to implementation.

    So there''s a hard copy book'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'published in 2023 it''s all

    available online at PBR dash'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'book, so if you are happy

    navigating a Web page, you don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: have to buy the Book.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then there's pbrt.org is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'includes the resources and the

    links to the software. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the last link there, the GitHub

    link, is the repository for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version four of the software

    that you can put on to Your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computers. I have it on my

    MacBook Air and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for grading quizzes before

    meetings 10% so I''ll make a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question or two available. By

    6pm that''ll open at 6pm the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'night before class. So tomorrow

    night, at 6pm there''ll be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question or two, and you''ll have

    until the start of class to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer it, and then we''ll

    discuss it in class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participation 10% so I''m

    including the wiki in'
  persid: ''
- desc: participation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I feel like the wiki can be a

    valuable thing. I so I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'persisting with that. You may

    notice I''m not persisting with'
  persid: ''
- desc: responses. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so assignments, I''ve indicated

    30% i Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there are in the textbook,

    there are some exercises that'
  persid: ''
- desc: involve modifying the software.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I don''t want to take that off

    the table if somebody is keen on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing some programming to extend

    and modify the rent the software'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but my feeling is we''ll focus on

    using the software to create'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Images and get an understanding

    of advanced rendering techniques'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'involved in creating physically,

    involved in creating accurate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simulations of physically let''s

    try that again. Physically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accurate simulations of

    lighting.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we don''t so we end up with

    images that are hard to tell'
  persid: ''
- desc: from real.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I have a midterm exam 15% I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a Thursday after the

    break, So be in class And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: final exam. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and for you, those of you in 405

    there might be an opportunity'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for a research credit. So we

    have a participant pool in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer science. So if we have

    studies that involve we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'user tests. So if an opportunity

    exists, I will advertise it on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your courses and you can earn up

    to two marks, two bonus marks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for a research credit for

    participating in up to Two'
  persid: ''
- desc: studies. Is
  persid: ''
- desc: that clear? I
  persid: ''
- desc: i wrote assignments twice. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so can you hear me? Okay in the

    back? Do this seems like a much'
  persid: ''
- desc: cozier room than I remember I
  persid: ''
- desc: So hello,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll just talk a little About

    the wiki Again, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m recording our meetings in

    Otter, and then I will post a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcript that otter generates

    onto the website so you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take, yeah, audio transcript and

    correct it, clean it up. I will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take pictures of the board so we

    can include those'
  persid: ''
- desc: I I bless you. I'm Sorry.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm Slow there. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so, summarize, correct the

    audio, transcript, reference'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'images of the board. Ask

    questions include ideas for exam'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions include links for

    concepts discussed and other'
  persid: ''
- desc: stuff you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I would say, we have, well,

    we may have 15 students here, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''d Say sign up for two spots

    for the Winky.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I thought I made that into A

    Lake. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so that''s the software.

    Now I just have to Give it A'
  persid: ''
- desc: file. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's try Watercolor. I
  persid: ''
- desc: let's do A simpler One You
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is set up to render
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can see the progress of

    the rendering and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I did this at home. It was

    making good progress.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, We have a plus Sign. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: there we Go. Oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s done about a 10th of the

    time it needs to render the full'
  persid: ''
- desc: image and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what do you think about This

    first pass?'
  persid: ''
- desc: It looks realistic, very
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noisy. Yeah, the bottom looks

    noisy, but little hard to shut'
  persid: ''
- desc: the light on. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Minecraft, RTX, when it first

    came'
  persid: ''
- desc: out, when you
  persid: ''
- desc: reactor, probably I
  persid: ''
- desc: That's discoloration,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, I the stones here, they're
  persid: ''
- desc: very there's a lot of noise,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not looking for it. It could be

    mistaken. Is like discoloration,'
  persid: ''
- desc: like the light refraction,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and those rectangular gemstones

    on the base of the crown, like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ones that have surrounded

    like buckles, almost those don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look like any real gemstone

    ever, like they''re just every'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color mixed together like they

    look like a seed, like A seed,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at random. You know what? I

    mean? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Paul, satisfying voice,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is my new subway service.

    You think,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very small. Shall We look at

    Another one? Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone want to call out one

    head? Okay? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: less detail on it, so it's going
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quicker, so it''s going to take

    longer. I we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a recognizable image quite

    quickly. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s important here we''ll

    talk about a lot is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bi directional insert, different

    kind of interaction function, So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have bi directional reflect,

    reflectance function,'
  persid: ''
- desc: transmission function,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and there are others as well. So

    does this look like it could be'
  persid: ''
- desc: a person?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like It looks like a person from

    a game, as far as like, all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way real. It''s something''s off

    about it little uncanny around'
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe the islands.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, it is cool, but you can

    see the light behind this gear,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'though. Yeah, he looks dead.

    He''s either dead or I''m going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be dead, and that is up to

    something.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s the uncanny right there.

    But I feel like everything looks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realistic. You look at it

    individually, yeah, that''s true.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you look at it as a whole,

    though, it just feels slightly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'off, but that''s just, that''s

    just lightning, that''s just'
  persid: ''
- desc: uncanny.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Something around the Bucha is

    messed up like, if that makes'
  persid: ''
- desc: sense, it's obvious,
  persid: ''
- desc: getting more realistic,
  persid: ''
- desc: looking for this stretch
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marks growing it looks like he''s

    concentrating really hard to'
  persid: ''
- desc: blow up My head with
  persid: ''
- desc: his mind. Give him
  persid: ''
- desc: a minute.
  persid: ''
- desc: I not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to be killed by the

    eldership Divine Being from'
  persid: ''
- desc: beyond. Thank
  persid: ''
- desc: you. Thank you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Greg is all powerful. He lets us

    Live Our Way.'
  persid: ''
- desc: We kind of have a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'project. This is actually, this

    is chronologically in order,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'after Greg hope. This is Greg

    opens his eyes, that is seven'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seconds, he casts a fireball.

    That''s why he that''s why his'
  persid: ''
- desc: eyes were closed.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I send you the dust. That''s what

    You see in Your Mandal story'
  persid: ''
- desc: behind
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i So will These scenes render

    the same every time, or do they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'render different every time? So

    if you did another head, would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it look similar to the previous

    one? Or would it be very'
  persid: ''
- desc: different?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It would be very similar. So

    it''s a question of how many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'samples? So we can use different

    integrators and different'
  persid: ''
- desc: sampling regimes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but it''s about the the number of

    samples. So if we specify a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'higher degree of precision, then

    we get we''re converging to an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image in a very high quality

    image. The Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what if we had 100,000 image

    samples, and we were trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generate an image of an apple,

    but we had like, 50,000 images'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of apples and 50,000 images of

    bananas. And my question is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, how convergent and how

    divergent is the image be like?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Would it but look like if we try

    to kind of like, generate two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'polar opposite images, like, if

    you try to, like, merge samples'
  persid: ''
- desc: together,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think that''s not a computer

    graphics problem. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s an AI generative AI

    problem. Maybe that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, let''s see how long it''s

    going to take. Well, 4000'
  persid: ''
- desc: seconds. So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a video online of

    someone using this bathroom and'
  persid: ''
- desc: putting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I set myself up for that. So use

    using the model and then adding'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a geometric figure, kind of

    slicing through the figure in an'
  persid: ''
- desc: animation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But it''s this bathroom, and so

    the geometric figure was sitting'
  persid: ''
- desc: on top of the counter. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does this scene have any post

    processing in it, or is it just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rendering engine doing all

    of the lighting effects? Because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s almost like there''s blue.

    But at the same time, I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know if that''s just look it

    hasn''t finished yet. It does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look like it''s struggling with

    the ground, and certainly the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light of the wall, the like sort

    of bright, sort of dots that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'individualized, instead of sort

    of like merging together a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit, unless it''s just a

    dirty ground.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, someone''s splashing around

    there.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so there''s still a lot of

    noise. It''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: pretty big scene.
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's go to the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m looking for images, but I

    wanted to point this out, this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is from Moana, rendered using

    pbrt 2018 there are over 146'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'million unique triangles, And

    with instancing, there''s 10s of'
  persid: ''
- desc: billions of triangles. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought that was interesting.

    Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'profile picture just dropped.

    That''s Weird.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I know there were some of these

    sample images in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the bottom right you can go into

    to the Next page. So the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: section, I
  persid: ''
- desc: hope to assume
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I see, yeah, that one doesn''t

    have the weird color on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gemstones, and they stopped. One

    facing us, yeah. And the pearls'
  persid: ''
- desc: are all kind of nice,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah. And also the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weather had a little bit of

    specs all over ours, but not'
  persid: ''
- desc: this one.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So So an interesting bit of

    history here. It was originally'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendered with 1280, samples per

    pixel in 73 hours of computation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on a quad core CPU on a modern

    GPU, pprt renders seen the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sampling rate in 184 seconds.

    You'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's see how we're doing. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is that the only one that''s

    running, or all of those don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: run.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t believe the other ones

    are running. I think I can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'switch to windows here, though.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: whatever You
  persid: ''
- desc: that's look at
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m heard dodecahedron in A

    bathroom that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: This is the bathroom
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve think it is. It doesn''t

    have, oh, it doesn''t have a tub'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in it. It''s not quite the same.

    It also'
  persid: ''
- desc: has some extra lighting. Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s the same wallpaper in the

    background,'
  persid: ''
- desc: though, so yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the taps or same place, it''s

    very similar,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, if you live a mirror, the

    background is exactly the same,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like the wallpaper, yeah, the

    painting on the wall, it''s just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like they have a different point

    of view. Even the crown molding'
  persid: ''
- desc: is the same. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so something you think about for

    assignments, do we want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generate images or do we Want to

    do some,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some modifications to the code?

    Modifications?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so I I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t want to put pressure on

    anyone to make a decision. Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it seem like this will be An

    interesting,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interesting semesters worth of

    images? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Any questions or concerns I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I''ll put up the

    scheduler so somebody can take'
  persid: ''
- desc: on today's wiki page. I and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then I will post the quiz for

    tomorrow at six, and then we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'start into it. So have a look at

    chapter One at the pbrt.org'
  persid: ''
- desc: There's a
  persid: ''
- desc: so There's,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s the bathroom, and here''s

    The water in The tub. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s lots of things to

    look at. So I would say you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'include links there in the wiki

    that you''re putting together, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: you happen.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t have to say anymore. I

    think anyway, any other'
  persid: ''
- desc: questions or concerns, should
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we call it a day? Motion to

    adjourn. Okay, thanks again for'
  persid: ''

    we''ll see you on Thursday.'
