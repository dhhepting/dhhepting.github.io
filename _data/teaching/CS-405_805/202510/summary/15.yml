- desc: 'Okay, I think that''s

    working.'
  persid: ''
- desc: All right, so we're eating 15
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of 26 so it''s our first meeting

    in March. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I haven''t heard that expression

    for March in like a blank and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out like a blank. They''re

    different blanks. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if it starts out being mild,

    it''s going to be go out being'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not very nice. It''s not it''s

    going to end being not very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nice. And if it is not very nice

    to begin with, it''ll be nice by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the end of the month. I don''t

    know that this is still accurate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in this era of climate change,

    but that just came to mind,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe There are other ways to

    update that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'old saying and it anyway. So I

    just wanted to I noticed there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were some people who hadn''t

    submitted assignment one. So if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you want to get a mark with a

    late penalty submitted by the by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'midnight tonight, after that,

    you won''t get a you won''t be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able to get a mark for it. So

    the exams will be graded before'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our next Tuesday meeting. So

    you''ll get an email from grade'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scope.com because I''m going to

    scan I''m scanning the exams, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I have the PDFs, and you''ll

    get a copy of the scan PDF with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'type notes, so it may be a

    little more legible than my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'handwriting and a little bit

    more organized perhaps.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll be using that so you''ll

    get an email, and you''ll get it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'before next Tuesday, so you can,

    if you have questions, you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use grade scope to ask questions

    about the marks and so on. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s got a lot of nice features,

    I think. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: there's that, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s an opportunity to give

    me two kinds of feedback. I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: just point you down here. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so formative feedback at midterm

    for formative feedback for me,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s under exams. I''m not sure

    when I''ve set the cutoff time'
  persid: ''
- desc: for this. I let me check. Maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll make this to Six instead.

    So Thursday,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I Okay, and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the other one is feedback about

    the midterm exam. What'
  persid: ''
- desc: did I make this one for? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i mean that Friday can Make the

    other One Friday. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the formative feedback for

    me, that''s anonymous, but this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last one, so this one is

    anonymous, the formative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feedback at midterm, and then

    this one is not anonymous,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because it''s part of

    participation. Okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I came across when I was

    looking for exam question,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making up the exam questions

    last week, I came across some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'videos by Eric Haynes, who''s a

    an engineer at Nvidia, and who I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'met. I many, many years ago at

    the SIGGRAPH conference. And he'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was, I associate him with this

    sphere flake. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I see that he has he created

    a set of videos about ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing that I thought might be

    interesting to look at.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if I turn the lights down, we

    can watch some videos and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I see if I''ve done this

    properly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hi, my name is Eric Haynes, and

    I''m an engineer, and we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to do a series of audio entries
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do it. This is David Kirk,

    who''s a fellow, says There''s an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'old joke that goes ray tracing

    is the technology. I the'
  persid: ''
- desc: technology.
  persid: ''
- desc: You analogy of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the future, and it always will

    be well the future is now here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as of least 2018 that a single

    NVIDIA card, terrain card, can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now do real time ray tracing.

    Let''s start with the basics.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What''s a ray? Well, a ray is

    defined by just two things. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has an origin, some point in

    space, x, y, z and a direction.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And ray casting is the idea of

    taking that Ray and shooting it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out in that direction and

    finding what gets hit. And this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is not in a rendering algorithm.

    It''s just a basic tool in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'toolbox. You can use it however

    you want. You can be using it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for checking radiation or doing

    all kinds of other things. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use it for rendering. So ray

    casting is just shooting a ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out and seeing where it hits

    something. You can also use ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'casting between two points. So

    you may say, Well, I''ve got a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point A, point B, and I shoot a

    ray, and I want to see if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything''s in between. This

    could be used, for example, if I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to see if there''s a shadow.

    If you already have the points'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like a and b, there''s a light

    and a surface that you can shoot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that Ray, and if anything gets

    in the way, then you know that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point B is in shadow. Ray

    casting is a way that you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually make an image. So if

    you think of a screen like a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen door, and you think of

    each little square on that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen door that you''re looking

    through, think of that that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your pixel. So you want to know

    what''s at that pixel and what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ray hits. So the ray shoots

    through that pixel and goes up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the environment and hits a

    bunch of things, and whatever is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closest is what you''re going to

    see through that pixel. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can shoot rays towards the

    lake, for example, and see if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have hit or missed anything

    in between. And if you''ve hit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something, then the objects,

    your point of intersection is in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadow, otherwise it''s lit. And

    this is actually the first use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of ray tracing in a

    computational form, is for by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this person at Apple back in

    1968 he traced rays towards'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lights to get shadows. And his

    outfit device was a pen plotter,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a pen that draws on a big sheet

    of paper. So Ray tracing really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'takes off back in 1980 with the

    seminal paper by Turner with it,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it covers a lot of interesting

    basic things that we still do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nowadays, like anti aliasing and

    bounding, vying hierarchies,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which I''ll talk about in a

    minute. But basically he has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this intuition, or this idea of,

    how can I get reflections and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refractions and shadows, and how

    can I do this in kind of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'recursive way? That''s the big

    breakthrough. So let''s show how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that works. Here we''re shooting

    ray from the eye again, and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hits a piece of glass. So this

    glass is nice and shiny, so it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflective and it''s also

    refractive. So we might first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shoot a shadow ray, and the ray

    goes towards the light. OK,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good. That''s eliminated. But we

    also do this thing, which is to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spawn off two more rays, one in

    the reflection direction going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'down below, and one in a

    refraction direction going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through the glass. So we can

    follow both of these rays. I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ignore the one going off the

    screen, the reflection'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction, one, the refraction

    one. Then we shoot another'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadow ray and see again, the

    effect of the light. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again, we spawn more rays. We

    can shoot a reflection, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s an internal reflection

    Ray that''s going upwards. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again, we''ll kind of ignore how

    further it bounces and shoots up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more rays. So we''ll just follow

    the refraction one that''s going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'off to the right. So then when

    going off to the right, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that box. And again, we can

    shoot a shadow ray, and that one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually is blocked, so we know

    that the box is in shadow. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with that, we now take all those

    contributions, all those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intersection points, the two on

    the glass and the one on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'box, and we kind of add them all

    up, and we get a color at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eye. We get all color for the

    pixel. So that''s wooded style'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ray tracing. It''s really good

    for things like sharp shadows'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and reflections and refractions.

    The advantage of this kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering algorithm is that you

    can basically do it from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eye. You know that you are

    hitting a mirror surface, and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'goes to the light, and you

    basically get a very few number'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of rays that you need to cast,

    versus if you had sort of shut'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all the rays from the light, and

    had it bounced around, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'almost all those rays are not

    going to actually get to the so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the next breakthrough as far as

    Ray tracing goes is these Cook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stochastic, or sometimes called

    distribution ray tracing in 1984'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The idea here is that instead of

    shooting just a single'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection Ray, for example, you

    might have a glossy surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something with kind of a sheen,

    and you shoot a sort of a burst'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of a rays. Instead, you can also

    get cool effects like motion'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blur. And the idea here is just

    that instead of shooting one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection Ray, you''re shooting

    a bunch. Or instead of shooting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one shadow ray, you''re shooting

    a bunch to try to get a soft'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadow with stochastic ray

    tracing, you shoot a ray out. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hits the box, and then you shoot

    one ray at the area light. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our sun now is a little bit

    larger to give it some actual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'area, just like the real sun.

    And we picked some arbitrary'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point on that sun. This one made

    it all the way to the light. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s two more rays, one hit,

    one missed. So now we know at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this point that two thirds of

    our rays are hitting the area'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light, and so we can say, well,

    OK, the shadows somewhat soft,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two thirds illuminated, but we

    can shoot more and more and more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rays and get a better answer. So

    this is stochastic ray tracing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And the idea here is, like, I

    say, just shooting burst arrays,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s more expensive. You have to

    shoot more rays, and the more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rays you shoot, the better the

    answer you get. But that''s, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know, it''s often worth the cost.

    So in 1986 was sort of the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theoretical leap, which is

    kijiya style, diffuse, inter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection. And this is a paper,

    a classic paper, which we''ll go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to in a further lecture, in a

    later lecture, called the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering equation. And

    basically his idea is, well, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know what? If we say the sky is

    the limit, we''re just going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shoot rays out from the eye, and

    we''re going to have each ray hit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something, and we don''t

    necessarily know which way it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to reflect. It''s a mirror.

    We know, sure, or reflect on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mirror direction. But say it''s

    something like unglazed pottery'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or some other thing like cement

    or something, you then don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really know which way the lights

    coming from. Well, you know the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lights coming from all kinds of

    different directions. So what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you do is you shoot more rays in

    different directions, but with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'path tracing, you shoot just one

    ray in one direction and follow'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it along a path. So let''s, let''s

    show you what that looks like.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s path tracing where we

    shot one ray through, you know,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through our pixel, and it''s in

    one particular location in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixel. It hits this box, and we

    shoot a secondary ray in some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction, and it goes off to

    the sky. Say, we shoot another'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ray that one happens to hit a

    light. So that''s actually going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to be a fairly important

    contribution to sort of a lot of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direct illumination from the

    sun. And notice that we''ve also'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put the pixel sample in a

    slightly different location'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'within the pixel. This allows

    you to get sort of anti'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'aliasing, kind of for free,

    because by moving the samples'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'around within the pixel, you''re

    basically sampling the whole'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'box, the whole pixel box,

    instead of just the center of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the pixel. And so we go. We

    continue here. Here''s a path'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where we hit the ground, and

    then it hit the cylinder, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then it shot up down to the

    ground, somewhere else and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on. You keep shooting these

    rays, and you get more and more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'paths. And once you have all the

    paths, then all meaning you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tired of shooting rays, you

    basically then add up all those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contributions. You basically

    have figured out where the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lights coming from for a bunch

    of different directions, a bunch'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of different paths, and add them

    up and get a color. So in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'film industry, for example,

    you''ll often see scenes where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''ll use 1000 rays, 3000 rays

    per pixel, and so those take a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little while to compute. The

    point is, is that by doing this,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you will eventually get the

    right answer. You know, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of reversing the whole

    process of getting light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'percolating through the system

    and but doing it just from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eye, and you will eventually get

    the right answer. So that''s path'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing. And what makes ray

    tracing great is the fact that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it can be that simple. It''s just

    you''re shooting a ray and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bouncing it around along

    different paths. And here''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ray tracer, in fact, that''s on

    the back of a business card.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is from Paul Ekberg

    business card when he was at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pixar in the 80s. And it

    actually is a ray tracer. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will actually make a little ray

    traced scene with, I think it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shooting against a bunch of

    spheres. So it''s a very compact,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simple kind of algorithm. You

    have this simple tool, a ray and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using those rays in various

    great ways. So you can basically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get beautiful results like this,

    where you''re getting soft'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadows and lovely reflections.

    And that''s it for this lesson. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wanted to point at some further

    resources that you''ll see on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'web page links to places where

    you can find books, and there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also going to be a link for ray

    tracing gems, which is a book'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I helped co edit, so

    thanks, and I''ll catch you at'
  persid: ''
- desc: the next lecture.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hi. My name is Eric Haynes at

    Nvidia, and this lecture is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rasterization versus ray tracing

    to start with. I''d like to have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a quote, and this one is the

    brute force approach is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ridiculously expensive. This is

    from a very long paper, I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s 5060, odd pages long, a

    seminal paper about hidden'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface algorithms. And the

    interesting thing about this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quote is it''s from appendix B,

    and they talk about this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'algorithm, they go, Well, this

    algorithm is ridiculous. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to use up a quarter of a

    megabyte. Who has $60,000 for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that much memory, and it turns

    out to be the one that GPUs now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use all the time. It''s called

    the Z buffer. Sometimes it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just a matter of brute force

    winning out. And rasterization'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has been quite successful with

    this algorithm for, you know,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for decades now. And the

    difference between rasterization'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and ray tracing is pretty

    simple. In rasterization, what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re doing is we''re taking a

    grid and we''re kind of throwing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'objects at that grid of pixels,

    and for each object, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basically look at each pixel

    that that object covers, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'says, Well, is the object closer

    in this point or not? And if it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is closer, we save it. If not,

    then we discard in ray tracing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We flip that loop, we go for

    each pixel, and we go for each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object, then, does the object

    cover that pixel? So in other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'words, at a pixel, we shoot a

    ray, and we look at each object'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we find out which is the

    closest one, if any. So let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just zip through rasterization,

    just to make sure we''re all on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the same page. Here''s three

    triangles. That''s sort of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ultimate image that we want to

    form, but we''re only using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'centers of pixels, so we''re not

    going to get anything that high'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'res. So you start with an empty

    grid, you throw a red triangle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'against it, and you cover the

    pixels that are where the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle covers the center of

    the pixel. Now you take the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle away, and let''s get the

    next triangle in. Here''s a green'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle, and again, you cover

    the ones that it covers. And the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trick is, as the green triangle

    is in front of the red triangle,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we know that any pixels that

    it covers will also cover the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'red triangle. Finally, we have

    this blue triangle. It''s behind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the green and the red triangle.

    So when we cover its pixels, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'both say, oh, OK, is the pixel

    covered by this triangle? Yes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'oh. But we also store for each

    of those pixels a depth, and if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the depth says, Oh, I already

    have something there, and it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closer than discard. So the blue

    is further away, only the pixels'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are not covered by written

    green get covered by the blue.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'With ray tracing, as I say, we

    reverse the process. We start'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shooting rays. And as we go, we

    basically are hitting various'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'objects. So at this point, we

    hit a red and a blue triangle,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the red triangle is closer,

    so that''s the one that shades'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the pixel. And we keep through

    this process, and we hit green'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles and red and so on. And

    as we go, we now go through the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whole process and we get the

    same answer. We get the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image as the rasterizer. The

    thing that makes ray tracing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particularly useful as the

    scenes get larger and larger and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more complex is something called

    the bounding volume hierarchy.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So with the bounding volume

    hierarchy, what you''re doing is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have a circle that encloses

    your whole scene, and within'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that, then there are other

    circles, within circles, within'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'circles, and on down the tree

    until you get to actual objects.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And this has a great advantage

    for ray tracing, because you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shoot a ray against that

    structure, and it can be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'extremely efficient. So for

    example, if the ray doesn''t hit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the outer circle at all, then

    we''re done. We don''t have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look at any of the circles

    within circles, because we know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we haven''t hit the outer circle.

    But if we hit that outer circle,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what we do is we open it up and

    we look at the two children'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'circles, and we shoot the ray

    against those, and not down the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chain until either we hit

    something or we''re clearly not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to hit anything. We''re out

    of circles to shoot against. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this process tends to be

    order log n in computer science'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'terms. In other words, it''s

    faster than just throwing all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the objects against the ray. So

    instead of shooting you know, a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ray against a million objects.

    You may shoot a ray against only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a very few objects, because

    those are the only ones that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'close enough to the ray that

    there''s any chance that it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to hit. Here''s another

    view of that kind of algorithm,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and it''s more kind of what we

    actually really do in ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing, which is to use

    bounding boxes. So here we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a hierarchy of boxes, and as we

    go on down the chain, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basically are looking in those

    boxes, and then there''s sub'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'boxes and sub sub boxes. And

    eventually we find out, okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that one box has a bunch of

    triangles in it, and, oh, look,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ray hit that one triangle.

    So instead of shooting the ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'against 1000 triangles, we might

    shoot it against a handful of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'boxes and a few little few

    triangles. And that''s it. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s much more efficient.

    Interestingly enough, this used'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to be the reason that people

    thought, Well, Ray tracing is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to totally beat

    rasterization back in the 80s,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like they thought, OK, this is

    it. Look we have this order log'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'n rasterization. Well, look for

    rasterization. We have to throw'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'every triangle against the

    screen. So that''s going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'order n, and being the number of

    objects in the scene. However,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rasterization has a bunch of

    ways that it can do the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kinds of tricks and so on that

    allow you to get sort of order'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'log n behavior. So that''s not

    really a great argument. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this slide is rasterization and

    ray tracing, and compares the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two. And I''m not going to go

    through it, but you can look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, you can put pause and try to

    see what all the differences'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are. But the real point is here

    is that they''re kind of just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'complimentary. They''re two

    different ways of looking at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same rendering system. Is that

    you want to make a picture,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, what''s an efficient way to

    do it? Well, with Ray tracing,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you are shooting rays. With

    rasterization, you''re throwing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles on the screen. The key

    here is that it really isn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rasterization versus ray

    tracing. Rasterization is really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good at situations where there''s

    a point and like such as a high'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point or a light and you want to

    look out into the scene, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re happy to get a nice

    regular grid, or pixels or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whatever, and have these samples

    at a regular distance and so on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And Ray tracing is much more

    general, and that you can take'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from any point to any point and

    see what''s in between or what''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'along that ray. So they each

    have their strengths, and they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be used together doing so

    you get wonderful images like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this, where the eye rays are all

    rasterized. We''re basically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using rasterization to get our

    initial view of the world, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re using ray tracing to

    get all the lovely glossy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'effects and lighting effects.

    And that''s the end of this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lesson. So I do want to point

    you to resources on our website'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which give links to all kinds of

    great stuff about ray tracing,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'including free books that you

    can get. One of those free books'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is ray tracing gems, which is

    all about modern practice. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'downloadable for free. It''s a

    PDF. Hi, my name is Eric hings,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I''m an engineer at Nvidia,

    and we''re going to do a series'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of lectures about ray tracing.

    The first one is the basics of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ray tracing. Let''s get going the

    thing I like to do it in it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: knew that
  persid: ''
- desc: was too good to be true. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Eric, hi. My name is Eric Haynes

    with Nvidia, and this talk is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called ray tracing hardware. So

    I''d like to open these talks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a little quote, and this

    one I love, which is, pretty'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soon computers will be fast.

    That''s kind of always the case,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right? It''s like, oh, with just

    a little more power, I could do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this new, cool thing, but I

    think there''s like a constant,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is that Windows will

    always take five seconds to open'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a new window, no matter what Ray

    tracing is, one of those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'processes that''s what we call

    embarrassingly parallel. Since'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re calculating a color at

    each different pixel, each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different pixel is independent

    of the other pixels. So you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could throw a processor at each

    one. Turner witted famously came'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up with this idea of, well, what

    if we took a football field and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'filled it full of Cray

    computers, and we put light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bulbs on the top of each one,

    red, green and blue, and we just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had each computer compute a

    single pixel, and then we fly a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blimp over it, so we can see the

    image produced in 1987 is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first ray tracing machine that I

    ever saw. It''s the at&t pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'machine. It was kind of a

    surprise to me to hear about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this, like when I arrived at

    SIGGRAPH and oh, whoa, there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this machine that''s doing ray

    tracing. And it was doing these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scenes where I had just come up

    with this database for testing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ray tracers. Procedural database

    is what it''s called. And so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s one image sphere flake,

    which they were using to test'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and would take me hours to

    render one of these little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scenes. And for them, it was

    taking 30 seconds. And with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tuning a year later, it was

    taking them just 16 seconds to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'run on this machine. Now this

    machine, admittedly cost'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hundreds of 1000s of dollars,

    and is now sort of a footnote in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'history. It was very expensive

    for the time. Nonetheless, was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first one where I saw real

    life ray tracing, and better'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yet, I saw real time ray

    tracing. They had a tiny little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'postage stamp on the screen,

    little 64 by 64 pixel kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing, maybe 32 by 32 and they

    had a case where you could move'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the mouse and move this sphere

    on top of this desktop kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing, or on top of a plane, and

    it would reflect things in real'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time. And now we can run that

    on, you know, the crummiest cell'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'phone, but at the time, it was

    just magic. So Moore''s law is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ending. Sad to say, it''s not

    just a few people saying it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this. It''s one of those things

    that people said for years, oh,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Moore''s law is just about to

    end. However, the sign that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually kind of being true.

    It''s where, you know, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hearing it from Nvidia, we''re

    hearing it from Google, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re hearing it from other

    companies. That there''s just not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as much of an oomph every year

    from the previous year. So what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that means is we have to rethink

    how we designed hardware. Where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going in, Nvidia is

    considering more special purpose'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hardware. If you think about

    transistors, there''s basically a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bunch of transistors on the

    chip, and it''s your budget. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how many you can use for things.

    You can use it for memory. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can use them for general CPU

    kind of processors, or you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use it for something special

    purpose. So on GPUs, on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'traditional GPUs, we have

    special purpose hardware for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rasterization. With this new

    generation Turing, we now have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'special purpose hardware for

    both artificial intelligence,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'deep learning operations and for

    ray tracing, and so they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called RT cores for ray tracing,

    and that''s what we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about next. So RT cores, or

    ray tracing cores, perform two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basic functions. They accelerate

    Ray bounding, volume hierarchy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'traversal and Ray triangle

    intersection. So with traversal,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they are basically shooting the

    ray against a bunch of boxes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and they return the boxes that

    they hit with Ray triangle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They''re shooting against a bunch

    of triangles. And there''s sort'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of these two levels where you

    can basically have a mesh and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have that mesh be copied as many

    times as you want, because it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just has a hierarchy on is

    triangles, so you get this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instancing, so it could have

    lots of bunnies for very little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'extra cost. And we use string

    multi processors, which are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader cores for doing other

    kinds of instancing or custom'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intersection, like Ray Sphere or

    Ray subdivision surface, and for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'traditional shading. The other

    thing that''s been interesting is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to see how much memory has

    changed over the years. It used'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to be we''d have some small

    number of megabytes, you know,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe 100 megabytes, if we''re

    lucky, and it''s gone up to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point where we''re now having

    machines that have as many as'
  persid: ''
- desc: '512 gigabytes. And film

    production uses, for example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scenes that are maybe 50

    gigabytes or more, for very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'complicated scenes. So we''re

    within the realm of actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'being able to hold entire scenes

    from a film inside GPU memory.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so this lets us do things

    like Ray tracing, where we kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of have to have all the data

    around at the at the same time,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or at least most of the data,

    and be able to swap data in as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'needed. So the idea here is just

    that we can now store things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like a whole ray tracing

    database and do something with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. Back in the old days, we

    could only store, not very much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at all, a few textures, a few

    triangle meshes, maybe, if we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lucky. So for example, to just

    show the speed up that you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get, this is from Metro Exodus

    and just an analysis of one of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their frames. So in the Pascal

    architecture the previous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generation, it took someone so

    much time in Turing if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t use ray tracing, the ray

    tracing cores, but did use some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the improved functionality in

    Turing otherwise, like integer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'math, you could trace rays

    against boxes and so on in an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'efficient manner, and it would

    save you some time. Then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'finally, though, if you turn on

    these ray tracing cores, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'takes that center chunk and just

    squishes it right down to a very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'small footprint as far as how

    much time it''s actually taking.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And the other good news is that

    you can do a lot of tuning. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one thing to make the hardware,

    but as we saw with the 18 T'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixel machine, where they

    started at 30 seconds per frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and went down to 16 after a year

    of tuning. Well, the same thing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can happens with games or any

    other applications, where as you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learn the hardware and you learn

    what the problems are, you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get faster and faster. So over

    just a few months time, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able to have a considerable

    increase in the speed for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Battlefield five. For example,

    Nvidia developed a demo with ILM'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and Unreal engine called Star

    Wars reflections in March 2018'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we were able to present this

    along with Microsoft''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'announcement of DirectX for ray

    tracing, we used four volta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'water cool GPUs to run this in

    real time. What was great was,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just a few months later, when

    Turing came out, we could run'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this all on just one GPU. Back

    in 1987 I was astounded to see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the 18 T pixel machine doing my

    512 by 512 image of 8000 spheres'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'running in just 30 seconds of

    frame. Now in a Turing class, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can run the same demo at 5

    million spheres and gets 60'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frames per second. No problems.

    To see the full Star Wars'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflections demo, or to find

    other resources about ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing. Come to our website.

    You can also get the full ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing gems book for free as a

    download.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let me try this again.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hi. My name is Eric hings, and

    I''m an engineer at Nvidia, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to do a series of

    lectures about ray tracing. The'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing I like to do in any of

    these lectures is give a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quote at the beginning. And this

    is David Kirk, who''s a fellow Ed'
  persid: ''
- desc: you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hi. My name is Eric Haynes with

    Nvidia, and this talk is about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ray tracing pipeline. I''d

    like to start with a quote, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this one''s from Matt far around

    year, 2008 GPUs are the only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'type of parallel processor that

    has ever seen widespread'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'success, because developers

    generally don''t know they are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parallel. Rasterization and ray

    tracing both make use of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parallelism. Rasterization is

    straightforward in that you send'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a triangle to the screen, you do

    vertex shading, you do pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shading, and then whatever the

    result is, you do a raster'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operation to blend it into the

    screen. With ray tracing, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a similar kind of flow. You

    start with a ray, you traverse'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the environment, and then you

    shade it. However, at this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point, we actually have the

    ability to recurse, to go back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the beginning and shoot more

    rays, to spawn off more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possibilities, such as shadow

    rays or reflection rays. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bottom part in the green box is

    what we actually do with RTX'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'acceleration is we can do that

    traversal and intersection piece'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very rapidly. In DirectX for ray

    tracing, and in Vulkan for ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing, there are five new

    kinds of shaders that are added.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There''s a ray generation shader.

    And what that does is it''s kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the manager. It basically

    starts the rate going and keeps'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'track of it and gets its final

    result. There are intersection'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shaders. So if you wanted to

    intersect a sphere, you''d have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an intersection shader for that,

    or a subdivision surface, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whatever you want. There''s a

    different kind of shader for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each one. Then there''s these

    last three shaders which are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of a group. There''s a miss

    shader which says, Well, I shot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a ray and it didn''t hit

    anything. What do I get? There''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a closest hit shader, which is,

    well, I hit something. What'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shall I do with it? Kind of a

    traditional shader, but you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also spawn off rays at that

    point, such as reflection or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadow. And there''s also any hit

    shaders, which I''ll talk a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit more about in a

    second. So just to sum up again,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have the ray generation

    shader, which controls all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shaders. There''s the

    intersection shader, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'essentially defines the object

    shape. And there are these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'control per Ray behavior shaders

    Miss closest hit and any hit. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how do these fit together? Well,

    there''s the complicated, many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'boxes, kind of version here.

    Here''s the simple version of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that same flow chart. What we do

    is we have a trace ray which is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called to generate the ray, and

    then it goes into this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'acceleration structure loop

    where we walk through the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bounding volume hierarchy and

    find out objects that could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'potentially be hit by the ray.

    The intersection shader is then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applied to that object, and if

    we hit and it''s the closest hit,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we keep track of that

    information. We also then use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the any hit shader if available

    for testing, if the object is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transparent and the ray should

    actually just continue on. Once'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we get through this traversal

    loop, we eventually get to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'end where there''s nothing else

    in the acceleration structure to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hit. It''s gone through the whole

    bounding volume parking, and now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we take our closest hit and say,

    Okay, what''s that shader S, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we missed everything, then we

    use our Miss shader and that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what color we get back for the

    pixel. The any head shader I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wanted to talk about a little

    bit more. It''s an optional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader. It''s one that basically

    is used for transparency. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mention, you have this leaf on

    the right, which you''re doing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tree of leaves, and so you''re

    not really caring about each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'individual leaf. So you really

    just take a rectangle and you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put a texture of a leaf on it.

    Now, much of that texture is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'empty, it''s blank, it''s

    transparent. So what the any hit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader does is it goes and

    checks the texture. So let''s say'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I hit with my ray in the upper

    left hand corner of that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rectangle, the any hit shader

    would say, Oh well, that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transparent. So don''t really

    count this as a hit, and let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just keep going so real time ray

    tracing can clearly be used for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'games. Here are three shipping

    titles that are showing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflections, global illumination

    and shadows. What''s also cool'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about real time ray tracing, or

    interactive ray tracing,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accelerated ray tracing, is that

    you can use it for all kinds of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other things. For example, you

    can do faster baking. Baking is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where you shoot lots and lots of

    rays. It''s an offline process'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that takes a bit and you

    basically bake the results into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a bunch of texture maps. I was

    reading about how one studio'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'went from 14 minutes of bake

    time to 16 seconds of bake time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'once they switched over to GPU

    ray tracing, even if you don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to use ray tracing,

    particularly in your title, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can use it for a ground truth

    test. Shaders that are part of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Direct X can be used on any

    machine. You can basically put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your shaders into a ray tracer

    and get the correct answer. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you''re trying to do some

    approximation, you can always'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get the ground truth and know

    what you''re aiming for, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back off and try to figure out

    what your faster method might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be. The other cool thing you can

    do with Ray tracing hardware is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that you can abuse it. In other

    words, we''re now looking into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'researching ideas of what else

    can we do with this. Could we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collision detection, or could we

    do volume rendering, or could we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do other kinds of queries? And

    work is just starting on this,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I think it''s a really

    interesting open field where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s all kinds of possible

    ways we can use and abuse the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'new hardware. And that''s it for

    this talk, for more information'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about ray tracing and plenty of

    other good free resources such'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as free books. Go to this

    website. You can also get a free'
  persid: ''
- desc: book that's very modern. What
  persid: ''
- desc: do you think so far? I
  persid: ''
- desc: really like the spheres. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hi, my name is Eric Haynes. I''m

    with Nvidia, and this talk is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about ray tracing effects. It''s

    got all the eye candy you would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ever want. I like to start with

    a quote, and I promise I won''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try to sing it. This is from

    Queen and it''s from Bohemian'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Rhapsody. Is this the real life?

    Is this just fantasy? And I like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to say that because which one is

    real of these two images, one is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a photo and one is the

    simulation. Turns out the one on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the one on the left is the photo

    and the one on the right is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simulation. This is the famous

    Cornell Box. The Cornell Box was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually made in 1984 I believe

    it was actually at the lab at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the time. In fact, they''re not

    part of that group. And it was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pretty funny because Don

    Greenberg comes in and he goes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, guys, we''re going to make

    a box. And they''re like, Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sure, I can do that with a

    little computer graphic. He''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, no, no, we''re going to get

    some plywood. And you''re gonna'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get some paint. And they were

    all like, what are we doing? But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eventually, you know, they got

    with the program, and the rest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is history. So with the Cornell

    Box, what you can do is start'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a really simplified system

    and look at the various effects.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re gonna start with just

    hard shadows here. And so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instead of an area light source.

    Overhead, we have just a point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light source, a single point

    where the light''s emitting. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can see that what you get is

    these very sharp shadows. And a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sharp shadow is just going from

    some intersection point, some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point what we''re looking at to

    the light. And some of those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will be blocked, and those are

    in shadows, and some are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'illuminated. If you want soft

    shadows, you have to go with an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'area light where you''re sampling

    on various points on the light.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is that more stochastic

    ray tracing, kind of a feel,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where you''re shooting a bunch of

    rays, and you''re figuring out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what percentage of the light you

    see if you''re fully in light,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'great, if you''re partially in

    light, that''s called the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'penumbra, and that''s where the

    soft shadow is. Or if every ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is blocked, then you''re in the

    Umbra full shadow area. The next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'step is to start bouncing that

    light around, to let the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'percolate through the

    environment. So instead of just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking directly at the light,

    we''re going to have light that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bounces around. This is called

    by a lot of different names.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There''s inter reflection,

    because the light''s reflecting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'off of a bunch of surfaces, or

    indirect lighting or color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bleeding, which is sort of

    specifically where color comes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'off of one wall and illuminates

    something else. And they all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have this group term called

    Global Illumination. So in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'case, we can see a ray is going

    from the floor where there''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'green spot, and hits the wall

    and it goes to the light. There'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are, in fact, tons of paths.

    This is one of many, many paths,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if it could hit the wall and go

    towards the light, and all of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them contribute a green color to

    that floor area. In that last'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scene, everything was diffuse,

    matte. Didn''t really have any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of reflection to it. You

    can also go with glossy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflections, where, again,

    you''re doing that stochastic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of process, where you''re

    shooting a ray in a burst, like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re shooting a burst of rays

    from your reflective surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and that gives you this fuzzy,

    softer reflection in it. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those are a bunch of different

    kinds of effects. And here''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'another example of glossy

    reflection. It''s very shiny on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the left and goes to more and

    more rough as we go to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right. So here''s your quiz

    question. This image has a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'number of effects in it. Which

    effects that we''ve talked about.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you see in this image? The

    three that I see are there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'glossy reflections on the

    ceiling and on the floor and on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the wall to the right, there''s

    inter reflection throughout, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s soft shadows. And I

    especially want to note the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inter reflection throughout. The

    point of this is that if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were to just have this seam lit

    by just the sun, you would only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a few small portions of the

    interior that would actually get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any light at all. The rest of

    the interior would just be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'entirely dark. So by having this

    light bouncing around the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interior, we get a realistic

    look to things. There are other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operations you can do with Ray

    tracing where it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particularly physically based,

    but it''s physically plausible.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is called ambient

    occlusion, where there''s no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particular light source in this

    scene. But what we''re doing is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re shooting out little bursts

    of rays from every location in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the scene, and trying to see if

    things are in crevices or could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be occluded by other objects. So

    let''s look at that scooter in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particular with ambient

    occlusion. What you do is you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take a point and you shoot out a

    burst of rays, and you shoot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them a certain distance. You may

    shoot them, say three feet or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whatever scale makes sense for

    your scene. If a bunch of rays'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hit something like underneath

    the scooter or the tire or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whatever, then we can say that,

    well, this area is kind of dark'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like odds are that if a light

    were to be shown upon the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scooter, that area would be in

    shadow. On the other hand, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re out in the open, you have

    a burst of rays, and almost all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rays get to that maximum

    distance, like three feet, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whatever it is, and maybe a rare

    to hit something. But overall,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re kind of in the light, and

    you can see it all, so that area'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gets no shadow at all. So notice

    that it''s a term that''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'physical in that if you actually

    shown the light underneath the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scooter, it would still look

    dark using ambient occlusion,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but it''s a really good

    approximation of how crevices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'darken up and so on. And so it''s

    commonly used in games, and it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'been used in rasterization for a

    long time, but with Ray tracing,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can get a better answer.

    Basically. Another cool thing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can do with Ray tracing is

    depth of field, you can get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'background blur, as in this

    shot, or you can get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'foreground blur, or you can get

    Foreground and Background blurs.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'For that matter, the idea is

    that by using depth of field,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a very cinematic effect,

    and you can lead the user''s eye'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to whatever point you want to

    focus on, so the character on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the right in this case, the

    other thing you can do is motion'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blur, instead of varying where

    the rays go, what you''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is varying where the model is in

    time, and you just kind of add'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up the rays at various points

    during the frame, and you get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this blurry effect. And again,

    this is a cinematic effect, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s actually quite important to

    have in games or films, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what you want to do is you want

    to sort of not have this kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stroboscopic effect, where, if

    you just had a single flat frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with very sharp edges and so on,

    it animates as if someone is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'flashing a strobe light on the

    scene. This can actually be used'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in various films, like gladiator

    for effect, but generally it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not the effect you want. And

    when the film is actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'running, you don''t tend to see

    this motion blur so much. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just looks natural. You can also

    do atmospheric effects. So if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have, say, a beam of light,

    you can do a thing called Ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marching, where the ray hits the

    beam and marches through it, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it looks at light scattering in

    and light scattering out, and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on. And you just kind of walk

    through that thing and sample it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as you go. And you can get these

    nice beams of light, God Ray,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kinds of effects. So I''m going

    to just show this short clip'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from Minecraft RTX, a demo we''re

    making in conjunction with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Microsoft of bringing ray

    tracing to Minecraft. And I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just leave it as sort of a quiz

    question for you as to figure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out which effects are happening

    in this little demo you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one last effect I want to talk

    about is caustics, which sounds'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dangerous. It sounds like acid

    or something, and they are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dangerous, and not because of

    the octopus in the picture here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what caustics are is the

    reflection of light off the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface of water, or refraction

    of the light through water or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through glass or through other

    transparent media. So here we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have light reflecting off the

    water, and you can see it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'underneath and above. In this

    next picture, you can see beams'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of light, and you can see the

    caustics on the ground under'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'water. And this is a little clip

    from the Justice demo, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shows how these caustics are

    underneath the bridge and how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they really sort of bring that

    area to life, gives it a real'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vibrancy. Now, as far as the

    danger of caustics, it''s a real'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'life danger. So this is a

    picture of my office, and on my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'window sill. Like a lot of

    computer graphics, people have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little chaskas of different cool

    materials and things I can stare'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at. One of them was this little

    crystal ball on a wooden'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platform. And if you zoom in on

    that crystal ball, you''ll see,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'oh, gee, there''s there''s funny

    little marks on the wooden'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platform. And I hadn''t realized

    this for quite a while. I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'once in one office, then I moved

    to another office, and you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see the effect. There are these

    burn marks in two different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'areas, and it just depended on

    which way the ball was facing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And luckily, I did not burn down

    our office. That would not have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'been so good. But anyway, this

    is actually a real problem, like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people will if you Google it,

    you''ll find someone has their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'house can light on fire due to

    snow globes. So beware of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'caustics. So I like to keep my

    caustics virtual. Like to keep'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them in the computer graphics

    world. And so these are just two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shots from the physical based

    renderer by Matt fire and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'others. And it gives these

    gorgeous effects of light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refracting through these various

    glass and so on surfaces, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s it. For further

    resources, see the link for all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kinds of free books and whatnot.

    And one free book in particular,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''d like to point out is ray

    tracing. J'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hi. My name is Eric Haynes with

    Nvidia, and this talk is about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rendering equation. I''d like

    to start with a quote from Roman'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pain the Muse is not an artistic

    mystery, but a mathematical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation. And this is really

    good for the rendering equation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rendering equation, it''s not

    a rendering equation, it''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering equation. It really

    sums up how light gets to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eye. And I can already see your

    eyes drooping, in fact, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ve just seen an equation put

    on a slide. Oh my gosh. What are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we doing? This is, if you''re

    going to have one equation in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your life, make it this one. If

    you''re in two computer graphics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it has a few terms in it. It all

    looks a bit like much, but we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'break it down in this lesson,

    and you''ll find it''s really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'worthwhile. It gives you this

    tool where you can think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how light works, what effects

    you want to do, what effects you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to leave behind. So to

    start with, there''s a bunch of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inputs for the rendering

    equation, which is there''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point x, which is some point in

    the scene, and that''s the point.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s say that you''re looking at

    and there''s an outgoing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction, which is this omega

    hat, that W looking thing, omega'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hat out o, sub o, and that''s an

    outgoing direction. So it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basically a direction, say,

    towards the I. There''s also an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incoming direction, which if you

    look at the far right of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation, you see an omega hat

    I, and that''s just some light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming in from some other

    direction. There''s this surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normal, if you have a flat

    surface, say the floor, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normal is the direction pointing

    straight up, for example. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then finally, there''s this S

    squared term, which means it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all incoming directions. So

    we''re going to be evaluating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this piece on the right for all

    incoming directions. Light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming from a bunch of different

    directions. How do they affect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what we finally see from our

    eye? The terms in this equation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first two, are really easy.

    The outgoing light on the far'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'left, that''s basically saying

    given a point and giving an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'outgoing direction. What light

    do I see? In other words, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking in a direction at some

    point. Well, what light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming from that point? To start

    with, there''s the emitted light,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is a function that looks

    just about the same. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basically says, given a point

    and given an outgoing direction,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what light is coming from that

    point? So if you have a light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source, a lot of light is coming

    out from there, and that just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shines right into your eye. And

    if everything in the world was a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light source, then we''d be good.

    We wouldn''t have to think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any of the equation to the right

    where the right equation comes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in. It has an incoming light, a

    material, and this Lambert'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'geometric term. So the incoming

    light is basically saying, OK,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'given a point and given some

    direction, what do I see in that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction? What light is coming

    from that direction? The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material equation is just simply

    a function that says, OK, given'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an incoming and an outgoing

    direction, what light goes in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the outgoing direction? So in

    other words, like a mirror, for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example, will be very reflective

    in one direction. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incoming and the outgoing

    directions are closely related,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but other surfaces, many

    different incoming directions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will give a different term,

    different amount of light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bouncing off the surface. And

    then finally, there''s this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Lambert term, which is this

    incoming direction times the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normal and that''s a geometric

    term, and I''ll show what that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'means. What happens with the

    Lambert cosine law. It''s an old'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'idea, and it''s just simply

    something that''s kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intuitively true, that if a

    light''s directly overhead, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to have the most effect on

    the surface. But as you tilt the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light, the effect of that light

    is going to be less and less as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it gets to the horizon. So on

    the far right of this you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see how the light kind of

    spreads out as we get to this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shallower angle. And that''s all

    that term is. And this is just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'another visualization of that

    term, where it''s showing how it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decreases over angle. So what

    pure path tracing does is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basically says, all I''m going to

    do is I''m going to sum up the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light in all directions, and

    that''s what''s going to go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'towards the eye. So in path

    tracing, what we do is we kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of shoot a ray and then we shoot

    another ray off that surface in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some other direction. So with

    path tracing, what we did is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shoot a ray from the eye and

    hits this box, and then from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there, it scatters out rays in

    various directions. So each path'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a different direction. One

    may go up and hit the sky,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'another one may go and hit the

    ground, and that bounces'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'somewhere else, and so on and so

    forth. And we add up all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contributions of those paths to

    get the color at the EI. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trick with this is that we don''t

    really know in a given direction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what the light is. Sometimes we

    do if we look directly at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sun, well, we know what that is,

    but often we''ll hit something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'else. And so the rendering

    equation is actually a recursive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation. It''s one where it

    says, well, what''s the incoming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light direction and intensity?

    Rather from a direction? Well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we don''t know. So what we have

    to do is use the rendering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation again on the place that

    we just hit. So if I hit the box'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then I hit the cylinder,

    we''d apply the rendering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation at the cylinder and so

    on and so forth until we finally'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get an answer. The trick with

    that is that if you did a pure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'path trace, it''s a very slow

    process to converge if you don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a big light source, like,

    so if you didn''t have, for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example, the sky, so that you

    know when a ray hits the sky,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re done. You could be in

    trouble, like if you just have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'small light source in the scene.

    Pure path tracing says, Well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m going to bounce my rays

    around until I hit a light. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s a problem, because if the

    light''s small, that could be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very, very long number of

    bounces. There''s things. What we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do about this one is called

    important sampling, and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basically says there''s got to be

    good directions for me to go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shoot my rays in. Let''s see what

    they are. One approach with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important sampling is to just

    look at the effect of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material. So we take that

    Lambert term, and we take the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material function, where it has

    an incoming and an outgoing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction, which, if you want to

    impress people at cocktail'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parties, is the bi directional

    scattering distribution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function, the BSDF. And all that

    is, is a fancy way of saying,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, when light comes in from

    this direction, what effect does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it have on the material? For

    example, if the material is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'black, well, there''s not going

    to be any outgoing light, but in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'general, there''s some outgoing

    term that will respond to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different directions. With a

    mirror, for example, it''s clear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the outgoing direction is

    going to basically be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection direction from the

    incoming direction, and that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the only direction that really

    matters to us. So if we''re path'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing and we hit a perfect

    mirror, we can just always shoot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our ray out in that direction

    and feel good about life,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we know that light from

    different directions, that it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not going to really matter too

    much for a glossy surface where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s got like a sheen, then you

    might shoot out a burst of rays.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for each path, you might

    choose a different Ray and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decide to go one way or the

    other and so on. And then adding'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up all those paths should give

    you a pretty good result.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Finally, you have something like

    a diffuse or a matte surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like unglazed pottery or cement

    or things like that, where light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be coming in from all

    different directions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contribute to the outgoing

    direction. And there you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing more of like a Lambert''s

    law, kind of a distribution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going in all different

    directions however you want.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Again, that can be expensive. So

    there''s yet another way that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go to try to reduce the load.

    It''s called multiple important'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sampling. And here we say, well,

    OK, we will vary by the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material, but we also want to

    vary using the light direction.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we know that there''s an

    important light source in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'room, or if they know that

    there''s the suns out there, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something like that, we''ll also

    add that in as an important'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'place to shoot rays, basically.

    So instead of just shooting them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of randomly, we''ll say, Oh,

    I also shoot some rays towards'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that light, because I know that

    light''s going to be a really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important direct lighting

    effect. But it''s also worthwhile'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to shoot these other rays

    because we want to catch some of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the indirect lighting. So in a

    mirror reflection or a glossy or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diffuse, it''s all sort of the

    same idea. We''re going to try to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shoot a bunch at the light, and

    we might weight them by how much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''ll matter, that the diffuse

    one, it''s going to matter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perhaps more. The reflection

    one, perhaps less, because we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really mostly care about what''s

    in the reflection direction. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will not go through this

    image, but it''s really worth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking at. This image of

    multiple important sampling.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s from a classic paper 1995

    and you can try to think this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one through. Consider this, your

    quiz is, shininess is varying.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'At the top, there are a bunch of

    light sources, and the radius of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those light sources is

    increasing in each one of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three figures. And in one, we''re

    just sampling the light source,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and another, we''re sampling this

    BRDF, which is the bi'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directional reflectance

    distribution function, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s like the scattering

    function, but it''s meant for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surfaces, and it''s for things

    that are opaque, not like glass.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then you have this mis

    multiple important sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where you''re doing both, and you

    can see that both is better,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basically. And this is a good

    one to try to think through. Why'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do some of these images look

    fuzzy? Once you understand that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then you''ve got a level of

    enlightenment on the rendering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation. So as an example of

    path tracing, Nvidia picked up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some open source code from some

    researchers who were looking at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quick two an old game, but they

    decided, well, now that we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ray tracing acceleration, let''s

    do a path trace version of it,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like really crank up the good

    lighting and materials and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on. And it makes a dramatic

    difference. It''s the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assets, but just improving the

    lighting alone can really make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the game shine, literally. And

    now you''ve got the rendering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation of your build. It''s

    really, honestly a wonderful'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tool for thinking about lighting

    and how it percolates through a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scene and what you care about

    for further resources. See the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'website, and I also want to

    mention that there''s this book'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called ray tracing gems that''s

    downloadable for free. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hi, I''m Eric Hayne for Nvidia,

    and this talk is about de'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noising for ray tracing. I have

    a quote today from Daphne'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Culler, a Sanford professor of

    works on AI for biomedical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applications. She says, The

    world is noisy and messy. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to deal with the noise and

    uncertainty. This is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particularly good for ray

    tracing, because ray tracing can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be extremely noisy. On the left,

    you''ll see an image that has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five samples per pixel using

    path tracing, and you can see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s quite noisy. There''s a lot

    of black pixels that where light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just didn''t get anywhere near

    where we needed it to. After 50'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'samples, it''s starting to look

    better. 500 better yet, 5000 is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking pretty darn good. And if

    you looked at really closely,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''d still see some noise in

    there. And in fact, films'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'themselves have this trouble

    where they''ll shoot 3000 rays'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'per pixel, but they''ll still see

    some noise. So what they''ll use,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and what we''re going to use

    today, is a process called de'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noising to make those images

    better. And you can see there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a diminishing return here. It''s

    pretty much the variance goes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'down with the square root of the

    number of samples. So if you go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from, say, four samples, that''s

    twice as good as just one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample, nine samples, that''s

    three times as good as one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample. But it''s diminishing

    returns. So we just can''t afford'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to shoot 5000 rays per pixel

    right now, so we have to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something else. And as they say,

    That''s de noising. Our reality'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is that we start with a noisy

    image if we''re doing any kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more elaborate effects, and we

    have to try to get to a nicer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image. We''d love to get this

    kind of image, but we often will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a crude, noisy image, and

    then we have to reconstruct. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reconstruction is called de

    noising, and there are various'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ways to do it. Here''s another

    example, where the left is noisy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the right is de noised. This

    de noising process can be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'extremely fast. It says

    identical time, but it''s almost'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'identical time. It''s the blink

    of an eye. And what de noising'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does is basically look at that

    area at the various surfaces,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and tries to use data, both in

    color channel and any other kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of information they might want

    to use, like the normal or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color of the texture that''s

    underlying the surface. And use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that to come up with some kind

    of filtering process where it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tries to fill in, tries to infer

    what''s going on in the surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you could denoise by effect,

    for example. So in this image,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have a nice, soft shadow

    given by that plant onto a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'floor. But it might be difficult

    to actually de noise this if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try to do it on the final image,

    because the floor of rain would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possibly mess up your algorithm.

    So what you could do is instead'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'de noise just the shadow image,

    which would just be a bunch of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gray scale tones, and then you

    would fold that in with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'textured surface and get a nice

    final effect. The problem with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'denoising by effect is that if

    you did this for every single'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pass, it would start to really

    add up. The de noising cost'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would become exorbitant. So what

    we try to do is de noise on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'final image that we would have

    just one denoising pass. So on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the left we have the original

    image, and on the right we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a human filtered image and a

    neural network filtered image.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And the human one is basically

    using sort of traditional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'denoising techniques and then

    tweaking and so on, and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neural network is using an

    entirely different process.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What''s interesting here is that

    I think the computers are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'winning, because in the upper

    right, you can kind of see that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back wall, there''s a little

    strip of green. It''s kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blurred out a little bit too

    much with the human version, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the neural network has picked up

    on that and kept the vertical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stripes there. Deep learning can

    be used for image denoising. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way this works is that we have a

    bunch of rendered images, 20,000'
  persid: ''
- desc: '40,000 however many we can get

    as training data, and then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'train our neural net using those

    images to have the neural net'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of know what the

    environment is like. We can then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use that neural net to take a

    noisy image and have it infer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what the real image should look

    like. So we have some huge'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'training set, or some reasonable

    training set. It just depends.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And from that, we then can

    actually do a great job of de'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noising images, surprisingly

    good. So here''s a noisy image,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one sample per pixel, and here''s

    our de noise image. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shadows look really nice, and

    notice how soft they are. A'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit of soft shadow. It''s

    a fairly nice final dimension.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You can compare that to the

    ground truth. They''re almost'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'identical. In comparison, the

    traditional method in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rasterization is to use shadow

    mapping, where you render'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything from the lights point

    of view. Here you get somewhat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sharper kinds of shadows.

    They''re just not as beautiful,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s face it, and it has other

    kinds of problems, like that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One person is floating a little

    bit. It''s called Peter panning,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and this can be avoided by using

    newer techniques. Here''s another'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example of denoising, where we

    have this shiny surface varying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in roughness and de noised. It

    looks pretty good. And here''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ground truth. Now, there''s a

    fair bit of difference between'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the de noised and the ground

    truth here, but it''s enough to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be plausible. It''s a reasonable

    result, and it''s one that is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to basically be reasonable

    to most people''s visual systems.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They''re not going to be

    surprised or shocked by the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'result. In comparison, here''s

    one that''s pretty different,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually. This is called

    stochastic screen space'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection method that uses

    rasterization, and it''s kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using information in the screen,

    and it has problems. There are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ways that it works fairly well,

    but there''s other places where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it kind of falls apart. To show

    you the comparison, again, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the ground truth and the

    spring space reflection, and you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can see they''re considerably

    different. Here''s another image.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Here we have just one sample per

    pixel of Ray Traced global'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'illumination and de noising, we

    get this really pretty fantastic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'result. It just blows me away

    that it can do this well. To'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compare this to ground truth, in

    the ground truth image, you''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'notice a little bit of darkening

    around the fringes of things and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the crevices and so on. But

    for the most part, the images'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are quite comparable. Last I''m

    going to finish off with an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'animation. So there''s a movie

    that was rendered called zero'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'day by this person called

    people, and he kindly put his'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'entire database and animation

    path and so on on the web for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people to reuse as they will. So

    we use this at Nvidia to'

    actually, it''s related'
  persid: ''
- desc: my thesis in the
  persid: ''

    thought I mean Ambient Occlusion'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was pretty cool. Anybody was

    never in yet. How can we do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'de noise thing in pbrt? Because

    often we get out of gamut'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixels. Can we? Can we reduce

    that using like denoising?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not
  persid: ''
- desc: my parent Sure, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not sure if that needs a

    GPU.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I will investigate. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking, Oh, that would be like

    a perfect, like solution to our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out of gap pixels. Is the de

    noise out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there? Yes. And did the crown

    look familiar?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That was the test image that we

    looked at early On this'
  persid: ''
- desc: semester. It's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so I just want to Touch on our

    quiz for today. Thank'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you. So what is a convenient

    bounding volume for shapes? For'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for some reason that sentence

    sounds really weird to my ears.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is a convenient bounding

    like, sorry.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, I''ll accept that it''s

    maybe a bit of tension between'
  persid: ''
- desc: singular and plural.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it was in the videos that it
  persid: ''
- desc: was
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like objects that, like emit

    light, like it was trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: remember exactly what I read.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's not about emitting it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we talked first about circles

    and spheres bounding objects in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the scene. Then he said, but in

    ray tracing, we Use boxes and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more particularly, access

    aligned boxes. Oh,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how are area lights defined

    in pbrt? Do?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it? Doesn''t it? Like, use, like

    the normals of like, the shape'
  persid: ''
- desc: to project lines. Is that right?
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, we want to attach an emit.
  persid: ''
- desc: Attach An emitter. We
  persid: ''
- desc: attach an emission profile and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to attach that

    profile to a square,'
  persid: ''
- desc: or whatever we want to
  persid: ''
- desc: have be the area light we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then, why is it useful to

    have bounds for normals? Why are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normal bounds specifically

    useful in rendering? Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe I just misunderstood what

    I meant by when a shape is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'emissive. But it''s useful for

    for that, and that''s is that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when you''re having like, a like,

    an actual shape for your light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source, like, because normally,

    lights come from a point, often,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is what we do. So if you have

    like, let''s say, a balloon that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was emitting light, that would

    be an emissive balloon. Is that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'correct? Like you''re emitting

    light from a shape, as opposed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to a point, and that''s why it''s

    that''s why it''s useful the'
  persid: ''
- desc: normal bounds.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can think of like a cone

    that contains the bound it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'balances the light using its

    shape and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we have a bound for So, a

    similar thing is, if we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: spotlight, then we're shooting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the cone. And if we can bound

    the normals in a similar way,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that helps us to determine

    what''s visible'
  persid: ''
- desc: and efficient. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll review the answers you

    gave.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So It''s basically for

    illumination.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm late here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'From the text, it''s normal

    boundary, specifically useful in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lighting time patients, when a

    shape is emissive, they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sometimes make it possible. This

    sometimes makes it possible to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'officially determine that the

    shape does not eliminate a'
  persid: ''
- desc: bigger point in the scene.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s more of a bound. It

    limits it. It''s like saying a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light a light fixture, points

    the light downward, and then it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t need to calculate to the

    right and to the left of that'
  persid: ''
- desc: light. Is that sort of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'apt. We''ll talk about it next

    day.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And also you
  persid: ''
- desc: can think about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how to make that desktop

    tetrahedron. We''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: talk about that as well. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: the pyramid that one,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not a pyramid. Pyramid has

    four sides. Oh,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three sides. Okay, yeah, I think

    I did program it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'already. Okay. Anyway, thank you

    for today.'
  persid: ''
- desc: See you on Thursday. I.
