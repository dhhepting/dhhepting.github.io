- desc: on the clock.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Been there. We''ve all been there

    working on something. The next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing you know, it''s one o''clock

    in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'morning. Done that so many times

    less so now Alex 10 has moved'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Back in I don''t do that nearly

    as often.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so here we are at meeting 11.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: meeting 11, February 11.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sorry. I''m used by small things.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re in the last week before

    the breaks. We have a meeting on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thursday, then the break. And

    then we meet on Tuesday, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: '25th and that day we can do some

    review for the midterm, if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like. And we''ll start on Chapter

    Six then, so We''ll deal with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chapter five, today and

    Thursday. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s our meeting for today.

    See came'
  persid: ''
- desc: up? Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So? Assignment due dates I was

    checking with both Our marker I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first assignment, six marks

    That''s due February 25 Tuesday'
  persid: ''
- desc: At
  persid: ''
- desc: 2359 and
  persid: ''
- desc: '59, I What do you think about

    that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the final two assignments and

    would be due at the same time.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hello, I was now in time does

    midterms of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 27 Correct? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it should be in the calendar.

    Let''s check it out. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: Is it may be filtered. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Mom, our nature. I thought I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had taken out the attendance for

    that Day, but don''t stress about'
  persid: ''
- desc: attendance for that day. I
  persid: ''
- desc: winter, February, 27
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in class. So there''s no quiz

    that class, then obviously,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, I You did remove that
  persid: ''
- desc: my brain is actually, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can ask you, what do you

    need to bring today? And you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to respond with pencil,

    pencil sharpener, maybe an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eraser, and you remember your

    student card. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes, yeah, I think Dr Hepting

    Well enough by now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: just trying to get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into that. I''ve been around for

    forever. It''s my third Dr'
  persid: ''
- desc: Hepting class. I day class.
  persid: ''
- desc: '284, 28, don''t you know who my

    professor is? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I know I have to do another

    wiki, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will get that done off the

    Break.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s on my list of things to do.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: do so Mr. D,
  persid: ''
- desc: like one right before this one,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I brought that all right again.

    I I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did. Oh, is this four questions?

    Wow, is this any questions about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what I''m asking for assignment?

    One,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, change in size, adding
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one spheres. Changing the size

    so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you will be able to click on a

    description very soon. I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wanted to get the dates and the

    marks into your courses for you'
  persid: ''
- desc: to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'appreciate it, so now we can

    transfer them to our own'
  persid: ''
- desc: calendars.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, So has anyone done the

    export calendars from your'
  persid: ''
- desc: courses?
  persid: ''
- desc: I have another planning app I
  persid: ''
- desc: use. No I just meant to have the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transfer all The due dates to

    your own calendar And'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay so?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I want to encourage you to do

    that. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you don''t make any

    suggestions, I guess we''ll still'
  persid: ''
- desc: have a midterm. Anyway, though,
  persid: ''
- desc: when did you walk them by? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How about the day? Monday, the

    24th and midnight. I 359,'
  persid: ''
- desc: on the 24th or 2359 on the 23rd
  persid: ''
- desc: 24 24 Okay, Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you for that.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'These are randomly generated, as

    you realize, perhaps not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'randomly generated, but randomly

    ordered. So we talk in the book,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he talks about different spaces

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in which we can work and render.

    So what is an advantage of or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what is the camera world space,

    and what is advantage of'
  persid: ''
- desc: rendering in it?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, it''s basically like

    relative to the camera. It''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: biggest part of it, really
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Carroll road space. The

    origin of this space is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'camera''s position, but it

    maintains the orientation of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'world space. It is not

    necessarily looking down to Z'
  persid: ''
- desc: axis.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'render space tied to that''s the

    render space tied to the Canada'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'world spaces. But there''s a half

    that''s not lot of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my I''m just gonna look up

    David''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point. So rendering space can be

    the world space, the camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: space or the camera world space.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's just
  persid: ''
- desc: an umbrella term for
  persid: ''
- desc: space we're rendering in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feeling it should be at the top,

    and the other ones, if it is an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'umbrella term, it should be, it

    should be first and then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: other one should be the only.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'According to that coordinating

    system, it''s just the place'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where it''s being rendered.

    That''s a rendering space. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's all it is. It's not
  persid: ''
- desc: they seem like they're separate.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The rendering space is just your

    choice of those three coordinate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'systems. Which one you want to

    render'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So rendering space is

    mentioned above the list, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's at the end of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. Should I feel like it should

    just be the first of the four of'
  persid: ''
- desc: them that are listed?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, that''s a good point. I

    think it''s not like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re even trying to go in

    alphabetical order, because they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have object space at the top

    object'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'world, yeah, so are some of

    these familiar, yes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very familiar camera space,

    because whenever you''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, like game development, or

    anything like that. You''re from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the camera''s point of view all

    the time, and then you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'always leave it to do, like, to

    move stuff around in the world,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to place things. So in a similar

    way, you have them as separate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of entities. Just because

    you move your character doesn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mean the entire world moves

    around. The camera just moves.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I camera
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to me, camera space versus

    camera world, space. Camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spaces, if you''re looking at it

    like first person and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Camera, camera world is where

    you''re looking at the whole'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scene altogether, like where

    you''re a third like you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'outside. Like the classic Mario

    game would be a camera world,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'space where the first person

    shooter of me, one I don''t know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what Call of Duty would be,

    camera space like that''s what'
  persid: ''
- desc: we'd be looking
  persid: ''
- desc: at. Makes sense,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, but I think we have to be

    careful. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have to be careful in the

    sense that the final product we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see on the screen as you''re

    playing a game, for example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s the final product. Is the

    output. So, camera, world camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: space, world space, these are
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the details under the hood, so

    to speak, and there are some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'efficiencies that can be gained

    from them. Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s an advantage of using

    camera world space as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering as The rendering

    space,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more precision and geometric

    details preserved you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'More precision is definitely the

    case here, because if we have an'
  persid: ''
- desc: astronomical translation and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rare. So here''s the original

    car. Here''s a translation of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: million units I think
  persid: ''
- desc: looks like a Lego car, maybe a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what happens here is, because

    we''ve we''ve used up the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'precision translating a million

    units away, so We don''t have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very much to work with anymore,

    and so we get this imprecise'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image. So that''s a reason why.

    Maybe not rendering in world'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'space is a good idea, and this

    is a camera world space.'
  persid: ''
- desc: The viewpoint has shifted
  persid: ''
- desc: slightly, same here things
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just the pixels are slightly

    offset because they''re giant'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blocks instead of, you know, no,

    I think compared to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: original,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s what the description

    said. Viewpoints shifted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'slightly due to a lot of

    accuracy and the representation'
  persid: ''
- desc: of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the camera. Think you might have

    to zoom into the micro pixels to'
  persid: ''
- desc: find that very end of this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS, the translated CS, rendered

    camera road space. Much more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'precision is available than

    geometric details preserved.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'However, the viewpoint is

    shifted slightly due to loss of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accuracy in the representation

    of the camera position.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In other words, they couldn''t

    get the exact camera position.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's test that
  persid: ''
- desc: doesn't appear different
  persid: ''
- desc: 'display on them, probably the

    difference'
  persid: ''
- desc: in artifacts for J bagging I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'safe image as What''s going on

    here. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, Let's take a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s an interactive image. I

    guess that''s feature, Not the'
  persid: ''
- desc: bug. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. Now
  persid: ''
- desc: let's try and reset it. Does
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that look like it''s Yeah, I

    think'
  persid: ''
- desc: that is Okay. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t feel like it should not

    say anything at all if it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: working, but
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it doesn''t look like New files

    Be Great. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You put the second one quotation

    works, the camera, World card,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The other ones you put in

    quotes, yeah, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one because there Were arguments

    to the switches on the command'
  persid: ''
- desc: line. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ah, I think we''re getting

    closer. Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I was able to generate an

    error message so it''s it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'working. It should say there''s

    no difference. Who agrees with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me on that? No but I''m just

    saying the Image tool software'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should report that there''s no

    difference between two images. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: uh,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my technique would have been to

    Photoshop put them images right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on top of each other, and use a

    difference filter to see if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s any differences. But

    then, since they''re like, What'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'JPEGs, P and GS, there''s still

    going to be micro differences'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just because the file format. So

    I don''t know if there''s a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way to do it, without the

    artifacting and stuff like that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: but here anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So not conclusive, but it seems

    like they''re the same image.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''d be really awkward if they

    just put the wrong image up,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like they actually put the same

    image twice. It''s like they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t even notice the

    difference is not aligned. Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: it would be really awkward. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as we Have that in this PPR,

    Four scenes, I believe i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Not sure which one it is. Let''s

    try to smoke this Car. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i don''t i did this before, So I

    think it''s Maybe the VMW. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I only had 35,000
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seconds. Yeah, we won''t hold our

    breath for that one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I Okay, let's change
  persid: ''
- desc: it. A little better. A
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little better. Yeah, he didn''t

    want to wait for him for 34,000'
  persid: ''
- desc: seconds. I
  persid: ''
- desc: No, that's Not it. I it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe it is the pm or the sports

    car then,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, See what else we have

    here. I Have Here You'
  persid: ''
- desc: Daryl, Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so We can that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s take a look At the pbrt

    file. I Guess I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m wondering where how To

    specify render Space. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's An options, Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, back to The quiz we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'took. Took screenshots,

    screenshots. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s the implication of the

    shutter that opens for a short'
  persid: ''
- desc: period of time? Motion
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Blur? Why do they want to

    emulate motion blur in the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'place? What''s the benefit of

    having motion blur?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can remove some of the at

    least for cinematic qualities.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Some people like an emotional

    blur, because it emulates older'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'film, because the film was

    literally moving as you the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'camera. So like, as light went

    across, a new blur going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through, like, like, if you took

    two images and smeared it to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them to give a cinematic effect.

    And it can also kind of review,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reduce motion sickness if you''re

    staring at something really the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'high refresh rate, but if you''re

    a gamer itself, yeah, okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: cancel
  persid: ''
- desc: 'motion. Yeah. I get that. We can

    do it, but like, it''s a still'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image. So I was wondering why

    we, why we want to emulate'
  persid: ''
- desc: motion blur? Like,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s assuming it''s not a still

    image, because if there''s, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nothing''s moving, there''s no

    motion blur.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, could be like thinking,

    like you could render an image'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of a sprinter, but I''m wondering

    why you''d want to make him'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blurry. Show the boy running,

    you know?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we get the sense of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then being a sprinter,

    sprinting, moving blur, faster'
  persid: ''
- desc: than a speeding bullet
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also be used for like films that

    use Physically Based Rendering,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so as they have moving
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between each other, okay, that

    makes one sense. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I think I was messing
  persid: ''
- desc: around with
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Adobe Illustrator, and there was

    a film. I took a little video on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the job, set it so watching it,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I increased budget settings,

    added extra frames interval'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in between them and watching

    them just like a sudden jerk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'around and move to fill it with

    the gaps of So very ai,'
  persid: ''
- desc: COVID, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I see if I am correct about wall

    E, B,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s Not the bold title. Think

    it''s just Wally.'
  persid: ''
- desc: No, not that
  persid: ''
- desc: different. Wally. Oh, do we?
  persid: ''
- desc: Any future
  persid: ''
- desc: Restaurant Andre?
  persid: ''
- desc: Will We be at? Andre? Do?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Featuring the first use of

    motion blur in CGI Animation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Should we have A peek at it? Oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hole. Here you go, these Wings.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: These women you
  persid: ''
- desc: so yeah, for wings, we need that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pretty impressive. Yes, that was

    19, Eight, six. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the last question is about a

    circle of confusion.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This was a little confusing for

    me to wrap my head around a'
  persid: ''
- desc: little
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit. It''s basically like when

    you have an actual camera, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you ever, like, if you don''t

    have, like, the infinite focus,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or like a parallel lens, you

    could focus at a point which is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the focal length, and anything

    that is for or after that goes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the prism, and it either

    scatters at the imaging medium'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the sensor of the film, or it

    reverses up or reverses down, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it scatters at some point Before

    the Vocal Point of the lens,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creating Boca or depth of field

    so things become blurrier the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'farther out or the closer to the

    camera. Thank'
  persid: ''
- desc: You. So it's so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a point does not lie on the

    plane of focus as image to a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disc on the film plane, rather

    than to a single point. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'boundary of this. This is called

    the circle of confusion. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, there''s an example in the

    picture below.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if the circle of confusion is

    less than the size of a pixel,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it will affect it will appear to

    be in focus. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's figure 510 i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It looks like somebody''s thumb

    is in the picture.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's a lot of defoc,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s a lot of depth of field.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a large circle of confusion

    will lead to blur from being out'
  persid: ''
- desc: of focus.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can you go back to B so small

    lens after and then scroll down.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS so there''s more on the desk

    that''s in. It''s clear in that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one where in the other one

    there''s less focus,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the backgrounds and

    stuff is more out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of focus. Oh, wrote a time 17

    after'
