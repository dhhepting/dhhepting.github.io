Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I said assignment one would

    be six marks'
  persid: ''
- desc: And then two and three would be
  persid: ''
- desc: 12 marks each.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This. I was wondering, well,

    let''s not make any more of it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looks like the network is

    connected. There we go.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I we go. Oh. Now it's
  persid: ''
- desc: undecided.
  persid: ''
- desc: Look like You took the click I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so they would look at the Zoom

    transcript. No, it just came as'
  persid: ''
- desc: a lot of text.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I have my phone recording

    here, so if the other ones are'
  persid: ''
- desc: back To the standard
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the regular appearance of the

    transcript.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Well, I guess I''ll switch to

    my hot spot.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t need to do anything

    there. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: man, even the cell phone, Even
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cellular network is Slow.

    You'
  persid: ''
- desc: switch to i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m going to run it for my

    laptop,'
  persid: ''
- desc: See if That helps. If
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so assignments appears on

    the web page, and if you''re ever'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able to access the web page,

    you''ll see it here. So I''m going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to put some more details here,

    but I''m going to fill in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rubric. So I have the file on

    Dropbox. It''s also on the I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should put the link there the

    version four file format page.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I want you to take that

    change the Image Size to 1280,'
  persid: ''
- desc: by Oh, type, Oh. 720, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So change the image size of

    1280, by 720, and add and place'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two more spheres in the scene,

    each with a different material.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we run it with the specified

    integrator, and also use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wavefront integrator and use

    different values of samples per'
  persid: ''
- desc: pixel.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so that will and then I

    want you to fully document your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pbrt file with comments in line

    that describe all the statements'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used along with all parameters

    specified and default values for'
  persid: ''
- desc: those parameters not specified.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So lot of writing and lot of

    comments into the PBR file, pbrt'
  persid: ''
- desc: file.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I propose that three marks

    for describing, documenting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'input file that''s your you.

    Using, and then to run and'
  persid: ''
- desc: analyze the results
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at a three marks, and that''ll be

    due on February 25 so it''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Tuesday back from the break You

    said'
  persid: ''
- desc: to me chairs on that Thursday.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. Thank
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, do
  persid: ''
- desc: Is it blue and black?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Blue and black, or one color

    looks the same as another under'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'certain conditions, under

    different completely different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dress? I''m somewhat familiar

    with that example.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How To summarize, I''m two

    distinct pairings of like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spectra that they''re they''re

    different, but they can look the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same depending on like when you

    convert them to like spectra,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like spectra to like color and

    stuff like that, they look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'identical. It''s kind of what I

    interpreted as pairs of spectra'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was substantially different

    distributions that have very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'similar X, Y and Z values, and

    thus the human observer appear'
  persid: ''
- desc: to be the same. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s a white or gold or gold

    block, is the real question?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I have to do more research.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not sure that
  persid: ''
- desc: the dress example
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might be, it might be off his

    metamer. The idea is, so if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look at the Wikipedia page for

    metamer, they say, Here''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: monochromatic light,
  persid: ''
- desc: and then here's
  persid: ''
- desc: an RGB. I
  persid: ''
- desc: instead of me drawing
  persid: ''
- desc: up the picture, I
  persid: ''
- desc: so on the right in column one,
  persid: ''
- desc: We have a yellow light,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can also express the

    yellow light as a combination of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'red, green and blue in column

    two. So the the images one at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the top of columns one and two

    are perceived to be the same,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but the luminance is has a very

    different spectral power'
  persid: ''
- desc: distribution.
  persid: ''
- desc: So going down,
  persid: ''
- desc: we have
  persid: ''
- desc: so S, M and L and
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone know what SM and l
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are when you Don''t cook your

    chicken enough you get sick?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I not
  persid: ''
- desc: sound enough, isn't
  persid: ''
- desc: it spectral? I
  persid: ''
- desc: learning management
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t the stand for spectrum,

    no camera, stand for material,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no light. Getting cold. Short,

    reading cold. Short, medium'
  persid: ''
- desc: long, yeah, but
  persid: ''
- desc: That's right. Should I Get
  persid: ''
- desc: Good so
  persid: ''
- desc: you Just
  persid: ''
- desc: take a Picture. CS manager,
  persid: ''
- desc: still. So if you use it,
  persid: ''
- desc: so the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our eyes can perceive short,

    medium and long'
  persid: ''
- desc: wavelength. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a correspondence with

    red, green and blue. What'
  persid: ''
- desc: else did I ask? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: what else do I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ask? Was A characteristic of A,

    C, E, s2, 064,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's a color space.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it seems to extend past the

    visual light spectrum we can''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: see like they're what was it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theoretical colors or imaginary

    uses primaries that correspond'
  persid: ''
- desc: To imaginary colors? Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So the idea is that it

    allows All possible colors to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: represented. So I
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's a benefit for archival
  persid: ''
- desc: purposes that
  persid: ''
- desc: we can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re not limited to sRGB, for

    example, which is a standard for'
  persid: ''
- desc: the web. Does
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that just mean it avoids data

    loss? If you just stored in RGB,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you technically are losing the

    data of those imaginary colors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So is that why we use it for

    archival purposes? Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to preserve it historically, in

    case the values of our GPS'
  persid: ''
- desc: change over time.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm open to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing your own research on this

    as well, but I feel, my feeling'
  persid: ''
- desc: is that, because we're not, I
  persid: ''
- desc: the gamut
  persid: ''
- desc: 'made available with picking

    primaries that are outside'
  persid: ''
- desc: the range of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'visible Colors, so that we

    capture the whole horseshoe of'
  persid: ''
- desc: visible colors.
  persid: ''
- desc: That gives us
  persid: ''
- desc: more flexibility in
  persid: ''
- desc: terms of
  persid: ''
- desc: keeping a reference to
  persid: ''
- desc: and as we Get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as technology improves, we have

    wider Color gamuts and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are you Looking for your last

    question? I I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just want to get back to my

    teacher'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today. So what''s the

    relationship between x y z'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates and visible colors?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Not all values of x y z

    coordinates correspond to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: sizeable spectrum,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realizable spectrum, yeah. So we

    can have values of x, y and z'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that don''t correspond to

    realizable colors. But on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other hand, all the realizable

    colors I have coordinates in x,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'y and z. So that was a true and

    false question. Not true and'
  persid: ''
- desc: false, True or False. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so pbrt is dealing with spectral

    rendering, So we have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: be able to do
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have to deal with
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spectral power distributions and

    colors and'
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is physics, physical.
  persid: ''
- desc: This perception, perceptual.
  persid: ''
- desc: There are two issues. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So we want to I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to specify the spectrum,

    maybe By piece wise. But then We'
  persid: ''
- desc: also need to, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we need to work with RGB in

    some cases, And then we also'
  persid: ''
- desc: this is part of the other
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is, first of all, we

    have to do input, whether we'
  persid: ''
- desc: specify
  persid: ''
- desc: spectra to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'begin with, that''s input to the

    renderer, or whether we specify'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things in terms of RGB, then we

    need to convert the spectra to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do the processing. And then we

    also need to think about for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'output, converting the spectra

    to RGB'
  persid: ''
- desc: for storage you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So this is this diagram. Is

    the horseshoe that I started'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with or ended with last day. So

    we could see the wavelengths of'
  persid: ''
- desc: visible light around the edge,
  persid: ''
- desc: so blue is 380
  persid: ''
- desc: and red is at 700 and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the chromaticity is

    independent'
  persid: ''
- desc: of illumination and
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can talk about i
  persid: ''
- desc: So, X, Y, Y and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has anyone heard of y, u, v as a

    color space?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does it sound for ultraviolet?

    By any chance? No,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'u and v are the coordinates.

    Perhaps. Parameterization.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is what it was called when

    I was familiar, when I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learning these things that For

    the first time, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: it so now, more generally, We
  persid: ''
- desc: talk about why CR, CB,
  persid: ''
- desc: so illuminance, of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'course. Corresponds roughly to

    the green. And then we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: specify Chroma differences in
  persid: ''
- desc: red and blue and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So has anyone watched a black

    and white TV lately?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, there are some movies that

    were made in black and white'
  persid: ''
- desc: that I kept watching color.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, except for Ted Turner''s

    wonderful the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'show called one division that

    was in black and white for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: first half of it. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: it's a wonderful Street.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah? Chris, the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'old black and white don''t

    convert well to color in today''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: world.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. Well, this a little bit

    different.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's see. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i blame Ted Turner for this. Is

    that justified?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the original black and white

    with Alistair sim is that called'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A Christmas Carol, and it gets

    called Scrooge, I can verify'
  persid: ''
- desc: that changed the name. So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Miracle on 34th Street. It''s a

    Wonderful Life. It''s very'
  persid: ''
- desc: knowledgeable.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the point I was getting or

    losing towards was,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, okay, talking about one

    division and different. It''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: Wonderful Life and so on.
  persid: ''
- desc: Unless we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the source material is black

    and white, Unless we mess with'
  persid: ''
- desc: it. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so TV signals. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So the black And white y'all,
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s like, where should we have

    the black and white inside the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color transmission? So we''re

    just using part of the data to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create the black and white

    images. I or the black and white'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'TV. If it doesn''t have Chroma,

    it''s just using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: luminance to display the image.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. Did the original like

    cameras that were used to film'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these things, were they able to

    perceive the red and the blue?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But we just didn''t have a way of

    like capturing them, like, like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'putting them on screen. Like,

    for instance, if we went to an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'old black and white thing and we

    had the original tape, could we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then convert that to IE, to use

    Chroma, for instance. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part of what they did with the

    colorizing. Is trying to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I mean, a lot of colorizing just

    algorithms to just'
  persid: ''
- desc: read like do it. But
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you had the original tape,

    would you be able to just have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it? I don''t believe that the

    systems were able to record that'
  persid: ''
- desc: data
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the time. That''s the

    question.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So there was no tape, it

    was film,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and that was stuck in black and

    white. Yeah. I think the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'machines that it was recorded

    on, I don''t believe that they'
  persid: ''
- desc: had capabilities
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for life. Yeah, I will look into

    the history.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There was color film at the

    cameras. Like, if you put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colored film in those cameras,

    they would still, like, accept'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. It''s just that the film

    itself, it was way too expensive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to actually do any kind of

    color, so black and white, just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'black and white was very Cheap.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If anyone''s Interested in Very

    cones.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I So Talking about gametes. This

    is the range of colors that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can represent. So we have the

    blue, green and red primaries.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So based on the particular

    quantities of those primaries'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that defines the range of colors

    that we can represent the'
  persid: ''
- desc: So here are some
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other gamuts. So SRGB, that''s

    the web Standard, and D 65 and'
  persid: ''
- desc: So the White Point The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s a perceptual quantity,

    but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the white point is when, if

    we''re Talking about red, green'
  persid: ''
- desc: and blue,
  persid: ''
- desc: that we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'full full red, Full green, full

    blue.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s the Plot of the

    spectral distribution for D 65'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the nanometers are along the

    bottom.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pardon, me, I said daylight, but

    noontime daylight at European'
  persid: ''
- desc: latitudes. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so F is F series illuminance,

    and that corresponds to'
  persid: ''
- desc: fluorescent lights. And it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So earlier in the text had

    mentioned'
  persid: ''
- desc: about a lemon skin,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not just a skin, but a lemon

    with its skin on, and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'behavior of that under lighting

    conditions. And so this is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spectra for reflection from a

    lip from a lemon'
  persid: ''
- desc: skin.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Seems funny to say, lemon skin,

    right?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That feels like you''re talking

    about the inside of the skin,'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can have different kinds

    of spectra and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can have a piecewise Linear

    spectrum, defining a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution Using a set of

    values for'
  persid: ''
- desc: And then we can sample and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the tri stimulus theory of

    color,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll do a dramatic reading here.

    Of this paragraph'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'says that all visible spectral

    distributions can be accurately'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represented for human observers

    using three scalar values. Its'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basis is that there are three

    types of photoreceptive cone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cells in the eye, each sensitive

    to different wavelengths of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light. This theory, which has

    been tested in numerous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experiments since its

    introduction in the 1800s has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'led the development of spectral

    matching functions, which are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'functions of wavelength that can

    be used to compute a tri'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stimulus representation of a

    spectral distribution I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are the color matching

    curves for X, Y and Z, a given'

- desc: 'spectral distribution can be

    converted to x, y and z by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplying each of the three

    curves, and integrating the'

    wavelengths of light in the'

    with the RGB color associated'
  persid: ''
- desc: with each wavelength, so,
  persid: ''
- desc: blue here, red
  persid: ''
- desc: here, Green and
  persid: ''
- desc: how did I do? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when we''re studying, we don''t

    need to worry about, like their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'process of how they''re doing it

    in the program. We just need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'worry about the confidence, like

    when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re reading the textbook and

    stuff. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: formulas or anything like that,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the textbook, yeah, I would

    say I'
  persid: ''
- desc: the details of the mathematics,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really going to focus on that,

    because we''re not focusing on'
  persid: ''
- desc: that in our discussions
  persid: ''
- desc: it's about, How do we get

- desc: how are we
  persid: ''
- desc: able to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experiment or access these

    physical simulations in pbrt,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the details of the integrals and

    so forth'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe, if you think about the

  persid: ''
- desc: the text.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That might be a good way to

    think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: does that seem helpful?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thanks that formula is pretty,

    pretty easy and useful. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really just a percentage like

    and then the last one, even even'
  persid: ''

    x minus y, which is just saying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to all the one in reality,

    dividing one wavelength by the'

- desc: like, the total of the

    combined,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just what percentage of your

    lights, x, what percentage of y,'
  persid: ''
- desc: what percentage Z? Well,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then just saying, the kids in a
