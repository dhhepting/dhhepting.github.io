- desc: 'Okay. Here we are At

    meeting five of 26'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the first thing I Put for

    today, any questions or concerns'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: let me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see if one of These markers is

    going to do a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: better. I i paid for a while.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So questions or concerns so far.

    Okay, so in looking at chapter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three, I found a link to

    immersive linear algebra, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe is of interest. Would you

    like to explore? Can you wait? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, so that it seems to have

    lots of examples, lots of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'animation, so you can let me

    know what you think. So then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have been working on pbrt for

    Windows.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How the people here who''s had

    success with pbrt for Windows,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, that''s good. Good. Were

    you able to try the sample?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Didn't work. Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: So we Need C, make, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS, and then this script is

    designed to compile said lib'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from source and then build PBR T

    so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when I''m allowed in the lab for

    135 when there''s not a lab'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'section going on and I''m not

    otherwise occupied, I''ve been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying To get this set up On on

    the lab computers. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what I''m trying what I gotten

    to so far? These are the path'
  persid: ''
- desc: names I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I think root folder is where

    you''ve got, where you have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'repository with PBR, TV, four.

    And then, so in the lab'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computers, it''s actually on the

    C drive, users, Hepting D, for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example, GitHub. Actually, I

    don''t think it''s got GitHub'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there. It just, it''s pprt Four

    anyway, modify the path to your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source directory, and then the

    output it''s going to create some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information in third party, MS,

    VC, so the first part should'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'match the root folder

    information, and then we''re just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'adding a few more directories in

    the tree. And then here''s where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the source is located, and it''s

    in source extension Z lib. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're going to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make a build ms V c, directory,

    and CD into that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we''re going to call the

    Microsoft Visual Studio'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'batch file, V c bar is 64 dot

    bat. I don''t know what that does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exactly, but I found on my lab,

    on the lab computer. I found'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Microsoft Visual Studio, and

    then I found a path that matched'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the C auxiliary build. So I just

    did some pattern matching there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to get to that. Then I I took

    out the minus g for generator'
  persid: ''
- desc: option here,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'since I wasn''t quite sure Which

    generator to use. So we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to generate Z
  persid: ''
- desc: lib. Okay, so we've got, I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not sure why we have two

    calls to C make? I guess the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first one is setting some

    parameters, and then the second'
  persid: ''
- desc: one is doing the build.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then we''re going to clean up

    the build directory, and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: going to add
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mSv clib into our path, and then

    we''re going back to the root'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'folder. So first of all, we

    we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'changed directory to the zip,

    lift source, And then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going back to the root

    directory. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s the same i a strategy

    about matching the version we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have for under Microsoft Visual

    Studio, and then we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: do C make so I think
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so C Make didn''t find the optics

    or the CUDA'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'files on lab computer, so I have

    to check those paths.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But anyway, so the idea is we

    build Z lib, and then we build'
  persid: ''
- desc: the project.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I got part way through before

    I got kicked out of the lab'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yesterday, but it was building

    source, so I''m hopeful this is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good approach. So our Tai Lin

    posted a link. His last entry'
  persid: ''
- desc: was, try the strategy here. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that direct link was about

    changing the C make list, dot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'text file, I think, but I, I

    couldn''t. I see where the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'changes were needed to be made.

    So I went back to the issue in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is to which this was

    reply, to which this was a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reply. And I found the script,

    and I think that''s maybe a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little more straightforward. I

    if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you want to find exactly where

    it''s changed, you can always do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like a text comparison tool,

    where you load up the one file'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you load up the other one,

    and it''ll tell you if there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: any differences. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, I know I can do a diff.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was looking at at the diff, I

    thought that''s what I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking at on GitHub, and when I

    searched for P techs and zlib, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t find anything that

    matched. So, yeah, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had a friend try to find said

    love, and he couldn''t find it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Either. He was looking for it

    for me, and he just couldn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: find it. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the source is included in the

    PBR TV for repository. If you''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'downloaded it With the recursive

    option that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway, There it is. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any so I''ve noticed that there

    hasn''t been a flurry of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion in the class

    discussion lists or the wiki. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who still needs to get the

    software running on their own'
  persid: ''
- desc: computer there?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s just a matter of knowing

    the commands and stuff for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, if you''re having issues,

    you can send me an email'
  persid: ''
- desc: directly if you don't want To
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put your issue into the class

    discussion list, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m hopeful that When we get

    this, when I get this bill, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll be available on some lab

    computers.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I just want to mention the

    wiki and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so under meetings.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So meeting three is red, so that

    means that the link has been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marked after but the half page

    hasn''t been created and meeting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four hasn''t been made into a

    link, so Let''s just edit that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do you want to start Fine while

    you''re in there too?'
  persid: ''
- desc: That's today's sure you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the issue with the scheduler

    is because it wouldn''t let I set'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up after the first class and

    because the first class was'
  persid: ''
- desc: already finished.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'David, I were just saying, I''ll

    do three, I''ll finish three.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll do meeting three, and then

    he''ll do four and five. Okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s just six through 26 that we

    need to figure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out. Yeah, okay, did everyone

    get a reminder?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here I''ve created a file for

    the input to generate the simple'
  persid: ''
- desc: I supposed to Be pbrt, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so I''ve cracked it. I''ll

    correct the link. It''ll Still'
  persid: ''
- desc: want to download it. You
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll just Text it. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There we go. So the first part

    of the file specifies the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'camera, sampler, the integrator

    and the film. And then, from'
  persid: ''
- desc: world begin I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'onwards, then rescribing The

    scene. So this is the 400 by 400'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is the one that comes in

    the file format section of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'web page. So if you''ve installed

    pbrt, you''ll get that picture of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the glass ball floating over the

    checkerboard.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So where can we find the

    commands to actually like run'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the PBR team program. So if we

    wanted to run the checkerboard,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where would we find the commands

    to do? So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what are the command lines that

    we need to be inputting here?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s where I''m at is don''t

    understand where the those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'commands are, how am I supposed

    to open the command line? Where'
  persid: ''
- desc: am I running
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this so I have pbrt installed in

    user local bin. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What? Let''s see equivalent

    Windows command to find out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which executable is being

    accessed.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Can you key principle drive?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m sorry I didn''t hear the

    path. Okay? So this is I could,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I could do. I
  persid: ''
- desc: i So this is my path setting.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So which tells me which there''s

    multiple versions of pbrt, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: one is going to be executed.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I That''s print environment.

    Print,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, this is on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'MacBook Air, so we just got to

    find the equivalent command on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Windows. As long as I know what

    the Mac is, we can find the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'windows one if I find them on

    the wiki, okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So doing the which tells me that

    it''s installed, so if I just did'
  persid: ''
- desc: pbrt.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is going to look at

    standard input for the scene'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'description, so we don''t want to

    do that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So end of file before world

    Begin. Fatal errors during scene'
  persid: ''
- desc: construction and
  persid: ''
- desc: example of
  persid: ''
- desc: PDR teams, yeah, but that's I I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think I moved this instead of

    copying'
  persid: ''
- desc: the Downloads folder to
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, yeah, Sure, too.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you just write the name of

    the file after you take a pbrt,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you''ll find it and then

    start to generate enough folder,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes, and if we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the open X er Image Viewer set

    up, like we did in class that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first day, you can see the image

    fill in and see the progress of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the image. What was that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called? That''s how was that?

    Called X tab or'
  persid: ''
- desc: XCR, imager. So that is, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: up right there.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so, p, V, R, T, I, pbrt

    display server, local host.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s on the GitHub tree

    master page and'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's so To read Me, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you played, You might miss

    it. You Oh,'
  persid: ''
- desc: sanitation, Yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i So I think there were some

    error messages when I started up'
  persid: ''
- desc: to have four. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: going
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to guess that''s what causes

    segmentation fault. But the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image generated properly, and

    you can use whatever viewer you'
  persid: ''
- desc: want to look at the images.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s just using that little

    bit of text in that file to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generate this image, like it has

    all the things with like the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sphere and the reflective

    property and the color and all'
  persid: ''
- desc: that. Yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s pretty cool. What other

    textures do we have like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'available to us? Do we have

    like? Can we make it a gold'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sphere, for instance, just like

    a slightly shiny golden sphere?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i will show an example of a

    shite, slightly shiny golden'
  persid: ''
- desc: sphere on Thursday, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then I''ll compare the source

    code to figure out how you did'
  persid: ''
- desc: it. Okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do you feel good About I

    Running?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are, this is about the

    building blocks and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of Doing the ray tracing, The

    path tracing And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Chapter Six is going to deal

    With spheres and triangles and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so forth. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we talk about the coordinate

    system as A frame. It has an'
  persid: ''
- desc: origin and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so If we have the frame. What

    do we get? The'
  persid: ''
- desc: I would like to buy a vow,
  persid: ''
- desc: C, A,
  persid: ''
- desc: let's go with our F. Go with the
  persid: ''
- desc: I, guess. How about E?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sorry, there''s no more mapping

    soft N.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can I guess the word? And he

    guesses n, I guess the word. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: guess
  persid: ''
- desc: he said, N, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I heard at the end, but you

    wanted to guess'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the word. Can I guess affine

    space.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Affine space?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that means we can describe

    points in the space as a linear'
  persid: ''
- desc: combination of
  persid: ''
- desc: this vector. These vectors.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in 2d, we have x and y. In

    3d. We have a choice.'
  persid: ''
- desc: What's the choice for z, whether
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it goes inward or outward? Yeah,

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it says left handed. So would

    that be? Would that be inward'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'X, cross Y, and your thumb

    points in the direction of'
  persid: ''
- desc: positive z, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's how I remember it. But
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it was something like like this,

    since my left hand, so left'
  persid: ''
- desc: handed. Method, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the way they say x, cross y

    and positive Z points out as my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right hand and if I use my left

    hand, X, cross, y, positive, z'
  persid: ''
- desc: goes into the board and
  persid: ''
- desc: So positive goes inward.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, That's the left hand. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone appreciate my third

    option? Yeah, and the dexterous'
  persid: ''
- desc: Is that a thing anywhere, ever?
  persid: ''
- desc: No, I don't think so. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so PPR keys using a left hand. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: product uses, co sign, yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It would be nice if cross

    product was cosine, because they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'both Begin with C, but not

    everything can be nice. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is also known as an inner

    product i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i was thinking about the origin

    of cosine and sine and tangent'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm wondering.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, What the background of

    Those terms Are? You?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a 2d example of

    current system.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is our original system.

    So origin is at zero, and here p'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is three units in x and three

    units in y.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then our new coordinate

    system, the dashed lines, so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have two units in x and minus

    four units in y. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does that make sense? So the

    point doesn''t change, but we'
  persid: ''
- desc: have a new frame,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and having The new frame makes

    it easier to transform things'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so we can pick up different

    frames. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we think About a camera,

    let''s get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Our camera specification is

    we''re looking at. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so look at is a popular way to

    specify a camera position. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need the eye point where the

    camera is, point where we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking at. And then the up

    vector.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the eye to the lookout point.

    So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is one of the vectors we

    need to describe the frame.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How can we get the other vectors

    we need to describe the frame? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what other vector is defined in

    that look At specification,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, so up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s also right, up, right,

    forward. Sometimes you can use'
  persid: ''
- desc: left instead. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'guess that really depends on

    whether or not your camera is'
  persid: ''
- desc: moving at all.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we want to specify an up

    vector. So when we take a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'picture, if this is the up

    vector, well say here''s up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector this way, and then if we

    rotate the camera, the up vector'
  persid: ''
- desc: is this way.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s not about up, down,

    left, right, top, bottom. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saying this is the direction

    that''s up in the image.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The reason I specified the right

    is because you can actually make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so that through

    transformations, you can have it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that all of a sudden your

    right is left, and everything in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your picture just gets inverted.

    So it''s not that it''s not that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it rotated, it''s that it gets

    completely inverted. Your left'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'becomes your right, your right

    becomes your left. I don''t know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if this system can do it. I know

    that''s just a common thing that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they use when you''re doing a lot

    of camera transformations, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that you don''t have that

    mistake. But you just calculate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it with your forward and you''re

    up if you just do like, a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relative calculation, if you

    always have your rights on hand,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just makes future calculations

    easier to do transformations. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use that a lot in, I think, the

    one video game class with'
  persid: ''
- desc: Professor Hamilton.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I better use that one here. I

    guess it''s not necessary,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'especially if the camera is

    stationary.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you can give me a bit more

    information, I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put it into context for for us,

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the eye point and the

    look point, that''s one vector,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then the up vector specify,

    that''s another vector we can use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to specify the camera frame. And

    then how do we get the third'
  persid: ''
- desc: vector
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wasn''t the eye look at point

    different?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you mean like the position

    vector? Because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'isn''t the eye more like the

    actual camera what you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking like? Yeah. And then

    look at point as where you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: looking
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes. So by doing the difference

    between them, we define a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector. So I point, and then

    we''re pointing at the look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point. So that''s one vector of

    the frame. Then the question is,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the vector between

    the I point and the lookout'
  persid: ''
- desc: point and the up vector.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can spin the camera around

    this vector between from the I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point to the look at point once

    we pick the F vector that gives'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'us the second vector for the

    coordinates. Does that make'
  persid: ''
- desc: sense? I?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m sorry, yeah, okay, then, how

    do we get a third vector that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perpendicular to these two

    vectors? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''re saying, how do you get

    like this vector? Like this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your look at this is your up.

    And you''re asking this one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right? Yes, that''s, that''s what

    I call the right the right'
  persid: ''
- desc: vector. You
  persid: ''
- desc: so how do we derive it?
  persid: ''
- desc: Is it not the cross product of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Yes, so we do the cross

    product of these two vectors,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we get a third vector

    that defines our core, our'
  persid: ''
- desc: camera coordinate system,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and it should be normal because

    the other two are normal, right?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, we didn''t specify that

    this is going to be normal if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if these two, if these two are

    normalized, then you should get'
  persid: ''
- desc: a normal vector.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s talking about The

    implementation of tuples and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so vectors are based on tuples

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s example of what we can

    do with vectors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can add v plus w, and we can

    see the sum is the diagonal of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: parallelogram.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the addition commutes, we can

    get the same place if We do v'
  persid: ''
- desc: plus w or w plus V i.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is w minus V, but if we did

    v minus w, we get The other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other diagonal? So those results

    are different. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re out of time now, so any

    questions or concerns well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when will we have our first

    assignment? Are you still just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to work on the PDR, G on

    the lot computers before'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you? Yeah, I want to make sure

    that we''re set up with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: software first. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you''re still having issues,

    communicate with me and I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'update you on the lab situation.

    I''ll give out the assignments'
  persid: ''
- desc: starting next week. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thank you. Thank you very much

    for today. Have a great rest of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your day and see you on Thursday

    for some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'slightly shiny gold balls. Is

    that right? Yeah, if it was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'overly shiny, it would be a

    Polish gold'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
