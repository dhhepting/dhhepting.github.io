    Transcripts and The Pictures'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so today we''ll go through

    The quiz, which is really just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your suggestions for exam

    questions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what I want from you for my

    birthday, do well on the final'
  persid: ''
- desc: exam?
  persid: ''
- desc: Sound? Okay, wow.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It. So I''m going to turn the

    screen off so I protect the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'names of the people who

    suggested different questions,'
  persid: ''
- desc: And I will
  persid: ''
- desc: 'post a summary of the

    suggestions I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Today or tomorrow. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What are the best integrators

    for producing high quality'
  persid: ''
- desc: images? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m just going to read out

    the options instead of writing'
  persid: ''
- desc: them on the board.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One, ambient occlusion, BD, PT,

    light path, MLT, number two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'path, random walk, sppm, ball

    path, number 3b, D, P T, M, L T,'

    five, simple vol, path, B, p, p,'
  persid: ''
- desc: T, M, L, T, Simple Path and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there was no answer for this

    One. Any thoughts about third'
  persid: ''
- desc: one?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think I I think I Forgot to

    answer,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is Not a key quantity that

    describes electromagnetic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radiation, a, flux, B,

    irradiance, C, intensity, or D,'
  persid: ''
- desc: aliasing, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: what's the answer?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Flux or radiance, intensity or

    aliasing? Yeah, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: What was the
  persid: ''
- desc: answer? Alias sing, alias,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you. Which of the following is

    correct, a spectra'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if the human perception of

    light, B, color is the physical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'characteristics of light. C,

    gamma is a range of colors. D,'
  persid: ''
- desc: the color of an object is
  persid: ''
- desc: the absorbed light and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that the answer is, C, gamut,

    I,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what best describes the purpose

    of a BRDF in rendering a it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calculates the total amount of

    light emitted by a surface. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defines how a surface reflects

    incoming light into different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directions. It measures the

    distance light travels before'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'being absorbed by a material D,

    it determines The color of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: light source in a scene I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s no answer indicated

    that I''m leaning towards B is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defines How a surface reflects

    incoming Light into different'
  persid: ''
- desc: directions and
  persid: ''
- desc: what was the question?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What best describes the purpose

    of a BRDF, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is the primary advantage of

    points using point sampled'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spectral rendering over RGB

    based rendering a It reduces'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'memory usage by avoiding texture

    lookups it allows the render to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'handle more triangles per

    second. It enables accurate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simulation of wavelength

    dependent phenomenon like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dispersion and Meta metamourism

    That one simplifies the shading'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'models by removing the need For

    color conversion.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, it was C that one. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What kind of lighting produces,

    soft shadows, Point Light,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ambient light, area Light, or

    volumetric light, leave it to'
  persid: ''
- desc: Area Light.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, in the context of pbrt,

    which of the following best'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'describes the bi directional

    scattering distribution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function, a function that models

    a projection of 3d scenes onto a'
  persid: ''
- desc: '2d playing. A function that

    determines how light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattered from one point to

    another through a medium, a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function that defines how light

    is reflected and transmitted at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surfaces, a function that

    measures the amount of light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'emitted by a point light source

    i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The moment a function that

    defines how light is reflected'
  persid: ''
- desc: and transmitted At surfaces you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how many different camera

    coordinate spaces are there? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five? Yeah, it''s five. So name

    as many as you can. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the object space, world space,

    camera world space,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you hyphenated one without

    mentioning both. Camera space,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s camera space there''s

    camera world space object space'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering space and World Space

    World space'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object space, World Space

    counter, warm space i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What are aliasing errors, and

    what are the differences between'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'post and pre aliasing errors?

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how Would you Describe

    aliasing? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so it has to Do with samples

    we''re trying to reconstruct'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an image or reconstruct a

    signal, so we have to take a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have to take enough samples

    to begin with, and then we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'To filter frequencies that are

    above the Nyquist rate'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's the pre In the post You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s what are the issue, or

    what are the differences between'
  persid: ''
- desc: rasterization and ray tracing? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rasterization is more of an

    object based approach for real'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time application, where Ray

    tracing simulates the light pass'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for more realistic visuals,

    especially when you''re talking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about reflections and shadows.

    But Richard is saying, How is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: higher computational cost?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I am I capturing Your comments

    here? Yeah, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ray tracing also simulates The

    light paths Per writing while'
  persid: ''
- desc: reading.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have a couple of examples of

    so for rasterization, an example'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of a character moving in a 3d

    environment, usually what''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'likely rendered with

    rasterization. And then for ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing, movie with special

    effects, where light bounces off'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of a shiny surface, or character

    reflection of puddle that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'likely rendered using ray

    tracing. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we also think about the way

    the Processing is handled. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for each object In rasterization

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in the rasterization case,

    we''re using a Z buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to keep track of the closest

    objects based on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scan, converting the model in

    screen coordinates, and then if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then keeping track of what''s

    closest. And so that''s how the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image is created. With ray

    tracing, we look at each pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and see what''s closest and what

    determines the color that gets'
  persid: ''
- desc: assigned to that pixel to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is the purpose of a

    bounding volume hierarchy? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The purpose would be to reduce

    the amount of computations that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are necessary. It doesn''t

    intersect the highest one of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hierarchy. It doesn''t go into

    the higher yield.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how can we think about a

    bounding volume hierarchy? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: say that again.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How is it structured? How can we

    think about constructing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: bounding volume hierarchy? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i would probably start with

    having an area that contains'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiple objects in one, in the

    highest in a higher level, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then each object having its own

    box within it, yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have nested, Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is Monte Carlo integration?

    How is it used in pbrt to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compute lighting? Discuss the

    role of sampling and variance in'
  persid: ''
- desc: This context. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so samples aren''t Unlimited, so

    we have To Be careful about How'
  persid: ''
- desc: we take samples to
  persid: ''
- desc: important space sampling so
  persid: ''
- desc: I thought It
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what transferable skills have

    you'
  persid: ''
- desc: gained from looking at pbrt? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: trouble she's geography,
  persid: ''
- desc: GitHub repositories, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'command line program or command

    line running,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so While still invite or accept

    suggestions for exam questions'
  persid: ''
- desc: until I Guess Monday noon. I
  persid: ''
- desc: The any questions or concerns.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can we heavily weight the

    multiple choice questions, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Have more of them versus the

    longer answer.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Probably
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll Say I'll give an update
  persid: ''
- desc: on the exam structure. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you haven''t done a wiki page

    yet. Please do them so I include'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that in your grading that will

    need to be done soon. Will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you be reviewing the

    automatically marked exam quiz'
  persid: ''
- desc: questions,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and per and the ones that

    haven''t been marked at all, to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'determine if we so we have an

    idea of what we''re going into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the exam with for quiz answers,

    yes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you have questions about the

    quizzes that were marked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'automatically, please send me A

    note and I will check those in'
  persid: ''
- desc: particular one Question,
  persid: ''
- desc: will there be
  persid: ''
- desc: from chapter one to how much
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh yeah, I understood that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m gonna say in ballpark of

    half the questions. Because, as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve said, the midterm, the

    midterm performance was not'
  persid: ''
- desc: great,
  persid: ''
- desc: so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m going to give you another

    chance of that material, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''ll add On the things

    that we discussed after The'
  persid: ''
- desc: midterm And
  persid: ''
- desc: seem Okay. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, I hope you''ve enjoyed the

    semester. If we'
  persid: ''
- desc: tried something new together,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and thank you for your

    engagement. Thank'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I guess that''s all I have to

    say.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So thank you again for today and

    for this semester, and we''ll see'
  persid: ''
- desc: you here in a week.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s in this room again, yes,

    two o''clock on Thursday the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 17th, yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re free to go. Yes, take

    care everyone.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I''ll be, if you have

    questions, send me an email.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
