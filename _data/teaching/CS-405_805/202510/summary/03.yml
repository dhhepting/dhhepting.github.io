- desc: 'Posting the transcript

    from meeting two, but It''s there'
  persid: ''
- desc: now.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So any existential crises that

    we need to talk about currently'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'getting pbrt installed seems to

    be the common existential'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'crisis. I was able to just get

    it installed on my computer, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm fighting with it. Currently.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can''t download it for

    something. I don''t get it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to restart my computer. I''m

    not allowed to make a C file.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I'm working on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the last two hours trying to

    find what they''re trying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do. Okay? So I noticed you

    responded No to being able to'
  persid: ''
- desc: get it to run on your computer.
  persid: ''
- desc: So probably a key to painter.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ll talk. We will

    eventually, but just print this'
  persid: ''
- desc: minute now. Yeah, okay. Are
  persid: ''
- desc: you okay? All right.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, actually,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I I realized the problem with

    the attendance link, because I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t update my meta

    information for the class. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can''t take your attendance.

    Yeah, you can take attendance,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but his website before use the

    you are courses link'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you go to upcoming events or

    actually class calendar for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today, let''s see that. Yeah,

    that includes attendance here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can go to the activity

    and do attendance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so
  persid: ''
- desc: I was going to make
  persid: ''
- desc: suggestion here at the end,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s import or export

    calendars. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so you can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s like the meetings I cs file

    that I created that you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'update, you can download an i cs

    file for all the class events.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in typical frustrating

    passion, sometimes here Custom'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Range isn''t custom. It''s set to

    be'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's the duration of the course,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, so I think it''s January

    9 to January 14. Yes, not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'September 1, but January 9 to

    January 14 of 26 it''s also a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s also, it''s in the format of

    D month here, yeah, no word use.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m just as a way to make

    things easier to access'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you''re on top of things like

    quizzes and so forth. You might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consider downloading the

    calendar from your courses.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s interesting, it says

    events related to courses. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t say events related to

    this course. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or you could just say all

    events,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes, we will need some work, and

    I spent I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a more time then I would like to

    acknowledge creating the quizzes'
  persid: ''
- desc: before meetings.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And if you remember from 428,

    we''ve talked about keystroke'
  persid: ''
- desc: level models and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'click, click, click, click,

    click, click, click, click,'
  persid: ''
- desc: click, click,
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's not very efficient.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I have to do that many clicks

    for 2625 or 24 quizzes. So you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can tell me if I''ve got them

    right, or there''s some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tweaks I need to make, but I

    think they''re all set up'
  persid: ''
- desc: properly. Knock on wood.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so that''s, that''s the way

    to get the attendance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And other things related to the

    calendar. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not sure. So your name is there

    because of the wiki scheduler.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: that'd be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perfect. Let''s see what else.

    Okay, so the quiz closed at 1pm'
  persid: ''
- desc: i
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so let''s, before we get into

    some other things, let''s,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, let''s talk about Wiki

    pages first,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we'll
  persid: ''
- desc: talk about building PBR, key, v4
  persid: ''
- desc: Then some new things.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I'm going to ask you to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look, start looking at chapter

    two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see if I flip this to the next

    quiz. And I did so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three quizzes out of 24 are set

    up correctly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know everyone''s really impressed

    with that. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so here''s the first

    meeting the wiki.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I tried to get rid of this

    description,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but I was not successful, so

    maybe,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with your permission, I''ll move

    it so that doesn''t come up in'
  persid: ''
- desc: the the
  persid: ''
- desc: top of every screen.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is this helpful to have that

    description there? Okay, I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: leave it if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I guess there are a few more

    opportunities here for links. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so thanks to Laura who started

    the ball rolling here with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contributions to the wiki page.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was curious about pbrt and its

    connection with Maya. I think I'
  persid: ''
- desc: made that note
  persid: ''
- desc: 'personally, and I think I just

    threw it off there because it'
  persid: ''
- desc: was in my notes. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe if there''s a link to go

    with that, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: there are 14 people in class.
  persid: ''
- desc: There are 24 meetings. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if everyone does two, that''s a

    little bit of overlap. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I would invite you to sign up

    for that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: because I will,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will make some notes and count

    it as part of the participation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mark. I''ll give you some

    feedback about'
  persid: ''
- desc: the entries and the
  persid: ''
- desc: so on.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s the manual, Moodle

    manual for the wiki activity and'
  persid: ''
- desc: uh.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Something to note, when you''re

    doing the wiki and you''re trying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to type stuff in the top left

    hand corner of the area that you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can type in, there''s an arrow

    pointing down. Click that and'
  persid: ''
- desc: it'll expand options.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, that''s true for any editor.

    Yeah. Sorry you'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's
  persid: ''
- desc: me. So here's a description of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of creating the first page.

    Well, the first page been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'created. So to add new pages,

    you enclose things in double'
  persid: ''
- desc: brackets.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s the arrow I''m talking

    on the laptop left corner there,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes, because I use the code part

    of it to do something rather'
  persid: ''
- desc: than doing it directly.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can add links, so it''s

    HTML format, so you can add'
  persid: ''
- desc: links by clicking on the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the link button and then

    filling it in.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, if you want to,
  persid: ''
- desc: if you want to add
  persid: ''
- desc: some code, you can,
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so to navigate between pages,

    you have to create your own'
  persid: ''
- desc: hyperlinks. I
  persid: ''
- desc: That's
  persid: ''
- desc: just fancy jazz.
  persid: ''
- desc: Pages. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s the information for

    the wiki.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s go back to the wiki page.

    I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: and let's edit this.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s the arrow the Laura

    was talking about. So you get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lots more things. And then I was

    popping back and forth using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second to last one in the last

    room, yeah. So this is the code'
  persid: ''
- desc: You Do.
  persid: ''
- desc: That should work.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I was thinking of

    putting different text into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'link, but that would not let Me

    match The page I'
  persid: ''
- desc: It's the link in there, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you click on it, like stick

    Your mouse into it, then hit the'
  persid: ''
- desc: break link, do?
  persid: ''
- desc: And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then just there''s a break Link

    button straight there. I should'
  persid: ''
- desc: fix it.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wikis in Moodle are a little

    different, but so the main thing'
  persid: ''
- desc: is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'referencing pages with the name

    of the page inside the two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'brackets. And then if you have

    regular links to include, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: can use the
  persid: ''
- desc: link button in the editor,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s mostly HTML, except for The

    wiki page references. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I started
  persid: ''
- desc: a PBR key page.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so an interesting thing that

    comes up, if you put headings,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is a medium heading, you

    get a Table of Contents.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I did a Google search. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this six minute video, so you

    say we watch this and see if it'
  persid: ''
- desc: gives us any
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how many ads are we going to

    have to go through? Do you think'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: think it's an ad? Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: So idea
  persid: ''
- desc: isn't set up here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Good to show you how
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to install and start using the

    pbrt project. We''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'work with the version number

    three, and we are going to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the installation on Windows. So

    first of all, you have to go to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the repository page. I''m going

    to put the link down in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'description of the video. Then

    we go down here. We copy this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'command, and I''m going to clone

    it on my desktop. You can clone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it wherever you want. And since

    I''m on Windows, remove sign'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it is cloning. Once it''s

    finished, we are going to open'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the project, and we''re going to

    create a new folder, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to name the build for now,

    and we''re going to download the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rest of the things that we need.

    So we need Python. You just have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to go here, and you can download

    the most recent version. And you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need a version three. That''s

    something to have in mind. I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not going to install it because

    I already have it. And also, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need 20 founders download C

    make.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we go to this link right

    here. It''s going to be in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'description as well, and we

    click on this, and we are going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to sell C make. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'once in its own auto we are

    going to click so next except'
  persid: ''
- desc: the terms,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s add C make to the CS path

    for all users, and watch this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video ahead of time, so I''m

    curious what Python too.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, it is a song, and we''re

    going to continue with Visual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Studio. We''re going to download

    the community version because we'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't need
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the other versions, just the

    free one, and we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'install it. Okay, we''re going to

    click on next,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so now we are here, and

    let''s solve just what we need.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We don''t need Asher. We don''t

    need this, this, I''m not that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sure, so I''m going to leave it

    there. But what we need is C'
  persid: ''
- desc: Plus Plus.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Actually, let''s remove that. Net

    is not necessary. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I think that''s, yeah, what

    we most need is C Plus Plus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compilers. So let''s do it like

    that, and here in optional,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s see what we can delete

    this one. We don''t need it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s see if we can make this

    smaller. The thing we don''t need'
  persid: ''
- desc: is, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: I think that's just
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So let''s install it. That''s

    going to take a while. So now we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have it has finished, so we''re

    going to test it 2022'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there is let''s continue with

    our code. Okay, so now we are'
  persid: ''
- desc: there. I'm going to post this,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and now I want to check

    something in help about'
  persid: ''
- desc: Microsoft Visual Studio,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and what I want to see is the

    version, so it''s 17, okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now we are going to go back to

    the build, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the CMD console we on the

    folder build. We are going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use this command, okay, now that

    it''s finished, we are going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'run the following command. Okay,

    now that it''s finished, we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to go to the src folder. Sorry,

    the release one, and here there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is going to be that executable.

    So now let''s see how we can use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this project. So now, in order

    to use it, we need to open a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'command prompt on the release

    folder, and we''re going to type'
  persid: ''
- desc: the following command.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s going to be using the

    pbrt that XC, and we have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give him a scene that is a file

    describing the scene. So I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using the one that is by default

    in the project. Is this one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right here. Scenes and killer

    resemble there is there. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s go back to build so we can

    see the image being generated.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so we enter and now it''s

    rendering. Once it finishes, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will see the image here, and you

    need to open it. I''m using an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'app special to open it, and it''s

    the file viewer clues. I found'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it on the Microsoft Store, and

    it''s free, so I''m using it. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here I can see the image now,

    and there it is. So guys, thanks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for watching. Please Subscribe,

    and I hope that the video helps'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you give us a like, and I will

    try to record the video in a few'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'days in order to install this

    project on Linux. So thanks for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'watching, and bye. In less than

    24 hours, you will have $1,000'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in your account, and then $1,000

    daily for the rest of your'
  persid: ''
- desc: project.
  persid: ''
- desc: Chain
  persid: ''
- desc: reaction,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so my question is, how did

    Google think that was the best'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video to show anyone? Get

    anything out of that video?'
  persid: ''
- desc: You did
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lots of stuff now, because I''m

    doing a wiki this week. Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, Oh, I thought I was like

    You did the first year.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Wait, okay, so I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so which platforms are you

    targeting? Who''s doing Mac?'
  persid: ''
- desc: There's one.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone else with a Mac? I have a

    MAC'
  persid: ''
- desc: MAC. Have you had success?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Have you tried? And what issues

    are coming up. So,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'work in progress, anything?

    Okay?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s an issue of earning C

    make or building it in there'
  persid: ''
- desc: once it's it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It wants you to create a

    separate build directory and'
  persid: ''
- desc: then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go inside And then execute the

    commands I'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see make I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pseudo might be useful is that a

    Windows thing as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Pseudo?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Unless you use the subsystem,

    but that''s different.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if the work in progress doesn''t

    progress,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'post some stuff to the class

    discussion or the wiki, and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: we can resolve it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m making some progress on

    getting the software installed'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the labs,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but there''s no binary installer

    for PBR TV four, so I need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get the build instruction set up

    for Windows 10 or 11,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so they can build and test it

    and put it on to some of the lab'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computers for You. Yeah, so when

    you were demonstrating it in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class, what were you using to

    show the file? I noticed you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used file viewer plus, but it

    looked different than the one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you were Using, yeah. So on the

    GitHub page, it talks about,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so there is a Binary installer.
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a binary installer

    for it, and On the Mac, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'available through home brew.

    Home'
  persid: ''
- desc: Brew,
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, anyone for Linux?
  persid: ''
- desc: One Linux, okay, do windows.
  persid: ''
- desc: So Windows, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m seeing people, okay, people

    who haven''t put their hands up.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What system are you targeting

    for building pbrt? Windows.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Windows. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see.
  persid: ''
- desc: I think we'll say 11 for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that. And windows, 10 or 11,

    we''re 11.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so what''s the problem

    you''re having with downloading?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have no idea why, but it''s

    stuck in 100% download, and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just won''t let me use it. So I''m

    thinking about just, I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know, restarting my computer or

    transferring it from a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'device. I just can''t download

    the file. The weirdest, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weirdest issues I''ve never

    really had that happen before? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just couldn''t download CMake.

    It''s stuck at 100%'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS should be on Windows. You

    should be able to just like, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just gonna turn my computer on

    and off again. I''m working with'
  persid: ''
- desc: version
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with Windows 10. Okay, yeah. Did

    it have any seats? Did it have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any seats? Or, like, default

    seats with so I can''t tell if it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'works. It''s got the stuff the

    files there, you have to build.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It. Not sustainable is getting

    them to build so you can, there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are scenes available if you

    download it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: just not In a scenes folder.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's a repository of i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i So there''s this is the scenes,

    and that''s where I was getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when I was using the software to

    show some images yet last week,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I got from there. So that''s an

    addition'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the PBR to before like GitHub

    page. The guy who has that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'GitHub repository, if you go to

    his like personal profile, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can find this repository. So

    MMP, yes, so that''s not far.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, see, that''s what we''re

    missing. Is it wasn''t clear that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we had to do this download the

    scene separately from the GitHub'
  persid: ''
- desc: stuff. It's not part of that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, my apologies, because I

    didn''t know this existed till'
  persid: ''
- desc: right now. I
  persid: ''
- desc: cancel it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. So if there are questions

    or things that I need to do,'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let me know. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: So the other thing I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a resources page for

    links of source. Notice she'
  persid: ''
- desc: seems to render.
  persid: ''
- desc: But there is a
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was sure I was on this page and

    found'
  persid: ''
- desc: Scene, description, rendering,
  persid: ''
- desc: there.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is A sample Fauci copied

    this and'
  persid: ''
- desc: I select This copy.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Create a File, simple, dot,

    pbrt,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'finish. Should get a an image

    like that out of it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s the file format, v4

    page. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone else besides David find

    that video useful? I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'already been looking at that

    one. I forget what''s going on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's
  persid: ''
- desc: see What. Me.
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So who''s had some success with

    Windows and C make? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So are you talking about Windows

    or Linux? Windows?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So did you have success with

    Linux? I haven''t started on'
  persid: ''
- desc: Linux yet, doing that later.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so tell me about CMake and

    windows. I already got CMake'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'downloaded for a previous

    semesters, like requirements,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we just C make

    everything. But other than that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: you kind of just built it. Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it is, it is particular that you

    do have to have. Was it c plus'
  persid: ''
- desc: plus 17? Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which already now, and I don''t

    know if there''s a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version of C plus plus 17,

    because I haven''t updated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything a while, but I noticed

    that when he checks his Visual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Studio, so you check that

    version 17, he was using CS'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dependent CS as part of that

    video. So it seems like you need'
  persid: ''
- desc: '17. Yeah, I''m not sure that 17

    is the same. You just 20 sets.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It might have been still. It''s

    not the same, 17. So he''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking c plus plus 17. Where

    the video he talked about Visual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Studio 17, so that it doesn''t

    necessarily mean that they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: the same thing. Yeah, do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t think that they are I

    think CS has different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'timelines, yeah, so it''s a

    standard from 2017'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So we''d be up to like 24

    by now. I don''t know when the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last one was set up. But yeah,

    it''s not the most recent studios'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that he brought up. I have

    Visual Studios 19 on my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer, so I think that''s

    where my issue is right now, is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I''m using when I''m trying

    to write CS using the wrong'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version of Visual Studio. So he

    was dealing with, he used 22'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then it''s version 17 on my

    computer. I have version 2019 on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mine, so I''m gonna have to check

    the version on my computer to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see if it''s actually 17, whether

    it''s version 17 or whether it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s why I think his video is

    pretty useful for, like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'troubleshooting his works. So if

    we can just do what he does,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll be good. Yeah. He was also

    dealing with version three of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the Software, no version old.
  persid: ''
- desc: Was I too harsh?
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: is,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when I Googled it, I got the

    same video as a suggestion. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think it''s just the most

    relevant. I just gave a terrible'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people make videos about this.

    We need to make more people make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'videos about combined with dvrt,

    yeah, so maybe that would be an'
  persid: ''
- desc: opportunity you were
  persid: ''
- desc: 'building up Windows 10, right?

    Laura, yes, you were on, I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: right? Laura, yes, there's 10.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who''s got Visual Studio

    installed on their Windows'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer? Does everyone have

    that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? Do Visual Studio. Visual
  persid: ''
- desc: Studio,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'working same with my it''s the

    Visual Studio, so I''m thinking'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's
  persid: ''
- desc: not using the rubber or kind
  persid: ''
- desc: of my
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking I could be trying to

    keep on 17, thinking about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: latest one, like 15 years.
  persid: ''
- desc: I different
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of so on the C make web

    page'
  persid: ''
- desc: can download binaries i
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so have you googled The error

    message that you''re getting. No,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was getting shots before I

    came to come here. Okay, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking it''s probably, I''m

    telling it to you, Visual'
  persid: ''
- desc: Studio.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So David, this if you do C make,

    did you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to download from this

    page? Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, I don''t know. I''ve read

    that happens. It''s stuck at 100%'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, I''m like, maybe I just

    need to restart my computer.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe it''s it restarts every

    night. I don''t know. I actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have no idea why it''s

    downloading correctly, but I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna just try using a different

    device to download it and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transfer it over. Okay, it

    should work. That sounds it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should it sounds like I should

    be having this problem. I''m just'
  persid: ''
- desc: randomly having this problem.
  persid: ''
- desc: Of all things you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you could through source

    available too, if you wanted to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try that anyway. I don''t want to

    make this about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dealing with software, so I

    don''t want to. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think it''s a good

    experience to get the software'
  persid: ''
- desc: running on your computer,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but I don''t want to make it

    about the software, so I''m going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to get, going to continue

    working on getting the thing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'installed in labs. So if you''re

    not able to run it on your own'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer, then you can go to the

    labs and do this. Because we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just, we''re going to focus on

    using the software in'
  persid: ''
- desc: assignments and so forth.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll just say Google your

    error messages, results,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I try that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again. Post results for the

    weekly more'
  persid: ''
- desc: class discussion.
  persid: ''
- desc: The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I didn''t go over the quiz

    from last day, so let''s do that'
  persid: ''
- desc: last few minutes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: So I want you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not a burden to bear

    individually, to do this if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re having problems, it''s not

    anything, pardon me, I said'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re not alone. Yeah, you''re

    not alone, and it''s not a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection on you. So I think

    this is an opportunity to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to develop our community

    interpersonal communication,'
  persid: ''
- desc: skills as computer scientists,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and all those good things. So

    it''s like having a group project'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'without having to do a group

    project.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All the benefits, none of the

    pain. What''s that? Well, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'suppose they''re having a bit of

    Pain.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I getting the softer to install.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you thought so why Lenny was

    an important milestone,'
  persid: ''
- desc: one of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first early adopter of the

    physical based rendering systems'
  persid: ''
- desc: in CS mind, Adam Neil,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the winners are nominated. I

    think it was one short or best'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'short animated, Best Animated

    Short Film, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: and following
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people who watched as a kid that

    were like, watch This. Really'
  persid: ''
- desc: creepy. But like, Oh, my
  persid: ''
- desc: God,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so does Lynn''s law as technology

    advances, rendering time remains'
  persid: ''
- desc: constant. Yes, yes, so I didn't.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I should play. I met Jim Lynn

    at SIGGRAPH once, and he gave me'
  persid: ''
- desc: a ribbon
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that SIGGRAPH they do once you

    get these ribbons in in one tray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of location, someone took a

    picture of me because I had'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ribbons down to the floor.

    Anyway.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I never saw the picture until

    someone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said to me, I''ve got words. So

    they saw the picture somewhere.'
  persid: ''
- desc: But anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: so here's
  persid: ''
- desc: the That makes
  persid: ''
- desc: sense, right? I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how did I phrase the Last

    question you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so my Physically Based Rendering

    important In production'
  persid: ''
- desc: environments,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'improves productivity and like

    efficiency, reflection. Shadows'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and other lighting, quality

    talk,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but like efficiency and like

    productivity, you have to spend'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'less, like, time working on

    like, every single detail and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'every scene can do more of a

    uniform, I guess,'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformation, it seems. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re empowering the artists,

    making their life easier.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And forgot everything that''s

    simulating reality, then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you said the benefit was that

    you could make in your earlier'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'days, you could make lights that

    behave strangely to meet the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need of the scene. Then it took

    the lighting into different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'situation, then it wouldn''t

    work, because the parameters for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the object the materials weren''t

    set to reasonable values.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So provided a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uniformity, so we''re not we''re

    not fitting for always working'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to make the most, the most

    accurate simulation of reality,'
  persid: ''
- desc: then we
  persid: ''
- desc: don't so we don't go wrong.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I have a little link. We''re

    out of time, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t get people trying to

    come into the class before the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last class is over. I get it

    when people come into class,'
  persid: ''
- desc: when the class starting time
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has passed and the previous

    person is still here, well, be'
  persid: ''
- desc: respectful of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fact that some classes ended 10,

    two, not quarter after. Our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particular classes don''t flip

    back quarter after. But there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are other classes, if it was

    only an hour off class, it rents'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'till 20 after. So being aware of

    one class before you end, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: supposed to happen. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, thanks for today,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and let''s keep working on this

    as a group effort.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And we''ll get we''ll get it sort

    of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soon, later in real time. Thanks

    for today. Take care. See you on'
