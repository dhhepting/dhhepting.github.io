- desc: Hello.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re at meeting 20 today, of

    26'
  persid: ''
- desc: any questions or concerns You
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the base color parameter,

    therefore we perform linear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolation between The column

    F zero for dielectrics and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'base color for metals. Using the

    metallic parameter as weight, F'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero equals mix F zero base

    color, metallic. For a metallic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value of zero, we get the

    dielectric F zero. And for a'
  persid: ''
- desc: metallic value we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I want to talk about

    reflection models. So we asked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you look at the First two

    sections of chapter Nine And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in pbrt, where Are reflection

    computations Performed in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this the answer that I was

    Looking for from the Book,'
  persid: ''
- desc: reflection coordinate system you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is So if you find that you''re

    not happy with the way things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'got marked by The system. Let me

    know when I''ll review them. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so why is cosine weighted

    hemisphere sampling useful in'
  persid: ''
- desc: diffuse reflection computations?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Was it because they could be

    directly used? Was that the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer? I wasn''t sure if that''s

    the answer you''re looking for or'
  persid: ''
- desc: not. They could
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also, like, improve the error

    without'
  persid: ''
- desc: additional competition.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. I so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was looking for something Like

    it reduces error without'
  persid: ''
- desc: additional computation so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, so reduces error without

    increased computational cost.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can see in there''s an

    interactive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s, well, it''s not

    interactive so much. There''s one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with and without the cosine

    weighted sampling, and you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see that the one with looks

    better.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s that weird gargoyle

    looking thing. Yes, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How would you describe material

    with the property if you choose'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a point on the surface and

    rotate it around its normal axis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at that point, the distribution

    of light reflected at that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you choose a point on the

    surface and rotate this surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'around its normal access axis at

    that point, distribution of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light reflected at that point

    does not change.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Isotropic, Yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so What''s the other way we could

    describe a surface that doesn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: have that property?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pitch Black. No what the

    distribution would not changed.'
  persid: ''
- desc: There's no lighting. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t know if I''m saying it

    right, but anisotropic'
  persid: ''
- desc: somewhere.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here is an example of an

    isotropic i'
  persid: ''
- desc: So an isotropic surface,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something with a matte paint and

    maybe A black chalkboard. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uh, velvet And the moon surface.

    Yeah. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: another one is Cat size.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So these were things that

    reflected, like right back at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the light or the camera. Was

    that the definite or retro'
  persid: ''
- desc: reflective?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So would a mirror be an example,

    or is that too much scatter? And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not really directed or

    vocal. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: a mirror, just as it is,
  persid: ''
- desc: would be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a different type of reflective

    surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if it''s if it''s a perfect

    Mirror, then, then we''ve got'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the light going off at an angle

    equal to the angle of incidence'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, because it compares to

    these ones, will send the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right back to the surface right

    during rebounding. Is that'
  persid: ''
- desc: correct?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, it''s collecting the

    incoming rays and directing them'
  persid: ''
- desc: back
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can Have like
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflective material or

    reflectors on a bike or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I have a couple videos today.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: that may be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'provide a bit of context for

    some of the other things we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: been discussing. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so part of the part of them

    are implementation, which we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'won''t look at, we''ll just look

    at the theory stuff,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you can let me know if you

    think they''re valuable. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I was looking at
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blin fun reflectance reflection

    model,'
  persid: ''
- desc: because
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now in the section on diffuse

    reflection and talked about'
  persid: ''
- desc: micro facet
  persid: ''
- desc: models.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that was a bit of my thinking,

    but let''s get started on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: videos. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do you look at the gorgeous

    woman? And immediately you think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to yourself, no, this woman is

    out of my league. She''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unattainable. The average middle

    aged man'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'd squared for the radius we

    choose the distance you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there are three simple changes I

    tell all of my arthritis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'patients to make. Number one,

    you have to start drinking more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'water. You wouldn''t believe

    happy, huh?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hello everybody. Welcome to

    shaders monthly. Today we talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the form and bling form

    shading models. Both models are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection models. This means

    they describe mathematically how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light is reflected at an opaque

    surface. Here you see the result'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the shader implementation

    that we will have achieved at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the end of this episode, the

    Fung model was published by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Bucha Fong in 1975 and later

    refined to the blinnfong model'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by Jim Blinn two years later.

    Blinn Fung shading used to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the standard in real time

    graphics for quite a while. For'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example, it was the only model

    available in the OpenGL fixed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function pipeline before the

    introduction of programmable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shaders in 2003 from today''s

    point of view, these models are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quite simple. Consequently, I

    will not only talk about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'form and bling form models in

    this video, but I will present'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these models in a general

    theoretical framework that can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be easily extended to more

    complex reflection models. In'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particular, I will introduce the

    rendering equation and the B'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directional reflection

    distribution function, BRDF,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which are the fundamental tools

    in computer graphics to describe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what happens when light is

    reflected at an opaque surface.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you are not interested in the

    theory, you can jump directly to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the implementation at the end of

    the video. To perform shading,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we need to simulate how light is

    emitted from light sources, how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it interacts with 3d objects

    that are made of different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'materials, and how it is finally

    observed by our eyes or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sensor of a camera and creates

    an image of the world. So what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is light? Light is a quantized

    electromagnetic wave. It is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quantized because it is made of

    particles called photons, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are packets of energy that

    travel as waves to space. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light travels extremely fast,

    with about 300 million meters'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'per second. The wavelength of

    the visible range is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approximately between 380 and

    770 nanometers. Visible light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that is monochromatic, which

    means that it only contains a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'single wavelength, corresponds

    to a speckled color from violet,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'starting at 380 nanometers over

    blue, cyan, green, yellow,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'orange, and ending at Red, is

    770 nanometers. Visible light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just one form of electromagnetic

    radiation. Gamma radiation has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shortest wavelength and

    carries the highest energy per'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'photon. Gamma radiation is

    produced, for example, in a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nuclear explosion. Then we have

    X rays, which also pass through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a material. For example, we all

    know X rays from medical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applications, ultraviolet,

    infrared, microwaves, which we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all know well because they heat

    our food in the microwave oven,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and finally, radio waves with

    the longest wavelengths, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we use for radio and TV

    broadcast and wireless'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'communication, light Sources

    often emit a wide spectrum of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different wavelengths. In

    particular, white light is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'superposition of many

    wavelengths. Here you see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spectral power distribution of

    daylight. This figure shows the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spectrum of the standardized CIE

    Illumina P 65 that can be used'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as a reference for the so called

    White Point, which we will see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'later. So daylight is composed

    out of all these spectral'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors. We can witness this in

    nature when we observe rainbows.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Rainbows are created when rain

    drops split the sunlight into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'its individual spectral colors.

    What happens when light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interacts with objects? Let''s

    assume light is emitted from a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light source in a homogeneous

    medium, such as air. Light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'traveling along straight lines

    through the world. Some light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rays may hit the eye directly.

    Others are reflected from an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object surface towards the eye.

    When a light ray hits the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface, the photons are either

    reflected, transmitted or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'absorbed. The energy of absorbed

    photons is converted into other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forms of energy. Typically, this

    is heat dependent on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material. Photons with certain

    wavelengths are absorbed, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'means that light changes its

    spectrum and consequently its'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perceived color. For example,

    this tea port appears red under'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'white light because most photons

    that are not in the range of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'red spectrum are absorbed. The

    process of reflection can repeat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'many times. In a scene, for

    example, this ray hits the Blue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cup and changes its color

    because of absorption. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'remaining light is reflected and

    hits the red teapot. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spectrum is further reduced at

    this surface, and the remaining'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part is reflected in the

    direction of the eye. If the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light rays reach the eye,

    receptors on the retina are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'activated and an image is formed

    in the brain, there are two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'systems of light sensory cells

    in humans. The first system'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consists of rods that react very

    sensitive to light, but do not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'produce color vision. The second

    system consists of cones, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are the color receptors. There

    are L, M and S cones, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'react to light at long, medium

    and short wavelengths. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diagram shows the curves for

    normalized absorption of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cones over the wavelengths. The

    Center for blue, sensitive s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cones is at 420 nanometers. For

    Green, sensitive M, cones at 534'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nanometers, and for red,

    sensitive L, cones at 564'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nanometers. Because there are

    only three types of cones, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'human visual system cannot

    resolve the real spectral power'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution of light. Instead,

    the true distribution is sampled'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very sparsely by the response of

    the cones. Consequently, human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'observers can be tricked to some

    extent, different spectral power'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distributions can produce the

    same perceived color in low'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light situations, the cones are

    not sensitive enough, and only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rods are working. That is

    why we do not perceive color at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'night, as you have already seen

    in previous episodes of shaders'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'monthly. We typically use the

    RGB color model as the output of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our fragment shaders. This means

    different colors are created by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the additive mixture of three

    primary colors, red, green and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue. So for red, we have the

    weighting factors, 100, which is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first dimension of this

    color space. For Green, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weights are 010, which is the

    second dimension. And for blue,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the weights are 001, which is

    the third dimension. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'additive mixture of red and

    green gives 110, resulting in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yellow. The additive mixture of

    red and blue gives 101,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'resulting in magenta. The

    additive mixture of green and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue gives 011, resulting inside

    if all three weights are equal,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this results in a shade of gray.

    When using arbitrary RGB'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weighting factors in the range

    from zero to one, many different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors can be created. The use

    of three primary colors is to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some extent, motivated by the

    three code types in the human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'visual system. However, until

    now, these RGB weights have no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reconnection to quantitative

    values in the physical world. To'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'establish this connection, we

    have to talk about the CIE RGB'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color space. This color space

    was defined by the CIE in 1931'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and is based on experiments with

    human participants. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participants were shown a target

    color shown on the left here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and had the task to recreate the

    same color perception by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shooting the additive mixture of

    three lines of 700 nanometers,'
  persid: ''
- desc: '541.1 nanometers. And 435.8

    nanometers. So the CIE'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experiments used real, physical

    red, green and blue,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'monochromatic light sources of a

    defined wavelength. The question'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was, if all possible colors

    could be reproduced by additive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mixture of these three lights.

    The experiment showed, yes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three colors are sufficient, but

    some weights had to be negative.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what does this mean? How are

    negative weights created? The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trick is simple. Light can be

    subtracted from the right side'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by adding light to the left

    side. So if the participants use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'additive light on the left side

    to match the two colors. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was counted as a negative

    weight. Here you see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'resulting color matching

    functions for red, green and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue. So for example, if we want

    to create a monochromatic bluish'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sign, spectral color with 480

    nanometers, we have to use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'RGB weights of minus 0.05, for

    red, 0.04 for green and 0.15 for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue. To represent any spectral

    power distribution in the CIE'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'RGB color space, we can multiply

    it with the color matching'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'functions and integrate over the

    complete spectrum. This results'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in three scalar RGB values. So

    the CIE RGB color space defines'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a three dimensional space of all

    perceivable colors. This space'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is visualized here in a special

    two dimension called the CIE'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chromaticity diagram. Here on

    the border, we see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'monochromatic spectral colors

    which enclose the space of all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possible colors. The colors that

    can be created with positive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weights are always in this

    triangle, spared by the three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'primary colors at 700

    nanometers, 546.1'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nanometers and 435.8 nanometers.

    For colors outside of this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle, negative weights must

    be used. Next, we introduce the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sRGB color space, which is

    different from CIE RGB. SRGB is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the current standard for

    monitors, websites and images'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'without an explicit color

    profile. Therefore, if we write'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color values from our fragment

    shader into the frame buffer and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'display the result in a standard

    consumer monitor. The expected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader output is sRGB. The RGB

    values are in the range from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero to one. SRGB uses different

    primary colors. Here you see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color gamut of sRGB.

    Consequently, the range of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'displayable colors is smaller

    compared to CIE RGB, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'standardized CIE illuminant D 65

    defines a white point for sRGB.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Fortunately, we do not lose a

    connection to physical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quantities when using sRGB

    instead of CIE RGB. If gamma'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'correction is performed

    beforehand, there is a linear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation from s RGB to CIE

    RGB. What do I mean by gamma'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'correction? Here you see the

    function to decode a color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'channel from s RGB to

    radiometric linear s RGB values'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the figure, this function is

    plotted as a black curve. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors that you see down here

    are s RGB values. So these color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'steps are linear in s RGB space.

    Interestingly, as you are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'probably watching this video in

    something that is close to s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'RGB, these values should appear

    approximately linear to you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'However, if you measured the

    brightness with the radiometric'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light meter, it would not be

    linear. The reason is that our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'visual perception is not linear.

    The human visual system is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better at distinguishing darker

    intensities than lighter ones,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is considered in CS RGB

    encoding. However, in rendering,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it is important to work in a

    linear space, because otherwise'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we cannot simply add

    contributions from different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light sources. Therefore, it is

    important that we apply gamma'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decoding and encoding in our

    shader. We could use the exact'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function that is denoted here,

    or we can approximate it. In the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'figure, the red curve is a

    simpler gamma decoding function'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which decodes the color value by

    raising it to the power of 2.2'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ok. This concludes what we need

    to know about representing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors in our shader. The main

    take home message is that we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not need to simulate the Light

    Transport for every wavelength.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Computing the Light Transport

    for three primary colors is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sufficient for most

    applications. Next we talk about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rendering equation. The

    rendering equation was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'introduced in a SIGGRAPH paper

    by James Cargill in 1986 this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more than 10 years after the

    form model was published. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering equation describes

    what happens when light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflected at an opaque surface.

    Solving the rendering equation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is very challenging, and many

    different approaches try to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approximate the exact solution.

    As you see on this slide, there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are several terms, such as a

    solid angle, irradiance and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radians, that we need to

    introduce before coming back to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rendering equation, let''s

    start with a solid angle. In'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'school, we all learned about

    angles in a 2d plane. In 2d if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we want to know the angle that

    is covered by an object seen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from a certain point, we place a

    circle around this point and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'project the 2d object onto the

    circle. Then the angle is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defined as the arc length s over

    the radius r of the circle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Although the angle is a

    dimensionless quantity, it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specified in the unit radian.

    Obviously, for unit circle with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a radius of one, we can drop the

    division by the radius for a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'half revolution in the unit

    circle, the arc length is pi,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is in fact, the definition

    of pi. Consequently, for a full'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'revolution in the unit circle,

    the angle is two pi, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equivalent of an angle in 3d

    space is called a solid angle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If we want to know the solid

    angle that is covered by an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object seen from a certain

    point, we place a sphere around'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this point and project a 3d

    object onto the sphere, then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'solid angle is defined as the

    size of the projected area s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'over the radius squared. The

    solid angle is a dimensionless'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quantity, but it is specified in

    the unit steer radian. If we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to compute the solid angle,

    we can split the whole solid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle into infinitesimal solid

    angle pieces denoted by d omega'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here, and integrate over the

    whole domain. One way to solve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this integral is to parameterize

    the solid angle in spherical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates. These coordinates

    are the polar angle, theta and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the other muscle angle, phi, d

    omega is equal to an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'infinitesimal surface patch ds

    over the radius squared. We set'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Radius to one and compute

    the area of a surface patch, ds'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the multiplication of d theta

    and d phi now we see in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'figure that the size of a d phi

    step depends on theta. When'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta equals zero, the

    contribution is zero, and for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta equal to pi over two, the

    contribution is a full D phi'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'step. We can take this into

    account and use a factor sinus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta, to scale the d phi step

    accordingly. Rearranging the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'factors gives a final result of

    the root. Two quick examples, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we want to compute the solid

    angle of an entire sphere, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'integration limits of phi go

    from zero to two pi, and of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta from zero to pi, we can

    solve this interval'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'analytically, and the result is

    a solid angle of four pi. Is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radians. If we do the same for a

    hemisphere, the result is two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pi. Okay, let''s define the other

    terms that we need for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering equation. First we

    have the radial flux, which is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'measure of power. It is equal to

    radian energy per time. The unit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is watt, which is joule per

    second. We can think of it this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way, every photon carries energy

    that is equal to Planck''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constant h times the speed of

    light, C, divided by the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wavelength lambda. So the radian

    flux is the sum of the photon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'energies that are emitted per

    time in graphics. The radian'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'flux can be used as a typical

    parameter for a point light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source that emits light

    uniformly in all directions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Another quantity that is often

    used in graphics is radian'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intensity. It is equal to radian

    flux per solid angle, the unit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is one plus the radian in

    graphics, the radian intensity'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is often used if a light source

    does not radiate equally in all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directions. For example, a

    spotlight, radian intensity is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the sum of the photon energies

    that are emitted per time in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'solid angle, as I have tried to

    illustrate in this figure here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s consider an example that

    relates the two quantities,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gradient flux and radiant

    intensity that we have already'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'introduced. If we have a point

    light that emits light uniformly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in all directions with a certain

    flux, then the radiant intensity'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be computed by dividing the

    total flux by the total solid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle. We know from the previous

    slide that the total solid angle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for a sphere around the point

    light is four pi irradiance. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for a point light, we get

    radiant intensity is equal to'
  persid: ''
- desc: radian flux divided by four pi
  persid: ''
- desc: 'another important quantity is

    irradiance. It is equal to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radian flux per area. In other

    words, irradiance is the sum of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the photon energies that are

    received by a surface per time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and per area. The unit is watt

    per square meter. The received'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'flux can come from all

    directions within the hemisphere'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'above the surface. As an

    example, we compute the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irradiance produced by a point

    light source for this small blue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface, EA of infinitesimal

    size, irradiance is flux per'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'area. We know the total amount

    of flux that is emitted by the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point light in all directions,

    but how much of this flux is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'received by the blue surface?

    Well, we have already computed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rated intensity, which was

    flux per solid angle. We put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this result in the equation for

    the irradiance. Now we need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compute the solid angle. The

    solid angle d omega is equal to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the projected area, ds divided

    by radius squared. For the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radius, we choose the distance

    from the blue surface to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point light, then we don''t have

    to project the surface onto the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sphere, at least not if we

    assume that it is of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'infinitesimal size, but we have

    to consider that the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'area that is seen from the

    direction of the point light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'appears shorter if theta is the

    angle between the surface normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the incident light

    direction. Then the required'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'foreshortening factor is cosine

    theta. This means, if the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incident light direction is

    perpendicular to the surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta is zero, cosine theta is

    one and the visible area is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'largest. But if the light comes

    from the side, we have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consider the cosine theta for

    shortening factor. If we put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this result into the equation

    for the irradiance, we see that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the factor DA is canceled the

    irradiance caused by a point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light is the radiant intensity

    of the light times cosine theta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'divided by the squared distance

    between the surface and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light. In the case of a point

    light, we can further replace'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the radiant intensity with the

    radiant flux divided by four pi,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as we have computed in the last

    example. To summarize this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'result, firstly, the irradiance

    caused by a point light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decreases quadratically with

    distance. Secondly, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irradiance is largest for a

    light direction perpendicular to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the surface, and decreases with

    the cosine of the angle of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incidence. The last quantity

    that we need for the rendering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation is radians. If we

    observe a surface patch and want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to measure its brightness, we

    are not interested in the total'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'flux per area, but only in the

    fraction that is going in a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'certain direction. For example,

    we are only interested in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part that is going in the

    direction of our eye or camera.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we are interested in the flux

    per area per solid angle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'However, when we say area here,

    we mean the area in flux'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction. If a surface area is

    not oriented in flux direction.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Its contribution in terms of

    area, is smaller. We have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiply the surface area with

    cosine theta to get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contributing area in the flux

    direction. Radians is flux per'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'solid angle per projected area.

    An important property of radians'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is that it does not change with

    viewing distance, at least if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do not consider participating

    media such as fog or smoke. When'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we move a camera or our eye

    towards the surface, the solid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle per pixel gets larger. But

    on the other hand, the area that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we observe per pixel gets

    smaller. These two effects'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cancel each other out, and the

    radiance does not change. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is something that we observe

    also in our everyday lives.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s say we look at a wall and

    move towards it, then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'brightness does not change. How

    can we compute the irradiance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'produced by incoming radians?

    Irradiance is flux per area. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'received flux can come from all

    directions within the hemisphere'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'above the surface. Radians is

    flux per solid angle per'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'projected area. If we put the

    definition of irradiance in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation, we get radians is

    equal to de over D, omega times'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cosine, theta. Rearranging the

    equation gives de is equal to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radians times cosine, theta

    times d, omega. De is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contribution to the irradiance

    by the radians received from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'certain solid angle, D, omega.

    To compute the complete'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irradiance, E, we have to

    integrate over the hemisphere.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The irradiance for the surface

    patch is given by the integral'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'over the incoming radians, l

    times cosine theta, where theta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the angle of incidence. Let''s

    remember this result and go back'
  persid: ''
- desc: to the rendering equation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The rendering equation

    calculates the outgoing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radiance, l, o, in the direction

    v, for surface patch at location'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'X with normal n, the outgoing

    radiance is the sum of two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'terms. The first term is the

    emitted radiance, L, E in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction v. This term is only

    larger than zero if the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a light source that produces

    radian flux itself, the second'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'term is integral over the

    hemisphere. It is integrating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'over the contributions of all

    incoming radiances, Li from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hemisphere above the surface

    patch each incoming radiance Li'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from direction l generates an

    irradiance contribution. De This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the same relationship between

    radians and the resulting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irradiance contribution that we

    have discussed a moment ago on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the previous slide. Again, we

    have the cosine theta factor,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where theta is the angle between

    the surface normal and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction of the incoming

    radians. Consequently, radians'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the larger angle theta

    contributes less to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irradiance of the surface patch.

    Each infinitesimal irradiance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contribution de is now

    multiplied with the BRDF, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is shown for B directional

    reflection distribution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function. This is a function

    that describes the material'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'property of the surface patch.

    It defines how much radiance is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'emitted by the patch in

    direction v, if it receives an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irradiance contribution from

    direction L. Of course, the vrdf'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the radiance values are also

    dependent on the wavelengths, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have to evaluate the

    rendering equation for each one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of our three RGB primary colors.

    The rendering equation describes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the full light transport in a,

    c. This means that an outgoing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radiance, l, o of a surface

    patch contributes this radians'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as incoming radiance, Li and

    another surface patch. So all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface patches in the scene are

    connected via the radians. They'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are contributing to each other.

    This is why the rendering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation is very hard to solve.

    In practice, the BRDF describes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the angle dependent spectral

    reflection factor for a surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the ratio of the outgoing

    radians, lo and the incoming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irradiance, E, both the incoming

    direction L and outgoing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction d could be

    parameterized with spherical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates, theta and phi.

    Consequently, the BRDF is a four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dimensional function, if you do

    not consider the dependency on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the wavelength by specifying

    this 40 function, the reflection'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'properties of a surface are

    described precisely. The BRDF of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a material could be measured and

    stored in a 40 table. However,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this would require a significant

    amount of memory. Furthermore,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we cannot edit materials easily

    with such a representation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Consequently, for most cases,

    parametric BRDF models are used.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'For example, the form model and

    the bling form model, which we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to implement today in our

    shaders, are parametric BRDF'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'models. Here you see different

    materials. The metal material on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the left is almost a perfect

    mirror. For such a material, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle of incidence is equal to

    the angle of reflection for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second metal sphere, the

    material is not perfectly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smooth. For such a material, we

    assume that there is some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'variation in the orientation of

    the micro facets in graphics,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the term micro facets is used

    for tiny surface patches that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are much smaller than a pixel.

    Each micro facet behaves like a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perfect mirror. It is assumed

    that the orientation of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'micro facets follow some

    distribution around the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'macroscopic surface normal so

    statistically, these small'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'variations in orientation cause

    the reflected light to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distributed around the

    macroscopic reflection'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction, if the roughness of

    the surface increases, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattering of light around the

    reflection direction becomes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'larger. For metals, photons are

    either reflected or they enter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the material and are absorbed.

    This is dependent on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wavelength, therefore, the

    reflected light might be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colored. Examples are copper or

    gold. The behavior that I have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just described is true for

    metals, for dielectric'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'materials, the reflection model

    is a bit different as for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'metals, a certain fraction of

    photons are reflected at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface, and we call this part

    the specular reflection. For'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dielectric materials, the

    specular reflection does not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'depend on the wavelengths, so it

    is not colored. Photons that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not reflected enter the material

    here, they are either absorbed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or they are scattered in random

    directions below the surface. At'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some point, they might come out

    of the surface again and exit in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'random directions. We call this

    part the diffuse reflection. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diffuse reflection depends on

    the wavelength and consequently'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is colored for dielectrics.

    Okay. Now we are ready for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'form BRDF. The form BRDF has two

    parts, one for diffuse and one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for specular reflection. The

    Diffuse part is a simple'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constant denoted by KD. It does

    not depend on the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction L or the view

    direction v. Note that the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction L is defined to go

    towards the light. So the yellow'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'arrow that goes from the light

    towards the surface is minus l.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In this figure, the reflected

    direction R has the same angle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the surface normal n as the

    light direction. So if I change'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the light direction here, the

    reflection direction changes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accordingly. The specular part

    is a dot product of the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction v and the reflection

    direction r, raised to the power'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of NS and weighted with a

    constant Ks. If I increase Ks,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here you see that the specular

    part is appearing as a lobe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'around the reflected direction,

    the dot product of the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction v and the reflection

    direction r is equal to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cosine of the angle between

    these vectors. If the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction matches the reflection

    direction, the contribution of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the specular lobe is largest and

    reduces when the angle gets'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'larger, the exponent NS controls

    the fall off of the specular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lobe. For a higher exponent, the

    fall off is faster, as we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learned. A higher exponent

    corresponds to a smoother'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface. The exponent Ns is

    typically referred to as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shininess. Okay, great. Let''s

    implement the form blef, as we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have seen, the exact evaluation

    of the rendering equation is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'difficult in computationally

    demanding the equation becomes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much simpler if the light

    exchange between surfaces is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neglected and only the so called

    direct light is taken into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'account, which is emitted from a

    number of light sources. For'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each light source, we compute

    the irradiance and multiply it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the BRDF. Then we can sum

    up the individual light source'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contributions. Or if the emitted

    light is zero and we have only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one light, we simply have

    outgoing radians equals the BRDF'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplied with the irradiance.

    Let''s put in the form BRDF and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the irradiance of a point light,

    the cosine theta term can be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'replaced with the dot product of

    the light direction and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface normal. Our

    implementation starts from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'total stock example from episode

    number three. The link is'

    underlying theory. In a tutorial'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'presented at C graph in 2012

    brand Burley, who works for Walt'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Disney Animation Studios,

    presented a user friendly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interface to the micro facet,

    BRDF. In this interface, all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameters are in the interval

    from zero to one. This approach'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a current de facto industry

    standard to represent a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material, and is known as the

    metallic roughness workflow. As'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the name suggests, the two most

    important parameters are the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'metallic and the roughness

    parameters for metals such as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gold, silver, copper and so on.

    The metallic parameter is one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for dielectric materials, which

    are also called non metals, such'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as plastic, wood and rubber. The

    metallic parameter is zero. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'roughness parameter controls the

    distribution of the orientations'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the micro facets. The micro

    facets are not real geometry,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but are only evaluated

    statistically. In the micro'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'facet model, each tiny micro

    facet surface behaves like a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perfect mirror for very smooth

    polished surfaces, the roughness'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is zero. All micro facets point

    in the same direction, and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material behaves like a perfect

    mirror. If the roughness'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameter is increased, the

    orientations of the micro facets'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are more random, and light is

    collected from larger range of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incoming light directions in

    Disney''s model, the metallic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameter could also be set to a

    fractional value, for example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: '0.5 This would mean that the

    material behaves with 50% like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'metal and with the other 50%

    like a dielectric material,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is physically not

    plausible. Therefore we should'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not use values other than zero

    and one for the metallic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameter. If we stay within the

    physical world, it is much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'easier to produce a realistic

    material that works well in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different lighting conditions.

    However, in textures or mid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maps, the resolution is limited,

    and we might have a mix of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'materials within a single pixel.

    In these situations, a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fractional value for the

    metallic parameter makes perfect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sense. Another parameter is

    called base color. It is an RGB'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector for dielectrics. It

    contains the RGB values for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'albedo, which is the amount of

    diffuse reflection in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interval from zero to one for

    metal this parameter contains'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the RGB values for the Fresnel

    reflectance, which we have not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talked about yet, but it will be

    introduced in a minute. Then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there is an additional parameter

    called reflectance, which is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used only for die electrics. It

    also contains a Fresnel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflectance, but this time for

    dielectric materials. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameter is called specular in

    Disney''s original tutorial'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'notes. But I like the name

    reflectance much more. Whatever'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it is called, the parameter,

    controls the amount of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dielectric specular reflection.

    In contrast to metals, for which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the specular reflection at a

    perpendicular incident angle can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reach up to 100% for die

    electrics, it is much less. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ranges approximately from zero

    to 16% the quadratic remapping'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function is used to map zero to

    16% to a user friendly interval'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from zero to one. These very few

    parameters are sufficient to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'control our basic micro facet.

    BRDF, Disney''s full model has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'several other parameters for

    subsurface scattering, an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'additional clear coat layer and

    other advanced features that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are not discussing today. Now

    let''s dive more deeply into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theory. Our microface BRDF is

    used in combination with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering equation. As a

    refresher, here is a slide from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'episode number four. The

    rendering equation calculates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the outgoing radians, l, o, in

    the direction v, for surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'patch application x, with normal

    n, the outgoing radiance is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sum of two terms. The first term

    is the emitted radiance, l, e,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the direction v. This term is

    only larger than zero. As a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface is a light source that

    produces some radian flux'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'itself. The second term is the

    integral over the complete solid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle of the hemisphere above

    the surface. We integrate over'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the contributions from all

    incoming radiances, Li from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hemisphere above the surface.

    Patch each incoming radiance, Li'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from direction l generates an

    irradiance contribution de, each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'infinitesimal irradiance

    contribution de, is multiplied'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the BRDF, which is short for

    V directional reflection'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution function. The BRDF

    defines how much radiance is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'emitted by the surface patch in

    direction v, if it receives an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irradiance contribution from

    direction L. This way the BRDF'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'describes the material

    properties of the surface patch.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is where we need to insert

    the microface BRDF that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussed today. Here you see

    the equation for the complete'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'BRDF. A quick introduction of

    the use notation before we talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about it, V is the outgoing view

    direction. L is the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction it points from the

    surface location towards the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lot. Consequently, minus L is

    the incoming vector from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light to the surface. N is the

    surface normal. H is the halfway'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector. It has a unit vector at

    the half angle between the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the light direction. The

    vrdf is a function of the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the light direction. It has

    a diffuse part and a specular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part. The constant diffuse part,

    rho, d, divided by pi, is known'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the normalized form vrdf

    that we have introduced in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'episode number four. For the

    specular part, we use the cook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tolerance microfacet model, the

    cook Torres microface model has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three terms, Fresnel

    reflectance, the normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution function and the

    geometry term. We will introduce'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these terms one by one in the

    following slides. Let''s start'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with Pranav reflectance. Here

    you see the image of a swimming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pool with a very flat water

    surface. In the bottom part of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the image, we can see the ground

    of the pool, but here in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'upper part, we don''t see the

    ground, but only the reflected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sky. Why do we observe this

    effect? The effect occurs'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because the ratio of transmitted

    and reflected light is not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constant. It depends on the

    angle of incidence and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refractive indices of the

    involved materials. If we look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the water from above, only

    a small part of the light from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the sky is reflected in our view

    direction at the water surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'most of the light is transmitted

    and we see the ground of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pool, the more we look from the

    side and observe the surface at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'increasingly grazing angles, the

    larger becomes the reflected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part, the more light is

    reflected, the less light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transmitted. The setup is

    illustrated in this figure. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the interface between two

    materials with two different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'indices of refraction, eta one

    and eta two. In the swimming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pool example, we observed the

    interface between water and air'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because water is an optically

    denser medium than air, its'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'index of refraction is larger.

    The angle of incidence of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light is defined relative to the

    surface normal, and is denoted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by theta one here for a

    perfectly flat surface, the law'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of reflection tells us that the

    reflected direction has the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle as the incoming Ray.

    Therefore this angle here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between the normal and the

    reflected direction is equal to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta one as well. Let''s have a

    look at the angle of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transmitted ray, theta two,

    during the transition of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light from an optically thinner

    to an optically denser medium,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the light ray deviates towards

    the normal consequently, theta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two is smaller than theta one

    for such a situation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mathematically, the relationship

    between the angle of incidence'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta one and the angle of the

    transmitted ray. Theta two is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'given by Snells law, eta one

    times sine of theta equals eta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two times sine of theta two.

    Given eta one, eta two and theta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, we can solve for theta two.

    With theta two, we can compute'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fraction of the light that

    is reflected using the Fresnel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation shown here, the

    transmitted fraction is then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'given by one minus the reflected

    part.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s look at Fresnel reflection

    for dielectrics light photons'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are either reflected,

    transmitted or absorbed with an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle dependent relative

    frequency. The reflected part is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattered on the micro face.

    Macroscopically, this creates a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specular part of the reflection

    in opaque materials, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transmitted part is randomly

    deflected below the surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'partially absorbed and emitted

    into random directions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Macroscopically, this creates a

    diffuse part of the reflection.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The more light is reflected, the

    less light is transmitted, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the diffused part becomes

    smaller. The likelihood of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'absorption inside the medium is

    wavelength dependent. Therefore'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the diffuse part is colored and

    the specular part is not. For'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'metals, the complete transmitted

    fraction is absorbed. This means'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there is no diffuse reflection.

    For metals, the reflected part'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'depends on the wavelength, so

    the specular part is covered. On'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this slide, we see the index of

    refraction for several'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dielectric materials. The table

    also contains the F zero values'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in percent. F zero is a

    reflectance for perpendicular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incidence of light when the

    incident angle, theta one is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equal to zero. If you insert

    theta one equals zero into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Fresnel equations, all the

    cosine terms evaluate into one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the equations become much

    simpler, as you see here. If we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then put in 1.0 for eta one for

    vacuum or air, and set eta two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to 1.5 for glass, we can compute

    a value of 4% for F zero. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'means that at the transition

    from air to glass at normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incidence, only 4% of the light

    is reflected and 96% is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transmitted. On this slide, we

    have listed the F zero values'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for several metals as discussed.

    These are wavelengths dependent.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have three values for the

    red, green and blue channel in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first column, the

    reflectance values are given in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'linear space, which we can use

    directly in our shader code. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second column gives the

    corresponding sRGB values, as we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have discussed in episode number

    four, it is important to perform'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gamma correction when we convert

    between these two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'representations, when we want to

    apply the Fresnel reflectance in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the context of the micro facet

    model, we need to be careful'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which angle we use for theta one

    for a perfectly flat surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta one is the angle between

    the incident light direction and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the normal of the surface, or

    because of the law of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection, theta one is also

    The angle between the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction and the surface

    normal. However, in the micro'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'facet model, we assume that the

    surface is built from tiny'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface patches that are much

    smaller than an output pixel.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Each micro facet behaves like a

    perfectly flat mirror surface.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This means we only get a light

    contribution in the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction if the normal of the

    micro facet is pointing exactly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the direction of the

    macroscopic half wave vector.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Consequently, the Fresnel

    reflectance must be computed for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those micro facets which have

    the macroscopic halfway vector'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as surface normals. Therefore,

    for the micro facet model, theta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one is the angle between the

    incident light direction and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'macroscopic halfway vector, or

    because of the law of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection, the same angle can

    be found between the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction and the macroscopic

    halfway vector in the paper by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cook and Torres from 1981 the

    Fresnel reflectance for eta one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equals one is calculated by the

    shown equations. We see that the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scalar product of the view

    direction and the macroscopic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'half wave vector is used. Though

    these equations do not use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trigonometric functions like

    sine or cosine. They are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nevertheless computationally

    expensive. Therefore the faster'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Schlick approximation is used in

    many implementations. The figure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shows a comparison between

    schliep s approximation and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'true equations for glass, for

    theta, one equals zero, we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: '4% reflectance at a grazing

    angle of incidence of 90'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'degrees. The reflectance is 100%

    we see that the approximation is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not perfect for the in between

    angles, but it follows the true'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graph reasonably well. This was

    the Fresnel reflectance term.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The next term is a normal

    distribution function. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution of the micro faced

    normals changes depending on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'roughness of the surface. For a

    perfectly smooth, polished'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface, all the micro facet

    normals point in the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction as a macroscopic

    normal. For a rougher surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the micro facet model assumes

    that the orientations of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'micro facets follow some

    distribution around the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'macroscopic surface normal. So

    statistically, these small'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'variations in orientation cause

    a reflected light to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distributed around the

    macroscopic reflection'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction. If the roughness of

    the surface increases, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattering of light around the

    reflection direction becomes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'larger. There are several

    suggestions for the normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution function in the

    literature, all three options'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are shown here are

    parameterized by alpha, where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'alpha is equal to Rp squared and

    RP is our user friendly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perceived roughness value in the

    interval from zero to one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Furthermore, we see that all

    three options for the normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution function depend on

    the scalar product of the normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the halfway vector, which we

    have also used for the specular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lobe in the blend form model in

    episode number four. In the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'figure on the right, we compare

    the three options for the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'roughness value. The x axis

    represents the angle between the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normal and the halfway vector.
