- desc: 'So we''re going to talk

    about shapes today'
  persid: ''
- desc: and fractals, I guess So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'oh, okay. So who''s familiar with

    fractals?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, what are some properties

    of Practice? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s one I''m a property that

    is important for our discussion'
  persid: ''
- desc: today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now this is the point where I

    see where there drew the right'
  persid: ''
- desc: Number of blanks. T I
  persid: ''
- desc: P, no, s, thoughts, CS,
  persid: ''
- desc: I said, M Right, yeah, yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: L, M, say, f Oh, wait,
  persid: ''
- desc: self similarity, do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t have any prizes, sorry,

    maybe I''ll have confidence right'
  persid: ''
- desc: now. Anyway, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is they wouldn''t

    heard of the SIP ski gasket, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'SIP in ski triangle. So Benoit

    Mandelbrot called the Sierpinski'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gasket as a joke, because a

    gasket is supposed to seal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things, and the Sierpinski

    gasket is full of holes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s my interpretation, he

    told he said that it was a joke,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but he didn''t I filled into the

    details or the rationale or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reason, certainly the way we

    constructed is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contained. Take an E collateral

    triangle, and then we take the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whole triangle, and we make

    three smaller copies, scale by a'
  persid: ''
- desc: half and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so we translate towards The

    vertices. So that''s the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: stage, and then the
  persid: ''
- desc: And then, 012,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's a different shape And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can see the relationship

    here. So the third stage, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'taking three copies of the

    second stage and putting them in'
  persid: ''
- desc: into the spots here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So self similarity is a property

    of nature of many natural'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'objects. So when I generate

    fractals on my computer, after a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'few minutes out, or maybe a few

    seconds out, comes up and puts a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'leaf on the image and it says,

    Well, this is a maple or comes a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'few different clients. Does that

    make sense in terms of'
  persid: ''
- desc: construction? In
  persid: ''
- desc: fact, it's,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a kind of patterns and that

    repeat itself in a small and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'small Yeah? So we can, we can

    keep going with this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'until our graphical fidelity of

    our screen doesn''t show anything'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anymore. Yeah. I Yeah, as soon

    as you get smaller than a pixel,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can do this construction.

    Take the triangles you can Take'
  persid: ''
- desc: you can.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, So You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can go from the top down,

    or we can think of concatenating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation matrices, because

    we can have a matrix for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each of these two

    transformations, so we scale by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'half, and this one, if it''s at

    zero and I don''t need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translate. But here we''re

    translating to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero, and this one, we''re

    translating to point 5.866,'
  persid: ''
- desc: point 866,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's, that's,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s approximately e

    collateral triangle. Or we could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'center it at the center of the

    triangle, and then this would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: point, 5433, 433,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not quite right, that''ll be

    here anyway.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can have a matrix to describe

    the different transformations,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can multiply them

    out, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can create strings of

    transformation so that the net'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'effect of them are going To be

    producing pixel size points.'
  persid: ''
- desc: That makes sense. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so We Get the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a way to think about the

    shape the fractal that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generated is The collection of

    fixed points of all these'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformations and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS. So when we create a

    transformation matrices, We can'
  persid: ''
- desc: we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so The weight, so we first want

    to Move. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we think of if we''re applying

    transformation this point,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translate point, the origin,

    apply the transformation, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scaling, the rotation and the

    shear, and then translate back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the origin to the center.

    So that gives us'
  persid: ''
- desc: so If we apply matrix zero and
  persid: ''
- desc: I guess So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the matrix that''s three times

    matrix zero, and we apply it to'
  persid: ''
- desc: the fixed point at 00, what?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What point am I going to are we

    going To get out? Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we''re multiplying the

    transformations out. So this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'm zero applied once, this is m

    zero applied twice. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is m zero applied three

    times.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we, if we transform the

    point 00 with this, because it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fixed point of this

    transformation matrix, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to get 00 out again,

    because we''re applying The same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation. So for each of

    these transformations, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equations, they have the fixed

    point at zero at the origin. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: the m zero is
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're just scaling by a Half.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how do we know when to stop

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: concatenated transformations.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what happens, let''s, let''s

    look at This matrix. Let''s do'
  persid: ''
- desc: some matrix multiplication. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s do this one first so we

    get two levels. So point five'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'times, point five is point two

    five and'
  persid: ''
- desc: The rest
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rests. The rest of them are

    zeros and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we apply point five,

    the matrix again, to this one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: which is a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then point five times point

    two Five is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense? So what do

    we notice about the progression'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of of the matrices? Yeah, so an

    important property I didn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mention is that the

    transformations have to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: contractive, so they converge to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to a fixed set of points. So

    let''s say we have, we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to go, we have.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You want to do a square image

    from Zero to One in x'
  persid: ''
- desc: and in y and
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what other information do we

    Need to know when to stop our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'recursion or our concat

    composition of Tran of'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformation matrices.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That was the sentence. Did you

    mean, like, if you mean how to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stop the recursion. You just got

    to send in how many depth you'
  persid: ''
- desc: want?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So how do we determine the

    depths of we want? Really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'depends on how many generations

    you want. So at the beginning,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if I say I wanted one, I would

    send in the second image you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have there. So generation one.

    So then you send in one, and you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subtract that one, and when you

    send it in a final time, it''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be like if it''s greater than if

    depth is greater than zero,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll keep going, and then if

    not, we''ll draw, draw whatever'
  persid: ''
- desc: we have currently.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, okay, but going with the

    idea that we do, we want to make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a pixel sized shape, or dealing

    with a pixel size shape from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each of these strings of

    transformation. So how so this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the space, the world space

    we''re dealing with.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But what about the resolution

    we''re going to create in our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image. So if we say 1024 by 1024

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we want to have the number of

    levels such that this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contraction factor is Less than

    or is approximately equal to'
  persid: ''
- desc: This size and
  persid: ''
- desc: so compose until I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to start with,

    say this is the size that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'starting With, so we have a

    width of one, and then after we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'apply one transformation, it''s

    point Five, and apply another'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation, It''s point two,

    five and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we take that the size of our

    rural space, and then we use a'
  persid: ''
- desc: way to estimate the size of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so The transformation is going

    to end up to produce a a point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is a pixel size. Does that

    make sense? Can you hear me in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the back? Okay, my tailing off,

    trailing off a little bit. I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try and keep the volume up.

    Okay, so then that brings us to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the assignment to reimagine the

    desktop tetrahedron. So let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: see if I Can.
  persid: ''
- desc: Chapter is honest. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I hope I''m curious why it''s

    taking so long. Been quicker'
  persid: ''
- desc: before
  persid: ''
- desc: minutes i entertainable.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I Okay, so Here are three

    spheres.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Corresponds
  persid: ''
- desc: to gasket, example, So
  persid: ''
- desc: just a little better. Okay, so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m using Object

    instantiation here. So I made a'
  persid: ''
- desc: base object. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i So I called it the object

    base, and then inside the object'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'definition, I say attribute

    begin. So that gives me so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because I''m putting the

    attribute begin and ends in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here, that I''m doing a

    transformation, not to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'current one, but starting from a

    fresh'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so another other languages might

    do push and pop, so it saves the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'state anyway. So then I''m not if

    I, if I don''t separate them with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the attribute begin and ends,

    then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the third, the third sphere,

    would be point five times point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five times point five. So be

    point 125, and not, if that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'makes sense. So I''m, so I define

    this base object. Here''s that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s the example of it. So

    I''m starting with the I''m just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'letting it be unit sphere of

    diffuse material.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I have three spheres. I have

    an object, then object end. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then to use the object, I See

    object instance And then base I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so do You see what I''ve done

    here?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m doing a translation of

    the base object, first scaling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by one half in all directions,

    and then doing a translation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scaling. And then the third one

    is scale,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and translate and scaled as

    well. So what is, what do you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think the output of this, this

    description, C, description will'
  persid: ''
- desc: be gasket. I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any ideas how many spheres are

    Going to see light?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Nine. Yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: now, how do I get to 27 Copy
  persid: ''
- desc: when you did there?
  persid: ''
- desc: Thinking, versus for me, part.
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's make a new object. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it should be the same image

    that we just had.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, can't Do that. I
  persid: ''
- desc: see, how Do we Start? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, what''s going to be The

    impact of that'
  persid: ''
- desc: change? I
  persid: ''
- desc: i guess 27
  persid: ''
- desc: let's See if I correct. Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I still have nine spheres,

    because I''m transforming the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three spheres. I transformed the

    three spheres three times. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now I have to fill in The

    transformations to Make the'
  persid: ''
- desc: Other I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It seems like a lot of mass on

    the board and maybe should be'
  persid: ''
- desc: nice On the Part I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, I offline. So what? What

    do we want to do?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So you want
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one three spheres here, three

    spheres there, three spheres'
  persid: ''
- desc: here, three spheres here. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And in each of these places. So

    what? 123456789, times, Three is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 27, So
  persid: ''
- desc: I Skip there.
  persid: ''
- desc: I and it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making little stars on the

    insides, which is pretty'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cool, that one section you

    completed, It makes a new shape'
  persid: ''
- desc: You saw
  persid: ''
- desc: You. Yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: so There's only
  persid: ''
- desc: a few spheres short here, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so We have 18, so I see what''s

    happening. You shared the base'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the bottom triangles with the

    top triangles.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the middle one, too should

    not. So you have it so that the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'middle like the bottom quadrant,

    if you look at those three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles, that is correct. The

    rest of it is not. So if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just, if you move everything

    over and upward, and you have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a second copy of the bottom

    left three triangles, and then a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'third copy on top, and that''s

    what you''re aiming for. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''ll be a big hole in the

    middle, as you would expect, on'
  persid: ''
- desc: a seconds. Keep Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, I''m i I''ll give you this

    file. You can work on it, if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like. But this is the idea

    behind constructing a model of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tetrahedron. So this is one way

    to do it, maybe a little bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tedious in a way to do it. So

    imagine a way is to compute'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation, compute the

    final transformations, thinking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about what kind of resolution

    you want. And then you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specify the transformation

    matrix as the input.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In the same description you can

    do it you can specify the 16'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coefficients of the matrix, and

    doing a transformation That way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gives you it starts with a fresh

    current transformation matrix,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you''re not concatenating

    them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there are places online to

    find the coordinates of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertices of the tetrahedron, and

    you can construct transformation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrices like this, like we''ve

    done Here. I''ll fix that up. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: realize I haven't I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have anyway. So this is for

    students, a little demo of how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do things, fractal shapes in

    pbrt, fill similar shapes. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll fix that up, and I''ll send

    it to you. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re out and so time. But I

    wanted to ask, what are two ways'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to describe common forms for

    describing shapes?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there was implicit, yeah,

    everything was parabolic,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'separate, parametric,

    parametric,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, good,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so how about we end there.

    I''ll fix this file up for you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe I''ll do a version with

    transformation matrices in it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay? Does that sound all right?

    Thank you for today. Have a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: weekend.
  persid: ''
- desc: See you on Tuesday.
