- desc: 'So Did everyone see The

    grade scope? Email? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is what it looks like. So

    it''ll have a link to view your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graded work, and it''ll Be from

    no reply@gradescope.com'
  persid: ''
- desc: so what Is sRGB?
  persid: ''
- desc: Stand it up in I
  persid: ''
- desc: Five in the 1990s I
  persid: ''
- desc: so it was defined in the 90s
  persid: ''
- desc: so that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''d Have a standard

    representation of colors on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: web and
  persid: ''
- desc: this is a color space.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what about a gannet? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is? What do we mean? We''re

    talking about a color gamut for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so gamut is just means, like a

    range. So when we see out of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gamut, it just means something''s

    outside the range. So in our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'case, the color space, so if

    it''s not represented in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color space, it would be out of

    gamut. Yeah, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how do we define the gamut

    for an RGB color space'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would that just be considered

    the zero to one or the zero to'
  persid: ''
- desc: '255, depending on like, which

    version you''re doing or and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything above those numbers

    would be considered, I Guess,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out of gamut, or they get

    truncated normally.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So the zero to 255
  persid: ''
- desc: talk about
  persid: ''
- desc: zero to full
  persid: ''
- desc: color? Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so typically, we''re defining a

    gamut,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the tri stimulus

    theory of colors, so we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represent colors based on red,

    green and Blue, and the gamut is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defined by the particular

    chromaticity of those three'
  persid: ''
- desc: colors.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can make
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all the point. All the colors

    inside the triangle can be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represented by the sRGB color

    space.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how does the gamut for sRGB

    compare to other gamuts we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looked at and that are available

    now,'
  persid: ''
- desc: bigger or smaller?
  persid: ''
- desc: Bigger?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, I remember the diagram. I

    just don''t remember which was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'labeled what? There''s just one

    that was bigger than all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: rest, though. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'SR should be as the smallest

    gamut in That picture you'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does That makes sense. You.
  persid: ''
- desc: No. Sorry about That. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s the section of the

    book'
  persid: ''
- desc: from which this question came.
  persid: ''
- desc: So in pbrt, we assume that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the geometric, geometric optics

    is adequate model for late'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattering. So we have linear,

    linearity, okay. Linear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'linearity, combined effect of

    two inputs an optical system is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'always equal to the sum of the

    effects of each input'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'individually. Energy

    Conservation, when light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scatters from a surface or

    participating media, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattering event can never

    produce more energy than it'
  persid: ''
- desc: started With no polarization,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no fluorescence or

    phosphorescence and steady'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'state. So the environment is

    assumed to have reached'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equilibrium, so the distribution

    of radiance is not changing over'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time. So realistic situations,

    as happens very, very quickly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we lose a geometric up with a

    geometric optics model,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diffraction and interference

    effects and'
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And just to confirm the thing,

    steady state, that''s like, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you were taking, let''s say, a

    picture of the stars at night,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then all of a sudden, a

    street line turned on beside'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you. It''s assuming nothing like

    that street mount will appear.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''re capturing the light as if

    it was all steady, so no sudden'
  persid: ''
- desc: light turns on.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No cars are driving by,

    therefore causing new lights to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'appear for just moments and

    things like that. Consistent'
  persid: ''
- desc: luminance, right? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would say even when you have

    new lights appearing,'
  persid: ''
- desc: their contribution is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reaches a steady state almost

    instantaneously.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that you''re avoiding people.

    You''re disallowing people from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'turning on lights or street

    lights or'
  persid: ''
- desc: driving by a scene,
  persid: ''
- desc: but the way we model it is that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we use exposure settings right

    where there''s like a long'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shutter time or whatever. So in

    that time you''re capturing light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as though it was steady or

    consistent. So if you''ve had'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'suddenly something turn on

    midway through, would that would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interfere with an actual

    photography so I assume it has a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing like we''re assuming that

    can happen. That''s one of our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assumptions with the steady

    state.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think the steady state, it

    means that we''re not, we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dealing with a period of time

    when the light comes On,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and seeing the effect of the

    light coming on'
  persid: ''
- desc: over the period of our exposure,
  persid: ''
- desc: that there's A difference in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the inner energy from the light.

    Rather,'
  persid: ''
- desc: if the light appears,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re just we just accept

    that it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In the steady state, there''s a

    new steady state, And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that might be Interesting to To

    Explore I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what is literate programming,

    and Do you have examples aside'
  persid: ''
- desc: from pbrt?
  persid: ''
- desc: How about Writing Code. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think that''s a Good

    explanation of literary'
  persid: ''
- desc: programming. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone. What do you mean by the

    narrative?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So describing how code is

    designed or written? Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you want to create an exposition

    of the design of the code,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so You''re writing it a way

    that supports the narrative So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does anyone have examples of

    literary programming systems'
  persid: ''
- desc: I've done pbrt Do thanks.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, It's pronounced tech. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What do you think about Jupiter

    Notebooks? Does anyone use those'
  persid: ''
- desc: before?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So just to clarify, literate

    programming is not like C Plus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Plus, where you have to declare

    the function at the very top,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then later you can do the

    function, but you have to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this here and stuff like that,

    like a very ordered and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'structured thing. What exactly

    is literate programming, as far'
  persid: ''
- desc: as Like how does it differ?
  persid: ''
- desc: So the documentation I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and Then there are Two pieces

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in Python with These Jupiter

    Notebooks, you can have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'documentation, and then you have

    code that runs. So it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'necessarily the same, but it''s

    an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so first of all, how many people

    are familiar with tech and late'
  persid: ''
- desc: tech.
  persid: ''
- desc: Cool, so,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes, with a computer notebook

    example, it''s more like, it''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: coding environment that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also kind of, like allows you to

    work with the building blocks.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It allows you to build up

    various blocks until you reach'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the very end. Because, like,

    that is, I mean, that''s kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: nice. Mean,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think with these notebooks,

    you can intermingle descriptions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and and code, and so they''re a

    little bit separate. So you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re including the code in the

    document, but the document and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the code are different, so it''s

    about having a single source'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that can be parsed into these

    two different streams. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s an interesting

    discussion. Okay, who''s who'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here. Is familiar with Emacs?

    Does anyone know what emacs is,'
  persid: ''
- desc: what kind of application it is?
  persid: ''
- desc: So editor, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can have a continued

    discussion about this. I''ll put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some resources online, but it

    won''t be on the final exam. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other things will be on the

    Final Exam. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it rasterization versus ray

    tracing. So we talked a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit about, very little bit about

    Z buffer and being a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rasterization algorithm. We''re

    keeping track of the closer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixel that''s closer. We''re

    testing against a Z buffer to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see whether the new picture

    pixel will be computed is closer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'than the existing one. If it is,

    we update the pixel. If it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: We discard it. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'writing a little bit too small

    there, I apologize. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rasterization says for each

    object in the scene, then for'
  persid: ''
- desc: each pixel i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that is possibly associated with

    the object as it gets scanned'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'converted. Is it closer than

    what''s stored in the set buffer?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so what does ray tracing

    do? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do the same loop, To organize

    the same way I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so who says it''s the same loop

    as rasterization for each object'
  persid: ''
- desc: done for each pixel? Anyone?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'My brain''s not working today,

    but that''s how I interpret it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So actually, we''re starting from

    the pixel,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, it comes, it comes towards

    that Ray, right?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The ray comes out of the pixel?

    Yeah, so the eye, which is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'camera, we trace a ray through

    the Pixel and into the scene.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So for each pixel, then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s as we Go through the

    scene, what''s the closest and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then how is the value of the

    pixel determined? So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing rates. If it''s a

    reflective surface that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bounce the reflection rate,

    retrace rate in light source,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see if it''s in shadow and so

    forth. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does That make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the depth of field is what,

    what happens'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the space? Sorry,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m really bad headed right now

    my brain can the best I can give'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you is This pretty much a second

    of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that. So what''s in focus

    compared to what''s out of focus?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when it''s not in focus, the

    lines don''t converge to a point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on The film. They convert it

    comes towards a desk. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: boundary of the disc.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So as to focus, the larger this

    disc is the film, the more out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of focus the image will be

    without the image will be or'
  persid: ''
- desc: that part that's out of focus,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are the different court

    assistance we talked About in'
  persid: ''
- desc: pbrt. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the world, the object, the

    camera, then I also put texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates which I didn''t know

    if it was a Click of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, yeah. World, object,

    Camera,'
  persid: ''
- desc: camera, world, i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i also seen a normalized device

    coordinates discussed in Chapter'
  persid: ''
- desc: Five about the projections.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we need to move between

    them, we use matrices. So why,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we''re doing projections, do

    we have four by four matrices'
  persid: ''
- desc: discusses
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the classes? Because when we''re

    doing translation, stuff like'
  persid: ''
- desc: that, I so we
  persid: ''
- desc: Got homogeneous coordinates and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for registers allow rotation,

    scaling and translation to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: expressed in the same matrix.
  persid: ''
- desc: That's why we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a four by four matrix for three

    dimensional objects is a useful'
  persid: ''
- desc: thing. Take A
  persid: ''
- desc: Picture. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. Somebody asked, where this

    was mentioned? Does it be the'
  persid: ''
- desc: four that we talked
  persid: ''
- desc: about? So we have a square,
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an arc, one quarter, one

    quadrant in a circle. So just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'imagine that''s that''s part of a

    circle. So when we''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: Monte Carlo and
  persid: ''
- desc: and number
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the it''s basically trying to

    find The ratio of points that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are inside the circle compared

    to inside the Square.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll put to the link to that

    administration and anything'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clarificational to that as well.

    Does that make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: spherical geometry and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'why is it important for

    rendering? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So why can we are we supposed to

    specifically worried about, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'concerned about spherical

    coordinates vertical Geometry'
  persid: ''
- desc: and ray tracing.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The so we''re dealing with all in

    coming and outgoing directions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Look at that in terms of these

    directions are expressed in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spheres or hemispheres,

    depending on the case.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We got to translate all of that

    to be a two dimensional screen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the end, because it''s got to

    be viewable.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re taking in like every

    single direction you could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possibly go up your day to get

    all that information.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But also, if you did every

    single direction, you would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there for more than a day. I

    think,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, we do it every day.
  persid: ''
- desc: It just works in nature.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s a simulation that''s the

    hard part, and we''re getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more fidelity with our

    simulation'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: and if we have
  persid: ''
- desc: a bright light source
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that makes it easier for having

    dimly lit space, then it''s hard'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to or to Find the light in the

    scene.'
  persid: ''
- desc: But anyway, so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are the three

    parameterizations for spherical'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'octahedral encoding, equal area,

    mapping spherical coordinates, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this spherical coordinates

    gives us an easy representation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'easy To convert between this and

    Cartesian coordinates.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Octahedral encoding Is space

    saving. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I wrote down E coli mapping

    some reasonable equilibrium'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mapping is important, because if

    you''re sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with spherical coordinates, you

    might get, we''re not going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get a uniform distribution, or

    we get extra stuff in the poles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and some distortion there as

    well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, Does that make sense? I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how do we use bone and

    glasses to accelerate re'
  persid: ''
- desc: intersection tests? You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can use it to truncate rays that

    aren''t hitting your object. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rather than checking like the

    very fine shape of the object,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you just search a general area.

    If you don''t hit that general'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'area, well, you''re not going to

    hit the shape. And also, when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ray leaves that general

    area, if it doesn''t hit the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shape, well, it''s not it''s never

    going to hit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shape unless it bounces. I

    analysis.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So imagine
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these are two axis aligned

    bounding boxes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What can I what other

    improvement can I do in CS'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'having a collection of bounding

    boxes at the same level, so very'
  persid: ''
- desc: shallow tree can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have multiple different like

    levels of it. So you have one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'boundary box that maybe contains

    both of those ones. If you don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hit that one, you''re not gonna

    hit any of the ones inside of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, either, right? And you can

    just keep going outward.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So hierarchical, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realize we''re in a time here. So

    Ken,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the chapter seven, kind of was

    about that when you told us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to read, yeah, that''s making the

    the data structures for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the hierarchy hierarchical

    bounding structures. So there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a list of things that are common

    to Ray tracing systems,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cameras and lights and

    visibility and light scattering'
  persid: ''
- desc: and so forth.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll post A link to that. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so question 11 about the

    importance of choosing an'
  persid: ''
- desc: integrator in the sampler
  persid: ''
- desc: that's from the user guide.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s a guide for the answer

    anyway, But I'
  persid: ''
- desc: tried to be open. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so bi directional distribution

    functions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the bi directional reflectance

    function, bi directional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transmit distribution function,

    bi directional surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattering, reflectance,

    distribution function. These are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the three we''ve talked about. So

    why are they bi directional? You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation, incoming direction and

    not going direction. So we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: those pair.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so it seems like we''re

    just at a time since I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: learned about my next meeting.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that makes sense. Okay, so I

    was generous with marking. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is an opportunity, so 15

    marks for the midterm won''t sink'
  persid: ''
- desc: you,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but if so, be clear about this

    stuff for the final.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. Thank you for today. Now

    the winters back, stay warm and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take care, and we''ll see you on

    Thursday. Oh, have a look at'
