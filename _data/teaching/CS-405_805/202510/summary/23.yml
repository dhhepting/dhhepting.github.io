- desc: 'So we have meeting 23

    today, of 26'
  persid: ''
- desc: April 1. Doesn't feel like it. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we''re going to talk

    about textures a bit more detail'
  persid: ''
- desc: today. So you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe we''ll Watch more videos

    too.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s actually interesting. I''m

    creating a tackle box for 458,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class. So I ended up using three

    different textures. I created'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one that was just the standard

    shader for Maya. One was the one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of their presets for metal, and

    then the third one was a preset'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'metal one with PBR, and the

    difference between them is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'astronomical, like just the

    difference between the three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different ones having the three

    different textures on this one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'identical object under the same

    lighting. It''s crazy how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different it is and how more

    realistic the PBR stuff is'
  persid: ''
- desc: versus the other stuff.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So are you combining the three

    textures? I''m not going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: combine. I can't combine
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them, but I applied the same the

    three different textures'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'identical color to all through

    to three different texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'objects, and then attach the

    texture object to the object'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'itself, and just the difference

    in coloring and the look of them'
  persid: ''
- desc: is just crazy. Oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so standard models like fun

    shading, even though it gives'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some realistic looking effects,

    it''s not physically based, so It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t it''s limited in What it

    can produce. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, I guess I just have to

    switch this. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s look at our quiz before

    reading 23'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can the texture sound made

    change from pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: to pixel, yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: only heard three yess, yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you. Thank
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so can we talk a little bit of

    why it is? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we might have the same

    texture, but it''s projected on,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'projected differently onto scene

    geometry, for example. Does that'
  persid: ''
- desc: make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, I mean, it may be the same

    texture, but in this pixel, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could be getting more light, and

    then in another pixel it gets a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different light. So it''s not

    necessarily going to look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exactly the same way in each

    pixel anyway. So we need to make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sure that our sampling rate

    accounts for that difference.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, but the sampling rate

    isn''t about the lighting, okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what if our sampling rate is

    let'
  persid: ''
- desc: me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ask another different question,

    similar question, but it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: definitely different.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what Is the Nyquist limit.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so that''s a phrase. It''s

    often in the textbook, I think,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to talk about the limit of the

    Nyquist limit. What are some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other ways you''ve used Nyquist

    name in vain, not taken His name'
  persid: ''
- desc: In vain. But I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking about the micro strait.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s twice the rate of this

    smallest thing is that? Right?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We dissemble twice the highest

    frequency We want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: reconstruct. So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So a good example is CD Quality,

    audio. Everyone knows what a CD'
  persid: ''
- desc: is.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we set up a 44.1 kilohertz,

    so we can reconstruct 22'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kiloHertz, which is The range of

    most what most people can hear.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So so then in recording, we

    don''t want to record frequencies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are higher than that,

    because we won''t be able to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reconstruct them. Going to

    filter out the higher'
  persid: ''
- desc: frequencies higher than that?
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we''re not able to set so

    in images, we we can''t often get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the functions we''re sampling

    aren''t band limited, so there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no equivalent to the 44.1

    kilohertz, which is the limit we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can set and we could be happy

    with being able to reconstruct,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then 22 kiloHertz suffragette CS

    up to 22 kilohertz.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for sampling, at a rate. So

    how can we think of the Nyquist'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rate As a limit? If that

    question makes sense, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we were sampling a certain

    rate, then We can only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reconstruct the rate divided by

    Two and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so Rate is limit so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m sorry, some days I just seem

    to be intent on writing more,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more smallly than others. So I''m

    maybe a secretly trying to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you to sit in the front row, but

    I''ll take when I take pictures'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the board, then they''ll be

    legible.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re we''re limiting the

    frequency.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re limited by the Nyquist

    limit, because we don''t want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'aliasing in our images, so we we

    have that as an upper bound on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the frequency that we can

    include so that affects how we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample the textures. Does that

    make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. This is clear when I wrote

    it, but I tried to give you some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pointers to what I was looking

    for. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there are a few different

    ways to do a 2d mapping of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture. In fact, there are four

    different ways listed. Anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like to offer one? Yeah,

    planner,'
  persid: ''
- desc: selectical. Do and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the last way can''t remember. I

    there''s two letters of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: alphabet,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because sometimes we just have a

    natural parameterization of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface, so we can map the UV

    parameterized coordinates into'
  persid: ''
- desc: the texture coordinates
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue depending on your object,

    you might need to have your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture map into all of those

    different'
  persid: ''
- desc: ways. What's an example of that?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, you could you do planar

    combined with UV for, like, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have, like, a table with

    side pieces. So we would be in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the UV spectrum on some sides,

    but you''d be on planar on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other parts. Yeah, so you talked

    about in the book, they talked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about different ways depending

    on the normal so one, if it was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pointing up, you would get an

    image, one image, and if it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pointing to the side, you''d get

    a do. Different image. So that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would be like the front cover of

    the magazine and the spine,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or even the back back. You can

    have a different one too. Yes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah. So there are different

    variations like that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, I mean, using a magazine,

    example, if you roll up a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'magazine, it''s going to have a

    different, different texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mapping than if it''s laid out

    flat.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, it''s not cylindrical and

    flat at the same time,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'though, no, but you would need

    to account for that Depending on'
  persid: ''
- desc: what you're doing.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, would You See The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s spherical mapping

    makes sense. So just in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'case, we just have the texture

    in B we just have the texture on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the surface of the sphere, we

    can define the texture that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three dimensions. And so we

    could, in that way, we could cut'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the sphere and see the

    texture on the inside as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone familiar with these

    coffee pots?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They say a kettle. I don''t know.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think that would be like a

    percolator.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, put water in the bottom,

    and then you have coffee grounds'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the middle, and then as the

    water boils, it''s forced through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the coffee grounds into the

    kettle on top. You to make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'espresso. I remember once I had

    a big, very big one, not not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'huge, but it''s maybe this big

    that would get me going in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'morning. But my wife and kids

    didn''t like the smell in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: kitchen, so I gave it up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway. So that''s a cylindrical

    mapping. I It''s not quite'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cylindrical, but it''s an

    approximation of a cylinder. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we can map on to that

    scratch texture supplied using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cylindrical texture mapping

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any other questions or comments

    about that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'although we''re looking For like

    the function side of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: progress, I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just I''m sorry. I was just

    confused on the way that you''d'
  persid: ''
- desc: asked the questions. What?
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, well, not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pretty much. But now understand

    what you meant. Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I last question was,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image, texture store, Q, D,

    arrays of point, sound, values'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of a texture function, which are

    used to reconstruct a continuous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image that can be evaluated at

    arbitrary position. What are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these samples called texels?

    Everyone agree?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so called texels. So why does

    that sound familiar? It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: the texture version of pixels i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So pixels Are picture elements

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture textiles or texture

    elements and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What if we had volume elements,

    pixels, foxes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: Fox. I probably
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Fox, yeah, it''s the term is

    voxel. So it''s just, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we look at participating

    media or I or contents of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chapter 11, then we''re In the

    realm of voxels that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: dealing with for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve had a cold the past few

    days, but I seem to be maybe on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the road to recovery, because I,

    my daughter claims that I gave'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it to her, so she said, this

    morning, you mean you got me'
  persid: ''
- desc: sick? And I thought, Well,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m sorry about that, but if

    that means that I''m going to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: better, that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when you reply to them and say,

    Well, my mother always taught me'
  persid: ''
- desc: to share. Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: I anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: any questions about that?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I picked this procedural

    noise video because it was from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the same series that we looked

    at the micro facet videos from a'
  persid: ''
- desc: little while ago.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But this one doesn''t have as

    much doesn''t have any theory in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'front of it, but I thought it

    might be interesting to watch.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then the Perlin noise video

    is from somebody who I the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'author of the book called The

    nature of code, which I enjoyed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reading. But I''m not sure about

    his presentation, but he seems a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit off the wall, so

    maybe that would be interesting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to watch. Let''s watch as well.

    These aren''t paper fools jokes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, we'll see. Does
  persid: ''
- desc: that seem like a good plan?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Watch this before drinking plant

    based milks, oat milk, latte'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'protein, you know, it''s

    excellent. Oh,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called pause, back to pause the

    first step.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hello everybody. Welcome to

    shaders. Mansfield Today we talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about procedural noise. In

    particular, we will learn how to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generate value noise that you

    see on the left and color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gradient noise that is shown on

    the right. Furthermore, we will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see that we can add multiple

    layers of noise with different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frequencies and amplitudes to

    generate noise with more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'details. This approach is often

    called Fractal Noise. On the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'left you see fractal value

    noise, and on the right, fractal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gradient noise to implement the

    procedural noise functions in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'GLSL. I use the GS and composer

    at GSN minus lip.org as a shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'editor, but you can use any

    other shader editor as well, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are writing pure open GLSL code,

    which you can use everywhere.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Links to examples that execute

    the same shader code using CS or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Java can be found in the video

    description. Our implementation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'starts with our example from

    episode number five, in which we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have applied a two detection to

    a triangle, click project and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'type in the project name,

    shaders, monthly, 05, and click'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'open existing, then open the

    graph texture triangle and press'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'play in the time control panel,

    let''s replace the triangle with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The chord. Click Create and

    navigate to 3d compute, generate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'play. Then we connect the mesh

    data node to the mesh input slot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the shader node. Perfect. We

    are rendering a quad set exactly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fits the size of the frame

    buffer. The currently applied'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture is this image here?

    Let''s have a look at the shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'code. We select the shader node

    and click the Edit Code button.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This dialog is a shader editor

    of the GSM composer. In the top'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'section we can define the vertex

    shader and in the bottom section'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fragment shader. Here we

    have the uniform variable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sampler, 2d my texture that

    represents the pixel based input'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture in the fragment shader,

    we use texture function to get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color value from the texture.

    The first parameter is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample to D variable, and the

    second parameter is the current'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture coordinate. The next

    line writes a texture color to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the frame of a pixel uniform

    sample to D, my texture can be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'removed. We replace texture, my

    texture, with the function'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value, noise, and define the

    function VEC for value noise,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the texture coordinates are

    passed via a VEC two that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'call POS. VEC two, POS, we first

    simply return the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates in the red and green

    channels. We turn back four post'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dot x, post dot y, 0.0, 1.0 we

    see at the shader output that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the texture coordinates are in

    the interval from zero to one in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'both dimensions, a texture

    coordinate of 00, is at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bottom left corner, one, zero at

    the bottom right corner, 01, at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the top left corner, and one,

    one at the top right corner.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'First of all, we need a function

    that generates some pseudo'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'random numbers. It is called

    pseudo random because the'

    statistically by a real random'

    generated by a deterministic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function. Because it is a

    deterministic function, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'produces the same numbers for

    the same input parameters. To'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'select a good pseudo random

    number generator, I would like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to refer to a paper called hash

    functions for GPU random by Mark'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'jacinski and Mark boleno,

    published in the Journal of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Computer Graphics techniques in

    2020 the authors compare'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different random number

    generators for quality and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'speed. I paste the code of a

    random number generator that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they recommend into our shader,

    we see that this function is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'expecting a U VEC three as

    input, which is a vector of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three unsigned integers. The

    output is a VEC three, a vector'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of three floating point values.

    This means that we get three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'random numbers from one function

    call these output numbers have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uniform distribution in the

    interval from zero to one. Our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first goal is to output a random

    color for each pixel of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'output frame buffer. As we have

    learned in previous episodes of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shaders monthly, the fragment

    shader is called for every pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the output frame buffer. To

    convert the texture coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to pixels, we add the function t

    to p. Now the current pixel in x'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction can be computed by

    float p x equals t to P plus dot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'x comma with and the current

    pixel in y direction by a float'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'p y equals t 2p plus dot y,

    comma height. Furthermore, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to define uniform int width

    and uniform int height to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the width and height of the

    frame buffer. Now we can use p x'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and p y as seeds for the random

    number generator VEC three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'random equals random,

    underscore, PC, G, 3d, u, v, x,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'v, p, x, p, y, zero. Return VEC

    for random 1.0 we return random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as the R, G, B value and 1.0 SC,

    alpha value. Okay, this looks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good. For every pixel, we get a

    different random color as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'output. Now, when we change the

    seat here, for example, when we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put one instead of zero, we get

    different random values, two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three, every time we get

    different values, let''s animate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this value. We add a uniform

    variable, uniform int, graph,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time, apply code and close the

    input. Texture can be deleted.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We create the node input,

    compute time, and it''s a time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Control dialog, which we can

    reach via this button, we set'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the end parameter to a larger

    number, for example, 20,000'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Furthermore, we increase the

    rendering speed and set the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameter milliseconds per tick

    to 20 milliseconds. Next, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connect the data output of the

    time node to the input slot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graph time of our shader. We

    open the shader Editor again and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put graph time as the third seed

    of the random number generator.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Perfect. Now we get new random

    values for every rendered frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer image for many

    applications, this noise output'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is too chaotic. There is no

    numbers from a uniform random'

    this, we are now implementing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value noise. The idea is that

    we''re not generating a random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value for each pixel. Instead,

    we generate a random value for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points on a coarser grid. To

    this end, we subdivide the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'complete domain of texture

    coordinates into an eight by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eight grid. We compute a grid

    position, cons, float. Grid size'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equals 8.0 vector grid POS

    equals POS times grid size if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'POS is in the interval from zero

    to one, grid POS is in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interval from zero to eight. To

    get the integer part of grid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'POS, we cast to a U VEC two,

    which is a vector of two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unsigned integers, u VEC two, I

    equals u VEC two. Grid POS. With'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this operation, we round

    downwards to the nearest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'integer, which gives us the

    digits before the decimal point.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We also need the fractional part

    of the grid position VEC to f'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equals frag grid pause, which

    gives us the digits after the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decimal point. Consequently, the

    values of f are again in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interval from zero to one, let''s

    output F, return back 4f, dot x,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'f, dot y, 0.0, 1.0, as you see

    here, we get an eight by eight'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'grid, and inside each cell, the

    variable f goes from zero to one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in both dimensions. This is a

    grid size of 16 by 16, four by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four, and back to a grid size of

    eight by eight.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now if we use the integer value

    of each grid cell as seeds for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the random function, we get the

    same random value per grid cell,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'although each grid cell consists

    of many output pixels, UX,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three, I dot x, I dot y, zero

  persid: ''
- desc: 'time variable to translate the

    grid cells over time. Vector,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pos equals interpolated text

  persid: ''
- desc: 'load graph, time value, noise,

    POS, well, this looks nice. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a never ending stream of

    random colors that only repeat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when graph time repeats. The

    value of graph time repeats when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it reaches the end of our

    animation, time which we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'set to 20,000 let''s stop the

    animation. To generate value'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nodes, we need a smooth

    interpolation between the grid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors. One interpolation

    technique that we already have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learned in episode number six is

    the bilinear interpolation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The bilinear interpolation is

    computed from four neighboring'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'values, which are the random

    colors in our example, the dash'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lines represent the core script

    of our random variables to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compute the interpolated value

    at the location of the blue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point, we first interpolate in x

    direction using the x position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the blue point within its

    neighbors. This is done two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'times for the two neighbors at

    the bottom residing in a linear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolated value at this new

    point and for the two neighbors'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the top, which gives us a

    result for this new point. Once'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is done, we perform linear

    interpolation in the y direction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using the y position of the blue

    point within the two new points,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the same setup is now

    illustrated in the ly figure.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The grid is the ground plane,

    and the color values are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represented as these red bars

    that point upwards. The length'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the red bars corresponds to

    the stored random values. Now we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first compute the value at

    location q1 by linear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolation. And here''s the

    equation to perform this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operation. You see that we use

    the values at x1 y1 and x2 y1 to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perform this operation. Next, we

    compute the value at location q2'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by linear interpolation. The

    value at x1 y2 x2 y2 are used.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And finally, the linear

    interpolation in the y'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction, where the values at

    q1 and q2 are used. To implement'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this linear interpolation in our

    shader, we need the four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neighboring random values, f1,

    one, i, x, I y, vec, one, two, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'x plus one, I y, f2 one, I x, I

    y plus one, f2 two, I x plus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, I y plus one. To perform

    the linear interpolation. GLSL'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has a built in mix function. The

    first two parameters are the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'values that are interpolated,

    and the third argument is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolation weight. To compute

    q1 we interpolate f1 one and f1'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two in x direction, VEC 3q, one

    equals mix f1, one, f1, two. VEC'
  persid: ''
- desc: '3f dot x, return. VEC for q1,

    1.0, apply code, send for q2 VEC'
  persid: ''
- desc: '3q two makes f2 one, f2, two.

    VEC 3f dot x, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolate in y direction, VEC

    3p equals mix q1, q2, VEC 3f,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dot y, we turn back 4p, 1.0

    good. This is the correct'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolation result, but it

    looks a bit blocky. We can fix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this by using the built in GLSL

    smooth step function. The smooth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'step function is shown on the

    slide. It implements a non'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'linear smooth transition from

    zero to one. The first parameter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defines where the transition

    starts and the second parameter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where it ends. We needed to map

    the complete fractional part so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have f equals smooth, step

    0.0, 1.0 F, excellent. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looks better. Let''s turn on the

    animation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We refactor the code, VEC three,

    value, noise, VEC two, POS,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'flow, grid size, return P, and

    we define a new function, VEC'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three, fractal. Value, noise,

    VEC two, POS, VEC 3n, equals VEC'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three, 0.0 n plus equal value,

    noise, pause, 8.0 return n and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'call it in the main function.

    VEC three, text, color equals'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fractal value, noise, POS, how

    color equals back for text,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color 1.0 ok. This should not

    change. Anything apply. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compute, no change. The idea of

    fractal noise is that we sum up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noise with different

    frequencies, which means here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different values for the grid

    size parameter. A common'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approach is to double the

    frequency and take half the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'amplitude for every layer. So

    let''s try n plus equal 0.5 times'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value. Noise plus four apply. We

    add the next layer n plus equal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 0.25 times value, noise POS 8.0
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and another layer n plus equal

    0.125 times value, noise POS'
  persid: ''
- desc: '16.0 the layers are also called

    octaves, same as in music, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frequency doubles for every

    octave. But you don''t have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'follow this rule, and can freely

    play around with these values to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'produce the noise

    characteristics that you need'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for your application. Obviously,

    the computation effort increases'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with every layer that we add.

    Here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s output the pure value.

    Noise again, we comment this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'line and type Vex, V, text,

    color equals value. Noise, POS,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 4.0 we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applied and closed. We named the

    shader value noise. Now the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second type of noise that we

    introduce today is gradient'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noise. Gradient noise was

    introduced by Ken Perlin in a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'SIGGRAPH paper in 1985 we copy

    the value noise shader and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reconnect the inputs. We call

    this shader gradient noise.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We open the shader editor for

    this new node. We rename the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'functions to gradient noise and

    fractal gradient noise.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The idea of gradient noise is

    shown in this slide. Instead of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolating random values. We

    interpolate between gradients at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each grid point, we create a

    gradient vector in a random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction of random length. The

    interpolation part stays exactly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the same. How can we compute the

    gradient vectors influence at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each position within the grid?

    Let''s look at a single gradient.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'For simplicity, this gradient

    vector that we have selected has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unit length, the value of the

    gradients influenced at each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position can be computed with a

    dot product. The red arrow'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represents the random gradient

    vector, and the blue arrow is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector to the current

    interpolation point. If we take'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the dot product of these two

    vectors, we get a value of zero.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If the two vectors are

    perpendicular, a negative value'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from zero to minus one is a

    point in opposite directions,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and a positive value from zero

    to one is a point in the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction. Overall, within this

    unit circle, we get a linear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gradient from minus one to one.

    There are different options for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the generation of the gradient

    vectors. The approach that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'present here creates a random

    vector by randomly picking a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point within the unit circle,

    given an angle phi and a radius'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'r, the X and Y position of a

    point within the unit circle can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be computed by x equals r times

    cosine phi, and y equals r times'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sine phi. We start from two

    uniformly distributed values, u'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and v in the interval zero to

    one. Let''s first try to assign u'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the radius and phi equals two

    pi times v, we then don''t get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uniform distribution over the

    area of the circle. The sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points are concentrated at the

    center. What we want is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constant sample density over the

    complete area, but the area of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the circle increases

    quadratically with the radius.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You can concentrate for this by

    assigning the square root of u'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the radius. This gives us a

    uniform sampling. Let''s do that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again. Oh. Now that we have

    discussed the theory, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'implementation is not

    complicated. We copied this code'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'block and comment out these

    lines. We changed the last'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameter from zero to one

    because we want different random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'values for our gradient vectors.

    We replace random PCG 3d with a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'new function that we call random

    gradient. The output of this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function is a VEC two, and we

    call the variables, VEC 2g one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, VEC 2g one, two, VEC 2g

    two, one, VEC 2g two, two, next.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We define the random gradient

    function. Define M, pi, 3.14,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so on. VEC two, random

    gradient, U, VEC 3p, VEC three,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'UV equals random PCG, three, DP,

    float r equals square root. UV,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero. Float five equals two

    times m, pi times u, v1 return'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back to r times cosine phi, r

    times sine phi. Next, we compute'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the influence of the gradient at

    the current interpolation value'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'F with the dot product, as

    discussed in the slides. Float'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'd1, one equals dot g1, 1f float

    d1, two equals dot g1, 2f, for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'd1, two, we should not use F

    directly, but use the offset'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relative to the next grid

    position to the right, which is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minus back to 1.0 0.0, then for

    the grid position above, float'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'd2 one equals dot g2 1f minus

    VEC two 0.0, 1.0 and lastly,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'float d2 two equals dot g2 2f,

    minus VEC two, 1.0 1.0 use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same interpolation code As

    before, we have to cast the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'float values to a VEC three. VEC

    3f one, one equals back 3d. One,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one. VEC 3f one, two equals

    back, 3d. One, two. VEC 3f two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one equals VEC 3d two, one. VEC

    3f two, two equals back, 3d.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Two, two. Apply. Code, Okay,

    this looks good, but we might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get negative values, which we

    can prevent by adding 0.25'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gradient noise done, but the

    output is not very colorful. To'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'add colors, we can combine value

    in gradient noise. We comment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out these lines and uncomment

    the code that we have used for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the value noise. There are

    different ways to combine both'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approaches. Let''s simply

    multiply our random values and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the gradient before the

    interpolation. Remove plus 0.5'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here and add times d1 one plus

    one, times d1 two plus one times'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'd2 one plus one times d2 two

    plus one apply excellent if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compare both approaches. The

    gradient noise looks more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'natural and less regular for the

    value noise, the underlying grid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'structure is more obvious. Let''s

    enable the Fractal Noise variant'
  persid: ''
- desc: for the gradient noise looks
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also good. Today we have learned

    how to generate value in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gradient noise. This is an

    important building block for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'future episodes of shaders

    monthly. We are going to use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'procedural noise functions to

    create things like water, waves,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clouds, fire and so on. If you

    have questions, use the comments'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or get in contact with me. See

    you at the next Episode of'
  persid: ''
- desc: shaders monthly. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so procedural textures number

    seven seems like it would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe interesting as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, add a link to it. Let''s

    stick with Perlin noise and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: many hours that
  persid: ''
- desc: I had i i mentioned before i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, here we are again. We are

    at a very exciting moment. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are so close, so close to

    finishing with this introductory'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'section, where I feel like I''m

    not really in control, and maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m screwing this all up. But

    soon we''re going to be getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to vectors. The vectors are the

    place where I think we''ll feel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comfortable, and we''ll sort of

    be on a directed path, knowing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where we''re going to create

    these Ridge motion simulations'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and processing. But before we do

    that, there''s an important topic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I think is actually

    probably the most important of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all of these kind of beginning,

    introductory topics about random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'numbers, and that is Perlin

    noise. Perlin noise is going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'allow us to create a randomness

    in our code that is smooth, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has a more organic feel to it,

    that''s going to allow us to do a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lot of lot of create a lot of

    things across, things like that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that feel a bit more natural, or

    that''s really interesting to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say, trying to come up with the

    right words, I should stop and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'restart, but I''m going to keep

    going. Okay, so Perlin noise?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is Perlin noise? First of

    all, Perlin noise is named for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ken Perlin, who, if we just

    broke through this wall and kept'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going and broke through another

    wall and went into the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'building, we would find Ken

    Colin is a professor here at NYU'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the computer science

    department, and he developed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Perlin noise, I believe, while

    working on the film Tron,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'somebody correct me and write

    nasty letters. I''m getting this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all wrong in the agency. In

    fact, he won a an Academy Award'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for his work computer graphics.

    And so prolinois was originally'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'developed to create procedural

    textures for 3d models in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer graphics, meaning,

    okay, if we want to have a vase'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that has a marble like texture

    to it, would you have a vase'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a marble like texture? I''m

    not sure. Do we need to hand'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create that with with handmade

    techniques, or can we create an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'algorithm that will make that

    texture procedural? Now, how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does it do this? And what is

    what are we really talking about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here? Well, first, let''s think

    about this moment of time for a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second. This moment, this idea

    of time. Let''s think about time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and random numbers. Let''s say

    this line represents time and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time is moving along. This is

    the beginning of time. This is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the end of time. We''re somewhere

    in the middle there. I suppose'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Time is moving along. And let''s

    say we take a random number at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any moment in time. Okay, I''m

    not going to be able to do this,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because I''m a human being and

    I''m just destined for pattern.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But you could imagine it''s going

    to have it''s going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something like this. It''s going

    to be this graph that makes no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sense at all, that just looks

    like a lot of squiggly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'randomness all over the place.

    Any random number we pick at any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moment in time has no

    relationship to the previous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'random number that we picked or

    the next random number we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'picked. There''s no smoothness

    here. So what does Perlin noise'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look like? Well, if you think of

    Perlin noise over time might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look something more like this.

    Isn''t that smooth, soothing and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relaxing and blowing a nice

    little graph there? I know, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t know if I how well I drew

    this, but this is randomness,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and that it''s random. You can''t

    predict it''s gonna go up, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna go down, it''s gonna go up

    lot, that a little bit, but yet,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a smoothness to it.

    There is this idea that occur a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'random number over here is

    related to the previous and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'related to the next one random

    numbers change slightly over'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time. This is a very powerful

    concept. If we can pick random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'numbers in this fashion, then we

    could have something organically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'grow and shrink randomly, but in

    a nice kind of almost breathing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'organic, like web. You see the

    word organic way too much, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can see what I really tried

    driving at. This has a more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'natural quality than this. And

    per the noise is something that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you know, in a way I was saying

    earlier, that randomness is this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'crutch. I''m gonna let them know.

    What''s that? How to make all my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'variables this, make them all

    randomness my crutch, my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'personal crush is right, is I

    just make everything with Perlin'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noise. It''s random, but it''ll be

    smooth, so people will like it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we need to be careful here.

    We want to use these different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'algorithms in the appropriate

    time for whatever it is, what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'behavior or what sort of

    expressive quality we''re trying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to achieve in our animations, in

    our program. But this is another'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tool in our bag of tricks that

    we can use. So the question is,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how do we use Perlin noise, and

    what do the results look like?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, again, let''s take let''s

    take a scenario this pen. By the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way, we need a new one at the

    moment. Let''s take a scenario'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where what we want here is our

    processing window, and what we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want is to be able to this way.

    I should also be talking about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this in the middle of the middle

    of the video, OK, what we want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is to put a circle on the

    screen. And every frame, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to give it a random

    location. So we''re going to say,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hey, float X equals random

    between zero and width, and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are going to draw a circle at

    that at that location, and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna see what that looks like.

    Let''s do that together,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually. Let''s press this

    button and come over here so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should have pre populated this

    would set up a draw. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay. I can type fast, so I''m a

    background, zero, fill 255, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: gonna draw a circle.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So anyone familiar with

    processing or p5 JS'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'processing, it''s used in C tech

    tool'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for Yeah, I just heard, if you

    were familiar with it,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'circle, and it''s going to be at

    an X location in the middle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen. And it''s going to be a

    nice size circle, and x is going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to be a random value between

    zero and width, and random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noise. Random noise thing. Okay,

    so let''s run this and see what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we get. You can see here, if I

    just slide all this over, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to get used to doing this

    eventually. You can see here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is randomness every frame.

    It''s at a new random location.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And in fact, we could maybe see

    this a bit more easily if I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'slow the frame rate down to

    something like 10 frames per'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second and run it again, you can

    see there''s no relationship. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just have this dot moving

    anywhere because it''s random in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'every frame. So what do we want

    to do is we want to start'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking at code for doing this

    with Perlin noise. We want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say float X equals noise

    something. So this is an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interesting question. Now, I''m

    really botching this. OK, this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is an interesting question now,

    because with random was very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clear, what the arguments to the

    random function are, minimum and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maximum range of randomness.

    What are the arguments to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noise function? It would be nice

    if I could just say zero comma'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'width, and if you type that in

    there, it actually would accept'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that and run, but it wouldn''t

    work the way that you want it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to. The thing about noise is, no

    matter what this noise function'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is going to give us a value

    between zero and one, Perlin'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noise. The noise, Perlin noise

    function in processing will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'always, no matter what you do,

    give you a value between zero'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and one. You cannot affect the

    range of what comes out of that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function. We''re going to be able

    to affect it quite easily in a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moment, using the map function

    in processing to map it to a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different range. But right now,

    we''re only ever going to get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero between zero and one out of

    that function. So what goes in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there? Well, remember how we had

    this idea of time? Well, with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'randomness, you know, there is

    sort of this idea of timing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There''s a pseudo random number

    generator that''s giving us a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'random set of random numbers in

    sequence. The timing really play'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a part in our thinking about it.

    With Perlin noise, we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually created a deterministic

    sort of time, space, continuum,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which Star Trek, land that makes

    no sense. We need to give time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as this argument. Now, time,

    what is it for? I like to sort'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of think of it as a time in

    terms of this graph, like, do we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want this random number at this

    moment in time? Or, do we want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this random number at this

    moment in time? What does that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What does that mean? Well, what

    are we doing here? Well, in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fact, we just need to create a

    variable, and so let''s kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get rid of this stuff over here.

    Let''s call it T and we could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say, hey, let''s ask for Perlin

    noise at time equals zero. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s go ahead and see what

    happens if we add this now to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our code. We know that we want,

    if this is the beginning of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time, we want Perlin noise value

    at time equals zero, and let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see what that gives us. I''m

    here. I''m back. Ok. So we are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now going to switch this to say

    x equals noise. And we said, at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some moment in time, and we

    create a global variable called'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'T, and we''re going to run this

    and where''s our circle? Well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first of all, our circle is at

    zero, right? Because Perlin'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noise only ever gives us a value

    between zero and one. We can''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get any other value but a value

    between zero and one. So we want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to use this function processing

    called the map function. Boy, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would love to just do a whole

    video just about the map'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function. And you know what? I''m

    definitely going to do that. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right now, I''m going to kind of

    assume that that exists and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ve watched it, and kind of

    just add the map function kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of quickly. So what I want to do

    is remap the value of x and map'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the value of x, which we know

    goes between zero and one. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually, yeah, that''s fine

    between zero and one, and I want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to map that between zero and

    width. I''m going to run this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now. I lost my pen. Okay, so,

    ah, so look, the circle is still'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'over there, but we got, let''s

    run it again. It''s over there.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now you can see we''re going to

    get a random value. Ah, there it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is, right? Perlin noise space is

    seated the beginning of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Processing sketch. Noise value

    at time equals zero, but it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not moving. It''s never changing,

    because the noise value at time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equals zero never changes. It''s

    the same, always in forever more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for that, for this instance of

    the sketch running. So what does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that mean we need to do? What we

    need to do is move through time.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We want in our sketches, say,

    give me the throwin noise value,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here, then here, then here, then

    here, then here, then here. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want all those values in

    sequence, so we get a sequence'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of these smooth values. And how

    far along we move through time?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do we move to here, to here, to

    here? That''s going to really be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'awful. So when we just regular

    redness, or do we move very,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very tiny, okay, very slowly. We

    need to say, t equals t plus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something, some value to

    increment. Should we go 0.00001'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or should we go 0.5 whatever? We

    could just try that and see what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'happens. So let''s take a look

    over here and see if we add'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that. OK, so we want to say,

    let''s move through time. Let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try T equals T plus one. That

    makes sense, right? Well, that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of more just like

    randomness, and I had that frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rate. Let''s take that, let''s,

    let''s let it run fast, 60 frames'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'per second. You can see that''s

    pretty much just like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'randomness, that T equals T plus

    one is moving really big steps'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through time, and really big

    steps through time, we lose the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fact that this, there''s this

    nice kind of curve going on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there. And so if I come back

    over here, let''s do something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much more reasonable, and say, t

    equals t plus 0.05 and look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this. I want it to appear. I

    need to, like, redo my way. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can see, look, it''s actually

    kind of moving almost more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smoothly. Now maybe that''s too

    big, so it''s also running very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quickly at 60 frames per second,

    which so you can see now we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'getting this nice, sort of

    smooth motion because we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seeing this sequence of random

    numbers. It also looks like it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moving with some type of rules,

    almost some type of physics to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. We''ve just sort of

    accidentally created this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'physics, this random walker, so

    to speak, with Perlin noise. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this would be kind of my

    exercise to you, if you want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try, to try to take this and

    kind of like link it to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything we doing. So far,

    there''s so many places in all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the examples where you''ll be

    able to add Perlin noise in, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right now, it''s in you go to

    that random walker and try to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make a Perlin noise random

    walker. And I''ll include, at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some point, I''ll watch these

    videos and see all the things I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say, and then I''ll put these

    links on the video page, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whatever it is, to examples. But

    you should be able to actually,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can definitely find, if you

    go to the nature of code book,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'GitHub repo, you can find

    several examples of the random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'walker with Perlin noise. So

    there''s more to Perlin noise.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One thing I just want to allude

    to very quickly that you could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also do as an exercise, is that,

    right, we have time here in one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dimension. And really, this idea

    of time I just used as a sort of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way of us describing how Perlin

    noise works. But this is really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just one dimensional space,

    right? There''s a value, there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a sort of a string, and on the

    string are written lots of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'numbers in one dimension. But if

    we took that string and made it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into a piece of paper, and the

    number here is related to all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these other numbers that are

    near it, so instead of a number'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here just having some neighbor

    to the left and right, there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neighbors all around it in two

    dimensional space. So what if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you could map noise values in

    two dimensional space to height'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'values in it in some sort of top

    to top top topology, or for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixel values in some type of

    texture for an image, right?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''ll get this is where you can

    start to get procedural textures'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for for three dimensional

    objects. So that''s looking at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two dimensional noise, and how

    that can work is kind of an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exciting possibility as well,

    and we''ll see later on in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video series, when we look at

    flow field for objects who are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dropped into space and moving

    almost as if there''s these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'currents and rivers pushing them

    along, where you create that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'flow field with two dimensional,

    permanent noise. So yeah, I list'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here, and I would like to make a

    two day permanence video, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we will do at some point as

    well. Okay, so this video is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'done. You''re gonna have lots of

    questions and confusing things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and whatever. We''ll re make this

    video or add some links and all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this. Everything will be okay.

    Everything''s gonna be okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: right? Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'goodbye, good girl, he''s good.

    We don''t touch that. But for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything else, there''s

    sensory, whether you''re a mobile'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back end, front end or any end.

    Developer will show you'
  persid: ''
- desc: what'd you think of that video.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Different. He had too much

    espresso, perhaps. And put it'
  persid: ''
- desc: politely,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, I''ll put a couple more

    links on the page for today''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting. If you can have a look

    at chapter 11.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think it''s fairly fairly

    short, and we''ll talk about that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on Thursday, and then we''ll

    touch on chapter 12 on Tuesday'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'next week, and then we have our

    last meeting on Thursday.'
