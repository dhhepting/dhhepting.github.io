- desc: 'Struggling with it, and

    then I looked at it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so we're at meeting 2226
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: reflection models I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: textures and materials and
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is chapter 10.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is in chapter 12.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I want to mention these other

    things, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: the assignment that's due and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking about what we''re going

    how we''re going to finish up The'
  persid: ''
- desc: class. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so meeting
  persid: ''
- desc: 324, 2526 and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so are we shooting to get to

    chapter 12 by the end of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'course is that this is

    indicated.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, I''m wondering if, if we

    Touch on chapter 11 as Well. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Bless you. You're
  persid: ''
- desc: too quick for Me. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, I think we''ll dabble in

    chapter 11 as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I suppose Are we just lightly

    touching on those three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subjects? Do you have another

    three kind of lectures? Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: '11 looks a little bit shorter,

    Though I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS, so I would invite your input

    for questions that would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'final exam questions that would

    Be a fair assessment of Your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learning this semester.

    Applause,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m sorry for missing last

    day''s meeting.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s go over the quest, The

    quiz questions From that you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are the three major

    classes of behaviors that come'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out of The electromagnetic

    theory of light.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Semiconductors Do
  persid: ''
- desc: conductors,
  persid: ''
- desc: and I guess, insulators. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The answer you have on the quiz

    is dielectric, conductor and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'semiconductor just has two of

    them listed. I know I''m just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking at it right now, since I

    got that one wrong, but yeah, me'
  persid: ''
- desc: too.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, I have dialectics,

    conductors and semiconductors,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because I put semiconductor is

    one word and you put it as two'
  persid: ''
- desc: words.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It might be because of the

    order, oh no, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: put mine in the same word.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I put commas in between them,

    and I have semi and conductors'
  persid: ''
- desc: one word,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, I will check my Answer and

    regrade them. Oh, yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that makes sense. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I also didn''t pluralize or I did

    pluralize conductors, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'arguably, I have none of those

    parts.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I realized all night.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, let''s look at the

    question. Since there are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions about the question, I

    Oh, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t put wild card At the end

    Here. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I will check
  persid: ''
- desc: it right now.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will check other issues as

    well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you have other quizzes that

    you think are Right, that got'
  persid: ''
- desc: marked wrong. Let me Know If
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what impact does the difference

    between indices of refraction of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neighboring materials have on

    reflection? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are you asking for? Like, the

    like mathematical impact, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wasn''t quite sure about what

    you''re exactly asking for on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this one, what I wrote was the

    differences between indices of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refraction is scaled by the

    square root of the two indices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of refraction. This is

    reflection, which I don''t know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if that''s what you were looking

    for, necessarily.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I also I had that, plus I had,

    intuitively, this could be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'understood those results, the

    radiance is differential, solid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle being compressed or

    expanded due to transmission.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was thinking about if there''s

    a greater difference between in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the season refraction

    neighboring media'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to reflect this reflection will

    be more intense. So diamonds are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more reflective than glass,

    because there''s a greater'
  persid: ''
- desc: difference.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Diamonds are more reflective

    than glass. I guess you don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'often see a nice diamond mirror

    like that''s not something you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just commonly come across.

    Diamonds are so small it''s hard'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to see. I imagine it would be

    really hard to make a diamond'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mirror. I don''t think it''s

    impossible, though, with'
  persid: ''
- desc: synthetic diamonds, i i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because otherwise that''s really

    expensive Mirror, mirror on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: wall, who's the fairest of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Wall? Could use it in like a

    telescope or something.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You said, the greater the

    difference, the greater'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'difference More intense

    function. I that we Were saying'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: what is Snells window?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you''re at like, the bottom of

    a pool, and you look up, there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna be an area that''s clear to

    you, and then the rest of it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will be, I guess, a little bit

    occluded. You basically have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nice little pothole of like

    vision that is clear that that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actual like frame, that window

    is Snells window, right? Yeah, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t know if that''s the most

    articulate way of saying it, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it made me want access to a

    pool.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Can't say I've ever opened
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my eyes. Don''t you like chlorine

    in your eyes? Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where the pain goes away in a

    few days. I also'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't stand too well.
  persid: ''
- desc: Less Salt i
  persid: ''
- desc: So cells window is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when you''re underwater, you''d

    look up, there''s a circle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Inside the circle, you can see

    the blue sky and the palm trees'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or whatever else you have around

    your pool,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'outside that outside of that

    window, you don''t, you don''t get'
  persid: ''
- desc: to see out. You see
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection. What is that last

    word after Water? Slash, air'
  persid: ''
- desc: interface.
  persid: ''
- desc: You're welcome. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What are three important

    geometric effects to consider'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with Micro facet reflection

    models,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'masking, shadowing and inter

    reflection.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I so I
  persid: ''
- desc: just shadowing.
  persid: ''
- desc: I masking happens when?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'When the light hits the surface,

    but You catch you See it? Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: How do you like my pictures?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Some of the mountains. I don''t

    know what happened to them. I in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their example, they use three

    identical mountain ranges. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'got a little bit liberative With

    your creativity there.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thanks. Creative license.

    Exactly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So why does pbrt use a

    specialized BS DF for air and'
  persid: ''
- desc: fur? Because
  persid: ''
- desc: 'otherwise it would be extremely

    expensive computationally, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it also make important sound

    like difficult for Monte'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Carlo, yeah. So there''s a lot of

    parameters that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a lot of ways to improve

    the efficiency of the sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for hair and fur, so they have A

    special one. That''s what I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: looking for. I Sorry.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Could you say that again you''re

    looking for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just could you just repeat what

    you just said? There? Sorry.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So there are
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using COVID diffuse materials

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: more generic BS df and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can do the do hair and fur,

    but it''s very computationally'
  persid: ''
- desc: expensive, and I
  persid: ''
- desc: so it helps to make,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it helps with efficiency, to to

    create a special BS DF, so it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: more efficient
  persid: ''
- desc: and produces
  persid: ''
- desc: better results. And
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, I know how hard it is to

    resist the urge to just have one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing work for everything like

    that, just have one sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'method that works for

    everything, and you just try to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do it as much as you can, but

    then it messes up other things,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then, like, Oh, yeah. Now

    hair works really well, but now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all of a sudden, leaves are

    breaking. You just get a bunch'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of like, weird things, as lame

    as it is, just to Break Your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coat up and create other

    specialized forms i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is the purpose of a go Neo

    photo meter or go Neo, reflect,'
  persid: ''
- desc: Do meter?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the answer you were looking

    for was it measures the SDF?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. I talked about how it had

    two separate, like, two or more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'arms for separating the camera

    and the light, so you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'measure something from all the

    different directions. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what I wrote. But I suppose

    that''s a very indirect way of'
  persid: ''
- desc: saying the same thing.
  persid: ''
- desc: I love. So go Neo,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the etymology of that word Gonio

    is angle do.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s the same the same root,

    and as we see in polygon, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'polygon would be many angles,

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a couple of those sections

    had the Don''t you can skip this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on your first reading. So I

    didn''t, I wasn''t looking for a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'great deal of detail. I just

    thought, Gonio photometer,'
  persid: ''
- desc: photometer. Either
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way, I thought, I thought it was

    cool, and I understood its'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intended purpose right away,

    because there''s a lot of value'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in not having the camera and the

    light just actually attached to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each other, especially if you''re

    trying to measure the way light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hits a surface. Well, that''s

    very limiting. And to have all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these separate arms I can

    picture, you could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computationally have the arms

    all move around and like, take'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it from different angles, and

    you just record it with record'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, just sort of capture that

    you can get a lot of data out of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that from any material or

    whatever.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really good for digitizing new

    materials, like maybe even,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, storing them to using,

    let''s say, a game or something,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just storing a texture by

    capturing lights. That would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a very interesting way of

    talking about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You. So I wanted to show you to

    start of rendering of the manger'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sponge was linked from Last

    Meeting And'
  persid: ''
- desc: it'll be a good problem. No,
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't think so.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is
  persid: ''
- desc: a finished version. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this generates a segmentation

    fault. So I''m not sure how many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'millions of triangles are in

    this. I didn''t do the six. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS, I did the Fifth Level, not

    the sixth level. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can see the starting

    point looks pretty good already.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The sponge appears. It''s just

    the spaces that need to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cleaned up. And you can see on

    the histogram,'
  persid: ''
- desc: there's a peak
  persid: ''
- desc: at 1.065
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the value should as we refine

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: image that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maximum value will go down and

    get us to the point of,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ideally, We''ll be in the range

    of zero to one. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to show that to you

    because of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the relationship with Sir Pinsky

    tetrahedron, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: can See it's going down And
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an example that I did with a

    triangle mesh. So it''s really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one triangle, and I put them, I

    use them twice. So, so first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three values are point one,

    second, three values are point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two, and the third three values

    Are the third point, so indices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 01, and two and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you don''t Have to have them.

    I did two triangles back to back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we could just do 01 and two

    for The triangle and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so here I've combined
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the model with spheres in the

    gasket, dot, PBR, key file with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the triangle, so The triangle is

    the same size as the gasket. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So if we''re doing for

    generating the tetrahedron with'
  persid: ''
- desc: a triangle,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, let''s talk about the

    gasket. If we''re doing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle, how do we create more

    detail in the triangle mesh?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are you referring to? Like the

    interior faces, like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you were to take the triangle

    and let''s say you slap four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles, one of the bottom and

    the three side ones you would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have, like An empty triangle, is

    that What you''re referring to?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so if we do it in 3d the

    tetrahedron. So this is made out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of four triangles, Then the

    first step would be to make the'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we get four. And then
  persid: ''
- desc: we get I got you,
  persid: ''
- desc: but with a triangle, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can construct the model by

    making the triangles so we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: shrinking the triangle
  persid: ''
- desc: by a half
  persid: ''
- desc: and bringing it to vertex and
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can start With The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can Take the triangle then

    we can define three new'
  persid: ''
- desc: triangles and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have three triangles. So

    00102, that''s a new triangle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then 011, and one two,

    that''s another triangle. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we can do 02122, to make a

    third triangle. And we can do'
  persid: ''
- desc: that recursively.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What do you observe these two

    images.'
  persid: ''
- desc: The one on the right looks good.
  persid: ''
- desc: I I want to vote the one on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the left. Well, the one on the

    left is trying its best. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s definitely having troubles

    in figuring out what it wants to'
  persid: ''
- desc: display it looks like.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the one on the right is

    filtered. So what do we want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'filter? So this is a texture.

    It''s the same texture, and it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: one sample per pixel.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we want to filter out
  persid: ''
- desc: what wet from
  persid: ''
- desc: our texture And
  persid: ''
- desc: sorry,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, it's noise,
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe even more specific. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so how do we
  persid: ''
- desc: how do we know we have a
  persid: ''
- desc: of enough samples
  persid: ''
- desc: to reconstruct an image
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when it looks less like The left

    one or more Like the right one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I two times. Highest frequency,
  persid: ''
- desc: highest frequency. Thank you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so if we''re sampling at a rate

    that isn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that doesn''t encompass all the

    high fruit, the highest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frequencies in the signal we''re

    trying to reconstruct. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can think the frequencies

    above the above the sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: rate will be noise.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense? What''s the

    word between we and Two one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank
  persid: ''
- desc: you. You're welcome. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'm going to filter out I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'done some filtering on The

    texture, and it looks a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: better.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And you said anything about that

    highest frequency is noise. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so the frequency that are

    above'
  persid: ''
- desc: the samples and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so If we''re sampling at a rate,

    at'
  persid: ''
- desc: rate, r so,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we sample the radar, then

    we can reconstruct frequencies.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That have a maximum the maximum

    frequency we can reconstruct is'
  persid: ''
- desc: R over two.
  persid: ''
- desc: So anything above r over two So
  persid: ''
- desc: so that makes sense. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think It would be useful if

    there were code examples or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'input file examples to generate

    these examples.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That would be good. That''s that

    seems like a really easy quality'
  persid: ''
- desc: of Life thing. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I wanted to jump to talk a

    bit about area light sources.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Here is the mythical point light

    source, Deluxe. Illuminating a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dragon like mythical Dragon,

    mythical Dragon, Yes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have Very sharp shadows

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s a small disk area, Lake

    source. Let''s compare it to'
  persid: ''
- desc: white light source
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can see some terrible soft

    the other word,'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's look At a large disc.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There. You''re almost non

    existent. How'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s still glass in here,

    guys,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the correct answer would have

    been way outside and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re still in Class. Can you

    guys leave? There''s still COVID.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All right? You now, I feel like

    we should go on for 10 minutes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: We're not done yet. I like,
  persid: ''
- desc: sorry. So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what do you want us to read for

    next week? Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: probably 1011, I think you said,
  persid: ''
- desc: let's look at What
  persid: ''
- desc: let's look at chapter 10,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''ll talk about purlin

    noise as a way to generate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'textures. So if you want to do

    wood and some other very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realistic textures there are. So

    we''ll look at some details of'
  persid: ''
- desc: that, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you for today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Have a good weekend.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sorry. Any questions about the

    assignments, please post into'
