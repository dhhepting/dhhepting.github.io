- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: let's get started Here. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from our quiz, what are two

    benefits of area lakes that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: wasn't really sure I put like
  persid: ''
- desc: softer shadows and more wings,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'deep lighting. Yes, that''s what

    I was thinking of. Hello. I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wondering if you''re gonna join

    your backpack or not. I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: eventually,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the washer was closed, were

    closed. Had to go further. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The squeaking on the whiteboard

    is new. I don''t know if I like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it or not. Some some feedback

    that I''m doing stuff, I guess,'
  persid: ''
- desc: but
  persid: ''
- desc: it's Not as bad as nails on
  persid: ''
- desc: a chalkboard. Definitely. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is that supposed to be effects,

    more realistic lighting effects'
  persid: ''
- desc: looks
  persid: ''
- desc: like an old from here
  persid: ''
- desc: looks like old facts.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you. You're welcome.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not creating new coining new

    words in class here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? I just, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a comment he makes, or they

    make in chapter 12 here is that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the range of lights is limited

    by the Physically Based'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Rendering paradigm they can''t

    have lights that do non physical'
  persid: ''
- desc: things,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not physically accurate things.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that that could have, that

    has has been an effective mode'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of operation in the past, but in

    the grand scheme of things, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better to use a physically based

    approach, because then Things'
  persid: ''
- desc: work together better and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there are four different

    kinds of lights, four different'
  persid: ''
- desc: categories of lights,
  persid: ''
- desc: point light sources,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directional light sources, area

    light sources and infinite'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lights, so they don''t have

    geometry associated with them,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But provide radiance to rays

    that escape the scene and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when We have legs in The scene

    We Need I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we don''t have lights,

    we''re not going to be able to'
  persid: ''
- desc: see much of the scene.
  persid: ''
- desc: If we have a case like this,
  persid: ''
- desc: where there is an area late
  persid: ''
- desc: so efficiencies can be gained. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we focus samples, so
  persid: ''
- desc: in that cone
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that connects the point on the

    surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: to the sphere.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So those are the directions

    where'
  persid: ''
- desc: we'll find illumination.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense? So if we

    just I,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, if we just I to focus our

    samples and the directions from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which the light is coming, then

    we''ll get a much quicker, more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Efficient rendering and less

    error In the image, less noise I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s a dragon with a point

    light source,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or lit by a point light source.

    What do you think about this one'
  persid: ''
- desc: hard shadowing?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, very hard shadows. The

    light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'must be very close Because the

    shadows are very short. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s see what clues we have

    about where the light is. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so this seems to be a

    shadow from here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: This is a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is the shadow from here.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''d say if we were the dragon,

    it would be just over, like on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our left side, like right here.

    If we''re the dragon,'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's go it's close.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you''re that close over here,

    I think this shadow would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: longer,
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe more to the
  persid: ''
- desc: side, almost to the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'side, yeah, maybe thinking like

    right here, because,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I guess, hard to say without

    duplicating it ourselves. Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so does it look impressive? This

    is a cool picture.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Depends on what you''re trying to

    accomplish.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If I want to make a cool

    picture. Have I succeeded? I it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe this is a cool picture in

    the 90s. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: What do you think, cool or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not? Binous. Do you have a

    thought about this? No,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, I Okay. Astra full, what

    do you think about this image?'
  persid: ''
- desc: It's
  persid: ''
- desc: different. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's just
  persid: ''
- desc: an expression of ambivalence. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, 12.4 I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what do you notice about

    this? Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: so it seems like it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not the same place as the

    first point light source is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spotlight, definitely slightly

    different spot.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it may or may not be the same

    position, But the difference is,'
  persid: ''
- desc: because It's a spotlight, so I
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're specifying a cone.
  persid: ''
- desc: So instead of having
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the light emitted in all

    directions from that point,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we specify a cone, and that

    gives the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is area on the outside of the

    comb, like around the edges of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the comb are softer, where the

    shadow that''s being reflected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the dragon is still hard.

    Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, so there are two angles

    here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So the total
  persid: ''
- desc: the total width,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s the whole angle. And then

    there''s the theta i'
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, theta is in the i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, so the two angles are fall

    off start and total width. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything within fall off, up to

    the angle of fall off start is'
  persid: ''
- desc: fully illuminated, and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up to the total width, it drops

    off.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we see the dragon in the in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the center here is fully

    illuminated. Then as the angle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drops, as the angle goes to the

    total width, it falls off to'
  persid: ''
- desc: zero.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is this one a little more cool

    than the other? One'
  persid: ''
- desc: more interesting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to draw your attention, more

    stuff to analyze and look at on'
  persid: ''
- desc: it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so here''s steam runner

    with projection light using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: grid image.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have an image.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's like a slide projector.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone familiar with slide

    projectors?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I Okay, okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Using a projector image like

    that, you could put, like a'
  persid: ''
- desc: colored image in color
  persid: ''
- desc: the light coming out.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s like if we had that exact

    same grid image. But the grid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image wasn''t white background.

    It had like a orange. It would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'project an orange hue over the

    Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I, I wonder if there are, if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you just wanted one color, you

    could specify the spectra of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light. But if you want to vary

    things, maybe that would be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: good way to do it,
  persid: ''
- desc: to project the texture.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Go neophotometric diagram, legs

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: do you remember
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our Gonio photometer setup?

    We''re measuring'
  persid: ''
- desc: the BRDF
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for different materials by

    varying the light source and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'viewing position. So this is a

    similar idea. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the emitted intensity is

    defined in a fixed set of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directions on the unit sphere,

    and the intensity is found by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolating intensities of

    adjacent samples and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so the first one
  persid: ''
- desc: mostly
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eliminates in its up direction,

    only A small amount of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'illumination in the down

    direction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s this is up and this is

    down.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Light B is a light that most

    illuminates in the down'
  persid: ''
- desc: direction. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s an example where they

    Have both up and down'
  persid: ''
- desc: contributions. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I wonder if we can compare 12

    point 12 with 12.3 we did You?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Did image diff. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's try it out. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Wow, that's a lot. I
  persid: ''
- desc: No, it's not a banana.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a lot of subtlety

    between those two Images. Ah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more. Shadow Play around the

    outside.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, the heart shadow

    underneath looks like it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: staying in the same spot. I
  persid: ''
- desc: off so
  persid: ''
- desc: this shell, Shadow
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the dragon, it seems like

    light is from'
  persid: ''
- desc: behind the dragon, and
  persid: ''
- desc: this part
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is very subtle. It''s hard to

    detect in the original image. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I see we're sure.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Really look, you can see it''s

    there, the 12, three.'
  persid: ''
- desc: It's hard to pick out.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s there. It''s actually, if

    you look, it''s got like a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit of a red hue where that is

    actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming through. So it''s like

    it''s reflecting off the dragon'
  persid: ''
- desc: and going Down on the ground.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's It's
  persid: ''
- desc: a
  persid: ''
- desc: bit there. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re Interested in the

    emitted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'power of distant light, and an

    approximation of that is to Find'
  persid: ''
- desc: the disk
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that can be inscribed in the

    sphere that bounds the scene'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'elements and oriented towards

    the direction of the distant'
  persid: ''
- desc: light
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that gives enough precision for

    what they need to do in you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not a very it''s not an

    accurate estimate of the emitted'
  persid: ''
- desc: power, but
  persid: ''
- desc: I won't underestimate it.
  persid: ''
- desc: So when we get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to area lengths, we have a

    geometry associated with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'emitter. And this is comparison

    of a small disk and a large'
  persid: ''
- desc: disk. Do
  persid: ''
- desc: '12 point 15. Is this becoming

    more cool or not?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, I think that''s I like

    Being'
  persid: ''
- desc: I like be overly, yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in this case, we''re Taking

    area lights and putting them at'
  persid: ''
- desc: infinity.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So environment lighting, so

    taking an image as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specifying the lighting for the

    scene in an'
  persid: ''
- desc: environment map.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the first one is illuminated

    by a few area lights, and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second one is illuminated with

    mid day sky'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light from an environment map.

    And C is using a sunset'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'environment map. So this is area

    lakes. This is mid day.'
  persid: ''
- desc: This is sunset. And I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'prefer infinite area lengths

    because I find it illuminates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the objects from all sides

    better and is more realistic.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s the mid day

    environment map.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Here's The Sunset And
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's lots of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'environment maps available On

    the web And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is environment
  persid: ''
- desc: 'map illuminating the dragon

    Model,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'morning skylight. Environment

    Map through two samples per'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixel. A is rendered with

    uniform sampling distribution. B'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendered with distributed

    samples distributed according to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the environment map image pixels

    and C, rendered using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compensated distribution that

    skips sampling unimportant parts'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the image, all images took

    essentially the same amount of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time to render, though B has

    over 38,000 times lower MSE than'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A and C further improves MSE by

    a factor of 1.52'
  persid: ''
- desc: what's MSE mean
  persid: ''
- desc: squared error? Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s quite an improvement.

    What'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's impressive.
  persid: ''
- desc: Very Clean that last one I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in this case, the portal is

    the window. So we''re trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'focus our samples. Our goal is

    to focus the samples out the'
  persid: ''
- desc: window and
  persid: ''
- desc: see that looks a bit better.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Here''s the idea Of the Four Pole

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: any thoughts about that?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought I would go through

    some of the questions that were'
  persid: ''
- desc: suggested for the final Going to
  persid: ''
- desc: not show you. I
  persid: ''
- desc: names of people i
  persid: ''
- desc: What is the Nyquist rate? The
  persid: ''
- desc: and what's the answer? I
  persid: ''
- desc: two times, yes, remember it
  persid: ''
- desc: was the two times something. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so choices are ambidextrous,

    left handed, right handed. Nd,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'indeed, there is no default

    coordinate system. I love'
  persid: ''
- desc: You. Kevin, yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is that word of the minimal

    coordinate system is, is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: supposed to be used
  persid: ''
- desc: in pbrt? Yes?
  persid: ''
- desc: What?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One what needs to be accounted

    for to prevent textures from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'being too blurry. You choices

    are camera integrators, angles,'
  persid: ''
- desc: bounding boxes or lights you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which one is not a member of the

    exposure triangle. Aperture ISO,'
  persid: ''
- desc: shutter speed
  persid: ''
- desc: or angle and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what is the primary purpose of a

    bi directional scattering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distribution function, to define

    the geometry of a surface, for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'array intersections, to model

    how light is transported through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participating media, to describe

    how light is reflected and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transmitted at a surface to

    simulate the spectral response'
  persid: ''
- desc: to the camera sensors, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'describe how light is reflected

    and transmitted at A Surface i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What does the rendering equation

    primarily describe how light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'travels through a vacuum, how

    surfaces reflect Light, how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'textures are mapped, how pixels

    are colored.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the suggested answer is B,

    how services reflect plane from'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm wondering if that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Answer is more nuanced than

    that. I will'
  persid: ''
- desc: think about that a bit more.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Which of the following

    statements'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about spectral rendering is

    true, but PBR TV four performs'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering computation

    computations using only RGB'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color values. Spectral rendering

    in PBR TV four involves'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'converting all spectral data to

    gray scale before processing PB.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'PBR TV four performs rendering

    computation using Point Sample'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spectra, limiting the use of RGB

    color to scene description'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inputs and final image output.

    PBR TV four system does not'
  persid: ''
- desc: support spectral rendering. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so use Point Sample spectra,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can specify things in RGB,

    but internally.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that was the third answer.

    That was the third one, yeah. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: I was thinking it was, it
  persid: ''
- desc: wasn't 100% Sure.
  persid: ''
- desc: I What Is blends, Law I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as technology advances,

    rendering time remains constant'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what are the three Main physical

    processes that infect The'
  persid: ''
- desc: distribution of radiance? What
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I explain the importance of

    Monte Carlo integration In the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering algorithms described

    in the book.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Why is it commonly used in

    realistic image synthesis? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A so Monte Carlo methods provide

    a way, a straightforward way, to'
  persid: ''
- desc: get a numerical solution to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'integrals. That would be

    difficult otherwise I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re still in class. We''re

    still in class every'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what is a texel And how is it

    different From a pixel? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: so I will post
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the questions after a bit of

    editing, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions or concerns. So

    we''ll do a review on Thursday,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then the final will be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the following Thursday on my

    birthday, yes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and which time I will be 60

    years old. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cupcake. I didn''t think about

    that. You finish the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exam, you get a cupcake. We''re

    supposed to bring them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Actually, we''re supposed to

    bring them. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right, yeah, cupcakes aren''t

    we''re thinking about doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: cupcakes for the 50th
  persid: ''
- desc: 'celebration, but they were like,

    three or $4 a cupcake, so it was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more cost effective to get a

    slab cake. Anyway. Gathering'
  persid: ''
- desc: on the green in the summer.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you for today.
  persid: ''
