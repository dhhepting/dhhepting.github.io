- desc: 'Go ahead. Welcome to

    meeting Two of 405-820-5805, The'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me, that''s the wrong course.

    Yes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone notice that before
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ours is fine, yours is fine,

    four or five plus 805.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's try refreshing it. 202510,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'alright, so the attendance, like

    someone that''s just, I just go'
  persid: ''
- desc: from the ER courses. I just
  persid: ''
- desc: 'went through your courses. Yeah,

    yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: mental
  persid: ''
- desc: illness just like personified.
  persid: ''
- desc: I hope he loves his
  persid: ''
- desc: craft. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I asked a question about the

    software I''m going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: so seven people have answered. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so five people have said, Yes,

    one of them is our TA. Three'
  persid: ''
- desc: people said, not sure.
  persid: ''
- desc: Do you have so, yeah, but
  persid: ''
- desc: today, I so, yeah, I think
  persid: ''
- desc: you have a Mac. So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve had good, a positive

    Experience installing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: software on a mat I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if You have c plus plus 17

    available,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and They use C make For the

    configuration and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay so I didn''t say Happy

    Thursday. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i went to ask this question

    about pbrt Because i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i One I''m talking with Science

    and Information Services about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'options for making pprt

    Available on a lab computer and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is, is that You''re

    not going to have,'
  persid: ''
- desc: have to have
  persid: ''
- desc: a computer that can run this and
  persid: ''
- desc: but it's
  persid: ''
- desc: it's good to try. It's good. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS, so I don''t know what options

    there are, so I just want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'encourage you to explore

    building the software on your'
  persid: ''
- desc: own computer
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and if it doesn''t work, we''ll

    figure it out. Does that seem'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? Wiki scheduler. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Good question.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, can you put a link to your

    site on the your versus page for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those people that don''t have it,

    guessing that you''re putting a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lot of stuff on there, or some

    stuff on there, like the'
  persid: ''
- desc: pictures and
  persid: ''
- desc: stuff? Yes, I
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I will
  persid: ''
- desc: 'add some more links. Thank you.

    So Laura is the only one who'
  persid: ''
- desc: signed up.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you, Laura. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m just going to Talk about

    the quiz questions. Any other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions that came up From our

    first Meeting?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one word, two processor or two

    steps'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'needed for literate programming.

    So literate programming is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe save file, Create a single

    file on that I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: any suggestions about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what to call those two

    processes? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, what is called Weaver.

    Yeah, so this is Weaver,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and this is the tangler i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Has anyone used latex for

    document processing?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s quite, quite nice, I think.

    But it''s, it''s using, it''s its'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'own example of literate

    programming. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what do we need to simulate to

    create images that appear'
  persid: ''
- desc: real, real.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thanks.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, light,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: perspective
  persid: ''
- desc: tell me more about perspective.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So having things get smaller,

    off into the distance, and to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make sure that everything

    appears to be like, you know,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things are in front of other

    things you don''t see the thing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'behind it, necessarily. To make

    sure everything is lined up in a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way that makes sense, doesn''t

    cut through each other. Now,'
  persid: ''
- desc: still clipping.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. Okay. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Who has The Minion?
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry notifications, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you so it''s important To have

    the physical models correct and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a lot of the stuff we''re

    going to deal with is about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Light and how to cap, how to

    model it,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and this is done within The

    context and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we might have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different lenses on a camera,

    different effects.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what is the last or second?

    Last Word say'
  persid: ''
- desc: correct Ways. Thank You. Do?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then the third question was

    about how the color, the final'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Color of a pixel, is determined

    in an image. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: A Z, buffer.
  persid: ''
- desc: Said, buffer, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: I used first pick.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So these Are screen based

    algorithms and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so they''re focused on

    visibility.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And How do we decide the value

    we associate with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the different lighting, like

    specular lighting and stuff like'
  persid: ''
- desc: That or those are helpful.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Diffusion, yeah, the back trace

    of all rays of the light that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would enter that particular

    pixel and the color for each ray'
  persid: ''
- desc: i
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, So let's say I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so We follow a ray From the eye

    point and'
  persid: ''
- desc: through A pixel into The scene.
  persid: ''
- desc: And So if We you
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we send the ray out into the

    scene through the pixel and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and follow its interaction. We

    don''t necessarily have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'complete model of all the

    interactions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so some of the examples we

    looked at the other day had 1200'
  persid: ''
- desc: samples per pixel. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you squish this computer

    down?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Please? Thank you. You're
  persid: ''
- desc: welcome.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m going to show a video that''s

    mentioned in chapter one. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a Physically Based Rendering

    production system that'
  persid: ''
- desc: was done,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'done by blue sky. Anyone

    familiar with the Ice Age'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'movies, this is the same people

    i'
  persid: ''
- desc: The projector is not on or not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this was nominated for an Oscar

    in 1998 The'
  persid: ''
- desc: CS, Thank You.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The skies as deep as you can

    Your'
  persid: ''
- desc: eyes, Won't You? Ground.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Five words you pronounce wrong

    two years before your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'brain starts shutting down,

    dementia'
  persid: ''
- desc: is now known as type three
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diabetes. I''m surprised you

    didn''t get interrupted with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: math.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, I decided to wait till the

    end.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So what did you think?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What kind of like claymation to

    a certain degree, kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reminded me of like puppets,

    almost like they''re Aristotle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's not i
  persid: ''
- desc: It's not like we have to choose
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between one or the other, so we

    can create different models and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Put them in environments
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then just simulate The graphics,

    simulate the lighting.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so I
  persid: ''
- desc: it so the idea is, as we get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better information about

    different different aspects of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the physical world take better

    measurements, then we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generate more accurate images.

    And so there are, there are'
  persid: ''
- desc: integrals that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can''t be solved analytically,

    except for very simple cases,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but we''re going to use numerical

    methods and the random sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'algorithms to to realize images

    Based on those properties. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All right, yeah, I was just

    reading the caption on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: picture
  persid: ''
- desc: so I Does
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that look like a Good

    photograph? Yeah?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have some basic elements

    of ray tracing Here I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I align too many things there.

    Let''s Try again. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can change this around. So

    instead of the film in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'camera to the pinhole, you can

    put the eye at the pinhole'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position and set up The image

    plane here and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what is returned As the

    contribution or the Energy'
  persid: ''
- desc: collected along that Ray and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I shouldn''t write so low on The

    board. Sorry,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s only a problem in the

    core,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, but it''s the pen isn''t

    working so well either. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when we send the ray out into

    the environment, we need to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able to do the ray object

    intersections,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so it''s better, more quickly

    we can do that, the better it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the processing speed when we

    have 10s of billions of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles in a scene, we would

    like to deal only with the ones'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we really need to so there

    are acceleration structures that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are important to employ. So the

    light sources. So in 315 we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talked about point light

    sources, but they don''t really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exist in the real world. So we

    have an area,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there are different ways to

    model light sources and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'properties they have. So we''re

    talking about the location of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lights and how they distribute

    their energy throughout space.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Visibility. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is the object visible from

    the light source so we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spawn? Rays to check that

    visibility, light scattering at'
  persid: ''
- desc: surfaces.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what kind of material is

    being so, how do we describe the'
  persid: ''
- desc: material
  persid: ''
- desc: in the scene? I
  persid: ''
- desc: it indirect light transport,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because light can arrive at a

    surface after bouncing off or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'passing through other surfaces.

    So if we have glass,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we bottled glass or the

    atmosphere and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here and how rays continue In

    space, Ray propagation i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll just say fig 1.2 so they''ve

    advertised the figures being'
  persid: ''
- desc: accessible and
  persid: ''
- desc: add URLs, they don't work,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at least not The ones I''ve tried

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is An example of one that

    doesn''t work. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'work. So here''s an example of

    visibility. So we have two light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sources, and it''s surface is

    illuminated by or the point P is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'illuminated by the one on The

    left, but not the one on The'
  persid: ''
- desc: right. So
  persid: ''
- desc: so here we're looking, I
  persid: ''
- desc: Looking at a bi directional I
  persid: ''
- desc: so this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'head is Using a sub surface

    scattering'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that means
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light is scattered after It hits

    the surface and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so stop with this one. I think

    so here''s a one we''re seeing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here is based on the original

    algorithm by Turner with it in'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1980'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it has lots of mirrored

    surfaces, which which is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forte of the ray tracing

    approach. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those shadows are awfully deep

    considering how reflective those'
  persid: ''
- desc: spheres are.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s only looking at a few

    directions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s see what happens if we do

    stochastic, progressive photon'
  persid: ''
- desc: mapping. There we go.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can see that these are

    made of glass, and we can see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The light that''s transmitted.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: here, here and here I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so in this case, the shadows are
  persid: ''
- desc: solid.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, they''re solid. So we''re

    just testing whether, whether we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cast a shadow from the spheres

    above the plane and but here'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're using
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The material properties. So

    let''s Look where else changes'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: we're out of time. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so can you please look at

    getting the software installed'
  persid: ''
- desc: on your computer? And I put
  persid: ''
- desc: on the wiki I have a
  persid: ''
- desc: to link properly,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I started a page for pbrt. So

    if you want, want to have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion there or post your

    experience and you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I will also add a class

    discussion'
  persid: ''
- desc: forum
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that discussion as well, and

    then, and then we''ll take it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from there. So thank you very

    much for today. Have a great'
