- desc: 'You like me to ask the

    question again,'
  persid: ''
- desc: sure,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the assignments, you have

    them due on April 8. We were'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wondering if you''re we''d be

    willing to extend the deadline'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to possibly the 15th, but I

    thought you mentioned you would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accept them until then, so We''re

    wanting some clarification.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, okay, you
  persid: ''
- desc: now, assignments you
  persid: ''
- desc: So the way it's phrased, i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i Sorry I was late today. I was

    not keeping an eye on The clock.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It seems to be struggling to

    make a connection and'
  persid: ''
- desc: let me try the other part.
  persid: ''
- desc: I fingers crossed And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so that''s, that''s, if

    that''s the way it''s set up now,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can submit to labor 15

    with a 20% penalty. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Who would like to have april 15

    with a smaller penalty? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was wondering if you would be a

    little bit later on The initial'
  persid: ''
- desc: due
  persid: ''
- desc: 'date or 11th last year classes.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we did that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can still have the end cut

    off be the 15th, just change the'
  persid: ''
- desc: initial duty to be april
  persid: ''
- desc: 11. Will be April 13.
  persid: ''
- desc: Who likes that idea? Do?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, let me see if I can happen
  persid: ''
- desc: quickly. Here. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so taste that I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, okay, I think I successfully

    made that change. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and she got a message about it,

    yeah, okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the other question we have

    was content of the final exam.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is supposed to be the

    content of it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more so? Is it cumulative? Is it

    more so focusing on post'
  persid: ''
- desc: midterm, etc?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. Yes, okay, so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so as I said, Before I welcome

    your input, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: and suggestions I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so that''s My advertisement

    for Your input. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so after the midterm, I said
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I''m going to ask the same

    kinds of questions on the final'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if You''re familiar with the

    midterm, that''d be A good you'
  persid: ''
- desc: try it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the final will be

    comprehensive, whole semester,'
  persid: ''
- desc: mid to more Questions And
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: sources We've looked At You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so I''m going to ask you to

    show that you understand the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'concepts involved, rather than,

    you know how to write it the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'integral or something like that.

    Does that seem okay? Yep.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Will it be like a similar format

    to the midterm or it''s short'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'term, like short answer your

    questions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Will there be any multiple

    choice questions on there?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Would you like multiple choice

    questions?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Some would be nice.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They take less time because I

    ran out of time mostly on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first victory. Yeah, then again,

    we''ll have more time on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the final
  persid: ''
- desc: 'section. There''s a good like,

    say 40% of the exam is multiple'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'choice. Gives us a little less

    stress. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so we had some issues

    getting started on time for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: midterm,
  persid: ''
- desc: no matter how
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I thought I was prepared to deal

    with The eventualities. Then'
  persid: ''
- desc: they came to bite me.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So if you want a number of

    multiple choice questions, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll make this a question, the

    quiz question for you over the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weekend to think up. So what are

    some good multiple choice'
  persid: ''
- desc: questions for the exam? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you want, like the potential

    answers, or do you want just the'
  persid: ''
- desc: question, like,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we give you questions

    suggestions, do you want us to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to give you what we are

    thinking? The answer should be,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah. Well, I think it''s

    especially true For multiple'
  persid: ''
- desc: choice questions that I
  persid: ''
- desc: it not sure why I stopped.
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, that one, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how would you like my

    multiple choice question on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: quiz for today? Oh, yeah. I get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the matching one select for the

    six drop six possibilities.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, that was
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nice. That actually worked, I

    think well, because then you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually still have to know

    which one belongs to which,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, as well as whether it''s

    increasing or decreasing, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: what it's doing that's moving
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a little bit there. Oh, there we

    go.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, yeah, that's cool.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I rendering, or if it was

    actually a panic,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where did you get your screen

    saver background'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kinds with the operating system?

    Oh, well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: Daryl, to see what don't
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know if there are other ones

    that are available, but this is,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is called Sequoia, this

    release, which is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 1015 1015 Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 1015 Yeah, 15.33
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, yeah, I think it was 10

    to Mark 15, but it''s really not'
  persid: ''
- desc: anymore.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense for the

    exam? Okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'provides the clarity that we

    needed.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Wow, about the assignments,

    yeah, a rubric'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the TA uses to grade.

    Because, like, when we get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'grades back, we get like, 2.7

    out of three. Like, that''s like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a good instead of an exemplary.

    But like, I don''t know what''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like missing to go from like

    that good grade to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exemplary, or is it just kind of

    arbitrary?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I it's not arbitrary, but
  persid: ''
- desc: I think we struggle To i
  persid: ''
- desc: to make them Clear, so much
  persid: ''
- desc: anxiety. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would it would still be

    helpful for me to fill that in.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I think so, okay, we'll work
  persid: ''
- desc: on it. I want to say here, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the way that I put this together

    was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the comment would be the same

    for exemplary plus exemplary and'
  persid: ''
- desc: exemplary minus. It's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just like a near miss and above

    and beyond or what.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the issue is trying to

    differentiate'
  persid: ''
- desc: those three levels of each each
  persid: ''
- desc: section that's understandable,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so exemplary, plus that''s full

    marks and and then it goes so'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's multiplied the way the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points available for the

    category times 1.0 for that one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then it''s point nine, point

    8.7, and it goes down to point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one. So if you, if you submitted

    something, you''ll get a 10th of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the marks anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It should have explained this

    before.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the idea, though, is that not

    everybody''s going to get an'
  persid: ''
- desc: exemplary plus or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not, everyone should expect to

    get an exemplary plus. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think he was more wondering, how

    does he get feedback on what he'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did to find out how he could

    improve to get a better chance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of having an exemplary closed,

    basically a worded rubric, like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a worded rubric where you need

    to do this or you''re missing'
  persid: ''
- desc: this.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, okay, successfully having

    the tetrahedra is worth this?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like, that''s like the

    requirement to get here, doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the proper texturing of the desk

    is enough for this. It gives you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a little bit more guidance and

    direction, what specifically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re looking for, so we could

    be more on the mark.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Just something to think about, I

    suppose, first teacher, it would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'help a bit for like, what

    specifically, specifically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re asking for, as opposed

    to, like the general, yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so do you want to talk

    about, do you want to talk with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me about the feedback you got

    from the first assignment.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, I still have office hours,

    although no one comes to see me.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, that''s right, you do. You''re

    the exception that proves the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rule. Anyway. You can do that,

    and we can talk about things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more and more specifically. And

    I will if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the comments I''ve written in

    the past in the rubric are maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a little more general than the

    specifics that we just you just'
  persid: ''
- desc: suggested. Yeah, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s got to be a healthy

    balance between the two words.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The grading is general, but it''s

    more the feedback that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking for, some more specifics

    on, not necessarily the general'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, the general grading, like,

    Okay, I know what I mark. I try'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to tell people, Hey, this is why

    you lost the parks, or this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what you were missing. So I

    think it''s more that aspect that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re looking for of, okay,

    we''ve lost the marks. Okay, fair'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enough. You''ve broken it down

    into which parts like the Create'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scene, all that stuff. But when

    we don''t get that exemplary,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'plus having an ID, getting more

    specifics on our particular case'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as to why we''re not getting that

    okay. How could we have taken it'
  persid: ''
- desc: to that next step?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, does that make sense? Yes,

    it does. So I that''s an easier'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fix to get some more comments

    from the marker.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Am I wrong? Is that kind of like

    for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'document, the run parts like,

    where the Analyze? Parts like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what more analysis? The Green

    Scene is kind of understandable.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like, yeah, I made a pretty

    simple scene I didn''t really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like that''s way too much for

    increasing way more extra'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'objects than the virus that

    would kind of makes more sense.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Why? How could it document

    better? How could I analyze it?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: all right, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll get some more clarity about

    that for you about the what was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'done, and then what will what

    we''ll use for the assignments'
  persid: ''
- desc: that are coming up. Still, I
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you. You're welcome.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, So our quiz for Today,

    we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s what accounts for The

    increase in radiance along'
  persid: ''
- desc: array? Do?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so The reduction,
  persid: ''
- desc: the reduction
  persid: ''
- desc: in radians, radiance
  persid: ''
- desc: 'due to the conversion of light

    to another form of energy,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, emission
  persid: ''
- desc: 'radiance that''s added to The

    environment. It''s like the'
  persid: ''
- desc: bottom one, last one.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Scattering is radiance heading

    in one direction that is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattered to another other

    directions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I that's number two.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Declares the particles. Yeah, so

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now is it generally accurate to

    say that radiance is constant'
  persid: ''
- desc: along rays between surfaces, no
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in a vacuum, and since most

    places are in a vacuum, it must'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be true. That''s the assumption

    that all spaces are vacuum.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's change.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then again, there''s also

    radiation in The vacuum. So it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: like I
  persid: ''
- desc: the answer not saved number one,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'got two out of three because you

    didn''t answer the third'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t answer the first one.

    Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we did pretty well with

    that one. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So we''re not always

    working in a vacuum.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like, generally, like 90% of the

    universe is a vacuum. I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: you've got backwards. 99%
  persid: ''
- desc: universal isn't in a vacuum.
  persid: ''
- desc: Mostly speaks about
  persid: ''
- desc: you big part of the universe.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re talking Earth, okay,

    that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: interesting. Cary centric,
  persid: ''
- desc: Earth. Is there vacuum?
  persid: ''
- desc: Watching Earth atmosphere? I
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some null scattering in him and

    homogeneous. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where it varies throughout

    space.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The degree of scattering will

    change depending on where in'
  persid: ''
- desc: the material or space.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can make it homogeneous by

    adding I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which makes it easier to sample

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t, this is a five o''clock

    this is a five minute video. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I, I and I start to look at but

    think this is from Unreal'
  persid: ''
- desc: Engine. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hey, Lewis, as I said to you,

    the Twitter D is Henning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Greenstein phase function, you

    receive this light vector. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be your sun, can be your

    moonlight, and, yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anisotropy, Will you act as the

    how much amount around the faux'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'supply you want this value to be

    distributed in a circular way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the light vector source.

    What this means? It means that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this this position here for your

    light vector, you will be taking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into account. And if we look at

    inside this, this function, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is quite simple. It''s really

    math, okay, and you see that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basically, you take your value

    for an isotropy. And we you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draw, you see that you have pi

    here, draw like a mask, circular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mask around the focus, or the

    origin of your of your light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source. And to make it even

    easier, I will show how I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using here. So this is the pure

    light vector and an isotropic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value here, and I multiply by

    this alpha, this alpha from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these material parameter

    collection I''m using as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intensity for my sunlight. And

    you see that is also I use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same, the same function here for

    the the moonlight. Okay, so this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the intensity, and this is

    the color teaching the end. I am'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplying here, so I have my

    color, I have my intensity, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m multiplying and giving this

    color to something as my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material is a ray Martian

    material. And like here of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drawing each point, then you can

    see, this is my skin, which I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use Ray Marsh, and this is my

    moonlight. Here you have just a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture with a light behind it.

    And the intensity for the white'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in this is given by another

    value, but the that material'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameter collection, it is

    represented here. So as it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scholars in RGB, and the alpha

    is the intensity. So if I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'increase this intensity, you see

    the effect. Okay. Now look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this. It is brighter around the

    source than it is far from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source. And it is given here

    like, if I use like, point minus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point three, you see that

    running lighter. Even'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if I look here back, you see

    that it''s darker. The effect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also contributes to the color

    here. So anisotropic minus point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nine, you hear very strong light

    and you see that basically far'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'away is completely dark. And if

    I just use like minus one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ll be completely black

    because we are like, constant'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'effect work. One seems to be no

    effect at all.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Point two,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you see that we have the light

    totally distributed, because,'
  persid: ''
- desc: again, it is a circle,
  persid: ''
- desc: so the intensity
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the light color is spread

    everywhere around the surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: like a halo shape,
  persid: ''
- desc: point one,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero, minus one, you see that is

    Getting the effect is coming'
  persid: ''
- desc: closer to the center.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And like minus six, it is the

    most expected for a behavior for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moonlight, of course, sunlight,

    you can''t use this much, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s two exaggerated for minus

    one. So rated four, minus one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seven I could use building use

    at smaller steps here. I guess'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this explains, well how the

    function works. See, you go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back so too long a video site.

    Anyway,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a pretty cool use case.

    Yep, yeah, because if you have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that moon phases and say again

    like that, then you can have it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that the degree of light

    changes based off the moon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'phase. You have it sort of

    automated, to a degree'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'full moon, as opposed to

    Crescent Moon, etc. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this was
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I linked to the set of slides

    last'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'week when I didn''t have a

    meeting. But here''s a video of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'his presentation of the slide.

    So I thought maybe that would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a useful thing to look at. It''s

    about bit longer than the time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have left, but we can watch

    till our class ends, and if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: have
  persid: ''
- desc: questions, you can ask.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So first of all, it pleasure,

  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thanks for Matty. Thanks for the

    introduction.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hi. So some of you may have seen

    this background talk before.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve done quite a few

    modifications to this here, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we won''t all be all packed so,

    but one thing that hasn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'changed is that over the next 15

    minutes, I''ll be going from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'physics underlying shading to

    the math used to describe it. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what is light? From physics

    standpoint, it''s technically an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'electromagnetic transverse wave,

    which sounds very fancy, but it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually means that the

    electromagnetic field wiggles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sideways as the energy

    propagates forward. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wiggling in the electromagnetic

    field can be seen as two couple'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fields, electric and magnetic,

    wiggling at 90 degrees to each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other. Electromagnetic waves can

    be characterized by frequency,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the number of wiggles they do in

    a second or wavelength, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distance between two wave peaks.

    Now engineers have in various'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disciplines have to deal with

    electromagnetic wavelengths'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ranging from gamma waves that

    have wavelengths of less than'
  persid: ''
- desc: '100 than a nanometer, to extreme

    low frequency radio waves, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those waves are 10s of 1000s of

    kilometers long and everything'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in between, but the range that

    we can actually see with our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eyes is both a tiny, tiny subset

    of that range only from 400 to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nanometers for pipeline to 700

    nanometers for red light. Now to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give you a bit of intuition for

    what 400 to 700 nanometers'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually is, because the

    physical size of this will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'become irrelevant later in the

    talk. So on the left, you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see visible light wavelengths

    relative to this sort of gray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cylinder. That''s a single strand

    of spider silk, which is one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'micron in width. And on the

    right, to give some extra'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'context, you see that same

    strand of spider silk, how it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be relative to the width of

    human hair. So, you know, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something that''s very, very

    tiny, but still it''s, I mean,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can see a strand of spider

    silk with your naked eye, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these are fairly close to that,

    maybe half or a third of that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So far, what I''ve shown you are

    simple sine waves that have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'single unique wavelength. And

    this the simplest possible type'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of light wave, but it isn''t at

    all a common type of light wave.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Most light waves contain many

    different wavelengths with a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different amount of energy in

    each this is typically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'visualized as a spectral power

    distribution, or SPD, for short.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'As you can see in the upper

    left, the SPD for this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particular wave shows that this

    wave''s energy is all in a single'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wavelength. It''s all in the

    single wavelength in the green'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part of the spectrum. And this

    is typically what you will see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in light emitted by laser. So

    it''s sort of a Dirac delta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function in the SPD. In

    actuality, lasers actually have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a little bit of bandwidth, but

    they are extremely narrow. Now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here we see the SPD is for red,

    green and blue laser that h'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplied by factor and added

    together to produce the SPD on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the right. Now this kind of

    spectral power distribution is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'similar to what you would see in

    life a laser projector. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'laser projectors are starting to

    show up in higher end theaters,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'newer theaters. They offer wide

    contrast, wide gamut. They have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some advantages. So this is an

    extremely spiky spectrum, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s still very simple, and it''s

    not one sine wave, it''s three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sine waves. And if we look at

    the actual waveform, we can see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that after adding up these three

    simple sine waves, we end up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with something that maybe looks

    a little more complicated than a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'single sine wave, but not that

    much more so. I mean, you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see some underlying frequency,

    and there''s some larger reads'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there. However, most light that

    you''ll see in nature doesn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look like that. SPD looks more

    like this. This is the SPD for D'
  persid: ''
- desc: '65 which is a standard spectrum

    for white light, outdoors light,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you can see also the

    waveform that it will create,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is, of course, very

    complex. Basically, the broader,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the more detailed SPD, the more

    chaotic looking the way from a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'form will be, and the less a

    simple sine wave. Now an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interesting thing is that

    although these two SPDs could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not be more different, one is

    extremely smooth and broad, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other one is three delta

    functions, but they have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exact same color appearance to

    humans. Now, the y axis isn''t at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the same scale, so obviously

    spikes are higher to compensate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the lack of width, but the

    fact that human color vision'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cannot distinguish between these

    two signals tells us that human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color vision is incredibly

    lossy. It maps the infinite'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dimensional SPD down to a three

    dimensional perceptual space.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now if we look at this wave form

    in vacuum, it will propagate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forever. The electric and

    magnetic wave will sort of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enforce each other, and they''ll

    just keep on going and going but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for rendering what we care about

    is what happens when this light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wave interacts with matter. Now

    what happens is, when an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'electromagnetic wave hits a

    bunch of atoms or molecules, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'polarizes them. That means that

    it stretches and separates the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'positive and negative charges

    and forms dipoles. This absorbs'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'energy can then come away, and

    this energy is radiated back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out. You can imagine, like a

    spring, the dipoles and this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'energy is irradiated outwards.

    And sometimes some of it is lost'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'heat. Other times, all of it is

    preserved and radiated outwards'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in new waves going in all kinds

    of directions. In a thin gas,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'molecules are far enough apart

    that you can treat them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'individually. And then there are

    fairly simple physical and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mathematical formulations that

    understand what''s happening. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in other cases, in dense gasses,

    liquid solids, the combinations'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the deckles interact with

    each other, and the waves'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interfere with each other. And

    the whole thing is, in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'general case, much too complex

    to accurately simulate. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'science of optics, in this case,

    physical wave optics, in order'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to tame this sort of chaotic

    situation, they adopt certain'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'abstractions, simplifications

    and approximations. For example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they have the concept of a

    homogeneous medium through which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light travels in a straight

    line. Now, homogeneous medium is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an abstraction, obviously,

    because matter composed of atoms'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can never be truly homogeneous

    for all scales. But in practice,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this abstraction works quite

    well for materials that have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uniform density and composition.

    The optical properties of this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'homogeneous medium is described

    by its index of refraction, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'IR, for short. This is a complex

    or, in other words, a two part'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'number. One part of the IR

    describes the speed of light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through the medium, and the

    other one describes how much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light is absorbed by the medium.

    And there are many media that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are completely non absorbent,

    and for them, that number will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be zero, localized in

    homogeneities in the medium is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have to model things of a

    completely homogeneous medium.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the way that optics models

    these localized and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'homogeneities is as particles.

    So the assumption is that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have these abrupt IO

    discontinuities, and they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scatter the incoming light over

    various directions. This is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'similar to individual molecule

    polarization that we discussed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'earlier, but these particles can

    be composed of many molecules,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and there are some formalisms in

    order to handle all this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'situation. Again, it''s a bit of

    an abstraction over what''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually happening. Now, the

    overall appearance of a medium'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is determined by the combination

    of its absorption and scattering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'properties. For example, a wide

    appearance, like the whole milk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the lower right corner, is

    caused by high scattering and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'low absorption. You sort of can

    sort of see absorption and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattering as to add independent

    axes here. And if a liquid is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colored, that means it absorbs

    light more readily in some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wavelength than others, so it''s

    sort of spectrally selective.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now, we''ve briefly touched on

    participating media here, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually the rest of my talk

    will be focused on object'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surfaces, which is a more common

    and basic case in memory. Now,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from an optical perspective,

    most important thing about a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface is its roughness. No

    surface can be perfectly flat.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'At the very least, we have

    irregularities at the atomic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'level, irregularities that are

    of similar size or smaller than'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light wavelength. We will. I

    will call this nano geometry,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and these cause a phenomenon

    called diffraction.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There is something called the

    Huygens Fresnel principle that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can help understand the

    diffraction on the intuitive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way, it states that each point

    on a planar wave, you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'imagine, each point on a planar

    like wave is the center of a new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spherical wave that''s being

    emitted, and then these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spherical waves will interfere

    with each other in order to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create a new plane wave. Now so

    far, this hasn''t gave us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything in terms of intuition.

    We went through a plane wave,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through a bunch of sea waves,

    back to the plane wave. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where this, where this sort of

    mental picture helps is when the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wave hits an obstacle, and

    that''s when you get diffraction.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when the wave hits the

    obstacle, then you imagine these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spherical waves, and then one

    side of it, the spherical wave'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s on the very corner of

    this obstacle, it doesn''t get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'canceled obvious. There''s no

    other waves next to it, and you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see the light is kind of bending

    around the corner. It''s actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not traveling a straight line.

    And that''s an example of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something you don''t get with the

    standard geometric optics. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the effect of this will be to

    slightly soften shadows. Even if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have a point light, your

    shadows will be very slightly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soft into this effect. Now

    what''s more interesting for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflectance, which is what this

    course, is about, is diffraction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the surface, the

    irregularities of snail geometry'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s on a surface. And for

    this case, I''m going to look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an optically smooth surface. An

    optically smooth surface is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defined as a surface where all

    the irregularities are in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Nano geometry category. So all

    the irregularities are smaller'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'than the light wavelength. It''s

    actually not hard to polish a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface to that degree.

    Commercial grass is commonly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'polished far smaller than a

    visible light wavelength. And if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we look at this plane wave

    hitting this surface that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'irregular on a scale of 10s or

    hundreds of nanometers, then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can apply the same Huygens

    principle. And so we see that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'every point in the surface is

    emitting its own spherical wave.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And this looks a bit chaotic,

    because it is. Some of these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface points are higher, some

    of them are lower. That''s due to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Nano geometry, and then all

    these screw waves will sort of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interfere and reinforce each

    other, interference. And you''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get this kind of complexity,

    structured wave front. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little drawing actually doesn''t

    do justice, and you''ll end up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with some amount of the light

    scattered in all kinds of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directions. Now, the smaller the

    Nano geometry, the less likely'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fraction, the more of it will be

    reflected, sort of in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'regular specular way that I''ll

    talk about soon. So it''s really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a function of the height of the

    bumps. And if you have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface, that''s, I think the

    term is super polished. I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know if that''s a technical term,

    but I''ve seen it used on several'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'websites. It is possible, with

    some effort and expense, to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'polish a surface to the level of

    individual atoms, then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scattering that happens on a

    surface like that will be small.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''ll be around 1% or half a

    percent of incident light, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s definitely still

    measurable. So there''s no such'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing as a perfect surface. Now

    we''re going to take a break from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wave optics and move into the

    more familiar, geometric or gray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'optics, which is a more

    simplified model, and it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really the model that all of the

    geographics, with a handful of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exceptions, has been using since

    forever. One simplification we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make is to ignore nano geometry.

    Basically. As far as geometric'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'optics is concerned, if it''s

    smaller than a light wavelength,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it doesn''t exist. Any optically

    smooth surface will treat us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this mathematically perfect,

    abstract, flat surface. Now, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be shown in the equations

    governing electromagnetic waves'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that such a perfectly flat

    surface, ideal surface, will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'split light into exactly two

    directions, reflection and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refraction. Now, most real world

    surfaces aren''t optically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smooth, but they have

    irregularities of the scale'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s much larger than the

    light wavelength, but still'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smaller than pixels. So we''ll

    call this micro geometry to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'differentiate from nano geometry

    that was smaller than light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wavelength. And this micro

    geometry variation, it doesn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cause diffraction. What it does,

    it simply is tilting the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in various directions. And

    since, as we saw here, both'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection and refraction

    direction depend on the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normal, on the surface

    orientation, then the micro'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'geometry is simply changing the

    local normal at a very small'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scale, and you end up with

    reflective rays, even though'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each specific point on the

    surface is only reflecting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incoming light of a single

    direction, because a pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'covers a lot of bits of surface

    angle in different directions,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you end up with a sort of

    statistic aggregate. Now this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'roughness on the microscopic

    scale. If I look at these two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surfaces, then to our eye, they

    seem equally smooth. They seem'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like these nice, you know,

    smooth hemispheres. One has a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hole in the middle of the map.

    They''re very similar shapes. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in on the microscopic scale,

    they''re different. This top'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface is slightly rough. If

    you took a micro micrograph of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it or micro photograph of it,

    you''d see these sort of gently'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'undulating hills, as it were,

    and that means that incoming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light rays will hit surface

    points that angle slightly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'differently and will bounce out

    in slightly different directions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and end up with this sort of

    narrow ish cone. And that''s why'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the reflections are only

    slightly blurred the surface on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the bottom, however, it is on

    the micro scale very rough. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you looked at the microscope,

    would look like valves or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something. And so every bit of

    surface by the light is angled'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in a very different direction,

    and the light spreads out in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very white color. Now, in the

    macroscopic view, we don''t model'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the micro the micro geometry

    explicitly between it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'statistically and view the

    surface as reflecting and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refracting light in multiple

    directions in a cone. And the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rougher the surface, the wider

    this cone will be. Now the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions we''ve talked about

    reflective light, what happens'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to refractive light? And this

    depends on what kind of material'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the object is made of. Light is,

    since light is composed of like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'magnetic waves, the optical

    properties of the substance are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closely linked to its electric

    properties. And we can group'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'materials with the three main

    optical categories, metals or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'conductors, dielectrics or

    insulators and semiconductors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And really, in games and movies,

    you don''t see a lot of exposed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'semiconductors lying around. So

    we can, in most cases, ignore'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that situation and just divide

    it into metals, non metals, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has advantage of being way more

    intuitive to an artist and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking about dielectrics and

    the like. Now, metals'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'immediately absorb all

    refractive light. Basically,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a CS, the electron that

    sucks up all the electromagnetic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'energy, and it''s gone never to

    return. Non metals, however,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'behave like those cups of liquid

    we saw earlier. Effectively, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have this participating medium

    underneath the surface that the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refracted light is

    participating, and the refracted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light is scattered or absorbed,

    or scattered and absorbed, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have all the same variations

    we saw in those cups of liquid.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If the object is making a

    completely clear substance, like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'glass or liquid, the light will

    just keep on going. But if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s enough scattering, which

    most objects will have, some of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this refracted light will be

    scattered back out of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface. And those are the

    little blue arrows that you see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming out of the surface in

    various directions. And I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of tried to visualize the

    fact that the light internally'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is getting selectively absorbed,

    so it''s getting tinted blue. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the arrows are sort of the

    yellow arrows turning blue and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue and bluer until they get

    back out on the surface. Now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this re emitted light comes out

    at varying distances from entry'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point. And you can see the L

    bars show one way. One Ray is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming up really close to entry

    point, one ray coming up a bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'farther. And this distribution

    of distances depends on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'density and other properties of

    the scattering particles. Now if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the pixel size or shading sample

    area or distance between shading'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points the shading rate, or

    however you conceptualize that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s sort of the area of

    interest for shading. If that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixel size is large, like the

    red border, green circle and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image compared to the entry exit

    distances, then we consume'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distances are effectively zero

    for shading purposes, we can''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'resolve the fact that the light

    is coming out in a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point that it''s entering. So in

    that case, by knowing the entry'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'takes a distance, we can compute

    all shading locally at a single'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point, and the shading color is

    only affected by light that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hitting at one point. It''s

    convenient to split these two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very different light material

    interactions and different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shading terms. So we tend to

    call the surface reflection,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'term specular, and the term

    resulting from refraction,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'absorption, scattering and re

    refraction, we call diffuse.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now, in the other case where the

    pixel is very small, or small'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compared to the end to the exit

    distances, so we have the red'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'border green circle again, but

    it''s much smaller in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'picture compared to scattering

    distances, then we can''t tweak'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shading as all happening the

    single point. We need some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'special subsurface scattering

    rendering techniques and even'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'regular diffuse shading, the

    physical phenomenon is the same.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s still subsurface

    scattering. The only difference'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between something where you''re

    running a subsurface scattering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader at one point where you''re

    running a regular diffuse'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader, is the difference

    between the shading resolution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the scattering distance. So

    it''s not true to say that this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material is a subsurface

    scattering material. This all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'depends on the distance to the

    camera. Right? If you have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'plastic far from far away or

    from arm''s length, then it acts'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like diffuse. But if you''re

    looking at Super up close, like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in The Lego Movie, then you can

    see visible diffusion happening.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And the same thing happens in

    first human skin has physical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scaling behavior. But if you''re

    looking at human from far away,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can just shape them as a

    purity gift. Now so far, we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussed the physics of like

    pattern interactions. Of course,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to implement them in a game or

    film render, you have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you with a vendor, yeah, is he

    making some useful points to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'help the understanding of what

    we''ve been talking about.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, we''re out of time today,

    so thanks for today. Have a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weekend. Conclude our material

    with a look at the the area'
  persid: ''
- desc: lights, chapter 12.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So does that include dome area

    lights? Just area'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we'll deal with area lights.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, yep,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thanks again for today. Take
    care, everyone.'
