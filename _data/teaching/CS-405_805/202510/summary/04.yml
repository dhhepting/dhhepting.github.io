- desc: 'Okay, meeting four of

    26 last meeting, we focused on'
  persid: ''
- desc: building pbrt version Four
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and some wiki stuff. Any

    questions about that? Applause.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I realized I set up a

    scheduler too late and it won''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let me. It didn''t let me set up

    a time for a slot for the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting. So Laura, you can

    remove your if, David, you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to do yesterday''s or last

    meeting?'
  persid: ''
- desc: For last meeting, yeah, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because more than one person can

    do,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connect it, right? Yes. Everyone

    can edit I''m just and nobody'
  persid: ''
- desc: else has signed up yet,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m going to send you a

    reminder to sign up. So thoughts'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the wiki pages. So on the

    wiki pages add navigation. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did that on first meeting, and

    then once you have a page'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'edited, posted to the class

    discussion forum, and then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will make The link to the

    meeting page,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which right now doesn''t do

    anything.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Right now does this because I

    don''t have the ID, the page Id'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'set up. So if you post it, then

    people know it''s there, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll get the information and

    make the link and'
  persid: ''
- desc: and I fixed the attendance.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So attendance, the link in the

    meeting goes to the proper you'
  persid: ''
- desc: are Courses page and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I left the link for The wiki

    documentation up. So our ta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'xylin, did we? Windows build of

    PBR T version four, and he'
  persid: ''
- desc: posted his comments here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In case you don''t recognize that

    link, that''s the one that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought was not very good, but

    it appears it''s better than,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better than I first gave it

    credit for. Most of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'procedures in the video are

    correct. So that''s the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing to look at. You may need

    to change the command C make.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the difference would be that

    minus a x 64 is removed from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second one, and then there''s a

    Pull Request that talks about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dealing with the P techs error.

    So if that comes up for you,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that might be a helpful
  persid: ''
- desc: thing to do. So any progress on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mine was the version I was

    trying to compile using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wrong version. So I need a

    version 16 for the Visual Studio'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have on my computer. Version

    17. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'went back. Tried that. It

    worked, just compiling it. Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So did you get I''m close. Did

    you get Visual Studio from? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had Visual Studio already on my

    computer. I didn''t know what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version I had, so I was able to

    from that video that you showed,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I saw where he found the

    version, and I went in mind and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realized that my version is

    version 16, Visual Studio. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that was the year that I was

    getting when I was trying to put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it all together. It was trying

    to use Version 17, and it didn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exist on my computer, which is

    true,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version 17 did not exist. So can

    you update? I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able to use. I was able to get

    it to work with, okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so Visual Studio at all?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I was able to get it

    because I just had to change the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version in the compilation or in

    the setup and did everything. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: was closed, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and see make, was that working

    for you? Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I got CMake working. I have a

    compiled thing of pbrt Four. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not test if it works. I realize

    that should have been an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important step. But if I can

    open it, and it opens, I got'
  persid: ''
- desc: things to work, probably
  persid: ''
- desc: closer. Let's go with that,
  persid: ''
- desc: pretty sure compiled.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you can open it, I would say,

    yes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I just haven''t rendered

    anything, is all. Yeah, that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it took forever for me to

    download the scenes. So once I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'got that first part working, I

    downloaded the scenes. I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'haven''t done a rendering of the

    city of the scene.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay? So was there any when you

    got C make to work? Were you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able? Did you notice, anything

    you needed to change?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was having trouble with the Z

    lip, static step, and my buddy,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he was getting I had a friend

    who walked on to help me with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, because he was, he''s not in

    this class at all. He just knows'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this kind of stuff. But so he

    was trying to help me, and he'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ended up bypassing that step by

    giving me a already installed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'copy. Somehow, I have no idea

    what he did, but He sent me a'
  persid: ''
- desc: working copy. Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: So yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: Bless you. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any other comments about this

    before we move on? I It would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nice if you have had success,

    share it with the class and The'
  persid: ''
- desc: class Discussion Forum. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not happy the way I started

    that sentence. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m paraphrasing the so we have

    a lot of integrals to deal with,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we can''t do An analytical

    solution. So how do we handle'
  persid: ''
- desc: them. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Anything else to add a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pretty decent approximation of

    integral through just random'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Walk analysis, like Monte

    Carlos, Just over, Over, Over,'
  persid: ''
- desc: CS,
  persid: ''
- desc: I supposed To do rendering I
  persid: ''
- desc: probability mass function.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, I I just I was curious.

    Instead of downloading, going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back to pbrt for a second,

    instead of downloading the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'repository with the with the PBR

    TV for scenes, is there an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example? Because that video that

    I disparaged it, talked about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'having a PBR key file in the

    project.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It might be somewhere in there.

    It''s just, it''s a very simple'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scene. So maybe it''s even a

    better indicator on whether or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not you can run it. Is if you

    can run the simple scene,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because it was just like a

    circle right over, yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: sphere and a checkerboard, yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that might be a sufficient

    indicator whether You can run'
  persid: ''
- desc: it. If it's in there you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so It might be available in the

    project repository, you can copy'
  persid: ''
- desc: and paste it from pbrt.org file
  persid: ''
- desc: format
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we looked at that the other day.

    Okay, yes, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bottom line says, suited to the

    integrals, that something up'
  persid: ''
- desc: with rendering had
  persid: ''
- desc: Come up With rendering. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so they use Las Vegas

    algorithms. Use random, some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'randomization, but they always

    come up with The same answer You'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so Can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are you more familiar with Las

    Vegas or Monte Carlo? Monte'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Carlo as the destination for

    gamblers.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I was reading about this, and

    there''s one, one source I found'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that said Monte Carlo was named

    after the name was chosen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because of Someone''s uncle like

    to go To the casinos there. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would take a numerical

    analysis.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I don''t want to make this

    about numerical analysis. I want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to give a bit of context so we

    can understand how to use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software. Okay, so fancy

    integrals will not be part of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the exams. I
  persid: ''
- desc: You, maybe for you, we can no
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ignore him. He''s speaking

    facetious.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Direction.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what? What is the idea behind

    integration? Generally,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you have, like a curve to

    figure the area under a curve,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, you don''t know an exact,

    like, straight angle, except'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for, like a derivative, you add

    up a whole bunch of little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shapes underneath that curve,

    until closer and closer and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closer it gets To being that

    curve essentially With the'
  persid: ''
- desc: estimated Pi over
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so quadrature comes up, and

    that''s based on fitting squares'
  persid: ''
- desc: under the curve.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Instead, it wasn''t very valid

    for this because it never really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'converged on the higher

    dimensional kind of things, kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: of, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: so these exactly
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saying, like, three

    dimensionally, you can''t use to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collect quantum sure, because

    you''d be using cubiture At that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point, right? If you''re doing

    three dimensional scenes. Is'
  persid: ''
- desc: that what it means?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think these are good for,

    smooth functions, and functions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re dealing with aren''t always

    Smooth and they''re not disjoint.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So the advantage of The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not sure how to write this

    with the error negligible.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Negligible.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The areas like so minute it''s

    important.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, it increases
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exponentially as sample size

    increases exactly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t want to hook up. Writing

    is in the wiki To the pages I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: linked you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It reminds me story about when I

    went to a Star Trek convention,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they said we talked about how

    script they have Star Trek, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they said the script writer did

    something, and then they put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blanks like that for the science

    consultant to fill them in.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Our choice is negligible. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Here''s the idea of Monte

    Carlo integration. So in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'case, we have a circle inscribed

    with a square, and then we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we plot, we randomly generate

    points, and we calculate how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'many are inside the circle and

    How many are outside we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s a way to get an

    estimate of pi and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here are a few versions of

    code to do the I'
  persid: ''
- desc: estimation of pi.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's C Plus Plus.
  persid: ''
- desc: Mathematica You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and Here''s an animation of The

    pie. Example i'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the question is, how do we

    make The most of the samples'
  persid: ''
- desc: that were given the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can''t always add more to

    compute an image. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So what are some approaches
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take more efficient samples. So

    if you have a phenomena where,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you know accuracy, increases

    by a distribution of where you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put those samples, you presume

    that it follows a distribution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to begin with as you sample it,

    so you don''t need as Many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'samples to get the same level of

    variance. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'll show an example from
  persid: ''
- desc: the book Question.
  persid: ''
- desc: I So here's the Stanford bunny.
  persid: ''
- desc: This was
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an illustration in chapter two,

    and then there''s also i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this was the illustration for

    more efficient sampling, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The computation these were done

    with the same computation, same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'amount of computation, but the

    one On the right here is using a'
  persid: ''
- desc: different sampling the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and it''s not easy to see With

    that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but there''s a tool in the

    repository and I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: Put
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these images on into the media

    for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for this meeting, but here I am

    running'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this on my laptop, so I took the

    Save the screen took screenshots'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the images, and that''s why

    they have these ridiculous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 04am and screenshot from
  persid: ''
- desc: Tuesday at 1103 and so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this image tool diff, so I''m

    Using the first image as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reference, and then comparing it

    with the second one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we've gotten a change
  persid: ''
- desc: of point zero 2% and
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's helpful. I
  persid: ''
- desc: you can see the edges are i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s where the difference occurs

    most pronounced. But you can see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s differences On the

    surface as well. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so the idea is, you want To do
  persid: ''
- desc: Focus soundly and
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So would that be like, saying,

    If you sample up here, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you sample down here, and that''s

    like a major difference, you do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a lot of sampling In this area,

    because there was the major'
  persid: ''
- desc: offset. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I wonder, I guess The short

    answer is, Yes. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so we might look at the

    variance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are there more minions? Do you

    think it''s gonna more minion'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'movies coming along? It seems

    like they''ve gotten all they can'
  persid: ''
- desc: out of that. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think they''ve gotten all they

    can now The Terminator movies'
  persid: ''
- desc: too, But they seem To I
  persid: ''
- desc: so if We've Got A
  persid: ''
- desc: That's The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I made the image bit bigger,

    like'
  persid: ''
- desc: five times i
  persid: ''
- desc: Here it is. I Send It
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I shouldn''t have changed the

    size of the image. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's do It def.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. Thank You.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that didn't change much. I
  persid: ''
- desc: let's try one More revision
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here. I I thought someone was

    trying to get into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this. That''s A trigger

    difference. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: do You still want more noise?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so I reduced the samples

    to 16,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and that also created
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the surplus of pixels that are

    out of Ganon. So when I did 128'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'samples at the resolution of 768

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had one Gan pixel. And then when

    I did the 16 samples, There are'
  persid: ''
- desc: '33,490 out of gallon pixel

    channels. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're at a time I will
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do some Work on getting

    exploring the parameter spaces'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for this simple PBR key file.

    And we''ll start on chapter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three. Well, we''ll give you the

    questions that come up. Get into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Chapter Three next week.

    Applause, thanks for your time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today. Take care of a good

    weekend. Stay warm.'
