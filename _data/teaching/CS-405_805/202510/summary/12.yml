- desc: 'It seems like the app

    has changed. The otter.ai app'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has changed without letting me

    know.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s our last few before the

    break.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Everyone excited about the break
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and tomorrow''s Valentine''s day

    too. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we''re in chapter five,

    talking about cameras and film.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I have an image open. Doesn''t

    look I have an image open. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m trying, I''m setting up this,

    the simple TBR key file with'
  persid: ''
- desc: different cameras. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the example with realistic

    camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is copy This is the plane I had

    To specify the'
  persid: ''
- desc: lens file And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so let''s start with a

    realistic one and see whether we'
  persid: ''
- desc: can. I
  persid: ''
- desc: and get An image of It.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It is pretty realistic. If I

    shut the lights off, it''ll look'
  persid: ''
- desc: just like that. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see if we do a
  persid: ''
- desc: Log levels.
  persid: ''
- desc: I You, There's a Light. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s make a larger aperture.

    Change the focal distance to 100'
  persid: ''
- desc: instead 10. Original. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, that's something
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I it''s Quite a fish. Highlights,

    yes, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'm using lens data from
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scenes, arc, Scenes repository.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's try a different One.
  persid: ''
- desc: I there's a warning.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There aperture diameter is too

    big.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I sure isn't capturing much.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I change the aperture diameter

    back to one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'number bigger than zero by

    hanging. Let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: go. Comment This out to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but if you left the focus

    distance at 100 but change the'
  persid: ''
- desc: aperture diameter to see five. I
  persid: ''
- desc: think that would get rid of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'warning, put turn the focal

    distance back to 100. I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: that was what Let's
  persid: ''
- desc: try this first.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I there? Yeah, I so let''s try a

    different lens. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's try And tell US photo I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s go Back to our wide more

    efficient so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I looked at the files, there''s a

    y dot dot file. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'haven''t tried the ghost 50

    millimeter. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I don't know that that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ones without the side the

    million, millimeter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specification are intended as

    inputs. I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking at the way that some

    people form and stuff. Maybe you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have to put them inside of

    square brackets for the aperture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diameter, look at that five

    point, because everything else'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is in square brackets. So should

    that 5.0 also be in square'
  persid: ''
- desc: brackets? Can the 102
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s an example that''s not in

    brackets. Same with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the black body down the bottom.

    Just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all the examples. I''m finding

    online, I''m trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: troubleshoot as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t think it''s it''s not

    having problems reading the'
  persid: ''
- desc: file. I believe I
  persid: ''
- desc: oh, let's add another light.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is the shutter signs you''re

    using?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, That''s a good point. I

    forgot about that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank You. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fire, cool. Let''s Make it.

    Locker.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Still together.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It sounds really great. There''s

    another setting called'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sensitivity. I don''t know if

    you''ve changed that one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I i guess ISO would be the One.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's the film
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameter. So we can specify the

    sensor, The sensor response for'
  persid: ''
- desc: RGB and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I tend to white balance. Yeah,

    they''re talking about that a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: More Chapter Two,
  persid: ''
- desc: there are a lot of pixels out of
  persid: ''
- desc: gamut. There we go. I think
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think the white balance value

    might have been too high. Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve used the white balance on

    my camera to take pictures of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like stars when it was like

    minus 50 outside. So it''s a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more comfortable doing that when

    it''s not minus 50 in here, 13'
  persid: ''
- desc: second exposure times I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I wanted to show the other

    ones as Well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'especially now that we can see

    the image'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the other ones, because they''re

    not realistic. I A came up with.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So here's the orthographic and
  persid: ''
- desc: why is it so zoomed in?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m just using the default

    setting. So that''s,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I know the other one zoomed In

    because of the camera choice,'
  persid: ''
- desc: but I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, their recommended focal

    Distance is 10 to the power of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 30. Jesus, I
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think that''s just a very large

    number. Yeah, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I do wonder what would what

    would happen if we did 10 to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: power of third i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll leave that for you to try

    That''s Fair. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s put The eye point a little

    further away, maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's too much say 916, E, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think you could have left the

    Other two the same and just'
  persid: ''
- desc: changed The Z. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you change the file name from

    example pbrt to orthographic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pbrt. So there''s another one

    that''s the pbrt file at the png'
  persid: ''
- desc: you Change right? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think I''ve done that

    correctly. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that looks very zoomed in I

    don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: think it likes the lens radius.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'recommended was like, what Zero

    or like one or Whatever. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s cool. You there do a high

    render, do a high distance, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a small diameter. Because,

    again, the default setting was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like zero and then 10 to the 30,

    like it wants a really far'
  persid: ''
- desc: render distance. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'oh, it''s giving you a higher

    time, And I think that''s A good'
  persid: ''
- desc: sign. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s just turn Off lens

    features and'
  persid: ''
- desc: there You Go. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s interesting. Take just

    change, is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: not in terms of x, y, z?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, that's X, Y and Z.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It doesn''t seem like The Y

    changed. I,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it doesn''t seem to update when

    the windows in focus. So if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were to click it again, it might

    update. There we go. So why does'
  persid: ''
- desc: it treat the z like the Y? It
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t. So here we''re looking

    we''ve increased z. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking at the top of the

    sphere. Four said was the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is it because we are looking

    down at 0.5 0.5 so if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'increase the Z between moving

    upward, do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it made sense to me, but I see

    your point.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, That's kind of Bizarre. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uh, B and B to increase the

    exposure brightness, There''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: capital
  persid: ''
- desc: B for increased so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which one did you use their

    capital B or lowercase p,'
  persid: ''
- desc: pardon Me, capital B, cool, I.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I like how it''s interactive,

    like because then you can watch'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it re rendering, it kind of

    neat.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I like that rendering part CS to

    use q and E to move the camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Up and down. I think You just

    did that. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i think you still have to become

    the thing to hit the scene.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe, maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I here and then ANC, I think

    that brings up the transform'
  persid: ''
- desc: position. I'm gonna be wrong.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do so I wasn''t sure about if the

    window had focus or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'terminal. Seems like, yeah, I

    but the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'controls are not very intuitive,

    because it''s not, I don''t think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s relative to the camera. I

    think it''s relative to world'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'space. It''s pretty hard to tell.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You can use the arrow keys to

    maneuver like the'
  persid: ''
- desc: orientation of the Camera,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which might be sufficient for

    what We''re doing. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re at the end of our Day

    today. We did, I''m sure. Link we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is related to the

    question about mosaics and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can imagine each of the

    squares in gray are a sensor,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then a tiny little
  persid: ''
- desc: filter is put over sensor so,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s reading red, green or

    blue. So what do you notice'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about this? There''s green ones.

    There are red and'
  persid: ''
- desc: blue. Red,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, there''s green on every row

    where Red and Blue are only on'
  persid: ''
- desc: every other
  persid: ''
- desc: 'row, yeah. So if we take two by

    two and two green, a blue and a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'red. So we need to demosaic this

    for the final image. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'excuse me, cool, let''s end it

    there. Thank you for your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'patience and input today.

    Applause.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It so it''s a starting off point

    for you to become familiar with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the camera and film parameters,

    and I''ll post these experiments'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we did in class. Have a good

    break'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this class up to the end of

    Chapter Five is on the midterm,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes, and we''re starting chapter

    six when we come back.'
