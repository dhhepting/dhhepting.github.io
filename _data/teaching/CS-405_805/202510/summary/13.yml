    break was.'

- desc: It's
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no windows is poorly optimized,

    but I know Windows is poorly'

    actually good.'

    new chips, pbrt running'
  persid: ''
- desc: on my machine a whole do like
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m just gonna look at the code

    as you'
  persid: ''
- desc: change GDR
  persid: ''
- desc: testing, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''d rather focus on the 15%

- desc: 'used, kind of like, I Just

    understand we''re actually, like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: video just past session. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So any questions about the

    assignment that''s due tonight?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are there any specific kind of

    like textures that are kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like required because, like,

    I''ve used a plastic texture for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like one, and we use like a

    bubble kind of texture, a bubble'
  persid: ''
- desc: kind of texture
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the other. So is there any

    specific'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'requirement? No, yeah, I asked

    you to do different materials.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the network is not

    cooperating with me. Even on my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'phone, it''s got a weak

    connection. So I''m going to I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'switch to version on My laptop

    here I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''ll give you a look at

    what I was planning to talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: about today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Give me a second. Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about, Does anyone else Having

    network problems?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I Don't know what I cool.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I did a calendar of fractal

    images, or I edited it all. Here'
  persid: ''
- desc: are the links.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I guess with my local, hosted

    version, I''m trying to access a'
  persid: ''
- desc: CSS file that's on the web
  persid: ''
- desc: and it's not happy.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think you might need to

    outline your text. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I need to, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to move this, the CSS

    that''s caused me the problems.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Make a local copy. I doesn''t

    like'

    from? Can I get a copy of that'
  persid: ''
- desc: one I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, I''ve been meaning to put

    the large scale resolution ones'
  persid: ''
- desc: up, so I will do that.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is from 95 I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think so. This is a van Cook,

    snowflake curve I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spend it over a height field.

    This was Ray tree and'
  persid: ''
- desc: networks back.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe, let's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so this is The assignment.

    So we''re using materials.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the main sphere starts out

    being with the dielectric'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material. So add two more

    spheres with different materials'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, are there any other

    questions about the assignment'
  persid: ''
- desc: then my post yesterday,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer some questions I didn''t.

    There was no reply to it, so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: wondered.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought better of getting

    into chapter six stuff today'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'based on the conversations we''ve

    had online. So I just focused on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the midterm that''s coming Up

    next Meeting I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in Section chapter one, section

    two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'introduces a lot of ideas that

    we''re exploring This semester. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so they talk about the light

    transport equation, also known'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as the render rendering

    equation. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, what is the purpose of the

    rendering equation?'
  persid: ''
- desc: What exactly was the question?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is the purpose of the

    rendering equation?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Total, realistic rendering. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s say it''s to do with

    simulation as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So An indistinguishable

    simulation. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're dealing with
  persid: ''
- desc: light in the scene. Well,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this video doesn''t have any

    sound. It''s about Three minutes'
  persid: ''
- desc: Long. I
  persid: ''
- desc: information, Please Do
  persid: ''
- desc: the best.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Practice your playback Speed up

    really High. Oh, my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'God. It kind of like, because

    the SDR does not kind of like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connect like correctly, whatever

    does that kind of like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accelerates it to some example,

    what'
  persid: ''
- desc: you're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saying is my cable might not be

    connected. Yes, does.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If it wasn''t connected properly,

    wouldn''t be able to see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: picture on the screen. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I mean, if my phone is plugged

    into a charger, it can still'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'charge. If it''s not plugged in

    properly, it''s just it will'
  persid: ''
- desc: charge slower. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'THE END seems to be the right

    speed. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: here's the Wikipedia entry that
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe gives A bit
  persid: ''
- desc: more accessible presentation and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is, we''re looking at

    the point x and seeing the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that gets emitted from that

    point x in the direction and'
  persid: ''
- desc: W, o,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re dealing With the con

    looking.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I so why isn't,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s Say, four samples per

    pixel. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: What's that? Number 4096,
  persid: ''
- desc: yes, power,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I mean, n samples. It''s just

    like when you''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'statistics, you make more

    variance and stuff when you have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a small sample base. So, yeah,

    that''s why you choose a second'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to 30 should which should Set

    End to 30? I?'
  persid: ''
- desc: It so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it makes sense. The four samples

    per pixel is going to be as high'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quality As 4096 samples per

    pixel.'
  persid: ''
- desc: What are some of the particular
  persid: ''
- desc: 'challenges, if, if we have four

    samples so,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'oh, you showed us the outer

    gamut pixels. So I imagine'
  persid: ''
- desc: there'd be way more of those. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so all light Sources may not Be

    counterpoint.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'At some point improvement you

    Get from adding more samples,'
  persid: ''
- desc: but
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we look at Like the Image

    tool diff, we''ll see the images'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'getting the subsequent images

    will have less variance, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then when they''re threshed, the

    variance is below a threshold,'
  persid: ''
- desc: We can say
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is a good number of samples

    per pixel to use And'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes, I Excuse me, Please Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the idea was, they''re supposed

    to open In Order. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is the realistic camera,

    and I''m setting the shutter. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shutter open time is zero, and

    the shutter closed. Time is'
  persid: ''
- desc: starting with 1234,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s shut or close At 10

    and a 20 and a 3040, 50 and'
  persid: ''
- desc: '60, 7080, 9100, and that''s 200

    And it 200 seems like it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: overexposed. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it almost seems like it''s a

    percent, like at 100% it looks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good at 200% it looks 200% is

    bright. Like, too bright. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not sure what the units are

    on that time.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Usually they''re about, like,

    some x over like a fraction of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second. So like, you have, like,

    one over 60 is the 60th of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second. And then if you have

    like, a time two, that would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: '200 over 100 so I''m assuming

    this is about 100th of a second'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'increments. So that''ll be two

    seconds of exposure for the last'
  persid: ''
- desc: one,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unless you added it like

    aperture, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what it''s doing is it''s adding

    all the light in that time. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just we see stuff, and then we

    keep refreshing our vision,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whereas it''s just like, what if

    we add all the light from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last 200 milliseconds together?

    This is what it would look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like. Well, I mean, our eyes do

    the same thing, though. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: like a running average. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so I think it''s percentage

    and average, right?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do? Okay, so David had a

    question last day, I believe,'
  persid: ''
- desc: before the break,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about why changing the position

    of the camera didn''t make sense.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t have a phrase. It was

    weird. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: behavior was weird. Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so can you look at this input

    file and see what might account'
  persid: ''
- desc: for that weirdness? I
  persid: ''
- desc: camera.
  persid: ''
- desc: Perspective, perspective,
  persid: ''
- desc: so using
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perspective, yes, it''s

    perspective. So we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'viewing frustum that''s a

    truncated pyramid. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: that changes to the camera
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would have to be normalized

    before we''d be able to properly'
  persid: ''
- desc: use the perspective.
  persid: ''
- desc: Explain that please. What
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do you mean for putting in any

    vectors'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and stuff that we''re putting in

    different cameras we''re putting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in one particular view, so we

    need to normalize it to be able'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to get it to be proper to the

    actual field of view and The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'world of you, in regards to your

    frame, You'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s think about the camera

    frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: how
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So a common and straightforward

    way to specify the camera frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is to the to specify an eye

    point that''s where the camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: position is going to be,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then a look at point, the

    point you''re Looking at, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then another vector so the eye

    point look at point defines one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'axis of the cord of the camera

    frame your out'
  persid: ''
- desc: vector is usually
  persid: ''
- desc: defining another one. Yeah. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we specify look at or the I

    point, look at point. That''s one'
  persid: ''
- desc: vector of our coherent system.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But we can still it doesn''t

    fully specify the frame, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the up vector can rotate around

    that, that I point look at point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector. So once we fix the up

    vector, so we have to look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the i point, look at point

    vector, the up vector, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can find the third vector by

    doing a cross product between'
  persid: ''
- desc: these two vectors. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'call that on the right vector

    personal'
  persid: ''
- desc: reference. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how have we defined the

    camera frame in this sample'
  persid: ''
- desc: input file? Well,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we set up, but we''re also

    supposedly like, aren''t we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking down? I''m confused,

    because the I is above the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lookup point, so we should be

    tilted downward. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'declaring up as one, one. I

    guess that''s so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the up vector is, is more so,

    like, it''s like, you have,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'literally, an arrow pumping up.

    You have an i, which is just a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point, yeah, it''s like, you draw

    a string between here the camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: relative
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the Office of z, it''s in the

    third slot'
  persid: ''
- desc: and one. So you just, yep,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s, that''s the thing, yeah,

    when we change the Z, it moved'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'backwards, or, like, it moved

    upward. And I''m like, that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weird. That''s the reason, right

    there, we''re declaring what the'
  persid: ''
- desc: z is, our up. So that is our Y,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a lot of 3d space, they use Z is

    their up axis, as opposed to y.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would say y is usually the up

    vector.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s more common, but I''ve

    actually been reading about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this, oddly enough, over the

    break, of people using the Z as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the upward vectors the third

    axis, yeah, the third axis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'becomes up because it''s now, no,

    it''s leaving the plane,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'therefore it''s adding the up.

    That''s the way I''ve seen it a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'few times. I actually this makes

    a lot of sense, but they''re just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using it that way. It kind of

    seems arbitrary. Honestly,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so if we switch the numbers

    from those two columns, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should fix it for us, at least.

    Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''d also have to change where

    the light source is as well to'
  persid: ''
- desc: make it relative to us.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That the Y in that file, yeah,

    so I''ve changed it here, just it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might be a good idea to change

    the light source so that the The'
  persid: ''
- desc: Y is 100 and The Z is 40. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's do this One First and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any ideas about how it''s just

    going to Look. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feel like the light might be in

    a weird spot, but hopefully it'
  persid: ''
- desc: works. Oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: it looks cool.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is it has we then changed the

    world plane, where the like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'world where the world plane is,

    because all those coordinates it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was given were relative to

    having the Y as one axis and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Z is another. That''s why I was

    saying we should swap that line'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value. But if it''s doing it for

    all the coordinates, you have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make sure you''re at least

    consistent on everything.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So so the simple pbrt file would

    be doing it in a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: direction too.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I that''ll just move the light

    though You have to do both the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'checkerboard, the ball and any

    other elements. Let''s see what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this test first. It''s just gonna

    move the light,'
  persid: ''
- desc: which might look cool.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So now the lights casting

    the shadow downward, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the good fraction We

    switched. Now the ground was'
  persid: ''
- desc: down there. Okay, okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, you have to change it for

    every single thing. So I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s just better to accept the

    fact that it''s using a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: system than wait a second,
  persid: ''
- desc: it's got a translate
  persid: ''
- desc: function. It's translating,
  persid: ''
- desc: if we got rid of that,
  persid: ''
- desc: fix everything, zero,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minus 101, negative one. But it

    would have to be zero, negative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, zero. But then you see

    those points. They would also'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, would they a translation?

    Is not a multiplication. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not, it is not, no, it''s just

    moving. It''s like, it''s saying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we moved it down, or, in this

    case, to the left. And then all'
  persid: ''
- desc: points are relative to that. So
  persid: ''
- desc: everything's relative.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Say that. Why wouldn''t we just

    wouldn''t we just move the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cameras to one model view or one

    view?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyways, that''s what I''m

    hammering saying. Everything was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in X, Z, Y, essentially. And so

    rather than switch everything,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should accept that it''s using an

    alternative format.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I were making a file from

    scratch, I would definitely do'
  persid: ''
- desc: X, Y, exactly.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I mean, choice of coordinates

    are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of arbitrary. It is, it is

    arbitrary. It''s just you have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know what it is, see, that''s

    what happened. That''s exactly'
  persid: ''
- desc: what it's expecting do.
  persid: ''
- desc: Making sense
  persid: ''
- desc: actually looks pretty cool.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Texture mapping over here is

    suspect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s actually pretty cool.

    It''s nice. It''s nice to go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, every single one of those

    points you''d have to go like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'negative 20, zero, negative 20,

    anywhere that there''s a, x, y,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'z, you''d have to switch the last

    two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unless they''re identical. That

    is, and then, yeah, obviously it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'excludes things like RGB, which

    are not vectors. Per se, I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the problem we''re having is

    because of the setup. The other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way, yeah, exactly because I''m

    saying, rather than change all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the values, it''s just might be

    better to accept it for this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'file, any subsequent files we do

    make, we can set to whatever.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, we were trying to modify

    this last week. Yeah. Sorry. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the problem we get this got

    brought up is because it was a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'problem because it wasn''t

    working as We expected it to.'
