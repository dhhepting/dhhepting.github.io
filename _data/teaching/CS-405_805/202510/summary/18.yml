- desc: 'Okay, so since I didn''t

    have the recording on right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'away, so I want to talk about

    sampling and the rest of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignments, so we''ll look at

    how to construct, sir pin ski'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gaskets and tetrahedra. Look at

    those assignments, and then talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: about sound.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I created an image here, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything you notice about the

    image?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The circles are pretty loaded,

    yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I suppose
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I are they bigger than they need

    to be? So if we think in two'
  persid: ''
- desc: dimensions and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have a circle, a unit

    circle at the origin, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: an equilateral triangle and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is inscribed inside the circle,

    so When we translate to the Vert'
  persid: ''
- desc: towards the vertices and
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not doing a good job. Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: So they should be touching,
  persid: ''
- desc: but not overlapping. You
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? So Do
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, here they're overlapping. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what I did in this image was

    I, I made'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an object instance that''s

    floating in front and not to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'top, and then I transformed that

    three times to make the shape in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the background upon which the

    shadow is being cast and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it missed opportunity to call it

    that scare ginsky gasket. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so you can have that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the way I''ve set up the pbrt

    file is I''m looking that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: position is two and y looking at
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re just x is zero, y is

    two and Z is zero, and looking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the origin, was the Z vector

    being the up direction.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is all COVID From the

    simple pbrt. And then I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'including gasket dot PBR key,

    which defines the instance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called gasket. And then I''m

    scaling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m trying translating the

    object three times, and then I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just after that, I''m translating

    once more With the original,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the original instance, not

    scale'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is what the gasket

    object looks like.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s material, diffuse,

    material translate, and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scaling well. We say the sphere

    has a radius of point 03125,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I believe There''s 240 43

    spheres. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have a little piece of code

    here. Let me show you where it'
  persid: ''
- desc: is on
  persid: ''
- desc: the website and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I didn''t do very well with

    documentation. Sorry about that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re doing, I''m defining a

    function gasket that will take a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'level so it''s, it''s recursive

    function.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if level is greater than

    zero, we''re going to call the'
  persid: ''
- desc: function with the image
  persid: ''
- desc: of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the point that we start with.

    And so in our case, the original'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point is 000, because that''s,

    that''s this point here. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: outputting the details.
  persid: ''
- desc: Nothing so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if levels gradients are up

    calling it, I''m recursively'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calling it with each of the

    three transformations for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertices that correspond to the

    vertices of the triangle or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gasket. And if I''m at the leaf

    node, then I,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then I print, then I Do the last

    transformation and print out The'
  persid: ''
- desc: scaling. So
  persid: ''
- desc: Did That make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS Third Way. The details of the

    transform of the program are in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this last little bit. So we

    defined three transformation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrices so we scale from the

    coordinate of the vertex to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'origin, and then we scale by a

    half.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then we scale, or translate

    back to the from the origin to'
  persid: ''
- desc: the sent fixed point.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then so we do object begin,

    and then SP is a starting point'
  persid: ''
- desc: which is 000,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we say starting point

    identity matrix, and then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'giving it five levels. So I did

    this. There''s room for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'improvement in the code, but

    gives you an idea of How it can'
  persid: ''
- desc: proceed. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we start with zero, then We

    have the sphere, The unit'
  persid: ''
- desc: sphere, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m curious why It''s good. It''s

    taking so long. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe it''s too close. The eye

    point is too Close. We''ll see. C'
  persid: ''
- desc: I,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's A bit too close. I
  persid: ''
- desc: too far away. Let's Try That. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'click theory is going To be too

    Large. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it won''t be very easy To see

    the Initial sphere, but do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It looks like they''re really

    stuff in there, doesn''t it? But'
  persid: ''
- desc: it seems to be correct. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the problem is with My

    diagram here, Isn''t it? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should we try? Let''s try another

    intermediate size. Should have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'added a command line argument

    for This. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i was expecting the spirit to be

    still a little more visible on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the other side. Is there? Do I

    See it? This time? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, that's two. One
  persid: ''
- desc: More, 1010.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think it''s retracting from

    the sphere, because I just did'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approximation, and I did four

    decimal places of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, does that make sense? Is

    that helpful? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how do we make a tetrahedron

    out of this? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are we able to, like,

    instantiate points and stuff'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like that? Because I know how to

    do it with just points, but with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spheres, you''d have to, you''d

    either have to, again, use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points, or you have to start to

    collate the faces.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can I meet? You''re a little bit

    over complicating this. So how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do we get a tetrahedron instead

    of a triangle,'
  persid: ''
- desc: three extra, you'd have to do a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transform on the other like you

    do the one, and then you would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have to do a trend, basically a

    duplicate of it, but that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'duplicate would be overall,

    transform to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be different. How to position

    different? Appear to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different, position differently

    so it would come out. Basically'
  persid: ''
- desc: your object space
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would be slightly different

    transformations.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how about it? So what do we

    have now to make this triangle?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We got to replace all those

    spheres with the littles, except'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we got to make it three

    dimensions, because it''s still'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'only one dimension or two

    dimensions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now, yes, how many

    transformations are we using to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make this triangle? Two

    dimensions, three?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how many transformations do

    we need to make a 3d object'
  persid: ''
- desc: form? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can think of the triangle

    being in the sphere at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try not To confuse this. So this

    is just too deep. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then at this point we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle. And then we want to

    put the other transformation'
  persid: ''
- desc: there,
  persid: ''
- desc: but At the Top we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m sorry I wrote that so small.

    So the fourth transformation is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the center of the triangle at

    a different height.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that means we can have, so

    this is one triangle here, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we have another triangle.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so both triangles one and two

    and three and four.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we just take the triangle

    and copy it. You get the right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'side looking properly bussing,

    but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it wouldn''t have the interior

    structure. So that''s why we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'iterating with four

    transformations instead of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three. Does that make sense? So

    what are some other ways you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could instead of using spheres,

    how could we describe the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tetrahedra shape the serpent ski

    tetrahedra He drawn'
  persid: ''
- desc: triangles.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, we Could do triangles,

    cubes, oh,'
  persid: ''
- desc: here so we can define
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shape and then transform it

    instead of A sphere'
  persid: ''
- desc: How About cylinders? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or you could do boxes as well, I

    guess so. Originally I did'
  persid: ''
- desc: spheres.
  persid: ''
- desc: One is 35 years old, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you do cubes, you might have

    the opposite problem, where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s gaps and they''re not

    actually touching, just because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where the points are around the

    cube. I Right? Because, maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not because the triangle, but if

    we actually use the triangle,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there would be the height would

    be less than the width, so you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'end up getting like, so you have

    to, like, sort of account for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that little gap and you face

    together, so maybe you wouldn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have that same cubic gap. It''s

    like the soft mother triangle is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smaller than the width of the

    side. All'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the lengths are the same. All

    the sides are the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'length, but the interior height

    is different than that side'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'length. You have, I think, root

    three for a length of two, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then the height of the pyramid

    is root two. I''ve done all these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calculations already because I

    made it out of points. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points. So then it''s, it''s easy

    to do points instead of spheres'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instead of points, because we

    Just placing this under the'
  persid: ''
- desc: sphere at the point. Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So is 10 levels of recursion.

    Much'
  persid: ''
- desc: it gets a little worried. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what do we see? Let me zoom

    in here. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blurring surface key. That''s

    good. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: What was your answer?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How did You describe them first?

    Oh, okay. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have jagged edges from

    aliasing. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So where we have,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where we have blurring. When we

    look at the image at Greg,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intended resolution. We don''t

    see this. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It looks fine there for that

    resolution, but once'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you hit so many recursions, you

    can''t really see the next ones'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway, regardless of what
  persid: ''
- desc: 'resolution. So 10 is probably

    too many, because you get to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point where you just can''t see

    the recursion anymore.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So there are a couple

    ideas here'
  persid: ''
- desc: the larger screen. Do
  persid: ''
- desc: so,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we see a staircase effect,

    but also the different colors of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the pixels indicate
  persid: ''
- desc: that we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applying some anti aliasing here

    to compete. The blur is it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: compensating for the AVIC And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so question is, what size is

    sphere? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that question makes sense, so

    what? How big a sphere do we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need, so that we''re making the

    most of our display, but not'
  persid: ''
- desc: adding
  persid: ''
- desc: 'adding extra detail that, what

    kind of can we think of an'
  persid: ''
- desc: expression to or attest to
  persid: ''
- desc: do that I use,
  persid: ''
- desc: like a radius of half the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'height short, yeah, Okay, so

    Let''s Say you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are the world

    coordinates that we have In this'
  persid: ''
- desc: image? And
  persid: ''
- desc: so We can figure out what
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how much world how much spaces

    and world coordinates in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image, and We divide that so we

    figure out how much we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how Much of that space is

    covered by A Pixel i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So conceptually, as we find out

    how much world space is being'
  persid: ''
- desc: covered by a pixel, and then,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then, we find the

    relationship between the size of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the sphere and the size of the

    pixel and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so should the sphere be the same

    size as The pixel, or should it'
  persid: ''
- desc: be half as Big or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I went to lead This into a

    discussion about sampling if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so we think about it in terms

    of a signal. How'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'many samples do we need to take

    to reconstruct that signal?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that question make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s think about CD audio,

    compact disc audio. You still'
  persid: ''
- desc: familiar with compact discs?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is that what C stands for? Yes.

    Oh, yeah, well, oh, good God,'
  persid: ''
- desc: the answer
  persid: ''
- desc: might be all
  persid: ''
- desc: 'over. I mean, I knew the Fauci

    so just didn''t know that what CS'
  persid: ''
- desc: stand
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for, yeah, I once asked somebody

    what an LP was. This is a few'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'years ago, and someone and they

    said, LP, it''s a lumbar'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'puncture. They said they were

    watching house at the time, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you remember that show. Anyway,

    LP stands for long play, 33 and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a half third revolutions per

    minute on the turntable. Anyway,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I digress a little bit. See
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answering machine all over

    again. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this CD audio standard is the

    sample at 44.1 kilohertz.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can people hear up to 44.1

    kilohertz.'
  persid: ''
- desc: They tried really hard.
  persid: ''
- desc: Most People can hear around 22 i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So have you ever heard of

    Nyquist?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sometimes it''s also, have you

    heard of Shannon Claude Shannon?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway? Sometimes it''s referred

    to as Nyquist Shannon, but in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the text, it''s called Nyquist.

    So Nyquist, the Nyquist sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rate is the rate we need to

    reconstruct the signal. So if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample it at twice the highest

    frequency, then we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reconstruct the sound, or you

    can reconstruct a signal. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So there are a couple quiz

    questions here that we can bring'
  persid: ''
- desc: In
  persid: ''
- desc: to Review And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so there is a question, Is it

    useful to think of pixels as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'squares, true or false? Anyone

    think it is useful? So I said,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'covered by a pixel. So I''m just

    thinking about the area that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re sound from which we''re

    drawing samples. So there''s no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'geometry with the pixel. The

    value we compute for the pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a sample, and if it''s seen

    with the ray tracer, we might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have more than one sample per

    pixel that we average together'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to come up with the value that

    we assign to that the image'
  persid: ''
- desc: pixel. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Elvie Ray Smith, who was at

    Pixar, I believe, made an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'emphatic argument for pixels not

    being squares. That was back in'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1995 I think so that reference

    is only 30 years old. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so why don''t we just increase

    the number of samples per pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: when we're ray tracing?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'At some point, you''re going to

    be just taking way too long, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re also not going to be

    seeing any gains from additional'
  persid: ''
- desc: sampling.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So yeah, so as we take more

    samples, the time goes up and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get better images, but there''s

    still noise in them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So is there if we didn''t have to

    worry about the time? Let''s say'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we had a super duper computer

    that made that first point not'
  persid: ''
- desc: so important. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is there a number of samples we

    could take that would say, Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, this is enough to

    reconstruct the image.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: try that one again. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the Nyquist works in the

    audio case because people can''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hear, generally people can''t

    hear above 22,000 hertz. So that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gives us a limit on the

    frequency that we need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reconstruct get the signal of

    the audio. But in the case, when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have things in computer

    graphics, if it''s we may not be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'band limited, So that means we

    can never take enough samples. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: CS, does That make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I said, Yes, where do you get

    the signal?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Or reconstruct is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not band limited. So if it''s

    not, if there isn''t a maximum'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frequency that we can double the

    i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, and So about the

    assignments'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve linked up things, so

    there''s a place to get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'description, and I''ll work on

    bit more detail for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: descriptions,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but they''re there in your

    courses, and they link Back to'
  persid: ''
- desc: my website,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll film the details, but

    the idea is linked to A small'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version of the Web of The

    picture. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it Okay, so keep on filling them

    in. Well, it won''t be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'continual process, but I''ll get

    more detail. So I fixed the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'links and by Tuesday, well, we

    can discuss final versions of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the assignment with the rubrics

    and so forth. Does that sound'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay? So they''re both. The two

    assignments are due on April 8.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Cut off date will be April 15.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we''re out of time.

    Thank you for today. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does the did that? Exploration

    of gaskets and pbrt help clarify'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some things, very polite. And

    let me go on about that. I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re all very polite anyway.
