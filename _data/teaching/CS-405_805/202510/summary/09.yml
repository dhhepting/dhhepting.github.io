- desc: "Okay, I think that's recording little picture of myself in the corner of\
    \ the screen. Now, thank you. Yeah, I know. So I want to look at. hey. on the\
    \ screen is because it's got names associated with the responses. So I don't want\
    \ to. Yes. nice one it so this is. These are the choices I had. so we'll have\
    \ 3 assignments using Pbrt. Then I could give the option of having one assignment\
    \ and a project or something in between. So the responses I have so far 3 like\
    \ this, 2 and 2 also added time to the survey. So if you want to, if there's anyone\
    \ who and write a response. You can. I think other people have replied. Yes, it's\
    \ under participation. The one anyone is really keen on doing a project. You can\
    \ do that. Tell me if you're keen on doing implementation. just make sure that\
    \ that you understand what's going on or what's required. Create the other piece\
    \ to make up the choice. 3 available. That makes sense assignment one. Take the\
    \ simple PBRT. Well, I don't. Oh, go ahead and forget. Drive hidden through Co.\
    \ 1, 35. I will oops official version of this tonight. Yeah, that's inspiration.\
    \ From the desktop tetrahedron image that I showed you. I stay, create a new interpretation.\
    \ Interesting features. Test this. What I propose for assignment 3 is. Oh, file\
    \ future guide. That's 1 place where, on the load features based on somebody's\
    \ paper. Live reports, having a look at one of those papers writing a summary\
    \ of it, and then using Pbrt to explore the future parameters, demonstrate or\
    \ test demonstrated to test the feature Tbr key. So you can see the changes. Yes,\
    \ I can show you my screen now. So trying to run the Croken image. I believe,\
    \ caused a segmentation fault because I ran out of memory. So we'll try running\
    \ it again here. So I'm using options to give me stats. and I've set the log level\
    \ to be verbose. So get more information samples per pixel is 8, and we're using\
    \ the wavefront integrator was camera 4. Maybe the issue is, they've misspelled\
    \ lounge too long. So we have 26 million nodes for 13 million primitives. Nope.\
    \ you can see physical memory. 15\_GB used 15\_MB free. Exciting as this is, we'll\
    \ stop this one. So these are similar settings. So did stats, log level, verbose.\
    \ And I'm using wavefront and 128 samples per pixel. This is a very simple scene.\
    \ So you can see we're getting right into allocating work. 4 samples right away.\
    \ We see that we're only using 10\_GB of physical memory. Okay? So that's 1, let's\
    \ do another using the integrator specified in the input file. So with the standard\
    \ setup. We have one out of gamut pixel. So that's not too bad. Just expecting\
    \ to see when a little bit of difference. But yeah, there's difference here. Let's\
    \ see, all you can see is kind of the light there's there's like there, it's there.\
    \ That's the kind of stuff I 1, 2, 2 explore in the 1st assignment. does it seem?\
    \ Okay. someone take pictures of the board for me. Okay, thank you. My email,\
    \ not email is fine. So I apologize, not having indicated 4.2 and 4.3 preparation\
    \ super bad. Yes. So the solid angle is the like an object projected onto the\
    \ sphere, and then further project that onto like a disk inside of the sphere\
    \ is to the so that helps in computation. This flows off a tongue, doesn't it.\
    \ Your view neglects a lot of the materials like surface properties, like, for\
    \ instance, that glass material. It wouldn't really compute much about the light\
    \ going through that material or help reflects while going through, and the mirroring\
    \ effects and stuff like that. So I mean, pay attention to the inner as part of\
    \ it. 5%, whereas the long and hard to say one is, it does all that stuff. There's\
    \ also the effect of like some materials that aren't like translucent like skin\
    \ is semi opaque. but if you shine like a light through your hand, you can see\
    \ that the light scatters inside of the surface as it reflect inwards and then\
    \ back outwards. And so the key difference that I was looking for years. And then\
    \ message travels distance. That makes sense. So what does it mean? So look at\
    \ color next week, next next week next meeting. But this is just to foreshadow\
    \ a little bit. So what's your understanding of gamut that we have out of gamut\
    \ pixels couldn't process physically cannot display the colors that are needed\
    \ displayed within our color spectrum. Yeah. So oh. oops sleep in some particular\
    \ color. Or Rgv. yeah, so is talk a lot about physical. physically based rendering\
    \ so spectra fits into that quite well. But then we have to consider how people\
    \ will perceive the color. Oh, one Gb. red, green, and blue. So we have this idea\
    \ of a tri-state in this colored fairy. Try the 3 stimuli correspond to red, green,\
    \ and blue. So the way the display works is there are red, green, and blue colors,\
    \ and and each pixel resolution at resolution of each pixel and display don't\
    \ even. And then color. We're setting values for red, green, and blue. We make\
    \ the red, green, and blue effect right? Colors that we can represent. and international\
    \ in college. All international bodies have French names, it seems. and device\
    \ is colors that you can get by combining red, green and blue are available to\
    \ us from display. So there might be some differences between monitors. Talk about\
    \ good friend approaches for dealing with that makes sense way to convert between\
    \ spectra and colors. Well, the things we discussed today really seem okay. All\
    \ right. I'm sorry I didn't have more stuff on the page, for today's meeting.\
    \ Something came up this morning that I need to deal with. So focus on the section\
    \ dealing with color for next meeting. You can read the. It's not the next one,\
    \ but you can read ones in between if you like, but we'll be focusing on color\
    \ next time. Okay. thank you for today you don't have a midterm schedule in. When\
    \ do you have? I thought I did have a date for the midterm? Maybe I'm logged.\
    \ Oh, look again! It's the Thursday after the break. and we'll cover everything\
    \ up to the break. We're on Tuesday. Oh, I invite your suggestions for exam questions.\
    \ anyway, we're out of time. So thanks again for today. Take care! Stay warm.\
    \ See you on Thursday. Now we'll see if I have a recording this or not. Hey? Thank\
    \ you very much."
