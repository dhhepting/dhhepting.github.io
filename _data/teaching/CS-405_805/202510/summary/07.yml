- desc: How's everyone today?
  persid: ''
- desc: Good?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ve tried To take the

    feedback. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve specified chapter four,

    section one, and I have a link'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to that for next class reading,

    as well as the PBR key version'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for User''s Guide and PBR key

    version for file format the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a word about assignments.

    Since I said I''d talk about them'
  persid: ''
- desc: this Week, I
  persid: ''
- desc: so there were 30 marks and
  persid: ''
- desc: I think that adds up to 30.
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, I didn't.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the first one will be to

    familiar, familiarize yourselves'
  persid: ''
- desc: with pbrt Making some,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some simple, some

    straightforward changes to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example input file that

    generated the sphere floating'
  persid: ''
- desc: over the checkerboard and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is there any interest? So I see

    the second and third assignments'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about Gen dealing with

    generating more complex images.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is there any interest in

    providing an option to instead'
  persid: ''
- desc: of two and Three, do
  persid: ''
- desc: Some implementation And
  persid: ''
- desc: it. So I'm thinking option C,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re not putting all your

    eggs in one basket.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll make a choice on your

    courses for this. Does that any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion about this to begin

    with? Yeah, explain what that'
  persid: ''
- desc: option C is. A
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit i I''m thinking to give you a

    bit more variety of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opportunities to get marks so so

    this isn''t weighted as much,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, so do a variation of

    assignment of one of the bigger'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignments, two or three, And

    then the implementation is worth'
  persid: ''
- desc: a bit less. I
  persid: ''
- desc: okay So I Will. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I thought I had a bigger version

    of this. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. Usually, if you open it in a

    new tab, you can zoom in on it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this was done before 3d

    printers were really a thing. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this was done with a program

    called Ray shade, written by'
  persid: ''
- desc: Craig Cole and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he was once considering doing

    his PhD at the University of'
  persid: ''
- desc: Regina,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking he went to Stanford

    instead. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway, so one of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one of the assignments will be

    to take that shape and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reinterpret it. Take this image

    and reinterpret it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t know how many hours it

    took to compute this. I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'recall, but it would not be

    long. Would be a few seconds'
  persid: ''
- desc: These days, I'm sure you
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that seem okay. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, let''s Talk about The quiz.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: spherical ordinance and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, octahedral encoding an

    equal'
  persid: ''
- desc: area mapping,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an equal area. So what about

    spherical coordinates. So it''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nice representation, but if

    we''re going to there are some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drawbacks, because we there''s

    distortion of the poles. And if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we want to think about set

    uniform sampling using that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameterization, we''ll get A

    we''ll get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very equal distribution of

    points I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the reasons are talking about

    octahedral encoding as a way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be more efficient in terms of

    storage and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve Never tried to draw an

    octahedron on the board.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And How does that look? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is, we''re going From

    the top, we''re going To do'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is the upper part, and then

    we Fold out The bottom and'
  persid: ''
- desc: and the equal Area mapping
  persid: ''
- desc: is a way to the
  persid: ''
- desc: Instead
  persid: ''
- desc: of I'll bring up the picture
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here. So I''m just curious, is

    anyone able to click on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'links to the pictures and

    actually have something show up?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What are you using for a

    browser? Yep, fireproof. I have'
  persid: ''
- desc: them on Chrome. You're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just talking about big in

    Chapter pictures, right?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. So there, let me see,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there was An open image In your

    tab. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I wonder
  persid: ''
- desc: what the problem is. Anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s good to know you''re still

    not numbered. The way they'
  persid: ''
- desc: advertise. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the third prioritization. So

    the idea is we''re Taking the'
  persid: ''
- desc: unit square and we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we create the mapping from

    unit square to the unit disc,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we do the mapping so that

    we''re preserving area, and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points on the disk are mapped to

    the hemisphere for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s a link in the text to

    an appendix talks about sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: a unit disc.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is about the spherical

    prioritization of spherical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates. So we get a using

    that parameterization, we get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collection of points at the

    pole, at the center, so we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not getting uniform distribution

    over the whole disk. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a correct map, it gives

    uniform distribution of light.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what about the Class,

    direction, code?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, God. That direction from

    that''s the it''s similar to what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we talked about yesterday, when,

    when light rays are popping out,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it calls them right away, so you

    don''t have any calculations on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them. So it keeps them sort of

    like in A spotty direction or In'
  persid: ''
- desc: the Correction direction. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: So then we can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bound the directions so that we

    know that we''re going to do.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Using to reduce complexity. So

    here''s something about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constructor for the direction

    cone I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here for finding an angle then,

    so we want to create the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directions we so we can create a

    cone. So we have a point, p and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a bounding, in this case, a

    sphere. So we want to determine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the size of the cone that

    includes the directions here, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have point P and then the

    center of The sphere. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is u of R equals one. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is, we get, we can

    find the cone, which will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'include the directions from

    point P and including that'
  persid: ''
- desc: bounding sphere and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then we can look at whether

    these bonding cones, these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction cones, are included in

    One in the other. So we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simplify our calculations that

    way.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And similarly, we could take

    cones that are not inside the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other but we can Find a new cone

    that bounds both of them and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are two interpretations

    of the matrix transformation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in Frame and Frame too frank,

    yeah, That''s right. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so within frame means we''re

    describing how points are points'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and geometric objects are

    positioned within the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frame. In that tetrahedron,

    example, had a bunch of spheres'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that were transformed to create

    that shape. And then so that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: within frame and between frame
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s like when we''re setting

    up the camera. So we specify an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'arbitrary position for the

    camera, an orientation, so then'
  persid: ''
- desc: we can set up.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can set up a matrix to go

    from the world coordinate frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the camera coordinate frame.

    We'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we'll talk about that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So homogeneous coordinates and

    so we have a fourth element to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our vector. Instead of x, y and

    z, we have x, y, z and w.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that w is generally one and

    so you can see in the textbook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to talk about making things more

    efficient'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by omitting the division by W in

    some cases. So it''s really the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'projection, the projective

    transformations, that we''ll be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking about chapter five,

    that''s the case where we need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be concerned with W and do that

    division and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s the benefit? What''s a

    practical benefit of using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'homogeneous coordinates for Lyd

    geometry? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''re asking. What''s the point

    of keeping that last bit? Is'
  persid: ''
- desc: that what
  persid: ''
- desc: you're asking? Well, I has
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do with multiplication. For

    instance, if you want to, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything is on zero, then you

    won''t be able to save whether or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not it''s scaled to a certain

    degree, and it will just kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ignore that bit. It''s just a way

    of returning everything back to'
  persid: ''
- desc: its origin. I can
  persid: ''
- desc: you explain that a bit more?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you take a shape and you

    perform a bunch of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplications on its

    dimensions, so it''s like three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'times bigger. That last bit will

    give you the ability to divide'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it by three. It sort of is. It

    will remember that was sort of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplied by three, and it

    allows you to say, Oh, this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing is scaled by three. You

    could tell, by the way, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weight variable is three, for

    instance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ok. So if you want to scale by

    3x, Y and Z, I,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if, if this last entry, it''s

    a three as well, then It''s, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really, this is Really the

    identity matrix.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You so we''re talking about three

    dimensions here, so x, y and z,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and this last column is the so

    we can think of these as as the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'basis vectors for our frame, and

    this is the origin i'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re representing three

    dimensions. Why is it a four by'
  persid: ''
- desc: four matrix and
  persid: ''
- desc: well, because we have
  persid: ''
- desc: x, y, z and w, I, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s do some multiplication

    on the board. This is shout out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when I make a mistake, although

    this is pretty straightforward,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have three times x and

    nothing else i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three times y and nothing else,

    three Times said and nothing'
  persid: ''
- desc: else that we just Want. Nothing
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's say w equals one. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's the scaling.
  persid: ''
- desc: What if we want to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what if we wanted to move the

    point as well, instead of just'
  persid: ''
- desc: scaling it, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. That''s like the last column

    on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the right. Yes, so if we just

    have,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we have three by three

    matrix, we have 3x'
  persid: ''
- desc: reduce the multiplication We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if you want to translate to

    123, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing not just the

    multiplication, But we''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: an addition here. So if we If
  persid: ''
- desc: here We get i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we get the addition just by

    the matrix multiplication. Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any questions or concerns about

    that? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so there''s a translation

    matrix that we just talked'
  persid: ''
- desc: About.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a distinction here,

    applying transformations to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points and to vectors. So w

    equals one is a point and a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector w is zero because we can

    think of a vector being defined'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as The difference between two

    points.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So x1, y1, z1, one. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so x1, minus x2, y1, minus y2,

    z1, minus z2, and then one minus'
  persid: ''
- desc: One, if equals zero and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if vector, we have the W set

    term equal to zero, then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't get in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the get in these terms, because

    the plus one is because of The'
  persid: ''
- desc: one here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So 3x plus zero, y plus zero, z

    plus one times zero, so that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: zero.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the translation affects

    points, not vectors. Does that'
  persid: ''
- desc: make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So we can do a scaling where

    it''s uniform, like we did here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or we can assign different

    values for each term so they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a function as scale to

    determine whether there''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scaling component in the

    transformation. And so they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'testing the the length if it''s

    greater, if the difference in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'length after the transformation

    has been applied is greater than'
  persid: ''
- desc: A tolerance.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then we have rotations as

    well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we rotate around the x

    axis. So we can see the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'column is just what we''d expect.

    It''s it doesn''t do anything to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the x coordinate, it just

    multiplies the x coordinate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value by one, so it leaves it

    unaffected.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Y and Z axes are changed. So

    base take the cosine of theta,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the sine of theta, that''s how

    the y axis is transformed, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then minus sine theta, cos theta

    is what the that access becomes'
  persid: ''
- desc: so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re combining X and Y or Y

    and Z values with cos and sine'
  persid: ''
- desc: functions and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the x coordinate stays the

    same, and we have Y And Z here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we see the rotation I,

    a theta.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here, for rotating around the

    Y axis, the Y column is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'identity, so it''s unchanged. And

    for the Z axis, Z for rotating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the z axis, the z

    coordinate is unchanged, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then the X and Y are modified by

    those trig functions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can rotate around an

    arbitrary axis and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a is the vector we want to

    rotate about, and V is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector We''d like to rotate about

    that'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we find
  persid: ''
- desc: 'V c by projecting v onto a, and

    that''s the dot product. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so one vector we can determine

    by subtracting V from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subtracting V C from V so that''s

    v1 and then v2 you can take the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cross product v1 and a, a is

    normalized, so v1 and v2 have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the same length. And and then we

    can compute the angle and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can convert that into a

    matrix. Here''s part of that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that transformation in matrix

    form we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can also rotate one vector to

    another. And then I just want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about the lookout

    transformation. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can specify Camera Orient,

    position and orientation and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so sometimes we get, we have one

    vector here, defined by the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'difference between the look at

    and the i point, and we have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector from the up, and we do a

    cross product, and then we get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: third vector.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then here they re compute up by

    doing a cross product so that If'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well. So to get an ortho

    orthonormal basis, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So I just wanted to point

    out in the last minute here that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have that we were

    transforming normals. So if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scaled the circle to be half as

    tall in the y direction, then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think we''re doing the right

    thing in B to get the normal to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transform the normal, but we''ve

    lost the property that normal is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perpendicular to the surface, so

    we need to do a bit of work to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'handle the transformation of

    normal vectors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the takeaway is that normals

    must be transformed by the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inverse transpose of the

    transformation matrix, And'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's our time for today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any questions or concerns.

    you''re doing Wiki pages, please'
