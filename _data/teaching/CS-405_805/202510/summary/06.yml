    thing I can the edge room I can'
  persid: ''

    hot spot. I''m waiting on a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ticket for that, but the other

    one last night and today, my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'password manager, so I''m using

    one password. Anyone familiar'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with that one? I i have a 19

    character password, but last'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'night, I decided to not accept

    my credentials. So then I called'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it service, and I have somebody

    had somebody who was helpful,'
  persid: ''
- desc: but a little bit condescending.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so when it happened anyway?

    So I reset my password, and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seemed to work. And then today,

    when I logged into your courses,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I had the same problem, and I

    called it support, and I got the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same person and said, if you''re

    confused, I said, Listen, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not confused. I have anyway.

    This is an IT person at the U of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'R, Yeah, you sound

    shocked. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: didn't know that we had an IT.
  persid: ''
- desc: Help. Help Desk,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but it''s the service it''s now

    it''s the Service Desk. IT help'
  persid: ''
- desc: desk. I can't
  persid: ''
- desc: 'believe we even paid for one,

    but we have one. I worked there,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but there being an IT help desk.

    It was like one person does kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of check out? Well, there''s lots

    of people in that office. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think it''d be funnier that''s

    just like, one day, just sitting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there, like, all the time, just

    like, oh, going through set my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'passwords, like, Oh, it''s you

    again. It''s the whole'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'person that''s just like mumbling

  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what I learned

    today is if I copied the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'password out of the Password

    Manager and click Login, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'worked. So I''m I''m not sure if

    there''s a strange character'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'somewhere in the process, or

    this particular person with whom'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I spoke was not interested in my

    problems with a passive password'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'manager. He was convinced that

    the problems with me,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the other apartments

    that are like that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for sure, it''s not limited to my

    car Statistics.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Not CS, so we''ll say onward and

    upward. You.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I was talking about the comes
  persid: ''
- desc: from a bow and arrow.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a mistranslation

    along the way, apparently.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, this gives you a few

    resources to look at if you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interested in etymology.

    Etymology is study of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'history of words. Entomology is

    a study of bugs, so there''s one'
  persid: ''
- desc: letter difference, I believe I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see if my black marker

    that I brought is going To be'
  persid: ''
- desc: any better. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So do you agree with that

    statement? Chapter Three is too'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'big to say, just read chapter

    three.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I will

    endeavor to break things down so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have a bit more depressed. I

    compressed so we have more focus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on What we''ll be talking About

    the Next day. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we don''t finish in chapter

    three today, we''ll cover next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'day, and then in future, I''ll

    break down chapters by sections.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m pleased to report

    somebody came to my office hour'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and somebody posted to the class

    discussion, and I replied right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'away to encourage that behavior

    so everyone''s got the software'
  persid: ''
- desc: sorted. Now. Is that true?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Should we go? Does

    anyone not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is anyone not

    willing to put their hand up in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class? Who''s not willing to put

    their hand up in class?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I guess I should ask who''s

    willing to put their hand up in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class. Okay, I think That''s what

    everybody saw. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so keep you abreast of

    developments, whether we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: pbrt installed in the labs. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s talk about the

    quiz questions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s so appealing

    to use This mouse, but it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: connected to my computer, So
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: quiz, so?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So where are the

    two things we have to specify.'
  persid: ''
- desc: We're dealing with array,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Origin and Direction.

    Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and to cover the

    matching question, what kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing is the origin and what

    kind of thing is the direction,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point and vector. Yeah, point

    and vector.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how would you? How do you see

    the quizzes so far? Are they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for those who did 315 last

    semester? Are they better than'
  persid: ''
- desc: what I did in 315 okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so generally, the quizzes are

    tied to the readings. So when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re dealing with questions

    that come up, you can look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the readings to find the

    answers. So it''s a way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incentivize you to look At the

    things I''ve asked you to look'
  persid: ''
- desc: at. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s not the word I

    was looking for.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I that''s not

    quite the question was, I guess'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I could read the question, what

    is the unfortunate turn of'
  persid: ''
- desc: terminology with normals not
  persid: ''
- desc: necessarily normal?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, they''re not necessarily

    normalized. Yes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I try and do more alliteration.

    I do'
  persid: ''
- desc: normally. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so what is a stereo steroid in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t understand what it is.

    I''m trying to figure out it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seems to be a unit index, but

    that''s as far as I figured out.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s the way of like measurement

    of sphere specifically, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of similar to how, when

    you''re measuring like a circle,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have like radians, like a PI

    is like something pi. Radians'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for, like a single, like a whole

    circle is measured in radians,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah. So if you apply that to a

    sphere, since you can, like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'integrate the circle into a

    sphere, you can turn it into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stir radians, which is just

    basically a solid radian. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'amount of area that if you

    project a ray into, like a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closed loop, makes, like, that

    amount of steradians.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: ''
- desc: Makes good sense, actually.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when we''re talking about the

    in 2d we can think about an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object, the angle, the arc

    length of the projected object,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we'll maybe see those
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look at a couple figures. So in

    ve,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instead of the

    planar angle, we have the solid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angle, which measures The amount

    of the sphere that''s covered by'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the object that''s projected.

    So steradian is a way to measure'
  persid: ''
- desc: angles within A sphere and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe I fill that in a

    bit more.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so before we get into
  persid: ''
- desc: the Text stuff I
  persid: ''
- desc: promised A gold sphere I
  persid: ''
- desc: looks like a Christmas ornament?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does it look like

    a gold Christmas ornament?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Though? Yeah, I think so too. So

    let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there are lots of parameters in

    this description that we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: going to deal With today, but I
  persid: ''
- desc: so see the
  persid: ''
- desc: physically based and
  persid: ''
- desc: the parameters at work here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can see

    there''s a reflection of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'checkerboard pattern here that''s

    clear enough, but there''s about'
  persid: ''
- desc: '3% of the pixels here that are

    out of gamut or clamp'
  persid: ''
- desc: zero to one.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let me I me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'show you what the file looks

    like.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I just changed the sphere that

    was the dielectric, or the glass'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sphere, and I made it into the

    gold sphere.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will separate

    these a little bit better and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put them on to make them

    available in the Dropbox. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so it''s the same as

    a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nose of audio is connected to

    the HDMI. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I took this material from an

    example of a gold plated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kangaroo. We can look at that

    file in a minute as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the end, these are spectrum

    data. So there are files here'
  persid: ''
- desc: that are referenced for Gold.
  persid: ''
- desc: Au is gold and
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's try Changing i
  persid: ''
- desc: Four. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we made the gold rougher so

    it looks more like an ornament,'
  persid: ''
- desc: doing it the other way. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so it''s a much smoother

    surface. Does that make sense?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, it''s really reflecting the

    sky so heavily.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's see if, what if we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Increase the samples here.

    Sorry, Sorry. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this has more out of gamut

    pixels, so you can see'
  persid: ''
- desc: here the errors or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the pixels that are out of gamut

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so would you want to, like,

    clamp them to keep them in'
  persid: ''
- desc: range?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, they do get

    clamped here. So the report is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three. That''s a little bit less

    than two or 3%'
  persid: ''
- desc: but the pixels are
  persid: ''
- desc: have been clapped, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s where we see these

    specs'
  persid: ''
- desc: come up. So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part of what

    we''ll explore is how to set the'
  persid: ''
- desc: parameters so we we get
  persid: ''
- desc: better images,
  persid: ''
- desc: so We don't end up with
  persid: ''
- desc: Without of gamma pixels. We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we had Killer root

    coated Gold. Yes, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: can you See I should
  persid: ''
- desc: change this. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Is it first? Visible enough? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what I''ve done for for the

    gold, The simple,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I've taken the
  persid: ''
- desc: coded conductor description i
  persid: ''
- desc: from here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is

    applying the code of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: conductor to a killer
  persid: ''
- desc: room. So Let's I
  persid: ''
- desc: up. Let's run This. We're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So once we

    get through chapter three, we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look at the user guide for the

    pbrt and understand what''s being'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specified in these images, in

    these files, and how they''re set'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up, and then use that For our

    first assignment.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I Let''s look at the

    gold one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And it look
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like a solid gold compared to

    the other one I'
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, there I was only COVID and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gold. Yeah, I''m gonna just look

    At the file now. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'conductor material, as opposed

    to coded conductor I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it Okay. What do you think about

    that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can I see the other one back and

    forth?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Should be just down a little

    bit. I see it there. Says one'
  persid: ''
- desc: beside it,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just above your mouse, there''s a

    highlighted thing just above'
  persid: ''
- desc: that with one, okay, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, it looks like A golden

    ring this time, instead of an'
  persid: ''
- desc: ornament. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I I
  persid: ''
- desc: can see the
  persid: ''
- desc: this coded one doesn't Look as
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looks different than The Golden

    One. Anyway, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I just want to

    highlight the camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'implementations in tbrt, so

    We''re using the differentials.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So the differential is,
  persid: ''
- desc: if that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one ray going

    out, then we have the difference'
  persid: ''
- desc: in x and in y.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the rays are going out from

    the camera one pixel apart. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have this, this one, and then

    we''re talking about using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'differentials to capture the

    information, more information'
  persid: ''
- desc: about The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the area surrounding

    the array of that pixel And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so bounding boxes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Have You

    encountered that idea before? So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pen is for pen is

    horrible.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe I should use it this one,

    maybe that''s going to last a bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: longer bounding boxes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I just want to

    think about the general case,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'why bounding boxes might be

    helpful in processing a scene'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that has billions of triangles

    in it. We don''t have to start'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with billions. We could say

    millions or 1000s, even,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, I can see if,

    like you''re trying to decipher'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'array or something, to see if it

    interacts with that particular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bounding box at all. I and then

    if it interacts with that box,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then, due to further

    calculations, if it doesn''t,'
  persid: ''
- desc: then you can skip it.
  persid: ''
- desc: Was that your answer?
  persid: ''
- desc: It was similar. Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i have something that could also

    be added. All the vectors that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are going upward will probably

    not collide with anything,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unless you have a roof. So you

    can have a similar bounding box'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s anything that''s

    scattering upward probably won''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collide with anything. So you

    can just stop calculating them'
  persid: ''
- desc: at a certain point.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You could even, like, clamp

    anything that shoots up too far'
  persid: ''
- desc: from The light source. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You so we can

    talk about in ray tracing, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we send out the rays from the

    Camera and we measure their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interaction if we have a

    perfectly reflective sphere,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we bounce a reflection off

    The sphere. And if there are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more spheres, then we create

    more rays that reflect.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If we''re if we have a model

    that''s very reflective has a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of reflectors in it. At some

    point we could go on forever and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this use of boundary boxes in

    3d is discussed later. Another'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example using them In the

    Software Is The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s a question

    criterion to stop, other than'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'depth of weight of race,

    because, if so number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflections, you could have it

    stop after a certain amount,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we talked about like

    infinite back and forth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Reflections, but maybe you don''t

    want more than eight.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Alternatively, if it''s not

    necessarily the number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflections, but if we assume

    that a ray is basically just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like a photon, have a little

    walk around, there''s like a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'predictable curve. It''s like the

    inverse squares. It gets farther'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and farther away. It loses

    energy. But if it reflects off'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something that''s not perfectly

    reflective, it loses some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'proportion of energy. And you

    can clamp it so that after they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lower bound, it just stops

    computing because there''s no'
  persid: ''
- desc: additional info being added.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, i
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is the planar angle.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s the

    angle from a point p of an'
  persid: ''
- desc: object.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So from the top to the bottom,

    that''s the angle and S is the R'
  persid: ''
- desc: length on the
  persid: ''
- desc: unit circle the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when we have a three

    dimensional so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m Going to go

    from the unit circle to the unit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sphere. Then we''re projecting

    the object onto the unit sphere,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then have the total area s

    of the projection, and that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the solid angle instead of the

    planar angle. And the solid'
  persid: ''
- desc: angles are measured in steradian
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can think of polygons

    being projected onto a sphere.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That becomes spherical polygons

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so again, think About

    edges of the polygon being great'
  persid: ''
- desc: circles. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a great circle

    is one that includes the center'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the sphere. So it''s not just

    off to the side. That''s not a'
  persid: ''
- desc: very technical definition. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there are a few different

    spherical parameterizations used'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the software we can do

    spherical coordinates and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s two angles

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one in the plane,

    the x y plane, and then another'
  persid: ''
- desc: one In
  persid: ''
- desc: the Z axis.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's quarter after two.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So thank you for

    today, and we''ll finish the rest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of Chapter Three on Tuesday. And

    then we''ll get into using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software in more detail. Okay,

    thank you for your attention'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today. Have a great weekend.'
