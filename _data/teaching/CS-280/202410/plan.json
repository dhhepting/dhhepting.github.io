It is also imperative to recognize that this is not a oneway street. Society also affects computing, resulting in a complex socio-technical context that is constantly changing, requiring the perspective of history to put the present, as well as possible futures, into appropriate perspective. Social Context provides the foundation for all other knowledge units in SEP (Society, Ethics and Professionalism), particularly Professional Ethics.\"\n\t* Topics:\n\t\t1. Social implications (e.g. political and cultural ideologies) in a hyper-networked world where the capabilities and impact of social media, artificial intelligence and computing in general are rapidly evolving\n\t\t1. Impact of computing applications (e.g. social media, artificial intelligence applications) on individual well-being, and safety of all kinds (e.g., physical, emotional,economic)\n\t\t1. Consequences of involving computing technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, biometric technologies and algorithmic decision-making systems, in civic life (e.g., facial recognition technology, biometric tags, resource distribution algorithms, policing software)\n\t\t1. How deficits in diversity and accessibility in computing affect society and what steps can be taken to improve diversity and accessibility in computing\n\t\t1. Growth and control of the internet, computing, and artificial intelligence\n\t\t1. Often referred to as the digital divide, differences in access to digital technology resources and its resulting ramifications for gender, class, ethnicity, geography, and/or underdeveloped countries\n\t\t1. Accessibility issues, including legal requirements and dark patterns\n\t\t1. Context-aware computing\n\t* Illustrative Learning Outcomes:\n\t\t1. Describe different ways that computer technology (networks, mobile computing, cloud computing) mediates social interaction at the personal and social group level.\n\t\t1. Identify developers’ assumptions and values embedded in hardware and software design, especially as they pertain to usability for diverse populations including under-represented populations and the disabled.\n\t\t1. Interpret the social context of a given design and its implementation.\n\t\t1. Evaluate the efficacy of a given design and implementation using empirical data.\n\t\t1. Articulate the implications of social media use for different identities cultures, and communities.\n\t\t1. Explain the internet’s role in facilitating communication between citizens, governments, and each other.\n\t\t1. Analyze the effects of reliance on computing in the implementation of democracy (e.g., delivery of social services, electronic voting).\n\t\t1. Describe the impact of the under-representation of people from historically minoritized populations in the computing profession (e.g., industry culture, product diversity).\n\t\t1. Explain the implications of context awareness in ubiquitous computing systems.\n\t\t1. Explain how access to the internet and computing technologies affect different societies.\n\t\t1.

How did that go?\n * more about assignments\n* Ethical theories and principles are the foundations of ethical analysis because they are the viewpoints which can provide guidance along the pathway to a decision. Each theory emphasizes different assumptions and methods for determining the ethicality of a given action. It is important for students to recognize that decisions in different contexts may require different ethical theories to arrive at ethically acceptable outcomes, and what constitutes ‘acceptable’ depends on a variety of factors such as cultural context. Applying methods for ethical analysis requires both an understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions guiding a given tool and an awareness of the social context for that decision. Traditional ethical frameworks as provided by western philosophy can be useful, but they are not all-inclusive. Effort must be taken to include decolonial, indigenous and historically marginalized ethical perspectives whenever possible. No theory will be universally applicable to all contexts, nor is any single ethical framework the ‘best’. Engagement across various ethical schools of thought is important for students to develop the critical thinking needed in judiciously applying methods for ethical analysis of a given situation.",

            "today": "From CS2023 Report (Gamma version): 'Computer Science has had — since its inception as a field — a diversity problem. Despite being a creative, highly compensated field with myriad job (and other) opportunities, racial, gender and other inequities in representation are pervasive. For too many students, their first computer science course is their last. There are many factors including the legacy of systemic racism, ableism, sexism, classism, and other injustices that contribute to the lack of diverse identities within computer science, and there is no single, quick fix.'\n\nEquity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility (summary by ChatGPT 3.5):\n\n**Equity**: Equity refers to fairness and impartiality in treatment or access to opportunities. It involves ensuring that everyone has access to the same resources and opportunities, regardless of their background or circumstances. Equity recognizes that different individuals may require different levels of support to achieve the same outcome.\n\n**Equality**: Equality refers to the state of being equal, especially in status, rights, and opportunities. It involves treating everyone the same and giving everyone the same opportunities, regardless of their differences. Equality aims to ensure that everyone has the same starting point and access to the same resources.\n\n**Diversity**: Diversity refers to the presence of differences within a group or organization. It encompasses a variety of dimensions, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, and socioeconomic status. Diversity recognizes and values the unique perspectives and experiences that individuals from different backgrounds bring.\n\n**Inclusion**: Inclusion refers to the practice of actively involving and valuing all individuals within a group or organization, regardless of their differences. It involves creating a sense of belonging and ensuring that everyone feels respected, valued, and empowered to contribute.\n\n**Accessibility**: Accessibility refers to the design of products, services, environments, and information to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. Accessibility aims to remove barriers and ensure that everyone, including those with disabilities, can fully participate in society.\n\nIn summary, equity focuses on fairness and impartiality, equality focuses on treating everyone the same, diversity focuses on differences, inclusion focuses on involvement and belonging, and accessibility focuses on removing barriers. These concepts are interrelated and are often used together to promote a more inclusive and equitable society.\n\n* [https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter){:target='_blank'}\n* [https://www.w3.org/WAI/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/){:target='_blank'}",

The grounds for social justice and world-remaking, however, are frictioned; technologies, architectures, and infrastructures are often designed and implemented without committing to disability as a difference that matters. This manifesto calls attention to the powerful, messy, non-innocent, contradictory, and nevertheless crucial work of what we name as 'crip technoscience,' practices of critique, alteration, and reinvention of our material-discursive world. Disabled people are experts and designers of everyday life. But we also harness technoscience for political action, refusing to comply with demands to cure, fix, or eliminate disability. Attentive to the intersectional workings of power and privilege, we agitate against independence and productivity as requirements for existence. Instead, we center technoscientific activism and critical design practices that foster disability justice.\"\n\t* [Cover image from the Catalyst journal issue that contains the manifesto](https://catalystjournal.org/public/journals/145/cover_issue_2199_en_US.jpg){:target='_blank'}\n* Does computing do enough to promote IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility)?\n\t* [ACM 'Words Matter'](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter){:target='_blank'}\n\t* [https://www.w3.org/WAI/](https://www.w3.org/WAI/){:target='_blank'}\n* [The Humane Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Interface){:target='_blank'} (book by Jef Raskin, Aza Raskin's dad)\n\t* \"An interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate of human frailties.
