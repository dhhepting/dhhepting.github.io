It is also imperative to recognize that this is not a oneway street. Society also affects computing, resulting in a complex socio-technical context that is constantly changing, requiring the perspective of history to put the present, as well as possible futures, into appropriate perspective. Social Context provides the foundation for all other knowledge units in SEP (Society, Ethics and Professionalism), particularly Professional Ethics.\"\n\t* Topics:\n\t\t1. Social implications (e.g. political and cultural ideologies) in a hyper-networked world where the capabilities and impact of social media, artificial intelligence and computing in general are rapidly evolving\n\t\t1. Impact of computing applications (e.g. social media, artificial intelligence applications) on individual well-being, and safety of all kinds (e.g., physical, emotional,economic)\n\t\t1. Consequences of involving computing technologies, particularly artificial intelligence, biometric technologies and algorithmic decision-making systems, in civic life (e.g., facial recognition technology, biometric tags, resource distribution algorithms, policing software)\n\t\t1. How deficits in diversity and accessibility in computing affect society and what steps can be taken to improve diversity and accessibility in computing\n\t\t1. Growth and control of the internet, computing, and artificial intelligence\n\t\t1. Often referred to as the digital divide, differences in access to digital technology resources and its resulting ramifications for gender, class, ethnicity, geography, and/or underdeveloped countries\n\t\t1. Accessibility issues, including legal requirements and dark patterns\n\t\t1. Context-aware computing\n\t* Illustrative Learning Outcomes:\n\t\t1. Describe different ways that computer technology (networks, mobile computing, cloud computing) mediates social interaction at the personal and social group level.\n\t\t1. Identify developers’ assumptions and values embedded in hardware and software design, especially as they pertain to usability for diverse populations including under-represented populations and the disabled.\n\t\t1. Interpret the social context of a given design and its implementation.\n\t\t1. Evaluate the efficacy of a given design and implementation using empirical data.\n\t\t1. Articulate the implications of social media use for different identities cultures, and communities.\n\t\t1. Explain the internet’s role in facilitating communication between citizens, governments, and each other.\n\t\t1. Analyze the effects of reliance on computing in the implementation of democracy (e.g., delivery of social services, electronic voting).\n\t\t1. Describe the impact of the under-representation of people from historically minoritized populations in the computing profession (e.g., industry culture, product diversity).\n\t\t1. Explain the implications of context awareness in ubiquitous computing systems.\n\t\t1. Explain how access to the internet and computing technologies affect different societies.\n\t\t1.

How did that go?\n * more about assignments\n* Ethical theories and principles are the foundations of ethical analysis because they are the viewpoints which can provide guidance along the pathway to a decision. Each theory emphasizes different assumptions and methods for determining the ethicality of a given action. It is important for students to recognize that decisions in different contexts may require different ethical theories to arrive at ethically acceptable outcomes, and what constitutes ‘acceptable’ depends on a variety of factors such as cultural context. Applying methods for ethical analysis requires both an understanding of the underlying principles and assumptions guiding a given tool and an awareness of the social context for that decision. Traditional ethical frameworks as provided by western philosophy can be useful, but they are not all-inclusive. Effort must be taken to include decolonial, indigenous and historically marginalized ethical perspectives whenever possible. No theory will be universally applicable to all contexts, nor is any single ethical framework the ‘best’. Engagement across various ethical schools of thought is important for students to develop the critical thinking needed in judiciously applying methods for ethical analysis of a given situation.",
