- desc: 'no'
- desc: We went over the assginements in class today. While the larger research assignment/infographic
    was easy to understand, I struggled to really see a purpose to the smaller CIPS
    IT assignment. In a class based on risk and reward in computer systems, why are
    we giving so much information to CIPS to complete what is essentially a job skills
    quiz? I failed to find how the CIPS portion relates to the course material, or
    how the marking criteria will work.

    ll answer here. I hope to understand more about the ethics that hold the computer\
    \ science side to stuff together. "
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: One thing that was difficult for me to understand was why we need to be able
    to be fact checkers when we could just look for credible sources or peer reviewed
    papers. Also, could there not be inaccuracies with Wikipedia?

    it seemed a bit unclear how it will be graded, though it may become more clear
    when more details are posted.

- desc: The Group assignment was little bit difficult to understand exactly how to
    do that and what to do in the assignment.
- desc: 'No'

    be the grading rubric for these assignments, and what are some examples of the
    topics we can choose for our infographic?

- desc: 'no '
- desc: It was difficult to understand how we can work in groups for the assignment.

- desc: everything that is discussed today
- desc: I learn more aout assignment today and also learnt about the ethics in detail
    and yes the group have to be  splitted again, not a great fan, but it will be
    different experience
- desc: Discussed about assignments and project
- desc: An important concept I have encountered today is the group work.
- desc: Evaluating information via sift
- desc: I encountered the new info on the asignemnts
- desc: important concept for me for today's is class is assignment annoucement.
- desc: Today I got to learn about infographic assignment and verifying facts
- desc: Today we went through our assignments and learned about CIPS.
- desc: Dark UX interface designs and how they can fool people to up-sell things that
    people don't need/want.
- desc: 'Group work and individual assignment '
- desc: Got to know about assignment and group tasks to do
- desc: Fact-checking sources is important
- desc: Importance of ethics
- desc: 'Canadian Information Processing Society (CIPS) and how to become a student
    member '
- desc: 'cryptography '
- desc: 'How to check the sources/credibility of an online article the way fact checkers
    do. '
- desc: How to verifying a valid information online.
- desc: not yet
- desc: Not to completely rely on information that we read on article. First make
    sure that the source of the information it well known enough based on number of
    members or their revenue
- desc: We talked about ACM ethics, assignment, etc.
- desc: "Proactive CARE for Computing Professionals. CONSIDER who might be affected\
    \ and how, ANALYZE the situation\u2019s details, REVIEW other obligations and\
    \ limitations, EVALUATE the best course of action:"
- desc: 'I learned about how to be a pro fact-checker. When looking at any kind of
    information we see online, it is important to check if it is true before believing
    it. To do this, we must ensure to look into the original source and determine
    its credibility (via wikipedia). '
- desc: 'Proactive care of professionals '
- desc: Evaluting information by SIFT, The standford experiment
- desc: Using Wikipedia for fact checking - I was always told not to trust Wikipedia
- desc: There are unlimited ways to get information from the web. It is hard to distinguish
    between such online sources to determine its credibility. To weed out the fake,
    rather than only looking at what the specific organization says about themselves,
    look at what the web tells us. Then look at the source of the information. Do
    not take all information for face value. Instead, trade for a higher trusted source
    and search if the information presented in the article is verified.
- desc: how to fact check information
- desc: Dark UX features can be terrifyingly effective in causing users to commit
    to actions unknowingly.
- desc: 'Talking about Assignment '
- desc: 'ACM Code of Ethics and Assignments '
- desc: 'We didn''t really discuss many new topics in class so not particularly '
- desc: Ethics
- desc: UX patterns.
- desc: Important discussion today was about assignment.
- desc: Evaluating Information using SIFT
- desc: I learned about the assignments
- desc: I learnt about all the different principles and what each of them entail when
    it comes to people vs. technology.
- desc: An important perspective that I encountered yesterday was the SIFT acronym
    for evaluating information.  I thought I had been evaluating information with
    online resources correctly, but it turns out according to SIFT I have not been
    tracing my media back to it's original context but rather just use trusted websites
    and fact-checked websites. Because of this new found technique I can accurately
    tell whether the media was fairly represented in the original context.
- desc: 'The idea to check the source  has never occurred. Only check their credibility. '
- desc: Cryptography
- desc: 'ACM code of ethics '
- desc: 'Infographics and assignments '
- desc: Nothing important
- desc: The Dark UX patterns topic was actually increadibly important, and I am incridbly
    intrigued by them. I found out about dark UX stuff from Youtube (go figure), and
    the rate they are effective is actually incredibly terrifying. By nestling options
    that prevent revenue, tech companies unfairly pressure users into paid, or alternatively
    more expensive, products that users didn't need (or in many cases, even want).
    It's also a crazy ethical issue too, since as a developer, you choose between
    poverty or ethics!
- desc: the importance of ethics
- desc: Learned what SIFT stands for. Stop, Investigate the source, Find better coverage,
    Trace claims, quotes and media to original context. SIFT is good for finding reliable
    sources on the internet and not spreading misinformation.
- desc: 'Assignments '
- desc: 'how to identify legitimate and reliable sites.  '
- desc: 'The concept I got to know was more about the assignment which was been discussed
    properly '
- desc: I learnt about the contents of our assignment and how the marks are allocated
- desc: 'An important I encountered today was how to efficiently decide if a website
    is reliable or not! 1) check main source through wiki and such 2)If not main source,
    go further and find main source and check it 3) fact check it '
- desc: Different simple ways to check if the content I'm reading online is based
    on real data.
- desc: The impotance of checking into the sources behind everything you read online.
    Many pages are not worth your time especially when more reliable sources exist.
- desc: About assignments, CIPS's SFIA and case study on dark UX patterns
- desc: I learnt about the different methods of fact checking an article online using
    fact checkers such as Snopes
- desc: I learned how to search for credible sources and get to the root of where
    they came from
- desc: Infographics, the use of pictures/visual images to represent data
- desc: 'Today we encountered few important things such as the assignment deadline,
    the last day of meeting and which should be submitted first and group assignments '
- desc: 'I learnt about infographics and how to use them in tech. '
- desc: 'UX pattern and assignments '
- desc: There were a Few important concepts in class today about investigation on
    ethics and how fact checker plays role in deciding authencticity
- desc: I think it was about the assignment discussion, that which assignment should
    we do first. The individual one or the group one.
- desc: "As per my understanding in today\u2019s lecture was based on networked learning\
    \ and discussed about assignment in brief."

- desc: Today we discussed about the two different assignments.
- desc: ACM Code of Ethics
- desc: Today we went through our assignments. We discussed the details of what is
    expected of us, and the marking scheme as well. We also watched a few videos regarding
    our portfolio assignment as well.
- desc: Assignment topics and groups
- desc: An important concept I encountered today was the importance of how one evaluates
    information found online. SIFT can be used as a tool to identify false information.
    One thing in particular that seemed to be the most important was looking into
    the credibillity of the source. From the Stanford Experiment stated in the video,
    65% of Stanford students incorrectly chose the more credible source. All it would
    take is a quick search to see which one is more credible, and decent percentage
    of them most likely didnt
- desc: Today the prof explained about the assignments and exams
- desc: Today we discussed about the assignments of individual and groups of 4. Also
    we later discussed about the video in which we were being taught about fact checking
- desc: short  videos about checking whether a source is reliable or not
- desc: 'I realized that it is vital to check your sources. Considering how many people
    failed the Standford experiment, most people don''t know how to check if their
    source is creditable. This can lead people to get false information from the web. '
- desc: That I need to go to my sources' sources to make sure that my information
    is accurate and true.
- desc: I was absent in the class today
- desc: We talked about assignments
- desc: i did not learn any important concept today
- desc: i get to know a lot about how to verify a source
- desc: How to find trusted sources of information on internet
- desc: 'Today we just to about ethics topic and assignment and group discussion '
- desc: 'It was about Assignments and Classwork groups . '
- desc: Today, we were introduced to CTRL-F's Online Verification Skills videos, where
    they discuss the importance of fact checking the information and sources we are
    researching on the internet. It is easy to be misled and so you need to do even
    more research on top of the research that you are already doing to make sure that
    your initial research is credible.

- desc: The videos we watched in today's class were pretty interesting to me.
- desc: 'Read and learn the concept '
- desc: An important concept we encountered today was credibility of sources. Whether
    a source was creditable or not and how we can identify them. In the videos we
    watched, it said there were many ways to know; one being to search the name of
    the source on wiki and another was to check if there's an author posted somewhere
    and when it was posted
- desc: The importance of distinguishing between credible and non-credible sources
    online
- desc: I learned whether or not to trust any given information by doing background
    check.
- desc: During this lecture I learned that there is even more to ethics than I had
    previously thought from last lecture, and I only expect to find out more
- desc: We watched some videos about how to find viable sources and how to fact check.
    It's very useful because I may never know how reliable a source is.
- desc: we learned how to find crediable sources

    of a site as well as how to verify facts on the Internet. '
- desc: 'One important concept I learned today was the acronym for evaluating information:
    SIFT.  When analyzing the validity/reliability of a source I have learned that
    I must Stop, Investigate the source, Find better coverage, and Trace claims/quotes
    to their original source.'

    quality of life, confirms that computing experts have a responsibility to apply
    their knowledge for the good of society.

    it if we dived deeper into what exactly makes a source credible. The videoes brought
    up in class point towards the staff, budget and other qualifications, but it would've
    been nice to have specifics on these traits. Like how many people should be working
