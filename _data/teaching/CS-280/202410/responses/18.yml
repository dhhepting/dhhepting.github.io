- desc: The profound impact of social media on individuals and society
- desc: All the things discussed today
- desc: Watched a movie in class today and discussed social dilemma
- desc: If you are not paying for a product, you are the product. This is basically
    how all social media platforms operates yet not so many people understand this
    concept.
- desc: The amount of control social media has over us.
- desc: People speak about their jobs working at facebook,instagram and twitter
- desc: Today we watched Social dilemma
- desc: That social media is a handy tool in today's digital age but, it has very
    serious flaws and can be dangerous for people using it.
- desc: Social Dilemma
- desc: No, we just watched movie.
- desc: social media has drastically affected mental health and suicide rates
- desc: everything
- desc: Regualtion and its flow was one of the important  concept.
- desc: The dilemma faced with the use of Socia Media and the adverse effects.
- desc: Watching 'The Social Dilemma' really put into perspective the ways big companies
    are using our data for their own personal gain and profit. One thing I particularily
    likes was taxing companies for the data that they store, thus financially dissincentivising
    them to continue hoarding out data and using it for (arguably) malicious or preditory
    purposes.
- desc: 'The three dangers of social media on our daily life, predict finances, mental
    health, and discrimination '
- desc: we are in a information cocoons
- desc: There are intersectional actions required to get over the challenging times
    of social dilemma
- desc: Role of social media in a persons life in a bad way
- desc: We talked about the people sharing their experiences working at big tech companies,
    movie, etc.
- desc: The fact that much of the social media and business architecture is based
    on the users subconscious biases and actions
- desc: Promote digital literacy, advocate for ethical tech design, and foster diverse
    representation in the industry to address the intersectional challenges highlighted
    in The Social Dilemma and build a more equitable digital future
- desc: 'The concept of today''s social dilemma with technology: If you are not paying
    for the product, you are the product (companies collecting your data).'
- desc: 'Social dilemma '
- desc: I thought it was interesting to hear the interviewees on The Social Dilemma
    boil down the three main goals of social media companies as engagement, growth
    and advertisement. The way those three ideas are portrayed in a sci-fi like skit
    also emphasizes the threat these companies pose when they have access to everything
    we do online.
- desc: It is important to receive information outside of your own views. Social media
    often tries to keep you in a bubble.
- desc: 'Social media is something that I plan to phase out of my life. I plan to
    allow myself to be bored. '

    interesting that in the Social Dilemma they were deeming the problem an existential

- desc: 'I learned that social media collects data and have more control on our life. '
- desc: 'The Social dilemma '
- desc: I encountered the concept of how social media and AI affects our growing world.
- desc: "An important perspective I encountered today was that fake news spreads 6x\
    \ faster than real news. Because fake news brings in money some companies don\u2019\
    t frown upon promoting it because it brings them more income. I think this is\
    \ straight up wrong and the screening yesterday definitely sheds light that some\
    \ laws need to be implemented about digital privacy and whether fake news should\
    \ just be spewed all over the internet. The screening reinforces that we need\
    \ some laws to protect people. "
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: The important perspective I encountered today was the idea that the people
    working in the tech industry did not realize all of the unethical things that
    were happening until it was too late. If these individuals could not realize what
    was going on, how am I supposed to know what is right vs wrong?
- desc: 'the social dilemma. and the effect of social media in our society '
- desc: from the movie " all social media compete for attention
- desc: 'the videos are interesting '
- desc: Man-made horrors beyond my comprehension. The demon of social media and it's
    leeching of my attention is now very front and center in my mind. The current
    world and the world I want to live in are irreconcilable.
- desc: the social dilenma
- desc: I learned how companies and corporations manipulate their users to stay addicted
    to their digital products and services

    \ change in behaviour is the product. There\u2019s almost no laws about digital\
    \ privacy."

    information about it '
- desc: Social media is designed to be manipulative.
- desc: An important concept I encountered today was from the movie the social dilemma
    and how are security is at risk through various social media apps
- desc: 'Today we watched a movie called the social dilemna. From the movie it showed
    how much my generation was and is still being effected by social media. I feel
    social media can be a place to grow as a person and learn whatever you want but
    there are problems that need to be fixed such as social media always wanting your
    attention. It should be a place to learn and explore not a place abused by companies
    to make you the product. '
- desc: Persuasive design techniques like push notifications and infinite scroll have
    created a feedback loop that keeps us hooked.
- desc: I learned about how social media companies spend billions of dollars into
    making as much money and harvesting as much data as possible from their users
- desc: I found it interesting that the user on a free web application is considered
    the product.

    film.
- desc: We watched The Social Dilemma which covered many issues related to social
    media such as rising depression rates, the selling of our information and how
    companies manipulate us by using our data to build a profile for us.
- desc: 'The mental health, democracy, discrimination dilemma subtly perpetrated by
    social media '
- desc: Midterm paper, missed about missing matoaka and sustanability

    are actual consumers of technology, and this is how you generate money.

    moreover the laws that can be implmented towards the negative use of technology

- desc: 'We talked about how user are turning into the product being sold to advertisers
    when they assume they are using an online service for free. '
- desc: 'I really enjoyed the film we watched this class. Being someone who used social
    media regularly, I really did not see all these subtle tactics that companies
    use in order to control our attention. I thought the film was very well put together.
    The music was excellent and very engaging. It was also interesting to see the
    speakers from the podcast in this video.  '

    how companies are not always looking out for us.

    some bonus clips from the movie. Afterwards, we discussed some actions we can
    take to protect ourselves from the dilemma. These include: deleting social media,
    using Qwant or DuckDuckGo, and touching grass. We also discussed about some things
    that we can look at doing to help prevent society as a whole to fall victim to
    this issue, like regulating technology and aiming for better digital literacy
    for society (especially youth).'

    next move, what youre interested in and what grabs your attention.

    \ often have underlying consequences which make technology problematic e.g biases\
    \ in ai, like button causing a mental health dip in teens. On the flipside, businesses\
    \ are not regulating any of this."
- desc: I got to know about Social Dilemma today.

    \ companies, but they are all competing in order to create the best versions of\
    \ your selves by setting algorithms to study if your an introvert, your political\
    \ stance etc during the video \u201CSocial Dilemma\u201D. This was proved by the\
    \ many former employees of the big companies speaking up"
- desc: The topic in the video about how people left their jobs in big companies like
    Google , meta , twitter because of their ethic towards their work
- desc: all social medias compete for attention, "how can we get as much as this person's
    attention can we get? how much of your life can we get?"
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today was the social dilemma. Behind many
    social media apps, companies are collecting an extortionate amount of data from
    their users. They are manipulating our behaviors, building models that predict
    our actions, fighting for our attention and selling our data to various advertisers
    all for the sake of profit.. '
- desc: 'I learned that that if you are not paying for the product that you got from
    the internet then you are the product. Social medias will always compete for attention
    and that is the main goal. If these problems continue, then we will go through
    digital warfare '
- desc: They have access to more information about us than we realize, including our
    birthdate, personality type, dating history, and activities. We are unaware that
    all of this data and information is being automatically entered into unmonitored
    systems that forecast our behaviour and identity. They use this information to
    create models that forecast our behaviour, and whomever has the most accurate
    information about themselves has greater influence over our lives and attention.
