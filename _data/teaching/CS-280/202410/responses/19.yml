- desc: the mother of all demos was interesting
- desc: I encountered the importance of empathy and mirroring in ELIZA's conversational
    design.
- desc: 'How "THE MOTHER OF ALL DEMOS"  changed the world forever '
- desc: There is a shorter hsitory of computers then i thought there was.
- desc: Mother of all demos and ELIZA program
- desc: Today we learned about motion of all lens
- desc: That women were the first people to run code on the NEIAC the first working
    computer.
- desc: CIPS meeting and topics and social dilemma and risks and rewards
- desc: No, we just watched a show
- desc: That the history of computing is largely attributed to white men when, in
    reality, there were many other contributors of diverse backgrounds including women
    and people of colour.
- desc: The Mother of All Demos is a profound concept that i have encountered today.
- desc: Women were part of the team that invented the first ENIAC Computers
- desc: Getting to know about different milestones in computing history helps to understand
    the exponential growth of technology we talked about in other class.

    of a socio-technical system feeding back into the system itself, fostering continuous
    evolution and improvement.
- desc: 'Today, I learned about "The Mother of all Demos" which was a live demo that
    introduced the key components of our digital world today: hypertext, video conferencing,
    word processing, mouse, etc. It''s a pivotal moment in history that truly embodies
    the power of computers as tools for collaboration and augmentation of our collective
    intelligence. '
- desc: 'The concept which we covered today was related to the human computer interaction '
- desc: 'Problem associated with social dilemma '
- desc: Something important that I encountered in this class is how the first computer
    programmers were women. Women who are never mentioned nor credited for their contribution
    to the creation of computation. I think this is important to know, not just so
    more women can have female role models to look up to, but also to pay more attention
    to how gender bias these industries are such as the computing industry.
- desc: 'An important concept was talking about Ada Lovelace, credited as the first
    computer programmer, and then personally considering her impact on gender ethics
    in computer science. '

    creations, and how the lack of representation affects women today.
- desc: An important perspective that I encountered today was the fact that such intricate
    machines that we have now stemmed from vacuum pipes and the whole world revolves
    around that technology. Having said that, about the women in STEM I knew women
    often did not get credit but it was really great to see Kathy shed light on the
    brilliant women who helped create the field that I am studying.

- desc: 'Today a important concept I encountered was the very first computer and showing
    how it operated and all the features '
- desc: 'Today we started talking about the history about computing and we watched
    videos about the first programmers. I think its very important to learn about
    where computing came from and how far its come! It shows how much we have learned
    and developed. It shows that we can always improve. '
- desc: Women in STEM being forgotten in history
- desc: That it is important to study history, to know how far we have come, how much
    has changed, and how little has changed.
- desc: History of Computing, Mother of All Demos, ELIZA
- desc: I learned about the history of technology such as the computer and the nuclear
    bombs

- desc: Some information regarding skill assignment part two.
- desc: Today we learned about Eliza a natural learning processing program.
- desc: We had members from the CSSS come to class today to talk about the upcoming
    elections. Today, we talked about the mother of all demos. The first public demonstration
    of the mouse, and modern computing. We also talked about ELIZA, which is an early
    computer language.  We also watched a TED Talk, which talked about the role of
    women in the computer society.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: got to know about eliza which was the best part of today's class
- desc: An important perspective today is that learning about history is important,
    as it makes aware of the figures behind many of the things we have today. In particular,
    we looked at the birth of the computer and ENIAC and the diversity of its team.
    One of the speakers of the TedTALK mentioned that we should be acknowledging this
    diversity show that anyone can be like them, and how anyone can go into STEM.
- desc: Today we discussed about ELIZA
- desc: The most important perspective I encountered today was the TED talk we watched
    on how women were hidden from the computer science field. Especially early on,
    women didn't get credit for the work they accomplished.
- desc: 'Watch some movie and discuss skills assignment '
- desc: We talked about Charles Babbage and why is it important to study history
- desc: we watched a video in class today. there were a couple of computer jokes but
    i didnt understtand it.
- desc: Today's important concept was breakthroughs in technology and its history.
    We discussed some names that were fundamental to the development of today's knowledge
    of technology (Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace), and other less known names (ENIAC
    Women) that contributed to the early computers.
- desc: 'Everything '
- desc: ELZIA

- desc: Today we watched videos about the women who helped build the first computer.
    We also watched a video about the beginnings of computation during the manhattan
    project.
- desc: The mother of All demos
- desc: An important concept we talked about today in class was the history of computers,
    what are the milestones and when did we start keeping track. One milestone we
    talked about was ELIZA, how it paved the way for human-computer interactions.
    Not only did it pave the way of technology, it was also invented by women in stem;
    thus now, empowering other women to go into stem.
- desc: 'Reviewing important inventions in technology. '
- desc: Something important I came across in today's lecture was a piece of computing
    history that I did not previously know about.
- desc: Mother of All Demos Video Notes (Map of all the milestones) - the mouse -
    1968? Had 2 wheels perpendiculat to each other right, very inefficient could only
    move left right up and down - chording keyboard - learning curve was not small
    (kind of like going from a tricycle to a bicycle)

- desc: The concept of mother of all language and how it was a major landmark for
    computer demonstration and development. This demonstration's underlying concepts
    and technologies influenced both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows graphical
    user interface operating systems in the 1980s and 1990s.
- desc: Today we watched different videos. one was regarding history of computing
    while one was a ted talk video explaining women's role in computing.
- desc: An important concept I encountered today is various milestones in computing
    history and how different parts of the computer first started out. For example,
    I learned that the mouse only had 2 perpendicular wheels at the time of creation,
    and that the keyboard first started out as a chording keyboard that had a fairly
    large learning curve. As technology began to advance, more features and optimizations
    were added to the computer, which helped develop the modern computers we have
    today.
- desc: The idea of "mother of all languages" and how it marked a significant turning
    point in the development and display of computers.  The fundamental ideas and
    technology of this demonstration affected the graphical user interface operating
    systems of Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh in the 1980s and 1990s.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The first public demonstration of the computer mouse and fundamentals of modern
    computing

- desc: Maybe more about the ENIAC during the WW2
- desc: 'everything is straight forward '
- desc: It would definitely be enlightening to learn more about the people that have
    been "forgotten" in the development of the computer science field. The women who
    programmed the ENIAC, the topic brought up in class, had a crazy impact on the
    field of programming, and it would be awesome to see what other people have been
    forgotten in favour of the typical white dudes we see in the written records.
