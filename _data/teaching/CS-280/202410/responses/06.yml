- desc: The idea that asking why something is being done is more important than how
    it can be done.  I feel like we don't do things unless we know why we're doing
    them.  Like creating something, we are creating it for a reason.  Coding something
    because we want to get a specific result.  I feel like a greater debate is how
    something CAN be done versus how something SHOULD be done.

    \ of Analysis, I would label them as Judgement instead. "

important:
- desc: Ethical Judgement in computing professions.
- desc: Criteria for Ethical Judgment Models of AI
- desc: We watched a video about methods of ethical analysis
- desc: Ethics in the world of computer science and data. The problem with ethics
    is that no one really enforce it in the world of technologies. As discussed, tracking
    of customers by using an app that does not nessecarily relate to their business
    is morally wrong. How can companies do better and be left in charge of this? Customer
    should have a say how their data is being used. Ethics is dificult to follow if
    people that checks it are the companies itself.
- desc: The concept about logical fallacies
- desc: The important concept I encountered today is in the realm of computer professionals,
    the development of ethical judgment is important.  We are faced with ethical dilemmas,
    such as privacy concerns, impact of AIs etc. So, ethical judgment is essential
    guiding us to better outcome.
- desc: important concept from today's lecture is ethical judgment.
- desc: Blooms taxonomy and how it impacts software developers.

    stage amongst all but if overused could lead to analysis paralysis. '

- desc: "there are 6 different parts of bloom\u2019s taxonomy that help us to make\
    \ ethical decisions as software engineers. these are. knowledge, comprehension,\
    \ application, analysis, synthesis and judgement"
- desc: 'Today we looked further into Bloom''s taxonomy and the 6 levels of thinking.
    I learned that to really excel at a concept, we must be able to create something
    from it and being able to recall and comprehend is not enough. '
- desc: Bloom's taxonomy
- desc: The overwhelming lack of asking the question why in the technological world.
    Knowledge and understanding of how the computer world can be navigated is pondered
    far more than why a certain decision should be made. It does not matter how, if
    it works against the benefit of others(morally), the task should be abandoned.
    So, constantly analyze and if the first decision is the wrong one, there is no
    more decision to be made.
- desc: ethical judgement among computer professionals
- desc: 'Logical fallacies are important to understand in all aspects of thinking,
    and I enjoyed wondering how they relate to the world of computer science. When
    we evaluate our decisions about the technology we create, we must be hyper aware
    of our fallacies in reasoning. '
- desc: I thought the concepts of logical fallacies while analyzing decision making
    was very important to consider.

- desc: That classmates talking makes learning difficult
- desc: When is it okay to collect data from people, and what that data is specifically
    used for whether that be targeted ads or other information.
- desc: 'Through the video we watched were told to watch yesterday and watched today,
    the perspective of hiring software engineers on an analysis basis and not implementing
    higher levels of Bloom''s Taxonomy in the hiring process. And then falling into
    the problem of not having judgment skills because of all the analysis and now
    diving into the problem of ethical judgment with computing professionals and asking
    why before how and before analyzing the whole problem instead of making an initial
    judgment.  '

    fallacies. It was interesting to see that ethics could be influenced by fallacies

    Also, the judgement part of ethics is various aspects is considered. '
- desc: 'Today we watched a Steve McConell video regarding Bloom''s taxonomy and Judgement. '
- desc: Today I learned about Methods for Ethical Analysis and Logical fallacies
- desc: the important concept i got to learn today was regarding the ethical Judgment
    and different ways of ethical analysis. also the difference of Ethical Judgement
    and Analysis , and at last regarding the logical fallacies.
- desc: Ethical decision
- desc: "An important concept or perspective from today is that when it comes to ethics,\
    \ you always ask \u201Cthe why\u201D before the \u201Chow\u201D. This is important\
    \ because \u201Cthe why\u201D is what determines whether or not the action can\

    they would apply to the world of computer science. We can see the "appeal to authority"
    fallacy would when citing online users, but whatever other instances of that fallacy?
