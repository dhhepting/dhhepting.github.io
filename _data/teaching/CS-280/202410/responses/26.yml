    I discovered that computer forensics is something I could potentiall get into.
    It sounds intesting and I didn''t know it could be a career option for me. '
- desc: 'Final exam '
- desc: An important concept I encountered in class was the example of the movie Robots
    with the narrative of constantly needing to upgrade yourself or society will deem
    you obsolete. I see thing happening with cellphones where they stop working after
    some time, prompting users to buy the newest cellphone.

    but it also wants to be free, as in freely accessible to people

    on dark patterns were interesting

    game design and cybersecurity aspects.
- desc: "An important perspective I encountered today was \u201Cfree information\u201D\
    \ and the tradeoffs that come with free information and how many people are not\
    \ willing to put their info in front of a paywall because they have no other way\
    \ to monetize their work"
- desc: not really
- desc: 'One thing that I found important was the idea that information wants to be
    free or expensive. It is interesting to think of it this way since I always considered
    it to either be information we wanted to share or data that we wanted to hide.  '
- desc: Final exam
- desc: finals
- desc: Final exam
- desc: 'Final exam review '

    and what kinds of questions will be there, along with some of the topics that
    will be present as well.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: "Today in class we discussed the phrase \u201CInformation wants to be free,\
    \ but information also wants to be expensive\u201D. We talked about how information\
    \ will have that implication as in the digital world, information is widely accessible,\
    \ but can also be easily locked behind things such as paid services, encryption,\
    \ etc. We talked about how this relationship will always seem to coexist in our\
    \ current society."

- desc: 'today we talked about information wants to be free (wikipedia), where it
    the phrase encapsulated the idea that information, like a force of nature, desires
    both freedom and value. It also has been advocated for open access and criticized
    by those who argue for IP rights. Another thing we talked about today in class
    was what to prepare for the exam and what the format is kind of like. Another
    thing we talked about was the infographics. '

    comes at a price, and often times if we do not have to pay for the product, then
    we are the product.
- desc: Talked about the final
