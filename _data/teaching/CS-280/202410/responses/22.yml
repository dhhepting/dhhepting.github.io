- desc: "Social media issue repeat with AI. The AI tech advance is unprecedented and\
    \ we don\u2019t know how big the consequences yet regarding its true impact. AI\
    \ is scary yet can be good and useful if used correctly. "
- desc: a good one
- desc: Digital Innovation in Taiwan
- desc: 'Today we encountered economics of computing '
- desc: That Taiwan has broad band internet across the whole country for a country
    with 23000000
- desc: Digital innovation in Taiwan
- desc: Yes, talked about who would be new urban planner
- desc: online platforms are the new spaces and we need online urban designers
- desc: digital innovation in taiwan
- desc: The type of regulation we should seek was important concept i have encountered.
- desc: Some digital Innovations in Taiwan that seems to be working for them.
- desc: The technological innovations brought in Taiwan is the most inspiring I have
    known the way they have incorporated open source computing is I feel the right
    use of it. Also the idea of implementing the proposal of the general public in
    governmental affairs to try for a year is also an innovative approach.
- desc: AI heading us into capital of social media
- desc: 'no'
- desc: importance of computing in today financial situation
- desc: 'We talked about Computing, financial system, etc '
- desc: technology holds a very strong influence over society. some regulations that
    we should be seeking include transparency and accountability, as well as ethical
    guidelines. Users should understand how AI algorithms function and make decisions.
    Ethical guidelines can address issues like AI's impact on employment, its potential
    to affect inequality.
- desc: 'The monopoly of tech giants in Assessable operating systems '
- desc: One important concept that I encountered while discussing with my group about
    computation of personal finance is credit cards. We talked about how many banking
    companies use credit cards to exploit money from people by using ads to push them
    into increasing their credit limit.
- desc: 'And important concept was looking at the benefits and drawbacks of computing
    on personal finances, especially considering how money is so accessible with card
    and mobile phone payment methods, yet easier to spend irresponsibly. '
- desc: the impact of computing on personal finances
- desc: security
- desc: Taiwan has country wide broadband Internet access. This is possible due to
    their small geographic region
- desc: 'We discussed the ethics of owning and developing a large social media platform.
    Specifically, it included how to make these online social spaces better. '
- desc: "I found it important that the question of what regulations we should be pushing\
    \ for was brought up. Right now a lot of the stuff on the internet isn\u2019t\
    \ heavily regulated, it is really just easy for companies to take advantage of\
    \ us. What can be done to stop this?"

    more data-focused
- desc: The social media issue with AI
- desc: Does being in an information age mean that we have vast amount of info good
    or bad or that we are informed and make that distinction?
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today was the way Taiwan innovates using
    completely different policies than in North America. I thought Dr. Hepting provided
    a good point of big tech is preventing this innovation from happening for monetary
    reasons, and it made me realize how money hungry these companies really are, and
    are not focused on the people who use their programs but just the money that these
    users bring to the company, only releasing new features when it is monetarily
    beneficial. '
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: The idea that we have to have internet platforms that mimic the real life
    activities. I would have never thought we should be trying to incorporate technology
    in a more natural way that advances what we were doing before.
- desc: more about ethics and the ted talks
- desc: Digital Innovation in Taiwan and asking why not anywhere
- desc: 'they were pretty understandable '
- desc: The ethical impacts of tech in finance is actually really potent. The ease
    of access to funds, while great for people that need to access money they have,
    can pose great risks for those that end up using money they *don't.*

- desc: The affect that computing has on personal finance, and how it changed it.
- desc: 'the intresting topic i learned was the apple antitrust case as i am also
    a apple user so was a fun '
- desc: 'An important concept I learnt is how the AI industry is basically heading
    directly to the same problems/ downsides that befell social media '
- desc: 'Today we encountered the pros and cons of computing in personal finance.
    I think computing has allowed people to be able to manage their finances more
    easily. The issue is the people who arent good with technology, so they dont gain
    from it like the people who do know how tech works etc. '

- desc: The perspective that social media sites like Facebook end up like the neighbourhood
    with garbage fires everywhere.
- desc: Digital Social Innovation to Empower Democracy, Obligations of social media
    and group discussion around "computing changed personal finance"
- desc: We talked about how computing has changed personal finance and we watched
    2 videos about how social media is too open and how the Tiwan government works.
- desc: How the social media spaces/structure affects conduct. eg LinkedIn vs X(Twitter)
- desc: 'Obligations and allegation on social media, more discussion '
- desc: An important concept i learned today was on digital innovation in Taiwan from
    the TED Talk Video
- desc: economics of computing
- desc: 'Regulations of security '
- desc: There was one important thing which was about assignment 3 discission.
- desc: Gained some different knowledge about the subject in a interesting way.
- desc: 'we learnt about Who will be the urban planners? '
- desc: Computing about financial system
- desc: Today we looked over the idea regarding technology and social innovation.
    One TEDTalk focused on creating environments online where people can have a place
    to communicate and feel comfortable; this talk's main idea is that humanity can
    only move forward when we trust one another. Another TEDTalk was about using technology
    to build a framework where democracy becomes less like two sides 'tugging', and
    moreso a conversation/discussion. Both these talks emphasize the importance of
    communication to better our s
- desc: We encountered different concepts in class and also discussed innovation in
    taiwan and social issues.
- desc: Today we discussed about kind of regulation
- desc: 'I realized how much of an impact computing has on our personal finance. For
    example, with the rise of Apple pay, online shopping, credit cards, etc. it changes
    our view of money as a whole. We might end up spending more in the process because
    we view money more digitally than tangibly. '

- desc: The idea of various environments affecting people's train of thought within
    the ted talk
- desc: Today we watched 2 TedTalks one which was from Audrey Tang and how the empowering
    democracy with technology. Tang said he uses the internet as a space for civic
    participation, dialogue, and consensus building. Another thing we talked about
    was if it was possible to navigate a page on your phone without getting hit with
    an ad; which by testing this out, i have found it is nearly impossible to not
    get hit with an ad if we are on websites or social medias.
- desc: 'Knowing about the digital innovation in Taiwan was really eye opening. That
    should happen to other regions, too. '
- desc: It was a great class, as it usually is. I love his humor
- desc: Economics of computing, innovation in Taiwan, urban planners and web designers
    as a start
- desc: Economies of Computing
- desc: ' How might platforms bring people together and create meaning?  - User friendly
    vs. public friendly products - online spaces can learn from offline spaces - we
    have different ways of relating - incidental exposure - the more you encounter
    someone, the more familiar you will feel with them. - sharing proximity to build
    social trust - healthy public spaces creates ownership and responsibility - we
    need digital environments that respect human diversity'
- desc: We briefed on computing and encouraged conversation on the history before
    continuing through the lesson plan
- desc: 'Digital innovations '
- desc: 'nothing '
- desc: Today I got to know about thoughts on how computing has changed personal finance
    from some students.
- desc: We can foster a digital landscape that can both be efficient and successful
    while not necessarily having to align with corporations and stakeholders. Instead
    of a digital landscape that doesnt respect our privacy to data and shamelessly
    plug corporate greed, we can ask for consent and be explicit in the use of data
    and lessen the amount of corporate dreck on the Web.

    \ media was introduced, and that we shouldn\u2019t make the same mistakes that\
    \ we did with social media, to ai."
- desc: Following the TedTalk with Audrey Tang, we discussed how computing has changed
    personal finance, and found that on of the positive consequences was the access
    to information, but a negative consequence is the risk of having personal information
    compromised.
- desc: So many
- desc: Economics of Computing. Knowing about the digital innovation in Taiwan was
    really eye opening.
- desc: 'Today we watched couple of videos on different topics. '
- desc: An important concept I encountered today was the fact that spaces are able
    to shape behavior. The way in which they are designed and the way they encode
    behavioral norms often affect our underlying tendencies. Digital spaces and social
    media platforms also shape behavior, and thus we must work towards building a
    healthy and structured environment that is conducive to human behavior.
