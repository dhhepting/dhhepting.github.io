important:
- desc: Today I learnt how social media can cause unhappines to users.
- desc: "Misinformation being presented when told about Kate Middleton\u2019s cancer "
- desc: The convenience and potential threats brought by 3D printing technology
- desc: 'Photo manipulation has been going on for a long time and that with the rise
    of AI and tech detecting fake photos will be a lot harder. '
- desc: Regarding the different perspectives of gun laws in the states and canada,
    especially with respect to the 3d printed gun situation.
- desc: A new perpective on how economics are affected by computer science
- desc: news articles and  first human Neuralink patient controlling a computer with
    his thoughts
- desc: Economics of computing
- desc: 'Today we talked about the economics of computing, as well as Apple antitrust
    and 3D printed guns. '
- desc: Nothing that important.
- desc: 'everything '
- desc: How photo manipulation can produce a terrible outcome is a important concept.
- desc: The statistics on younger Canadians (below 30 years) less happy
- desc: "How happiness of an individual is affected by social media. It indirectly\
    \ influences by making a person anxious even though scrolling hasn\u2019t proved\
    \ to bring any beneficial outcomes still people are getting more and more pulled\
    \ into it."
- desc: Economies of computing for example computers collecting peoples data and influence
    their chooses in the market.
- desc: 'NO'
- desc: about neuralink
- desc: We talked about the assignment, economics of computing, etc.
- desc: Kate middleton has cancer?! and that Some European grocery stores have adopted
    dynamic pricing
- desc: I learned about how people are using 3D printing software to build guns. This
    is both an impressive and terrifying development because of an old technology
    can be repurchased to build functioning tools while also making it easier to mass
    produce lethal weapons while making it difficult to trace weapons found in a crime
    scene.
- desc: 'We must consider legislating the economy of attention so that humans'' attention
    is not unethically manipulated for profit. '
- desc: I thought the Apple anti-trust case was important, it raises the question
    about proper ethics in the industry and if it is okay for Apple to have their
    services act as a walled garden.
- desc: The presentation for cips
- desc: Ethical Prospective of the Assignment
- desc: Neuralink patient controlling a computer
- desc: 3D printed gun
- desc: Understanding the economic dynamics of computing is crucial for both providers
    of computing resources and services and for society at large.
- desc: An important perspective I encountered yesterday was the concept of 3D printed
    guns, I had no clue that was a thing and it makes me wonder what other things
    can be illegally printed to promote violence and harm. And how the law can ban
    these types of things from being printed. It seems all new technology brings good
    and bad such as AI and deepfakes but how can we as computing professionals stop
    the bad of emerging technology from happening?
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: impact of phones sms and social media. Iphone as an example
- desc: ethics
- desc: personal skills
- desc: "The CIPS presentation contained tons of info. Reflecting back on that presentation\
    \ I am very happy they came in. I think it\u2019s super important to have a society\
    \ that I can be apart of and I can\u2019t wait to go to one of their events."
- desc: News updates, Economics of computing
- desc: "How LLMs\u2019 are neither surprising nor unpredictable, but are actually\
    \ the consequence of how we measure ability in AI."
- desc: The concept of dynamic pricing
- desc: Something I found interesting was about the lawsuit of apple and not owning
    a iPhone
- desc: 'Today, we talked about economics in computing. One of the explained examples
    was Neuralink and I think that this will have a huge impact of ethics in the future
    because of how it effects us. It will change every aspect of technology. So I
    feel that the ACM code of ethics will need to decide on where Neuralink will sit
    ethically wise. '
- desc: The idea that 3D printing guns can be dangerous
- desc: The crackdown on 3D printed guns - how the Canadian provinces are responding
    to this issue.
- desc: Kate Middleton, Apple Antitrust Case, Dynamic pricing (for groceries)
- desc: How owning an Android is treated like its less than Apple, even though they
    both offer the same features and purpose
- desc: 'I learned that some people may be pressured into buying Apple products so
    they fit in with the messaging system '
- desc: We talked about many things such as how AI relates to economics, how easily
    someone can fake a photo, and what should be done about 3D printed guns.
- desc: 3D printed guns in Canada which is a serious concern because they are untraceable
- desc: neuralink
- desc: We discussed few about assingments, apple antitrust case
- desc: I learnt that the economies of computing is important to those who develop
    and provide computing resources to others.
- desc: Everything
- desc: 'No'
- desc: We discussed about few of the topics from the previous assignment
- desc: Economies for computing
- desc: I think today is the due for assognment 3 and as professor discuss about that
    in the class it was very nice to clear all doubts about the assognment.
- desc: 'some basic understanding as per the meeting planned '
- desc: Today we had a discussion about all the in the new topics which were related
    to 3D printed guns, about the CIPS assignment and its usefulness.
- desc: "In today\u2019s class, we discussed the CIPS presentation, along with the\
    \ skills assignment part 2. We also discussed Kate Middleton\u2019s recent diagnosis,\
    \ and apple\u2019s antitrust case. We also discussed AI, and how quickly CBC News\
    \ was able to put Pope Francis in a jacket because of photoshop\u2019s latest\
    \ update "
- desc: Today we discussed about risks
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today was how misinformation could be
    anywhere. It is easy to get misinformed. '
- desc: Recent news about kate, effect of social media and smartphones on our behaviour,
    3d printed guns
- desc: Economies of Computing
- desc: Some information about assignment 2 and CISP
- desc: Today's important concepts regarded the news (Kate Middleton having cancer,
    the happiness of Canadians, 3D printed guns, etc.). Another topic that was brought
    to my attention was the Apple Antitrust and shaming people with Android phones
    by using the green text bubbles. I had never thought of it in a point of view
    of shaming Android users and it was really interesting to learn the true psychology
    behind it. We also discussed a little bit about the economics of computing, LLMs,
    and more.
- desc: 'Everything '
- desc: That there's a stigma around green text bubbles
- desc: Addition emergent property of LLMS
- desc: 'assignment '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: ' I learnt  economies of computing '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I believe we talked about economics in the computer world.
- desc: Great choicesv takes time
- desc: 'Today we encountered a lot of news online (Kate Middleton w/ Cancer, Happiness:
    how Canadians are less happy especially how our everyday life involved social
    media, 3D printed guns, ... etc.) through the news articles we talked about  how
    some news aren''t as credible (false news), how smartphones are changing the way
    we communicate with the world, how different places have different perspectives.
    Class ended with the "if you aren''t paying for the product, then you are the
    product"'
- desc: altered or fake photos are not a new concepct
- desc: A perspective I encountered today is that software really does pose a risk
    of harm in many different ways other than just 1s and 0s. This came to me after
    I watched the video on how 3D guns are being printed and how this all occurred
    from just some code.
- desc: I learned the economies of computing are important to those who develop and
    provide computing resources and services to others as well as society in general.
    They are equally important to users of these resources and services, both professional
    and non-professional.
- desc: Important news articles
- desc: '-'
- desc: The photoshop and 3d guns
- desc: I got to know about defence distributed and other things.
- desc: The misuse of technology such as 3D printing firearms and animal testing for
    neuralink. As well as the economics of technology, trying to find a balance between
    what can make the most profit while still maintaining your ethical principles
- desc: I got to know about latest new regarding the corse today.
- desc: we discussed about assignment today
- desc: "Today\u2019s lecture was interesting "
- desc: Economies of computing
- desc: ' understanding the economies of computing is crucial for developers, providers,
    and users of computing resources and services, as well as for society as a whole,
    due to its impact on resource allocation and utilization.'
- desc: dynamic pricing
- desc: Nothing

    and problem was sorted out . apart from that we discuss some news in the class
    like apple antitrust case '

    direct impact from social media usage.
- desc: i learnt about the apple antitrust lawsuit, how fake photos are a huge problem
    on the internet, and the idea of dynamic pricing in grocery stores that are emerging
- desc: About CIPS how they work and their mission.
- desc: Today I learned what is the future of programming jobs with AI as a tool.
- desc: An important concept I encountered today is that if you aren't being charged,
    you are the product. I found this to be an interesting quote as it sheds light
    on the fact that everything comes with a price. Though on the surface there are
    apps and websites that allow you to access their resources for free, there are
    hidden motives and methods that allow these companies to make profit (some of
    which are ethical, others of which are not).
