- desc: "Overall i didn\u2019t think so"
- desc: not really
- desc: Rewards in Information Society
- desc: 'Not particularly '
- desc: What does it mean of democratization from the perspective of this subject
    any example would be good to understand it better although I know from the word
    democratization meaning freedom if correct.
- desc: 'I was a bit confused as to why we were listing class names, you were a magnificent
    prof! '
- desc: "I didn\u2019t find anything difficult to understand today. "
- desc: I have no doubts in todays class.
- desc: There is not much that is difficult
- desc: If we talk about overall then i don't think so there was anything difficult
    to understand.

    the conversation of dr. Hepting .
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nope, it was all good and its was the just the beginning of course.
- desc: Not really, because it is just a start of course right now and topic that
    were discussed in the class today was start forward and was type of real life
    examples of what are the risks and rewards.
- desc: not much

- desc: 'no'
- desc: No, everything was explained well, and I don't have any additional questions
    at the moment.
- desc: 'No everything went very smoothly, I understood everything. '
important:
- desc: We are beginning to delve into the responsible use of new emergent technologies
    which is a very important concept as our level of technological sophistication
    increases. Hopefully we get more in-depth details in class soon on this topic.
- desc: have deep understanding of pros and cons on AI development
- desc: Android is better than IOS
- desc: How CS280 will connect or will it combine will all the CS classes I took before
    and I'm taking now. Really exicted to learn about it!
- desc: Went over Chapter 1. Learnt about group work and something about podcast we'll
    need to do.
- desc: The concept of Societal, Ethics and Professionalism with regards to computer
    science.
- desc: 'The important concept/perspective I encountered today is creating a brand
    new technology always have a reward/risk, giving new responsibilities to the creator.
    Also, I thought Android will be equal to # of votes as iOS. They''re both great
    in their own way'
- desc: I encounter a perspective on the risk and rewards we have on AI
- desc: 'in today''s class we have learnt the risks we can get from the information
    technology by using the example of terminator and apocalypse now movie. '
- desc: Today as per discussion I not only learned risks and rewards with technology
    development seeing example of Terminator and Apocalypse movie. Moreover we discussed
    SEP issues in all university classes
- desc: Today we learned about the U of R's Centre for Experiential and Service Learning
    and how helpful it can be to gain experience as CS students. We also went over
    the syllabus in which we were able to get an understanding of this course and
    what to expect over the semester.
- desc: An important concept I learned today was how the URpath can be very helpful
    to further develop my future
- desc: The important concept I encounter today were about risks and rewards in the
    world of computing and technology.
- desc: Since we only went over the syllabus the course structure was much more clear.
- desc: Computers do have Risks and Rewards
- desc: the concept I know today is Society, Ethics and Professionalism (SEP). this
    is my first time to know this
- desc: Artificial intelligence has the tendency to reduce human intelligence
- desc: At the end of the lecture, we learned about list of risks and rewards of information
    security
- desc: We had a CESL information session, talked about courses enrolled, courses
    syllabus, etc
- desc: 'I learned that Technology has its risks and its rewards. Some risks of technology
    include topics or concepts such as privacy, agency, employment, "truth", and human
    intelligence, or AI. And also that The rewards of technology include democratization,
    accessibility and convenience and augmentation of human ability. '
- desc: 'I gained a lot of insight from today''s CESL visitor about how to gain more
    experience as Computer Science student, which could help me build a more successful
    future. '
- desc: Getting a head start on the future is always helpful. When not sure the path
    to take, consulting those who struggled before us is ideal.  Since the education
    field is constantly changing, the facilities to help people especially in a competitive
    field such as CS is growing.
- desc: the concept of risks and rewards when it comes to technologies
- desc: The volunteer activity , wiki page and linking or referencing other CS courses
    to this
- desc: 'I haven''t particularly thought about SEP issues in relation to my university
    courses, but I think this could be imperative to building a tech industry that
    stands on the shoulders of humane actions and decisions.  '
- desc: The brief lecture about ur path
- desc: 'The risk associated with the technologies built, how it affects our truth '
- desc: Was good knowing more about CESL today.
- desc: ' ios vs android concept '
- desc: Today, I encountered that there is several parts in this course.
- desc: Computer Science (Artificial intelligence) and how it has both its risks and
    rewards
- desc: There are many risks and rewards associated with knowledge of computer science
- desc: 'Today I learned more about what my peers believe are risks and rewards. '
- desc: A perspective I encountered today is the fact that the SEP issues can be related
    to each class us students are taking all have different implications. And, taking
    this class along with my current ones can shed light on how SEP can be related
    to each topic that is covered in every computer science class.
- desc: I find it very unique how computer science has developed. For instance, half
    of the university is in Computer Science (If I am not wrong) and that just expresses
    how big the area of study has gotten
- desc: Ios vs android
- desc: The most important concept thai ai e country was risk and reward between the
    ios and the android.
- desc: 'Important was the brief info about risk and reward in the information society '
- desc: 'Syllabus '
- desc: My Career Path. And UR path
- desc: I will not lie, there wasn't exactly much covered beside the course material.
    I don't think there was anything of importance other than the course material,
    and your brilliant sense of humour :)
- desc: Ethical considerations involving surveillance of people's data
- desc: The content learned in this class will be applicable to all the other computer
    science classes as learning about the risks and rewards of technology gives you
    a responsibility to make informed choices about how to go about learning and coding.
- desc: Artificial Intelligence System; how it can be very riskier for humanity, even
    though it can be very beneficial and reduce human workload.
- desc: 'how films and tv impacted the general perception of technology and how some
    interpret technologies as a weapon rather than a tool '
- desc: 'Today i encounter great concepts about the cs 280 and just categorizing between
    risk and rewards which might be risk and which might be reward    '
- desc: I learned about the badges from the CESL presentation at the beginning
- desc: 'A important concept I learned today was the course description and what I
    will be learning this semester '
- desc: More information about Risk and reward
- desc: I learned about AI is infringing on human creativity
- desc: I encountered the important concept of the risk and rewards of certain types
    of technologies, these technologies included iOS/ android uses. One example was
    made about sacrificing privacy for a better user experience.
- desc: I learned that the majority of the people prefer ios over android.
- desc: The perspective that human intelligence is considered a risk.
- desc: little about Society, Ethics and Professionalism (SEP)
- desc: I learnt about the existence of SEP and that it's used to call attention to
    issues.
- desc: 'CESL and how to opt for volunteering, amongst others. Also course syllabus
    on what to expect in this course '
- desc: Today we saw some deep points on the course syllabus and at the end of the
    lecture we focused on the some topics.
- desc: 'Learnt more on risks and rewards and their differences, we also reviewed
    the course outline or syllabus '
- desc: U of R path!!
- desc: Basic information of risk and reward
- desc: Getting used to multiple techniques in the course and a brief about risks
    and rewards at the end of class
- desc: 'In today''s class nothing new was introduced. '
- desc: Understand course outline
- desc: In the todays video, what Tristan Harris talked about technology industry
    is shaping the human potential and human spirit, this topic I think I encounter
    today.
- desc: according to me it was about skynet
- desc: Today we reviewed the syllabus and what was done in the previous lecture.
    An important concept that I encountered today was how the actions of different
    computer science graduates affect people's everyday life so we need to analyze
    the risk and rewards helps to prevent any ethical or social problems.
- desc: I think so it was just a second lecture so prof mainly gave an course syllabus
    overview and explain little bit about the course.
- desc: 'In today''s class, there was a short presentation from  the CESL. In the
    presentation, the newly launched software "URPath" was introduced. Through the
    presentation I realized that using URPath can be extremely beneficial to me as
    a computer science student as there are many opportunities available that I can
    take advantage of. '
- desc: Risk and Reward in the Information Society
- desc: "I really enjoyed today\u2019s class as i got to learn about different risks\
    \ and the rewards associated to them. It was really informative."
- desc: There was nothing today that we didn't cover on Tuesday.
- desc: A perspective or something to think about from today's lecture would be about
    the other CS classes I am currently taking and how this class relates to or can
    be applied to it. For something like CS 215 (Web and Database programming), how
    user information is stored, collected, and used is important as moral or security
    problems can arise.
- desc: 'Today in class, we have learned some points in the topic risks and rewards
    in the information society '
- desc: IOS and Android
- desc: 'There was an introduction for CESL and how there are many programs in which
    the students can participate. And also we discussed more about risks in the society
    and there was a detailed analysis of course outline. At last, there was an announcement
    of groups being made in the class. Furthermore, the professor asked about the
    enrollment of students in other CS classes. '
- desc: i think assignment? its still a bit hard to hear in the very end of lecture
    hall
- desc: 'We talked about how accessibility may seem like a reward of technology but
    it can also be a risk as people often take advantage of innovations to breach
    moral and ethical boundaries. '
- desc: 'In the presentation about UR path, it was enlightening seeing that there
    are opportunities for CS majors to volunteer. '
- desc: The outline of our course.
- desc: The review of the syllabus and the discussion of ur path, how it is useful
    for the students for figuring the future.
- desc: Today it was mostly the course information.
- desc: in todays lecture there was discussion on risk and reward for Android and
    ios users. This demonstrate the basic concepts of CS 280. And in start there was
    discussion about course syllabus.
- desc: Today a guest speaker came in and spoke to us about URPATH. She said that
    there were a lot of computer science jobs available. She made me recognize the
    job opportunities available.
- desc: From the todays session, the concepts that I found important is the risks
    involved such as privacy breach, human intelligence and employment risk along
    with the rewards like augmentation of human intelligence, accessibilities.
- desc: 'Today, I learned about UR Path today and the presenter for CESL informed
    us about important aspects that we should start thinking about to help build our
    background in Computer Science. We also further analyzed risks and rewards. '
- desc: rewards and risks of AI, the risk of dependence of human intelligence on AI
- desc: I has a great experience with the CESL speaker and also learnt more risks
    and rewards of AI
- desc: 'In-depth knowledge of the syllabus '
- desc: 'About apocalypse now '
- desc: 'continue on risk and reward, '
- desc: 'The course description '
- desc: The assignments, midterm and final exam syllabus.
- desc: How important professionalism is in our program computer science, and how
    it will truly effect our careers.
- desc: The UR Path explanation was the most important concept I encountered today.
- desc: Risk is privacy and rewards is benefits .
- desc: An important thing mentioned in class today was when the professor asked what
    other CS courses we were also taking. And the purpose of that was to inform us
    that we should try and implement what we learn in this class to those as it could
    be very interesting and useful. Though it is common knowledge to implement what
    we have learned in past courses to future courses; this class, however, seem to
    be a bit different then the first few basic CS courses I have taken so far. Risk?
    Reward?
- desc: You got to risk it for the biscuit
- desc: A new perspective I learned in today's lecture was how a seemingly harmless
    thing such as technology advancement could have such a negative impact on somebody's
    life. I gained this perspective by reading the introduction to the book 'Blown
    to Bits' as shown in class.
- desc: The presentation given to us today could be really important for computer
    science majors looking for a job. Especially with how competitive it can be.
- desc: Pros and Cons in android and IOS
- desc: 'Firstly, the representative of CESL had explained about UR Path, then discussed
    about course outline, review of previous lecture also about CS 428 and at last
    the information about group for discursions. '
- desc: 'Just get better understanding of syllabus and basic idea of the course '
- desc: the evolution of technology and how it can affect intelligence in humans and
    creativity.
- desc: Risk and Rewardsin in Information Society
- desc: The opportunities created by CESL and URpath. The class syllabus was interesting
    and the division of risks and rewards as technology becomes vast
- desc: I got to know about UR path and how it can help CS students succeed professionally
    going forward.Also I heard about other CS 400 level subjects which students are
    studying depending on their career prospects and interests.
- desc: Today, I encountered different kinds of risks and rewards , I also got to
    know about an American movie Apocalypse
- desc: In today's class I get to know that computer science is not a subject to study
    about computers or its various languages but people should understand the impact
    on how computer plays a vital role in everyday life and people should use it in
    a responsible manner.
- desc: In the world of secrets, there are no secrets; this process will make us a
    more transparent society
- desc: 'As Tristan Harris the speaker said about the addiction of Youtube, Snapstreaks
    and Facebook. As it encouages people to live out the timeline they want and as
    a result it will benefit these companies. '
- desc: From the CESL presentation, I was reminded of the importance of actively putting
    myself in positions to further my knowledge skills and experience.
- desc: To be honest ,the concept I encounter today is how to edit and make the links
    and also clear view on risk and reward of Information society. Also I get to know
    the perspective of people behind iOS and android lol.
- desc: Understood the details of Risk and rewards in real life with example of movie.
- desc: From today's class the point I found important was, Balancing the risks and
    rewards requires a human-centric approach to technology development. This means
    prioritizing human needs, values, and well-being in the design and implementation
    of AI and automation.
- desc: AI as a risk in information age
- desc: We talked more about the risks and rewards of technology and specific examples
    of each.
- desc: Today I got to know about the risk and rewards as well as I came across a
    podcast which professor told the class to listen to.
- desc: 'Today, I learned that living in a technologically advanced society comes
    with risks and rewards  '
- desc: 'How the computer science, technology and ai is impacting the society ,ethics
    and professionalism '
- desc: the course outline
- desc: Risk of data
- desc: The risks and rewards that were listed and the fact that human intelligence
    is deemed a risk.
- desc: I learned that in computer science, we must recognize that there are incidental,
    social, ethical and professional issues we must face.
- desc: Couse Review
- desc: How professionals in computer science and other Informatiin Technology should
    have understanding of its ethical and moral implications.
- desc: Possible threats that advanced AI (Skynet) could pose to humanity
- desc: About the terminator (skynet) and Apocalpyse now  movies and how much AI based
    the movies are
- desc: Hiw the evolution of advanced technology can affect human beings.
- desc: Risk and Rewards involving different aspects of Computer Science aspects.
- desc: There weren't any important concepts or perspectives I encountered today as
    most of the class was spent talking about the syllabus and repeating concepts
    from Tuesday.
- desc: Risk and rewards and one ur pathway website
- desc: Risk and reward
- desc: Discussed about course syllabus
- desc: The professor discussed about the syllabus today and we also had a  session
    on Upath at the start of the class.
- desc: Although unrelated to course material, the UR Path discussion was really helpful,
    and provided some insight into what opportunities the university offers students.
- desc: I recognized the oppertunities that are in the field i am trying to get a
    degree in, CS !, i also realized how many cs students from different years are
    currently taking this classand what other CS Classes they are combining with CS280
- desc: 'The use of website that can be done acess information anywhere and anytime
    with the us eof technology '
- desc: The important concept I encountered today was about the risks and rewards
    in practical lifestyle with some of the examples.
- desc: 'I found it interesting that how students were enrolled in other computer
    science courses concurrently with this one '
- desc: One important concept I learned today was the existence of SEP (Society, Ethics,
    and Professionalism), a discipline that was created to set the guidelines on the
    influence computer science had on one's privacy.
- desc: I learned that almost everything can be simultaneously bad, especially digital
    technology. Therefore, professionalism is important in the world of Computer Science.
    There are many risks and rewards, but it is crucial to take the right path that
    will benefit society.
- desc: 'The evolution of technologic intelligence and how it would effect the importance
    of human creatvity and intelligence '
- desc: 'UR path was very informative '
- desc: Today I learnt about how Dr. Hepting transfers our responses over to his website.
- desc: ' The interesting perspective today seems to be the fact that around 70% of
    the class consists of iOS users'
- desc: I think the important perspective that we learned today is about risk and
    reward we have in information society.
- desc: 'The relationship between risk and reward. '
know-more:
- desc: Yes, I'd like to know more as to what I should be doing for this class. Are
    there any readings required online or otherwise? I feel like I should be doing
    something but am unsure as to what.
- desc: more aspect about AI and how it going to influence our life
- desc: Android vs. iOS
- desc: I would like to know more about what kind of podcast and what the assignments
    related to it are
- desc: Curious about the CESL, but nothing related to class today.
- desc: I'd to know more about why the terminator is always referenced in this class.
    I have not seen any terminator movies, so I have no clue.
- desc: I would like to know more about what assignments there will be this semester
    as well as how we are going to be separated into groups to talk and work on these
    specific assignements.
- desc: i want to like know about how the group will assigned for the project is it
    gonna be randomly choose or is that we have choice to select our group members.
- desc: I will like to know more about assignment grouping
- desc: I would like to know more about the CESL, in terms of available tutoring options
    in subjects like math. I would also like to learn about the volunteering opportunities
    available to CS students.
- desc: SEP and how 280 impacts or makes an individual think about how the courses
    are interconnected while providing the risks and rewards of each class.
- desc: 'Yes, about the group discussion which was mentioned at the end. '
- desc: More info about the assignments
- desc: We brought back the previous class's risk and rewards topic which had some
    interesting new addition to it some of the risk points had me wanting to know
    more about it.
- desc: What the rewards of our information/data-driven society are. Risks are fairly
    easy to understand, but rewards are not as easy to blatantly see.
- desc: 'Are Companies required to follow a particular national protocol when it comes
    to handling clients data for example a repair shop having access to details when
    a device is at work? '
- desc: I want to know more about Society, Ethics and Professionalism.
- desc: I would like to understand your website more
- desc: More risk of information security
- desc: 'No maybe later '
- desc: 'I would like to know more about the risks of technology that were mentioned
    in class today. the topic of "truth" '
- desc: 'I would like to know more about "democratization" as part of the rewards
    in information society. It was mentioned in class, but only briefly. '
- desc: I would like to know more about the rewards and risks of technology are related
    to other computer science courses. CS 215, for example, focuses on building websites
    with interactive databases. When I took the class, I noticed that the network
    we were using to build our sites wasn't secure which could open the flood gates
    for a breach of privacy when users are inputting sensitive information into a
    data warehouse. And that is just one of many examples of what this class may be
    trying to teach.
- desc: I would like to know more about the risks and rewards of AI since that is
    a research area of interest for me.
- desc: The assignments.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Nothing
- desc: 'I would like to look into UR Path more, the Center for Experiential and Service
    Learning seems like a fantastic opportunity for an undergraduate student. '
- desc: "I would like to know more about what the assignments will be like. Groups\
    \ were mentioned at the end of class and I was wondering if these groups are for\
