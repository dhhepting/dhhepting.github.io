important:
- desc: Should design be for the benefit of the majority or to protect the interests
    of vulnerable groups?
- desc: All the topics discussed today is important. I want to learn more.
- desc: An important concept I countered is that assymmetric dark patterns manipulate
    users by favouring servcie beneftis over their interests, employing several types
    of tactics. (i.e., trick questions)
- desc: "Didn\u2019t knew that ai chatbots collects human emotions "
- desc: we learnt about 3 social roles of privacy.
- desc: From the Ted talk and neurotech and how it can be used without consent from
    the wearer and how it can be used by big corporations for manipulation and the
    possibility of weapons to disable the human brain.
- desc: ai and how ai is implemented in devices like iot devices
- desc: Whether to design for the greater good or with emphasis on the more vulnerable
    communities
- desc: 'Privacy '
- desc: importance of social and cyber privacy and cognitive liberty
- desc: Everything was important
- desc: social dilemma
- desc: How brain data could be crucial to so many new research even though of such
    great importance it is important that this data is handled in a proper manner
    where peoples privacy is respected and not used against them.
- desc: 'The power of privacy especially with concern of AI '
- desc: Designs can protect the more vulnerable communities of users or deliver the
    greatest good for the greatest number of people.
- desc: Designing should be implemented while thinking of the vulnerable communities
- desc: Dark Patterns, group discussion, etc
- desc: Asymmetric dark patterns skew choices towards service benefits over user benefits,
    often hiding user-oriented options and employing confusing language or guilt-tripping
    tactics, like Trick Questions and Confirmshaming.
- desc: I learned about different types of dark patterns. Dark pattern is a user interface
    that has been carefully crafted to trick users into doing things. For example,
    trick question dark pattern is the use of confusing language to compel users into
    buying/subscribing to something they don't want.
- desc: 'Three roles of social privacy '
- desc: Today I encountered information about how companies are trying to find ways
    to hack a human brain to take control of it. This is quite interesting for me
    due to its complexity but also sounds dangerous at the same time. Perhaps it could
    be a potential idea for my infographic.
- desc: Internet safety is not perfect. No matter how secure a website is, entrusting
    a company with our private information can still result in unfortunate results.
    The trickery, clever ways to get consent, confusing the customer, such methods
    are all too common and honestly not very different from real life. But now they
    are accesible by anyone with access to internet.
- desc: I learned about dark patterns and decision making
- desc: 'Neuro-tech data collection is a serious concern for our individuality and
    privacy, which can, if enough coordination is provided, be deployed in an ethical
    way. '
- desc: "I thought the discussion question was interesting but I felt the question\
    \ was also pretty broad. I feel like there are situations where each option is\
    \ the best, for example with a business it\u2019s optimal to cater to the majority\
    \ in order to build a profitable product, catering to the vulnerable can come\
    \ later."
- desc: "The role of pricing in the society\u2019s mechanisms"
- desc: Dark Pattern Papers
- desc: shooting schedule
- desc: Learned more about privacy and saw some videos and duscussions related to
    privacy
- desc: Today I learnt about designs and how they should be changed in relation to
    being dark.
- desc: "An important perspective I encountered yesterday was companies don\u2019\
    t have the consumers best interests in heart, with all the data they extract from\
    \ their users, like with the ai love chat bots, and the frightening aspect of\
    \ getting data about our brains with neuro chips. I realized that it is up to\
    \ the consumer to ensure there are reliable policies that can protect the public\u2019\
    s safety and well being and without these regulations the world can slip into\
    \ a dark place with the data hungry companies. "

    was so intestine and helpful to learn and to read as well and explained so well
    I and to read it thrice '
- desc: I learnt about how much data is being accessed behind the scenes
- desc: 'Today we watched a TedTalk and a brief explanation was that it talked about
    how devices we use in our normal day (ex: Phone, Apple/Samsung watches, Headphones,
    etc) can be used to track our activities. This includes heartbeat, steps etc.
    There are devices out there that can be implanted to track our brain activities
    which can lead to people''s brains being hacked if we are not careful. I think
    overall, this tech will be very useful but could also lead to catastrophic outcomes.
    Brains influenced by Hackers. )'
- desc: It is impossible to benefit everyone in the world
- desc: That the ai used to mimic relationships are not harmless and collect data.
- desc: The concept that AI chatbots can collect a large amount of personal information
    about you

    the most people or the vulnerable people.

    went over neural privacy, and data collected from neurotechnology. In the TED
    talk, the speaker talks about how both major and small corporations are already
    collecting data from neurotechnology. They emphasized that neural technology has
    immense benefits, but also can have misuse.
- desc: Today we learned about dark patterns and its type and attributes and discussed
    a bit about the assignment 1  info
- desc: Today we discussed about social dilemma movie trailer and the Ted talk which
    discusses about how social media imapcts human life
- desc: 'It was brought to my attention how our data is completely out there on the
    Internet for anyone to see. Companies and websites are more indifferent about
    their users than we think.  '
- desc: Roles of privacy
- desc: Dark theme
- desc: social roles of privacy
- desc: Everything
- desc: 'We went into more depth about Dark Patterns today, as well as touched on
    the scary (and new) lengths people will take to invade privacy (Maxon and the
    drone incident). The topic of invasive AI disguised as romantic chatbots was also
    brought up. Lastly, and probably the most scary (in my opinion), brain-sensing
    tech!  '
