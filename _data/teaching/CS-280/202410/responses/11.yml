    and data collection. We went over things like when people's data should or can
    be violated for the greater good of a system or technology. Its not clear, and

    privacy should be violated, and when it important to protect somebody's privacy.

    \ that an Instagram post that was meant for friends could have that much of an\
    \ impact that the university decided she wouldn\u2019t be able to graduate with\
    \ her education degree. It puts it into perspective that \u201Cnothing goes away\u201D\
    \ like the koans covered in blown to bits chapter 1. "

    roles of privacy. This was important since it provided me with information I could

    role: Privacy is important for independent think and I think that is very important
    for anyone. It is hard enough to find opinions online when a lot of people either
    bandwagon or do not want to be deemed as "wrong". So online its hard to speak
    freely with your own thoughts without those people who want to ruin your day.
    So, overall privacy is very important for independent thinking.  '

- desc: In my group, we talked about the importance of restricting a company's access

    public but might not be liked by tech companies.
- desc: 'Thinking about privacy in more of a conceptual way changes my understanding
    of what privacy truly means. I never considered the possibility of privacy to
    deviate from social/societal norms. In this regard, privacy is more one''s own
    internal wants. '
