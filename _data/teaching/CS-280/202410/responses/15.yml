important:
- desc: Information capitalism is something socialist academics fear
- desc: I learnt about the privacy issue related to social media.
- desc: The concept of surveilance capitalism.
- desc: Some examples and characteristics of Sustainability
- desc: everything discussed today
- desc: Anything can be used to track us like vending machines being used to track
    customers. Companies will do just about everything and any thing in order for
    them to gather necessary data for their business. Customers must stay aware and
    alert at all times
- desc: the news article about the vending machines and the video about surveillance
    capitalism
- desc: I never knew that e-transfer can be used as a tool for abusers to contact
    their victims. Definitely learned something new today.
- desc: ' Interac e-Transfer messaging abuse'
- desc: I encountered new things about interac-e-transfer
- desc: Today we learned about surveillance capitalism and how it can put camera in
    vending machines, like the case that took place at the University of Waterloo.
- desc: An important concept or perspective I've encountered today was surveillance
    capitalism and how big coperations collect that information for personal gain
- desc: About Vendin machines, e-Transfer, and CIPS and SFIA
- desc: Today we talked about CIPS presentation on March 21
- desc: 'Everything '
- desc: Surveillance Capitalism
- desc: 'Surveillance Capitalism '
- desc: ' no'
- desc: That vending machine can steal the persons age and gender
- desc: We discussed about midterms, CIPS presenters, messaging abuse, etc
- desc: companies use personal data to predict and influence human behavior, effectively
    shaping our choices and preferences without our consent. She warns that this manipulation
    of information poses a significant threat to democracy and individual autonomy.
- desc: 'I learned further about surveillance capitalism through the example of the
    vending machine article where companies such as Invenda, could potentially be
    using our personal data (facial recognition, age, product selection) to elevate
    their sales and overall service. '
- desc: The important topic which we learned today was about sustanibility
- desc: Abusing of interac
- desc: What I thought was interesting was how the video we watched in class today
    suggested that we make the trade of human intelligence illegal in the sane way
    trading slaves is illegal. While I do think comparing data to slavery is a bit
    of a stretch, I can definitely see regulations put on surveillance that would
    help protect people's data and ensure that if there data is being collected, it
    is being handled with care.
- desc: Tech being created for helpful purposes are not always used positively. In
    case of the e-transfer, messaging happened to be available tool. However, I do
    not understand why banks need messaging blocks. If needed, any other information
    can be easily conveyed through other means. There should also be a minimum requirement
    for how much money can be sent through. No restriction is the reason people can
    get away anything they deem okay. New tech should arise negative impacts as well.
- desc: vending machines
- desc: 'Surveillance Capitalism is a market which poses the same risks to humans
    as the slave market, organ trade, and we should consider making it an illegal
    market as such. '
- desc: We talked about the CBC news article.
- desc: I thought it was interesting the way that etransers are used to send messages,
    I never thought about how it could be used in an abusive way. I do agree with
    some of the potential solutions presented in class, such as having a list of preseleted
    questions or having a minimum amount required to have a message.
- desc: 'The podcast we watch '
- desc: Nothing
- desc: we discussed more about the risk portion of risk and reward
- desc: Data Protection
- desc: Today, I encountered the concept of e-transfer abuse, which involves fraudulent
    activities related to electronic money transfers. This issue highlights the importance
    of cybersecurity and vigilance when conducting online transactions
- desc: E transfer abuse
- desc: How even e-tranfers can be used as a tool for abuse and violence
- desc: 'That people dont care if thaey are being watched only what is done or taken
    advantage of with that data and they want to know when they are being watched
    especially if it is a place of assumed privacy. '
- desc: "One important perspective I encountered today was the fact that some of these\
    \ blue chip companies will be taking away people\u2019s futures if we choose to\
    \ do nothing about it and don\u2019t put any laws in place. It puts humanity\u2019\
    s future at risk which I totally agree with and like some of more extreme points\
    \ the speaker made, I believe that with the new technology emerging that it can\
    \ be just as bad for humanity. I realized something has to be done to protect\
    \ human autonomy. "
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: 'people reaction to privacy '

    customers.
- desc: 'I learned about technology abuse and how e-transfers are a new way of doing
    it '
- desc: 'Surveillance Capitalism was a topic we covered today and relates to a story
    we went over about vending machines having cameras. I think anything that has
    a camera or recording software should have a warning in advance to prepare the
    user. '
- desc: "Vending machines had eyes all over this Ontario campus \u2014 until the students\
    \ wised up"
- desc: Surveillance capitalism
- desc: Today we encountered the unique perspective of vending machines. Some of them
    had facial recognition software that was spying on students at the University
    of Waterloo.
- desc: Should E-transfer allow messaging?  I think there should just be an integrated
    feature to allow messages to be sent along with e-transfers to you or not via
    a toggle in the settings.
- desc: "I learned that cameras are everywhere and we don\u2019t have as much privacy\
    \ as we thought"
- desc: We went over the commercialization of peoples faces and info. This was covered
    in a video and with discussion of a news article about cameras in vending machines.
- desc: Surveillance Capitalism
- desc: That midterm are gonna discuss on Thursday, the cips presenters
- desc: Surveillance Capitalism
- desc: Todays class
- desc: E transfer
- desc: About vending machine and threats on interac E transfers
- desc: There is nothing important I encountered today.
- desc: Discussion on various topics by teacher after midterm.
- desc: about the risk and rewards of AAI
- desc: Today was a really interesting class where we learned about surveillance capitalism
    and about University of Waterloo's vending machine.
- desc: "Today, we discussed the midterm, and how we can improve the experience for\
    \ ourselves in the final exam. We also talked about the vending machine and the\
    \ University of Waterloo, that had a facial recognition software installed. During\
    \ class we also talked about Interac e transfer abuse, and how people use it to\
    \ harass others. We talked about surveillance capitalism in today\u2019s class."
- desc: An important concept from today is the idea and situation with Surveillance
    Capitalism. Today we watched a video about Shoshana Zuboff speaking about the
    dangers of Surveillance Capitalism, and how it can erode free will, critical thinking,
    and autonomy within our society. She speaks about this growing issue within large
    corporations and how it affects us.
- desc: We talked about different case study like on vending machine in waterloo and
    watched a video on privacy
- desc: cips presentation
- desc: An important concept I have encountered is the idea of surveillance capitalism.
    Privacy is not private. Privacy is a political challenge.
- desc: Surveillance Capitalism is a very important concept that has provided me with
    plenty of food for thought.
- desc: Survelliance capitalism, news regarding vending machines
- desc: Saw video
- desc: the important concept was Interac e-Transfer that i encounter.
- desc: I learned about e-transfer abuse .
- desc: 'Podcast '
- desc: Surveillance capitalism
- desc: Today's meeting revolved around the idea of surveillance capitalism, possible
    new methods of dark patterns (the innovation's "mistakes"), and the distribution
    of responsibility (Interac incident). We also discussed some observations about
    the midterm and what we can do to improve for the final (ex. exam bouncer).

    of cameras in vending machines at the University of Waterloo
- desc: We watched a video about surveillance capitalism and democracy
- desc: Today we watched a video in class.
- desc: The vending machine article was interesting for me
- desc: Life is like Ice-cream eat it before it melts
- desc: the idea of privacy from facial recognition software in public and its prevalence
    in civil rights debates.
- desc: Today we talked about vending machines that have face analysis in them at
    UWaterloo. How it pushes the boundaries of privacy because there were no markings
    nor signs that claim there were cameras recording. Another thing we encountered
    today was people abusing the functions of e-transfer by sending pennies to convey
    inappropriate and harmful messages towards others. In Canada there is no law on
    inappropriate messages through e-transfer unlike in Australia where any inapproriate
    message will be blocked..
- desc: 'Surveillance Capitalism '
- desc: An important concept which we went over was the fact that big tech could change
    society and ruin privacy for us humans
- desc: 'The convergence of these topics underscores the broader societal implications
    of technology, particularly in terms of privacy, ethical use, and corporate responsibility.
    Addressing these issues requires collective action, informed by critical reflection
    and an understanding of the complex interplay between technology, commerce, and
    democracy. '

    the privacy.
- desc: Surveillance Capitalism

    companies are able to take and use peoples faces as faceprints without them knowing.
- desc: I learnt a little more about privacy and dark patterns
- desc: nothing
- desc: 'reviews for midterm '
- desc: An important concept that I learned today was the Surveillance or Privacy
    Policy does more that just 'survey' or 'protect' one's privacy. It immediately
    welcomes the agreement of not knowing what data is being collected whether its
    consensual (you fully know what's being shared) or not.

    from their campus after students noticed that they were being recorded.
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today was the idea of surveillance capitalism.
    Unbeknownst to our knowledge and use of certain technologies, many companies often
    install cameras and spyware with the intention of collecting our data for profit.
    Such technologies are a breach of privacy and is ultimately unethical for the
    digital future. '
