    context    '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I found it difficult to understand how the in class discussion groups are
    going to relate to the graded portion of the class. Will the topics we discussed
    in groups be part of our exams?
- desc: 'The question you gave us to discuss in group with no proper info but then
    you said it was joke or some which was a good one '

- desc: The task to be be done for the group work.
- desc: The questions were little complex
- desc: Again, a lot of what was discussed was very difficult to understand as other
    students were too loud. Especially near the end of the lecture.
- desc: "I wasn\u2019t able to understand few things about the assignment part and\
    \ question about the ethical analysis like how we are getting analysed "
- desc: 'No '
- desc: Not really

- desc: There was nothing hard in the today's lecture to understand.
- desc: Nope.
- desc: "The difficult part about today\u2019s discussion was to how to decide ? "
- desc: No, everything was straightforward and clear.
- desc: "It was difficult to understand where to begin when discussing the question\
    \ of \u201CHow to decide what to do?\u201D when it comes to ethics and ethical\
    \ technologies."
- desc: 'The information about the assignments '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: need more depth about the topic
- desc: 'The questions Dr. Hepting wrote on the board were a bit confusing. They seemed
    vague and I didn''t know what to discuss with my group. "How do you decide what
    to do" To do for what exactly? The best ethical analysis approach? I was a bit
    confused trying to understand what approach to answer these questions from. '
- desc: Everything was preety straight-forward
- desc: 'No'
- desc: no, there was not any thing that was difficult to understand today.
- desc: 'It was kind of difficult to understand methods of ethical analysis '
- desc: No, I guess discussion it nothing difficult every one were just sharing their
    thoughts.
- desc: No everything was understandable.
- desc: I am just wondering if we are supposed to post the group discussion to the
    wiki again? Are there due dates for these?

- desc: 'No'
- desc: The questions that were listed for the group discussion as well as the purpose
    of the groups assignments.
- desc: None
- desc: 'The group discussion '
- desc: would have preferred automatic groups as finding a group in a class of 270
    was chaos
- desc: The initial topic of what we were supposed to discuss in our groups was kind
    of unclear, Was not sure in what context I should think of the questions.
- desc: The discussion question was difficult to understand at first but eventually
    our group came up with some ideas.
- desc: I understood the lecture materials today
- desc: Ethical theories and priniples.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'Infographic '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: How do we decide if something  is good or bad  in methods of ethical analysis
    if we cannot decide by pubic opinions etc was paricularly difficult to understand.

- desc: No it was all clear and easy to understand
- desc: There wasn't anything too difficult to understand during the lecture.
- desc: 'Not particularly '
- desc: No everything was good.
- desc: There were not any difficult topics covered in today's lecture meeting.
- desc: Nope
- desc: No.
- desc: One thing I wish we had more clarification on was how to approach these difficult
    decisions, as well as what was meant by the question "Do you decide to decide?"
- desc: Not that I could think of
- desc: I had a bit of difficulty understanding the assignments and the group discussions.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no '
- desc: Nothing was difficult to understand today; everything was easy to grasp.
- desc: Some Questions wrote on the board were little difficult to understand.
- desc: "I still don\u2019t understand when the assignments are due and if we can\
    \ decide between working individually or in groups. "
- desc: Everything was pretty clear
important:
- desc: Today I learnt about the importance of decision making in computing professions.
- desc: Nothing. I dont know ehats going on in this class.
- desc: The importance of learning ethics as no single theroies is best acceptable
    for all scenario. Also loved watching video from ACM and learning more about ACM
- desc: Course calendar
- desc: 'The important concept/perspective I encountered today was minimizing harm
    while maximizing benefit. For me this is important because I believe that the
    riskier it is, the higher/maximum the benefit will be returned. I believe that
    its a delicate balance we must go through, and its extremely diffucult to minimize
    harm while maximizing benefit. Furthermore, in research, acedamic, or whatever
    in may be the case people should always aim for minimizing harm even though the
    benefit may not be as high. '
- desc: The different methods for Ethical Analysis
- desc: An important perspective I have encountered today is that everyone has different
    opinions with ethics in regards of the information world/actions.
- desc: we learnt about Ethical theories and principles from today's lecture.
- desc: I encountered today methods for ethical analysis and assignment 2 details
- desc: 'Today''s important concept was ethical theories and ethical analysis. Ethical
    theories help us analyze and make our decisions. In our groups we discussed what
    the public good is, which is what benefits the public. We also learned that no
    single theory can be applied to all situations, because different situations need
    different approaches. '
- desc: 'We learned about the Ethical analysis today which I think is really important
    in our daily practice while handling confidential information or using multiple
    tech tools '
- desc: 'Nothing important, we just discussed about group project. '
- desc: "Who gets to decide about collecting people\u2019s data? Where is the line\
    \ between privacy and security?"
- desc: 'group work '
- desc: Ethical theories and principles.
- desc: One was the method of ethical analysis which was utilitarianism which defines
    that to choose the right action that leads to maximum overall well-being.
- desc: 'The methods of Ethical Analysis '
- desc: ethical analysis
- desc: I learnt how to make descisions using ethical theories
- desc: ethical analysis on the privacy of someone's data
- desc: We talked about the assignment, team work, etc
- desc: I learned that voting or public opinion polls may be problematic in terms
    of ways on how to approach difficult decisions. They can go wrong when the public
    opinion in not in their best interest. Deciging to decide is better than ignoring
    a difficult question.
- desc: That there is no single theory applicable in all situations. Before ultimately
    deciding, we must consider the public opinion but sometimes, this opinion isn't
    in the public interest. So we have to look at different approaches so we can decide
    on what maximizes benefit yet minimizes harm.
- desc: 'Methods of ethical analysis '
- desc: When speaking with my group, we decided to talk about applying ethics to technology
    through minimizing risks and maximizing benefits. One solution one of my group
    members offered was by restricting how online platforms are used as a solution
    to stopping the spread of misinformation. I found this interesting because while
    I can get by social media companies censoring fake news online, I think defining
    what "restrictions" we should have would start a more interesting conversation.
- desc: 'A compelling perspective was considering how in society you must give up
    a level of privacy in order to ensure safety/security. Although, that level of
    privacy is difficult to decide as a collective. '
- desc: While discussing with our group, we agreed on needing a common ground when
    it comes to any kind of decision making. The decisions cannot be made for benefit
    of one and loss of another. So, when putting out any content for the public, with
    their interest in mind, the intentions of the product, and all risks and rewards
    associated with it must be public knowledge. In that way, the product can reach
    the right audience. It will also act as a public poll(benefit/use/what works/what
    does not).
- desc: Our group discussion touched on moral ethics problems, such as the way that
    the USA handled air travel before and after 9/11. We related these issues back
    to those of data collection/storage by trying to understand where a "line" was
    drawn with regards to the safety of the people involved. This line is hard to
    define, as there is never a universally correct framework to decide where it should
    lie.
- desc: "I found it really interesting the perspective that in an ethical situation\
    \ voting may not always be the best options. The reasoning for this was something\
    \ I\u2019d not really considered much before this discussion."
- desc: 'About the assignment that we can do in groups or individual '
- desc: the idea about how to make decision and is it viable to use a voting system
- desc: 'trying to understand how to make difficult decision '
- desc: Egalitarianism
- desc: Single theory application.
- desc: 4 topic were given for discussion in which we need to choose one talk about
    that in group.
- desc: I learnt about ethical theories which are the foundations of ethical analysis
- desc: That understanding what power you have when knowing how technology works requires
    ethical decisions that may not be easy
- desc: "Today we discussed how decisions are made and the implications of what society\u2019\
    s interests are, and how these affect each other. "
- desc: Nothing much I liked the separation between the classmates and divided group
    and discussion regarding class
- desc: 'One important perspective I encountered today was the idea that the public
    does not always know what is right for society. Simply because a certain portion
    of the population agrees upon something (through voting, etc), does not mean it
    has positive benefits for everyone. We often see this idea emerge in politics.  '
- desc: 'Ethical theories and principles '
- desc: Methods for Ethical Analysis
- desc: An important perspective is whether we should vote for one person to take
    important decisions which affect many people
- desc: 'how to decide what to do when making ethical decisions '
- desc: Ethical principles and analysis, case studies
- desc: The idea of how ethical analysis are made to create decisions.
- desc: 'Today I encountered methods of ethical analysis where we discussed about
    is single theory applicable in all situations or not and many more public interaction
    things '
- desc: the methods of ethical concepts that we should consider.
- desc: I learned that there are multiple takes on policing technology in order to
    benefit the public interest.
- desc: The concept of having a common moral operating system so that we can decide
    what moral ethics should be considered when developing technology.
- desc: Importance of ethical analysis in decision making and their methods.
- desc: Sitting down with my groupmates and discussing our interpretations on the
    questions for ethical analysis really helped me understand the importance of having
    different views on the same topic.  Where one of us consider focusing on maximizing
    benefit, another cared more about minimalizing harm.  I liked seeing the two views
    not opposed but rather working together.
- desc: I learned about the questions we may ask to help us come to an ethical conclusion
    when dealing with other user's data
- desc: How to make moral decisions. Voting? Minimize drawbacks and maximize benefit?
    etc..
- desc: ' the concept of  the "public good" or the"public interest"  usualy being
    part of decision making, minimizing harm and maximising benifits.'
- desc: Ethical Analysis, it's theories and methods.
- desc: Ethical Analysis
- desc: "How when making a tough decision, voting on the decision isn\u2019t the best\
    \ way to decide"
- desc: Today we talked about ethical analysis and about the assignments.
- desc: he most essential topic I learned today was about ethical theories and how
    they guide us through the decision-making process.
- desc: The lecture
- desc: About the number of assignments and the distribution of the marks
- desc: It was a good time discussing about the methods of ethical analysis, and getting
    in depth about voting in several methods that do not count
- desc: About group Assignments and it worth 40 percent of course total
- desc: I think that high profile software project disasters have been commonplace
    for decades, which I think , is going to be continued that think in the video
    I like the most.
- desc: Today we learned about analysis of situations and when what decisions are
    to be made. We also learned about how certain situations demand special actions..
- desc: Today we had discussions in groups regarding Ethical Analysis different aspects
    of it like the theories and rationality of those theories.
- desc: In today's class, we got into our groups and discussed ethical theories and
    principals, and how they are known as the foundations of ethical analysis. In
    our group, we answered a few questions, including "what is considered public good".
    The answer we came up with was something that can take society forward and help
    it grow, along with something that improves society for everyone involved.
- desc: Thinking of how we make decisions and how to deal with hard to answer questions,
    do you cast a vote or have a council decide.
- desc: When it comes to ethics and how society deals with broad problems, it is important
    to note that a singular solution cannot be applied to everything. Every problem
    is specific to its own needs and requires different or multiple perspectives and
    ideas to solve them.
- desc: 'Within Ethical Analysis, the idea of minimizing harm while maximizing effort
    is very important. What becomes too harmful for society while their personal information
    is still being collected. '
- desc: Today, I came to know about ethical theories and they are helpful in the world
    of technology.
- desc: Today we discussed about ethical theories and principles in the group
- desc: a bit about ethical analysis
- desc: "In our group discussion we talked about how the tach industry as a whole\
    \ would be better is it was not such a monopoly and more people/ companies had\
    \ a power over discussions that have on all of our lives. However, we couldn\u2019\
    t think of many ways of achieving this other than encouraging/ supporting young\
    \ developers through financial means. "
- desc: Nothing new today.
- desc: Today in the video learned about Bloom's taxonomy
- desc: 'Ethical analysis '
- desc: today, i encounter diversity and contextuality of ethical theories and principles.
- desc: I learner how one should discuss about topics in group.
- desc: Today we discuss on 4 random topic and assignments too.
- desc: Today got a quick brief about ethical analysis and its importance.
- desc: Today we learned methods used for ethical analysis as a class. It was brought
    up that sometimes, businesses analyze more user data than what is required for
    their business. This is an ethical dilemma in the information society that I am
    glad people are becoming more aware of. It is flaws like these that we should
    learn from and avoid. Our group also had an insightful discussion about methods
    used for ethical analysis.
- desc: 'Definitions of SFIA and CIPS, Ethnical analysis '
- desc: An important concept I encountered today is the methods for ethical analysis
    and the public's interests.
- desc: 'Ethical theory '
- desc: Today we learn about methods of ethical analysis.
- desc: start mindstorm about ethic thing on public good or public interest
- desc: Today, we encounter different methods for ethical Analysis.
- desc: An important concept that i learned today was "Methods for Ethical Analysis",  Ethical
    theories guide decision-making, but their applicability varies across contexts.
    Cultural factors influence acceptability, and ethical analysis demands an understanding
    of principles and social context. Traditional Western frameworks are valuable,
    but inclusive perspectives, including decolonial and indigenous views, are essential.
    No single theory is universally applicable, emphasizing the importance of engaging
    with dive
- desc: decision making
- desc: Who can our technology affect
- desc: The importance of working within a group, especially a big group, which allows
    many ideas to flow.
- desc: Getting to discuss with my group about the questions asked to us today.
- desc: 'today we learned about ethical analysis which was really interesting '
- desc: 'Practice can teach you anything '
- desc: The idea of ethic in technology.
- desc: Today we talked about Methods for Ethical Analysis. Then we got into groups
    and discussed the questions given in class, such as in different situations may
    require different approached and theories.
- desc: 'That my interests might not necessarily be the public interest '
- desc: that sometimes public opinion does not equal the public interest
- desc: 'An important perspective I learned today is that there is countless approaches
    to issues regarding ethics. Another thing I realized is that if a public poll
    is issued, the results of that public poll might not be a result that appeals
    to the public interest. '
- desc: Today I learned about ethical theories and principles
- desc: Ethical analysis.
- desc: I learned the importance of learning in groups.
- desc: Minimizing harm while maximizing benefits
- desc: ethical theory and their principles
- desc: Methods for ethical analysis is one of the important concepts I get to know
    more about today.
- desc: Today, I learned about the significance of using diverse ethical theories
    in decision making. This approach involves not only traditional Western frameworks
    but also decolonial, indigenous, and marginalized perspectives
- desc: We consider the previous topic and it was very important to learn it today.
- desc: In today's lecture we learnt about methods of ethical analysis
- desc: 'yes'
- desc: That you can approach an ethical dilemma from many different angles.
- desc: The ethical analysis is the most important thing in this world and specially
    in tech world. It seems to be very effective in our daily life and to take important
    decisions.
- desc: Today we learned how to handle different situations by different ways to handle
    it.
- desc: In the class today I have learned how you encountered different things in
    different scenarios and how you manage it.
- desc: skills for the Information Age
- desc: Today we got to know about ethical analysis.
- desc: Risk about society
- desc: today, I encountered the term ethical analysis
- desc: About assignments.
- desc: Methods for ethical analysisi
- desc: Ethical theories and principles
- desc: An important concept I learned today on the lesson of Method of Ethical Analysis
    was that there is no one solution to a situation. By looking at multiple different
    perspectives and views onto a situation, we are able to find many solutions. The
    importance is deciding the solution that maximizes the benefits and that prevents
    harm.
- desc: Ethical Manners in a human is the important concept that i encountered today
- desc: Can voting be a viable option to get public opinion on what decisions in the
    technology world.
- desc: 'Ways to apply ethical analysis and different ways to approach a discussion '
- desc: Methods for ethics analysis
- desc: How no one theory can be used in machines to make the best choices.
- desc: Ethical Theories and Principles
- desc: The ethical challenges that arrise when companies collect user data risking
    the privacy of the consumer.
- desc: The most important perspective I learned during the lecture today was how
    the choice between having the public interest or the public good in mind can drastically
    change how people handle tough decisions.
- desc: 'Discussion about Ted talk of horowitz and how technological app makes us
    take toll of decisions '
- desc: Today in class we learned about methods for ethical analysis.
- desc: The most important concept I encountered during today's lecture was the ethics
    behind decision making, and how there are many factors that play a role in making
    a decision.
- desc: The choice between the public interest and public good was interesting to
    learn.
- desc: We dicussed the topic given by the professor in our group. I also got more
    details about assignments for this course.
- desc: An important concept I encountered today is how every culture has their own
    idea of what should be considered 'acceptable'. Taking into account these varying
    perspectives in their respective social contexts, we will be able to better formulate
    our decisions in a moral manner.
- desc: I thought of siding with public good instead of public interest because it
    benefits all the people in the society. Nobody is excluded for benefiting from
    the goods. On the other hand, public interest could only be beneficial for some
    parts of the society which means that not everybody can benefit from it.
- desc: "I learned the difference between the public good and the public interest.\
    \ The public interest\_is frequently decided by an individual or group based on\
    \ personal opinions or ideals. Meanwhile, the public good\_is a society's common\
    \ benefit, which is generally defined by an objective examination of its needs.\
    \ Personally, I believe that the public good should be the standard when it comes\
    \ to decision making as there are many unfair/biased factors that roots from the\
    \ public interest."
- desc: What makes an ethical decision right and wrong based on ones morals
- desc: 'How to decide to decide '
- desc: Today, an important concept encountered was "the public good".
- desc: foundations of ethical analysis
- desc: 'I encountered fundamental frameworks and topics to take into consideration
    when making a decision. '
know-more:
- desc: Yes, I would like to know more about the factors that we consider while making
    decisions in computing.
- desc: The important topics since we are still discussing basics
- desc: Are these in-class groupworks going to be graded and do we form the same group
    everytime or different for each time? Will we be assigned a new group for assignments?
- desc: Judgement in Software Engineering due to its importance of choosing technology
    paths, best design approached, and projects that supports a businness's objectives.
    Judgement is very diffucult to make a decision on and if you are working in groups
    like in Software Engineering people may have different types of judgements than
    yours and working on a common ground can be complicated.
- desc: About how ethics affect how we use technology in our society

    they are worth 20% each. '
- desc: 'Alittle more detail explaination about the assignment will be good '
