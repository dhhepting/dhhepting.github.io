- desc: The answer to the question how did so many people got into IT and also if
    retraining is possible will it be done by bigger companies as it looks highly
    unfavourable.
- desc: 'How the inclusivity terms are determined in computer science '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: No, nothing was difficult to understand
- desc: concept of IDEA
- desc: I'm a bit skeptical for why a term such as 'dark patterns' needs to be changed
    to be inclusive. I can understand the 'dark' part could be referring to people
    of color, but as far as I am aware, dark patterns has never been used on such
    a minority. Context matters just as much as the word and if there are certainly
    words that would be deemed problematic to use in the modern age, there better
    be a good reason as to why.
- desc: 'I found it hard to understand the point of optimizing for a humane interface.
    Because at the end of the day in a world with so many easily accessible analytics,
    if a "humane interface" is what is the most optimal then the "invisible hand"
    would already push us to innovate in that direction. '

important:
- desc: Today I learnt about the concept of IDEA in computing.
- desc: 'That Professor Darryl is 58 years old '
- desc: not really
- desc: everything discussed today
- desc: The role of IDEA on computing, I think it highlights these concepts however
    it could be implemented and represented much better.
- desc: about the crip technoscience manifesto
- desc: The Humane Interface
- desc: I encountered about risks of AI and how it has lead to affect jobs
- desc: 'The concept of people with disabilities and their contribtutions to science,
    particularly technoscience. '
- desc: Discussed about byzantine and final exam
- desc: Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)
- desc: Risk and Rewards of AI
- desc: 'How deceptive designs can be handled by being empathetic apathetic and sympathetic '
- desc: How Computer Science graduates can have jobs amid the AI growth
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The relationship between humans and machine
- desc: Risks of AI
- desc: 'I learned that to design an interface that is humane, it must be responsive
    to human needs and considerate of human frailties. The interface alone should
    not just be a machine that a human operates. '
- desc: An important concept was considering the ethics of AI replacing jobs and the
    argument that roles should be given too AI that are suited for AI and jobs suited
    for humans should be left for humans
- desc: 'I learned about Accessibility Rich Internet Applications and how we can be
    more inclusive in our terminology used to describe computer things.  '
- desc: More information on dark patterns.
- desc: Crip technoscience
- desc: .
- desc: Learnt about IDEA, ARIA, dark patterns
- desc: Human interface
- desc: How an interface is considered human.
- desc: Today I learned more about dark matter and the different forms it can appear
    in.
- desc: An important perspective I encountered today was about the people who would
    mediate the risks and rewards of technology as a job. I think it is interesting
    but do not believe larger companies would employ a position like that because
    it may hinder income for the company and may cause opposing viewpoints between
    employees.
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: crip technoscience
- desc: computing and IDEA
- desc: I think the abstract of the crip technoscience manifesto article is interesting
- desc: 'artificial intelligence '
- desc: The replacement of jobs by AI, and the ethical qualms and necessities that
    come along with that. "The rights of the conquered."
- desc: humane interfaces
- desc: Personal skill development
- desc: Catalyst, Details of final exam
- desc: An interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate
    of human frailties
- desc: Important thing today was Does computing do enough to promote IDEA (Inclusion,
    Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility)?
- desc: An important concept I encountered today was the discussion about the value
    of human labour against AI
- desc: 'Today we went over the final exam. I feel having one or two short answer
    questions on the final about major topics woupd be beneficial. Maybe like a question
    about what did you learn in this class that will carry to your future: maybe worth
    like 10% or something not much but still good critical thinking etc. '
- desc: '11'
- desc: How computer science can do more for reconcilliation
- desc: The concept of 'Interfaces for humans' and designing for people.
- desc: Crip Technoscience, The Humane Interface, Catalyst
- desc: We talked about designing with empathy, sympathy, and apathy. We also talked
    about ARIA - Accessible, Rich, Internet, Applications. We also talked about "The
    Humane Interface".
- desc: Risk and rewards of Artificial Intelligence
- desc: Today in starting of class w about course evaluation, and discussed about
    acm
- desc: 'I learnt about the Crip Technoscience Manifesto : Its basicially for the
    disabled community that helps our collective experiences and histories taught
    us that we are effective agents of world-building and relations.'
- desc: Everything
- desc: 'Crip Technoscience Manifesto, IDEA, The Humane Interface '
- desc: Discussion about finals
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Regarding IDEA, Humane interfaces.
- desc: Today we learned about Crip Technoscience manifesto
- desc: Today, we discussed the responses to the class survey. We also briefly discussed
    the infographic assignment part 2, which is due on Tuesday. We also discussed
    the final exam, along with it's formatting.  We also went over the crisp technoscience
    manifesto, and discussed if computing do enough to promote IDEA.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Today we continued to discuss IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity, and accountability)
    in regards to computing. We talked about the responsibilities of comapnies when
    it comes to AI taking over specific jobs and how will previous workers be compensated.
    One idea suggested was giving some kind of retraining for a new position.
- desc: Today we encounter important concepts on AI's rewards and risks.
- desc: Today we discussed about the final exam
- desc: My attention was brought to the differences between empathy, apathy, and sympathy.
- desc: 'About AII computing '
- desc: Review for final
- desc: What is better Framing for Dark Patterns
- desc: Today's important concept regarded details about the final exam, the future
    of jobs within tech, and IDEAs. We sat down and finally addressed multiple elephants
    in the room, that being the final exam (which is in a week!) and what the future
    looks like for jobs in tech. We talked about possible questions that we may see
    on the exam as well as the format that the class chose through the survey. We
    also discussed how we can tackle the issue of AI taking over jobs. We finished
    with some IDEA points.
- desc: 'Yes'
- desc: 'no'
- desc: How the final is gonna work
- desc: The Byzantine empires fall in 1453
- desc: final exam
- desc: Group discussion
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Today we talked about the final and what should be on it.
- desc: IDEA concept was really interesting
- desc: self study is the best study
- desc: An important concept we encountered today was the risk of losing your job
    to AI. However, some government institutions may not want AI to handle risky and
    certain important informations, thus, humans will come in handy to do those certain
    jobs. With this we need to think about if we need people who understand the risk
    and rewards of technology to mediate humanity's experiences with the new tools?
    do the new technologies have an ethical responsibility to retain? what protections
    do we need to consider if so?
- desc: Knowing what's going to be on the final is interesting. It's nice to know
    what to prepare for.
- desc: IDEA, Humane interfaces
- desc: As disabled people engaged in disability community, activism, and scholarship,
    our collective experiences and histories have taught us that we are effective
    agents of world-building and -dismantling toward more socially just relations.
    The grounds for social justice and world-remaking, however, are frictioned; technologies,
    architectures, and infrastructures are often designed and implemented without
    committing to disability as a difference that matters.
- desc: We continue on our topic of inclusion, diversity, and equality by exploring
    new works created by experts who engaged in the discussion
- desc: nothing really

- desc: we discussed about Crip Technoscience Manifesto in detail
- desc: "The important perspective from today\u2019s class was the little bit discussion\
    \ about the upcoming final exam"
- desc: We talked about IDEA again, specifically if computing does enough to promote
    inclusion and diversity in the field.
- desc: Nothing
- desc: ' IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility)'
- desc: catalyst
- desc: The use of IDEA and how important it is to include it within our line of ethics,
    and the importance of creating a humane interface.

- desc: 'No'
- desc: crip technoscience
- desc: Crip technoscience manifesto
- desc: What is better framing for dark patterns?
- desc: I learned about the jobs at risk because of the advancement of AI.
- desc: Risk &amp; Reward of AI
- desc: 'Today I learned how jobs can be affected by AI and what companies can help
    their employees to tackle this affect. Also got ideas on final exam. '
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today is The Human Interface, which conveys
    how we must be respectful of human frailties while still supporting humans'' work. '
- desc: 'Today I learned about the ACM''s project to axe the use of offensive terminologies
    in the computing field. The goal is to get rid of those offensive terminologies
    and provided them with other terminologies that suits the context. This goal is
    very essential as it promotes diversity and a healthier environment. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: If computing does enough to promote IDEA
- desc: 'How words in computing world need to be more inclusive. '
