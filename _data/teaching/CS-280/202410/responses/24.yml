important:
- desc: Today I learnt about the importance of learning coding.
- desc: How in 2013 1 in 4 universities offered a computer science program
- desc: not really
- desc: Computer Science has a diversity problem that needs to be address. Diversity
    in computer science helps guard against bias and leads to new perspectives. The
    more complex computer science gets the more diversity in the field will be benefited.
- desc: Equality amoung other terms
- desc: "CS2023 Report (Gamma version): \u2018Computer Science has had \u2014 since\
    \ its inception as a field \u2014 a diversity problem"
- desc: I encountered purpose of computing
- desc: Dark Daryl and philosophical questions regarding computer science and computer
    engineering.
- desc: CS2023 Report (Gamma Version), Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility
- desc: We learned about education - Idea
- desc: ' I encountered the concept of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within
    the context of computer science.'
- desc: 'Equity  was one important concept I have encountered '
- desc: Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility
- desc: Discussing about what is the purpose of studying CS some reasons were to help
    those who are in need by making things accessible. Another point to add to it
    could be to mitigate the risks of artificial intelligence interfering with human
    well being  by studying about how those algorithms are set into place and the
    capabilities they posses and how to tap into that for the betterment of humanity.
- desc: 'Diversity in Computer Science Sector '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Briefing about Computer Science
- desc: We talked about Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility
- desc: Computer science faces persistent diversity issues stemming from systemic
    inequities, such as racism and sexism, often leading to a lack of representation
    and opportunities for underrepresented groups. Achieving equity and diversity
    in the field requires acknowledging and addressing these complex issues, rather
    than seeking a singular solution.
- desc: 'I learned the exact definitions of equity, equality, diversity, inclusion
    and accessibility. As these words are interrelated, often people (including myself)
    like to use them interchangably but there is a difference in the meaning of each
    word: Equity focuses on fairness and impartiality, equality focuses on treating
    everyone the same, diversity focuses on differences, inclusion focuses on involvement
    and belonging, and accessibility focuses on removing barriers.'
- desc: Equity
- desc: An important perspective was thinking about why people study computer science
    and code. Is it to help other people? Change the world? Why am I studying CS?
- desc: The problem of diversity. After coming to U of R, the people from different
    backgorund was a welcome site but I did not know a field like CS had issues with
    prejudice. Since it is a field in computers doesnt just doesnt mean humans within
    it are better.
- desc: learning to code is important
- desc: Grace hopper was a member of the military through and through. I was under
    the impression that she was contracted or something to that effect
- desc: I thought the concepts of Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility
    were important. Especially how they affect technology, the impact is a lot bigger
    than I thought
- desc: The concept of inclusion,diversity,equity and accessibility.
- desc: nothing
- desc: 'the importance of equity, equality, diversity and accessibility '
- desc: Alternatives for Charged Terminology in the Computing Profession
- desc: equity
- desc: 'Today I learned about Grace Hopper who was a part of making the first computer. '
- desc: An important perspective I encountered today was the "why" of people going
    into computing. Everyone has their own reason for learning computer science, and
    it's a shame CS has had a diversity problem in the past/present but it is amazing
    how many people really enjoy computing for more than the money that it can bring
    in. With the wave of AI surfacing I believe the people who don't have a passion
    for CS rather than the money will realize the job market will be extremely tough
    for them.
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: Charged terminology in computing profession
- desc: the contyributions of computing on humanity and people , and Grace Hopper's
    interview!!
- desc: the concept learnt was all very interesting
- desc: personal skill development
- desc: Computerization, IDEA
- desc: learn about Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility
- desc: The diversity problem that plagues computer science.
- desc: An important concept I learned today was from the first video about how determination
    is a key factor to success
- desc: 'An important concept we covered today was: Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion,
    Accessibility. I feel this is very important in computing today because we as
    computer science students we should always include, support, and provide for anybody
    who wants to be apart of technology. Everyone has a right to do what they want
    and I think anyone can make a difference in the world today. '
- desc: '1'
- desc: The concepts related to Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility.
- desc: 'Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility, Computing (benefits
    and why?) '
- desc: We talked about the diversity problem in the CS field. We talked about the
    purpose of Computing and said that it was to help people among other things. We
    also watched a video and thought about how poorly it aged.
- desc: Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility (IDEA)
- desc: We disscussed some articles

    Inclusion, Accessibility. I think it was imporatant to encounter.
- desc: Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility
- desc: We discussed about CS2023 Report.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: While it may not be a concept or perspective, we briefly talked about the
    diversity problem within the computer science field. While the data may have been
    recorded from 2023, I find that the CS department in our school is very diverse
    and even companies now are beginning to become more diverse. I believe that in
    a few years from now it will become less of a problem.
- desc: Today we discussed how computer science study is important for us to learn
    in school
- desc: I found it really interesting that despite being a creative field cs has a
    diversity problem because one would expect a creative field to be very inclusive
    of different types of people and perspective to encourage innovation that benefits
    different types of people.
- desc: 'I learned about Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility.
    Equity focuses on fairness and impartiality whereas equality focuses on equality
    focuses on treating everyone the exact same. '

- desc: 'We watched some more videos today, including a humorously outdated video
    about social media companies. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: inclusion and equity within computer science
- desc: An important concept we talked about today was Inclusion Diversity Equity
    and Accessibility(IDEA) which are concepts often used together to promote a more
    inclusive and equitable society. Another thing we talked about was thedailyscam.com
    and how it does not have a wiki page of its own, perhaps does it even deserve
    one? Lastly, talked about the purpose of comupting and why we are studying it.
    In conclusion, we summed up that it can help change the world; that its for humanity
    to improve quality of life.
- desc: 'The computing world needs to be more inclusive and treat everyone fairly '
- desc: 'The concept of equality in computer technology was really worth giving thoughts
    to. '
- desc: The video we watched about schools not teaching computer science was interesting
    because I had no idea some of these famous people we interested in coding
- desc: CS along with curent and future technology
- desc: Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility
- desc: In summary, equity focuses on fairness and impartiality, equality focuses
    on treating everyone the same, diversity  focuses on differences, inclusion focuses
    on involvement and belonging, and accessibility focuses on removing barriers.  These
    concepts are interrelated and are often used together to promote a more inclusive
    and equitable society.
- desc: The importance of recognizing the differences of equality and equity, what
    we can do to achieve them, and what we should do to ensure we hold accountability
    to meet them

    ,it was good to know about equity and diversity in computer science.
- desc: I got to know about Equity, Equality, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility
    today
- desc: Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Accessibility
- desc: Equity, equality and inclusion.
- desc: We talked about the importance of inclusion within the computing profession,
    especially with the growth and need for it over the past couple years. We discussed
    why diversity and fair treatment of all in this growing profession is so important
    because with growth comes diversity and it is crucial that we do not treat others
    differently because they are different than us.
- desc: 'Nothing '
- desc: 'we learn the terms equity , equality , diversity ,inculsion and accesability
    and some reasons why there is very less diversity in the computer science cource
    due to racism , sexism and clascism '

- desc: IDEA - Inclusion, Diversity, Equality, Accessibility.
- desc: 'An important concept that I encountered today is how the field of computer
    science has had many diversity problems. Many inequities such as gender, race,
    and class often contribute to the lack of diverse identities within the field.
    Not only are they affecting technology accessibility, but job opportunities as
    well. In order to address these problems, we must focus on equity, equality, diversity,
    inclusion, and accessibility. '
- desc: 'Equity emphasizes justice and impartiality, equality emphasizes treating
    everyone the same, diversity emphasizes differences, inclusion emphasizes engagement
    and belonging, and accessibility emphasizes the removal of barriers. '
- desc: about equity equality diversity inclusion and accessability
- desc: Grace Hopper's interview
