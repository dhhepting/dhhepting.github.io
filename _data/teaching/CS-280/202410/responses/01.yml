difficult:
- desc: Not really. The class was pretty straight forward and very informative.
- desc: Wasn't able to submit attendance on time. I'll try it next time
- desc: I understood everything that was talked about today, but had a slight difficulty
    locating the syllabus.
- desc: There was no such difficult topics which were diffcult to understand after
    the revising the Video 2nd time after the lecture.
- desc: Because today was introductory, everything was easy to understand
- desc: The specifics of the philosophical perspectives
- desc: Didn't understood what all things were included in the class participation
    for this course.
- desc: Whether or not we should be collecting personal data is a difficult question
    to answer, morally at least.
- desc: Today was a pretty baseline class. I believe most of the material, if not
    all, was pretty self explanatory and easy to comprehend.
- desc: Third question that was asked in the video. I had no idea what was that about.
    First two were easy to answer
- desc: 'I think I was a little confused when after showing the TED Talk video, "What
    is Apocalypse Now?" was written on the board, and I am not entirely sure what
    that means.'
- desc: 'One thing that forced me to think was when the TED talk brought up the need
    to apply a moral framework to how data is used. While we humans are in control
    of how that information is spread, information changes overtime. What we consider
    morally right and wrong now may not be morally right or wrong in the future. Of
    course we should be wary of how and what data we collect, but in my opinion,
    data is meant to be an objective representation of an entity and whether its good
    or bad, the truth is what matters.'
- desc: The Terminator reference.
- desc: Apocalypse Now and The Terminator reference and most importantly some part TEDx
- desc: I found it a little but difficult to understand what kind of material we will
    be focusing on in this course. Hopefully the syllabus will help with this when
    it is posted.
- desc: People in the back were not able to listen properly because the mic volume
    was low
- desc: Not in particular, at times I struggled to hear you, so slightly louder microphone
    would be nice (this may also just be because of the sheer number of people in
    the room making it harder to hear)
- desc: I did not understand where they would be pulling this information from.
- desc: Not really. The class just felt a bit slower today but I believe it will speed
    up in the coming classes
- desc: I found it difficult to understand Kant''s view on ethics. Kant wanted
    to use reasoning in order to solve ethical issues. However, this sounds very similar
    to what Aristotle said about using judgement to determine the best answer. I assume
    that judgment would be gained from personal experiences, whereas reasoning would
    come from analyzing the situation.
- desc: 'I feel the Risk and Reward definition but I will be studying about it tonight'
- desc: 'Not really, these are the basic things we encounter everyday, we just don''t
    realize them deeply.'
- desc: I didn''t fully understand what the ACM was
- desc: I might have misheard, I thought that we could begin these questions in class
    but I could not begin them until after class.'
- desc: Risk and Rewards interpretation little bit
- desc: I had troubles understanding what the types of moral frameworks being referred
    to in the TED talk.
- desc: The TED Talk that was presented in class was a little difficult to understand
    at first because I was unaware of the context and reasoning behind the video.
- desc: Based on other students answers, I was confused what the risks and rewards
    were referring to. Was it just things that involve risks and rewards or was it
    on the topic of technology?
- desc: No everything was understandable today but the method of teaching was somewhat different and was challenging as the TED talk was bit difficult to relate.
- desc: Yes there was something we learnt today that was difficult to understand it
    was how numbers can be used to seek a moral framework.
- desc: Honestly, nothing was difficult to understand today  as it was the first day
    of class and 16 minutes video by Damon Horowiatz was also interesting.
- desc: I was unable to fully grasp how the concept of utilitarian framework could
    be implemented in tech with regards to data collection because of how much opinions
    on the subject differ between people.
- desc: the course syllabus
- desc: There was nothing I found difficult to understand as today was the first day
    of class. We were just getting familiar with UR Courses which I found quite straightforward.
- desc: The definitions of different types of thinking.
- desc: There was no such thing which was tough to grasp in the video or the first
    meeting, but I am really looking forward to look what this course will teach me
    further as the very first class was so much informative.
- desc: I found that the main topic of the TED talk was not very clear. It begins
    with power and influence but does not expand on that much. It then talked about
    ethics and morals within philosophy and our own decision-making. At the end of
    the TED talk, I still felt that it had not come to a solidified conclusion.
- desc: Apocalypse Now topic - How it get related to the TED talk video is a difficult
    task for me to understand
- desc: When watching the TED Talk speaker, I found it difficult to find his exact
    point he was trying to make. Until the very end I was pretty confused on his point.
    It seemed at points he wasn''t referring to technology at all and more just the
    concept of how thinking deeply is beneficial. Personally, considering how vague
    this concept was it was just hard to find direction and meaning in his words.
- desc: How to access your website.
- desc: The three philosophies that were discussed in the video.
- desc: I just had trouble finding the website at first and was confused as to how
    the class would operate but I am beginning to understand the more that I play
    around with the website.
- desc: The difference between Kant and Mill philosophy (don''t we figure out how
    things are intrinsically wrong in Kant philosophy using a method similar to Mill
    philosophy?)
- desc: not really, learned a new word apocalypse
- desc: Not really, it was very straight forward and helped introduce the nuances
    of privacy and our personal right to it on a data level
- desc: No. We did not learn too much so the things we learned today were simple to
    understand.
- desc: Todays class was not that difficult to understand as we were just introduced
    to the course
- desc: The contents of the TED talk video.
- desc: 'Today the only bit that I found difficult to understand was the TED Talk
    as it went by really fast and I struggled to understand the meaning.'
- desc: some of the concepts were a little vague and abstract to catch on
- desc: yes, to define the risks and rewards in any particular situation.
- desc: I had a bit of trouble understanding the Risk and Reward topic near the
    end of class.
- desc: No the overview of syllabus and the video was interesting and easy to grasp.
- desc: 'The stuff about research credit. I''m unsure if the opportunities for Research
    Credit will be posted online, or we go participate on our own.'
- desc: TED Talk by a professor discussing ethics, where he mentioned about ethical
    dilemmas. The idea of this process is difficult for me.
- desc: I struggled to understand the course load and what is expected of me, as well
    as what my learning outcomes should be by the end of this semester. I also did
    not understand what is expected regarding quizzes and responses to meetings.
- desc: Yes the reason behind the video of TED talk in class but after reviewing with
    prof and friends it is quite clear. Although first session but seems to be interesting.
    Also, one suggestion to increase the volume of prof mic because it is quite hard
    to hear in such a big class.
- desc: Everything thought today seemed pretty easy to understand since it is still
    a welcome class
- desc: I have basic knowledge of computer, internet and mostly everything in computers
    so it was easy for me to go through today.
- desc: How to use and edit the Wiki pages
- desc: Technically yeah.
- desc: 'Philosophies that were discussed were a bit difficult to understand '
- desc: 'Didn''t find anything much difficult but found some of the things from TED
    talk spectaculating and curious to think things that way too. '
- desc: The TED Talk that was displayed was a bit confusing, I couldn''t understand
    what the speaker''s main point near the end of the video really was.
- desc: how can we relate ethics with math calculations like Plato
- desc: How to utilize Wikipedia pages and make edits.
- desc: I did not understand what the term Apocalypse Now was supposed to represent.
- desc: No, the video explained things clearly, as well as the examples of risk and
    reward we discussed as a class.
- desc: Understanding the reference to Apocalypse Now was a bit complicated.
- desc: Not at all. Everything was pretty much clear. I think we must see more examples
    of how data is vital nowadays and how we can implement mechanisms to manage it
    well.
important:
- desc: Today I learnt a lot of things about risks and rewards in the world of computing
    and technology.
- desc: 'The risk and reward of AI development '
- desc: the risk and reward of information handling
- desc: How ethics is important when using data and how it impact the thinking process
    of human beings
- desc: Just the introduction of the course.
- desc: Having a moral compass with regards to computing.
- desc: To learn the risk and rewards that society are subjected to in terms of information
- desc: There is a risk in reward, and reward in risk.
- desc: We have learnt in today's lecture that what is the moral operating system
    by TEDEX speaker damon Horowitz.
- desc: I came to know about important concept "moral operating system" where Damon
    Horowitz  shares that how important it is to have moral framework  concept to
    make decisions using technology keeping in mind how risks and rewards are linked
    with it.
- desc: It was our first class today in which the course was introduced. An important
    concept I encountered today was the risks and rewards that come with the information
    society.
- desc: The different philosophical approaches to mass data collection
- desc: The perspective of the speaker to try to make us understand about ethics that
    it is not just a simple equation to which a set of formula could be used to solve
    or to explain it to a computer rather it is something us humans decide by reflecting
    back on the steps we take to get to a decision.
- desc: That we need to be careful about our data, since there are so many ways it
    can be used and abused by third parties tracking everything we do online.
- desc: My biggest takeaway was from the Ted Talk discussing the different perceptions
    of morals there were.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: "Importance of one\u2019s privacy and that it should be the persons choice\
    \ to make it public"
- desc: We talked about risk and reward in information and TED talk
- desc: 'That artificial intelligence is everywhere. '
- desc: 'An important concept that I encountered today was from the Ted Talk video
    shown in class. It talked about the power our society holds over data and asks
    if there is a moral framework that could help us manage it with "justice". It
    was really interesting seeing in the video how many people have stronger opinions
    over their hand-held devices than our moral framework for making decisions. A
    notable quote stated in the video is how most people make bad decisions because
    the decision was not given much thought. '
- desc: From the video today i got to learn the most basic yet very imperative meaning
    of ethics in field of computing. Moreover, the illustration of AI to explain the
    concept of risk and reward was very influential as it covered the objectives of
    data usage.
- desc: One important perspective I encountered in this meeting was the consequentialist
    view regarding how data should be used mentioned in the TED talk. This moral framework
    appeals to me greatly since I also believe the ends should justify the means mainly
    when it comes to political/social issues. However, seeing utilitarianism applied
    in a computer science perspective got me to think more about how useful and dangerous
    technology can be such as with the rise of AI threatening to cost humans their
    jobs.
- desc: Some things can be both a risk and a rewards when it comes to the information
    society
- desc: Ethics plays a crucial role in IT society
- desc: The idea of looking at ethics and morals through the lens of math. Measuring
    the right and wrong to make a decision. Precisely why machinery is not ideal in
    systems that need to evaluate the weight of one's actions. Code relies on logic
    alone where the human mind is able to both empathize and think logically. Both
    is needed for humans to flourish.
- desc: I learnt with  great reward comes with great risk in the information society
    which is a gamble we most wisely analyse.
- desc: 'Generally, the concept of philosophical issues arising in the information
    society was not new to me, but todays class made me think critically about them. '
- desc: I learned that is important to think about the risks that come with information
    and technology. I learned how it is important to reflect on ethics and morals
    when making decisions for how technology is to be used.
- desc: The talk we had about Risks and Rewards
- desc: 'the risk and reward of the advancement in information collection '
- desc: 'Risk and Reward, as well as exploring Kant and other such philosophers '
- desc: Introduction to Risks and Rewards.
- desc: "I think all the topics were important but mostly today\u2019s lecture was\
    \ focused on decision making skills and also risk reward introduction "
- desc: 'That your personal information online is much less secure than most people
    think. '
- desc: In the TedTalk, I thought that the aspect of privacy and whether ethics and
    morals matter more than we think in regards to technology/social media.
- desc: I have occasionally thought about whether Justice is a definite, but now I
    am very cureous and excited to dive into the idea more!
- desc: Risks and advantages of data
- desc: 'An important concept or perspective that I encountered today was the idea
    that there is more than one answer for any ethical dilemma. Every question asked
    in ethics can be seen from many different perspectives. I have always assumed
    there is always one viewpoint that is more correct than others. However, after
    learning that different disciplines of study can present different ideas about
    ethics, I understand there are always multiple viewpoints and normally more than
    one correct solution to a problem. '
- desc: 'I leant about ACM, which stands for the Association for Computing Machinery.
    It is a professional organization dedicated to advancing the field of computing.
    ACM provides resources, publications, and events to support the global computing
    community. And also the TedX video that talks about Tech and AI and how AI will
    only work by the brain of a human '
- desc: Talking in video about the right things to do like respecting the dignity
    and the privacy of someone when we have their data.
- desc: 'Data collection; privacy; making our decisions after analyzing what is right
    and wrong. '
- desc: It is important to think about the intentions of making the technologies and
    the possible harm it can cause
- desc: The idea of how collection of data can be harmful if used incorrectly.
- desc: The amount of risks involve with information
- desc: From the TED talk I learned the everyone makes their decisions through a different
    process
- desc: Today I encountered a Ted Talk that talked about different decision making
    perspectibes that each person uses. It helped me understand how I make decisions
    and what I base my decisions on. Personally, I decide by my feelings and the consequences
    of the actions.
- desc: Risk and reward in information society
- desc: The ethics involved in handling personal information.
- desc: Moral Operating System, Risk and Rewards interpretation
- desc: That there aren't "truths" like math has, and that morals are not as simple
    as a set of truths or rules for everyone to follow.
- desc: Something I learned today is about amount of power people have in the information
    society. Our information is easily accessable to those who seek it which is both
    beneficial and concerning.
- desc: The morality of data collection and the risks vs rewards.
- desc: multiple view points on what could be considered as a moral/ethical systems;
    and from what I understood; what are the risks and rewards of collecting and using
    data sets.
- desc: "Today was the first day of the class and we started with syllabus and a video\
    \ discussion and we did discuss about some risk and reward, and as I am an introvert\
    \ person I couldn\u2019t tell at that tome but according to me I think AI can\
    \ be far more dangerous as it can copy one person completely and can do anything\
    \ with the data."
- desc: The important concept i encountered today is how people in the humanities
    field and those in the technology field have different perspectives of thinking
    and solving problems.
- desc: About DATA
- desc: It was a great time learning about the pros and cons i.e the risks and rewards
    of internet today
- desc: I like the topics we saw in video today, as ot was repated to cybersecurity,
    data privacy and decision making in information society. These are often involv
    in risk and balancing them againt rewards.
- desc: I encountered the concept of utilitarian frame work and how it applies to
    ethics of data collection in the technological field
- desc: The risks and rewards of Internet
- desc: 'Today was a general introduction to the course. After watching a video the
    risks and rewards of the information society were discussed. '
- desc: Ethics with privacy online.
- desc: 'Watching the Ted talk on We need a "Moral Operating System" by Damon Horowitz
    forced me to think about the topic which i never really thought about which was
    "ethics" which I though simply means doing the right things. But after watching
    this video, it provided me a new perspective that what really is a right thing.
    I personally think there is no right thing, it all depends on everyone''s perspectives
    and thoughts. In short right thing can differ person to person.  '
- desc: An important concept or perspective I encountered today is that both morals
    and ethics are very complex and cannot be solved or described using only one perspective.
    With a lot of the decisions we make every day we often do not consciously think
    about the reasons we make those decisions. It is important to think about how
    we think to begin to understand how we build our morals and ethics.
- desc: In the tedtalk video seen, I found that a good decision is made after viewing
    all the good and bad aspects of a particular case.
- desc: 'Today we covered what is apocalypse and discussed about what is Risk and
    Reward in Information Society '
- desc: Risk or Reward
- desc: 'The video you mentioned if people working in the tech field are responsible
    for setting and maintaining moral standards for users and themselves. '
- desc: 'The most important concept I''ve learned today was when talking about ethics,
    we need to consider that there multiple sides to a story. There aren''t going
    to be clear cut answers which makes ethics an extremely difficult concept to have
    opinions on. This is why as humans, we need to be able to think critically and
    deeply in order to develop a consensus on an issue. When talking about risks and
    rewards, this point was even more clear to me because I could see both sides to
    a difficult topic/issue. '
- desc: That we as a society need to put more effort into evaluating our morals.
- desc: about risks and rewards of information of society.
- desc: The important concept for today was about the ending topic of what comes in
    risk and what comes in rewards, secondly it was about the decision making power,
    and last was of data thing about what to do .
- desc: Advantages and disadvantages of data collection.
- desc: 'As of the the introduction was important as well as things discussed in the
    Ted talk. '
- desc: An important concept I encountered today in class involves the discussion
    of ethics in data collection. I learned about the different forms of moral frameworks
    (Plato, Aristotle, Utilitarian, etc.). The TED Talk by Damon Horowitz helped me
    to understand the importance of critically and consciously thinking when making
    decisions.
- desc: I got encounter that there are both risks and benefits of Artificial Intelligence
- desc: Risk and rewards
- desc: The concept of relating traditional philosophy to the world of computer science
- desc: 'risk and reward in imformation society '
- desc: An important perspective i gain today was the idea of moral frameworks being
    applied to data . Something which by nature is binary and statistical having a
    humanistic view applied to it.
- desc: although today's lecture was introductoy, but i find it very interesting subject
    to learn
- desc: The most important perspective I learned today were the moral implications
    of technological risks and rewards.
- desc: The ted talk that we watched today was really interesting and gave me something
    to analyze and think about for later.
- desc: Managing your time and focusing on lectures will take you to the peak .
- desc: The idea of our extremely interconnected modern society being a double edged
    blade with its own risks and rewards.
- desc: An important concept I encountered today was the different types of risk and
    rewards. I have never really thought about risk nor reward before so it was a
    whole new concept to listen and learn.
- desc: 'How morality relates to information '
- desc: Grading structure
- desc: making choices and handling of data
- desc: Apocalypes
- desc: The debate around whether data should be collected to make online experiences
    better or respect privacy.
- desc: The important concept i encounter today is we have a lot of power in the form
    of data but the main thing is that how we use that power(data). while using the
    power of technology, a technical person thinks in the way that we can access the
    data of others and doesn't care about the privacy &amp; secrets of any individual
    person. while the
- desc: In a really interesting Ted Talk, I found out that different groups of people
    understand things in their own ways. The speaker talked about how folks in tech
    and other areas have their own unique ways of thinking. Tech people, who work
    with cool gadgets and codes, share a similar way of looking at things. Meanwhile,
    people in different jobs also have their own similar thinking styles based on
    what they do. The talk explained how this affects how they work It  together and
    solve problems in different fields.
- desc: the perspective of how something that can be both a risk and a reward to certain
    individuals in information society
- desc: 'data privacy is a cornerstone of personal freedom, allowing individuals to
    express themselves and navigate the digital world without the fear of being tracked
    or profiled. But Is it ethical? '
- desc: An important concept today was the ethical dilemma of having access to data.
    Having that much accessibility grants an incredible amount of power, allowing
    people to view your activity on the Internet. However, we have to ask whether
    it is ethical to use and exercise that power, or should we consider other approaches
    to the accessibility of data.
- desc: Ethical Dilemmas was most important topic for me.
- desc: An important concept or perspective from today's CS280 class was that morals
    in technology is just as important as the programming part in order to preserve
    protection of the consumer and the creator, and protect authenticity of work.
- desc: "The concept of Risks and Rewards of Information Society. From today session\
    \ I get to know that there is mutual risk and rewards in today\u2019s world of\
    \ informative society due to technology. "
- desc: WELCOMING CONCEPT AND DETAIL ABOUT THE SUBJECT.IOS AND ANDROID
- desc: In todays lecture, I learnt the importance of taking responsibility. Being
    proactive when navigating risks and making informed choices contributes to a safe
    ethical information society.
- desc: We did encounter basic intro in class today including discussing about personal
    data and what it may mean plus we also discussed pros ricks and rewards as well.
- desc: There are more risks in the information society rather than rewards.
- desc: 'What our data loss can cause so we should preserve it from the ted talk '
- desc: The possible repercussions of collecting and sharing of data.
- desc: Making decision using your ethical mind.
- desc: Advantages and disadvantages of collecting data
- desc: ' Importance of moral framework '
- desc: I learned that in any  given situation there is always a risk and a reward
    involved.
- desc: The perspective of the people that companies get data from, mostly the consumers
    and users.
- desc: Risk and Rewards
- desc: 'Risk and reward '
- desc: Definition of risk and reward in the information society, and ACM as well
- desc: how can we ethically use this huge power of technology, that we have got in
    our hands, into the betterment of our mordern society.
- desc: The benefits and risk of the modern technology of AI
- desc: 'Different considerations about risk and rewards '
- desc: Potential consequences of disclosing personal information and its pros and
    cons .
- desc: The perspective that morals and ethics are more than just right and wrong,
    and that there are a multiple things that go into deciding whether something is
    right or wrong. Additionally, there is a risk and reward with this.
- desc: Privacy, it's use in two different ways, using people's private or public
    data to enhance their experience with technology or misusing their data to destroy
    their privacy.
- desc: I learned more about how there are risks and rewards to consider when we use
    technology.
- desc: One important concept I took into account was the idea that knowledge and
    data holds great power. As a result, we must think carefully about how this information
    should be used.
- desc: A lot of choices you make has risk tied to it, but in different scenarios,
    you also have a lot of rewards tied to a decision.
- desc: The idea of having a moral operating system that decides whether something
    is considered right or wrong based on what is believed to be morally right and
    wrong
- desc: 'The topic of whether it is safe to share information online. Furthermore,
    it is our duty as computer scientists to determine if it is morally acceptable
    to exploit user datasets to improve our work or whether we should respect users''
    dignity instead.  '
- desc: 'I encountered an important concept in today''s video: the development of
    a moral operating system.'
- desc: I today's class we learn about what are the risk and reward of the information
    of the an individual or a group of people in today's world.
- desc: Today's lecture gave me an introduction about the topic and the subject
- desc: There are many risks and rewards regarding the management of data. For this
    reason, we must be aware and have professional morals to tackle this topic correctly.
know-more:
- desc: I found the topic of Artificial Intelligence very interesting. It can either
    be a reward or risk for humans.
- desc: The Risk and Reward of other concept.
- desc: I want to know more about the risks and rewards. I'm interested in these topics.
- desc: Human thought and way of thinking for ethics or how data can/will be used
- desc: Probably the syllabus as well and maybe what type of class discussions we
    will be having
- desc: Not in particular, it all made sense to me.
- desc: I would like the class to progress more before I can ask to know more
- desc: I am curious if it's possible to have a reward without iniating any risks,
    or risks with 0 rewards.
- desc: i wanted to dig into more why we need the moral operating system.
- desc: Seeing  my curiosity, I will like to know more on "moral operating system"
    implementing on current IT industry by knowing what are new precautions to take
    care of risks and what are future rewards that can be achieved by using technology
    wisely
- desc: We listed a few risks and rewards but I would like to know about more risks
    and rewards that come with the information society, and if we can ever truly trust
    the information we access, without any risks. I would also like to learn about
    the risks and rewards that aren't obvious, when it comes to accessing information
    online. There are many risks and rewards we don't realize in the information society
    which is why I would like to learn about them, to be more aware and mindful.
- desc: Nothing specific yet!
- desc: Would like to know more about how today's lecture could link with computer
    science in general.
- desc: How different entities use and collect our data, what its used for and more
    details about that specifically.
- desc: I would like to know more about the risk vs reward concept.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: At the end of the lecture we talked about the risk of AI. I would like to
    know about to what extend it can cause harm
- desc: 'No I hope we will cover the stuff in coming classes '
- desc: 'More about risk '
- desc: I was wondering if the ACM code of ethics is an important concept in the class,
    and if it is, I could use further explanation about this topic.
- desc: Yes, i would like to learn more about the prominent risks associated with
    the information society in terms of data manipulation.
- desc: When talking about different risks and rewards regarding information, AI was
    brought up as a reward which is a belief I think should be challenged. I would
    like to learn more about how AI got so advanced and what that means for the future
    of humanity.  Is it worth sacrificing our jobs for the sake of efficiency? What
    will become of us if machines control and distribute our information? Those are
    questions I want to encounter to challenge our worldview on the future of technology.
- desc: No, I am good. Thanks!
- desc: More on how much of one's private information should be accessed. Anything
    too crucial should be left alone but opinions differ and that is interesting to
    listen to. However, I would like to know exactly what the people of technological
    world thinks.
- desc: 'The TEDx show breakdown of his concept '
- desc: I would like to understand more about the ACM code of ethics.
- desc: I would like to know more about what the assignments and exams will be like
    in this class, like what format will it be in and the dates they are due.
- desc: Nothing
- desc: i would like to learn more on what steps can be taken to protect one self
    for machines that are built without our wellbeing in mind
- desc: Not that I can think of, most topics were well explained
- desc: Nothing for today.
- desc: I would love learn the things that breaches the safety of people and inturn
    I would know what thing to take care of.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: I would like to know more about which topics fall under both the "risk" and
