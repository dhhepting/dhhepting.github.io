- desc: How does being watched affect our behavior and actions?
- desc: "An important concept I encountered today was the concept of sustainability.\
    \ And what types of sustainability there are, such as environmental, social, and\
    \ economic sustainability. I never really realized that computing does have an\
    \ impact on the environment and the resources of a company. Also, there are algorithms\
    \ used to maximize the use of scarce resources and to help with the environmental\
    \ impact of computing. And I did some research and there are multiple ways to\
    \ \u201CGo Green\u201D while computing. "

- desc: Midterm review
- desc: sustainability
- desc: 'the imp concept today was the designs of vending machines '
- desc: 'Sustainability in Computing. I think it is very important because I believe
    everyone that has some kind of technology should be concerned about the impacts
    of having everything being digital now. It may get to the point where technology
    could pollute more than gases, as an example. I feel this way because there are
    people who always want the best technology and sometimes those people do not care
    about how their previous devices are disposed off, which leads to pollution in
    the environment. '

    can come out of abstraction such as commodities
- desc: we went over midterm exam solutions today
- desc: Midtern ans`
