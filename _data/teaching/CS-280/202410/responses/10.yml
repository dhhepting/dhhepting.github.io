important:
- desc: I learnt about encryption today.
- desc: 'About open source software '
- desc: the concept of software license
- desc: The status of software being kinda in the grey area of patent. Software is
    such a complex creation and that the extent to which software can be eligible
    for patent is difficult to determine.
- desc: Key Encryption
- desc: we learnt about free open software topic.
- desc: I encountered concept of software patents  in today's class
- desc: Open source license, deep fakes, digital frogery
- desc: 'Different types of license '
- desc: Digital forgery was one of the important  concept I have encountered.
- desc: 'Software patent '
- desc: Got to know about different kind of password managers such as 1 password and
    also about differences between the policies of each country that regulates software
    patents.
- desc: Best password encryption options
- desc: digital forger
- desc: 'Concerns of digital forgery '
- desc: Comparison of free and open-source software licenses, etc..
- desc: A software patent gives inventors exclusive rights to their software-related
    creations, like computer programs or algorithms, usually for 20 years, in exchange
    for disclosing the details of their invention. However, the criteria for obtaining
    software patents differ across countries and regional offices, especially regarding
    computer-implemented innovations such as business methods.
- desc: 'I learned from the podcast that whenever we design/create something, we should
    always think that we are designing it for the most vulnerable person and how we
    could use our skills to aid those that are less fortunate. '
- desc: 'Digital forgery '
- desc: 'Today, I encountered the idea of copylefting, a concept I didn''t even know
    existed. I find it interesting that people are allowed to make changes to another
    person''s work so long as they publish it. '
- desc: During discussions, we questioned why open source would ever be an option
    when everyone building their projects would want to retain their rights to it
    as well. However, I understand it as sharing. Giving people the base to contribute
    and create something of their own. However, why would anyone allow others to modify
    and claim something that originally came from them. The idea to retain ownership
    and taking in feedback to change things sounds lot better as a customer. I want
    something readymade.
- desc: open source licences
- desc: 'Software patents can be viewed as a positive result from an individuals perspective,
    or a negative result from society''s perspective. I was not aware that software
    patents needed philosophical inquiry in this way. '
- desc: The podcast of deepfakes
- desc: nothing
- desc: digital forgery and image-based sexual abuse with ai generated art involving
    people (ex deepfake porn)
- desc: Risks with Pornography
- desc: Software patents
- desc: 'Patents of software '
- desc: 'Free software license, comparison of free and open source licenses '
- desc: Digital Forgery
- desc: I learnt about free-software licenses and the different kinds. I also learnt
    about public key encryption
- desc: Today I encountered the concepts of deep fakes and image based sexual abuse,
    which I didn't realize how common they were.
- desc: An important perspective that I encountered today and yesterday in the podcast
    was the concept of digital forgery and how alarming it can be to all kinds of
    people espeically females who can have their image tarnished by something they
    did not even do. I believe that as computing professionals it is our responsibility
    to determine what people should be able to create online and ties into the debate
    of should everyone have access to AI (something that people don't know how it
    works).
- desc: Software patents
- desc: Software patent
- desc: 'the concepts were all interesting '
- desc: foss licences
- desc: 'Free and open source license, software patent, public key encryption '
- desc: deep fake and digital fogery
- desc: The most most important concept I learned was about public key encryption
    and how it is useful and good for world
- desc: Issues regarding software patents
- desc: 'An important idea that was talked about today was Software Licenses. In my
    opinion, I feel Copyright laws are a little bit over the top. Not just in the
    software world but an everyday life situation. For example: I wanted to make a
    custom sweater which Ive always wanted but there were a few rules that I had to
    follow. I could not but anything that was licensed: words, pictures, logos etc.
    I could not be as creative because of limitations of copyright. I feel this 100%
    can be transcribed in software industry'
- desc: Free-software license
- desc: The dangers of deepfake technology is probably the biggest topic I encountered
    today, This is because of the future implications of people or governments abusing
    this technology to try and decieve the public. An example of this would to have
    a deepfake of a political rival doing something nefarious and using that to smear
    there image. Also, in a simpler way it could be used to damage popular stars image.
    A recent example of this would be Taylor Swift.
- desc: the idea that there are debates about changing the names of technologies in
    order to better represent what those technologies are capable of, good and bad.
- desc: I realized that I was more in favour of open-source software over proprietary
    software.
- desc: Intellectual Property, Software licences, patients.
- desc: the importance of word choice for a positive or negative affect, helps convey
    a perspective on the topic
- desc: We talked about the different kinds of patents and discussed which ones are
    better for certain situations.
- desc: Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption
- desc: 'We saw topics about software license, encryption '
- desc: An important concept I learnt today is about encryption
- desc: Everything
- desc: 'No'
- desc: We went more in depth with encryption and the case studies
- desc: Encryption
- desc: I think there was nothing importanat I did encounter today.
- desc: The important part was podcast on deepFakes, concern of digital forgery etc.
- desc: About the computer software and patent
- desc: Today we learned about software patents.
- desc: 'The use of AI to create sexualy explicit images is a new way that sexual
    abuse can be taken place.  This deep fake tech is how it is being used on famous
    celebrities. '
- desc: Today in class we discussed about the podcast on deep fakes and talked about
    important assignments submission and parts
- desc: Today we discussed about the podcast on deepfakes, the concerns of digital
    forgery, the assignment dates and password managers
- desc: I learned about password managers today. I always thought you had to just
    memorize or write down your passwords in some sort of note format. Knowing this
    now, I will definitely start using one and use more secure passwords.
- desc: About software patents
- desc: nothing important concept today
- desc: i learned about patent.
- desc: 'I got to know more about encryption '
- desc: 'Software patents '
- desc: Today we were introduced to several important concepts. Firstly, we given
    a glimpse of digital forgery and the harm that it inflicts on people, but especially
    women. Then we went over the precautions we should take regarding passwords and
    password managers. We also had a discussion about software patents with our classwork
    groups which we posted about on our blog.
- desc: Software Patents are still an open issue
- desc: The concept of digital forgery
- desc: Comparison between free and open source file
- desc: software patents
- desc: About assigbment
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'Security '
- desc: 'the use of ai for deception '
- desc: I learned the important concept of deep fakes and concerns of digital forgery
- desc: "I learned about encryption sites I haven\u2019t heard of today."
- desc: Key encryption was the most interesting for me
- desc: "Today I encountered the concept Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange and digital\
    \ forgery. The key exchange is a mathematical method that lets 2 people securely\
    \ exchange cryptographic keys over a public channel without doing it directly."
- desc: 'The concerns of digital forgery '
- desc: The impact that deepfakes and digital forgery has on people, and also what
    some believe to be real or faje
- desc: I learned the existence of software licenses / copyright / patents.
- desc: Concerns on digital forgery and talked about password managers
- desc: Comparison of free and open-source licenses and Public key encryption
- desc: 'Software patent are still an open issue: Not grated just for automating a
    task otherwise done by people, Must have some new elements that is the invention,
    Not just the code, but the lager packages.'
- desc: The heavy importance of encryption
- desc: learning about the podcast and its content
- desc: .
- desc: Today ,I discovered essential concepts such as software patent, types of patents,etc.
- desc: Encryption and the privatization of user data. Also Software patents and whether
    to consider the ethical and financial side of patenting software (i.e. proprietization
    or open source)
- desc: I got to know about different topics like comparison of free and open sources,
    public key encryption etc.
- desc: 'Today we discussed about Assignments and other stuff. '
- desc: "Today\u2019s lecture was extraordinary.. we learned good things\u2026"
- desc: 'Administration '
- desc: We learn about the concerns behind digital forgery and password manager.
- desc: 'the important concept was software patents '
- desc: 'I learnt about digital forgery '
- desc: 'the comaprison of free and open source software licences and their permissions '
- desc: deepfakes and digital forgery
- desc: Free and open source license
- desc: An important concept that I learned today was the emphasis on making safety
    for deepfakes. In all honesty the thought of deepfakes and how common it is for
    it to be sexually abused scares me. I want to find out the progression of minimizing
    it if there is any significant progression on the software engineering side apart
    from the bills that are being raised in question for it.
- desc: Important concept of ethical values is the need for the future
- desc: today we learn about the softwares and their licensing
- desc: "The use of deepfake ai being used to hurt/damage a person\u2019s reputation."
- desc: Comparison between free and open source lisences`
- desc: 'Whats in a name '
- desc: Public channel
- desc: encryption
- desc: Comparison of free and open source licences
- desc: Today we learned to free and open source software licence and also discussed
    about Diffie- Hellman key exchange method.
- desc: I learned about the concerns behind deepfakes (digital forgery), as well as
    software patents.
- desc: Concept about whether software patents are important or not .
- desc: One important concept I encountered today was the idea of software patents
    and how it still remains an open issue. They are not granted just for automating
    a task otherwise done by people, and they must have some new element that is the
    invention.
- desc: 'What I learned is that how dangerous digital forgery can be and how it impacts
    the victim of it. Digital forgery, which is deep fake, can bring so much harm
    to an individual. It can take someone''s face without their permission and use
    it to make sexual contents. '
- desc: 'The term "revenge porn", also referred to as "non-consensual pornography"
    or "image-based sexual abuse", was introduced to me today. The publication of
    sexually graphic images or films of someone without that person''s consent is
    known as revenge porn. The phrase refers to a specific situation wherein private
    images are posted online with the intention of harassing and dehumanizing an ex-partner,
    but it is also frequently used incorrectly to refer to any kind of non-consensual
    pornography. '
- desc: digital forgery concept is very intriguing.
- desc: Talked about the Podcast on Deepfakes, concerns of digital Forgery, password
    managers
- desc: about software license
- desc: SIFT

    on it. While I am pretty anti-copyright in a lot of cases (long live the unlicense),
    I think it would be valuable to get some extra opinions! Finding the balance between
    collective good and reward for individual labour would be a very insightful experience.
