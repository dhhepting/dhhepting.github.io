important:
- desc: Today I learnt about sustainability in computing professions.
- desc: 'what DEI stands for: Equity, Diversity, Inclusion '
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: All of the discussed topics today
- desc: The most important topic i encountered today was how important diversity is
    to technology. Diversity and inclusion are important due to innovation and ethical
    reasons
- desc: Regarding inclusion, diversity, and equity and how these concepts help design
    for the most vulnerable user.
- desc: we learned that equity, inclusion and diversity is what helps us create sustainability
    for technology

    for technology as it helps us keep in mind to create technologies for the most
    vulnerable person.
- desc: 'Use of equity in ethics '
- desc: While talking with my group about sustainability, we sparked up a conversation
    about NFTs and how they were very popular a few years ago. I thought it was interesting
    because we both understood what made NFTs appealing while also acknowledge the
    harm they can have on the environment just to produce and maintain.
- desc: "An important point was how planned obsolescence is an unsustainable practice\
    \ for tech professionals. And that I\u2019m just Ken  "

    said about using resources sustainably. The analogy he used was if you use a GB
    for each project but you have a TB of space your space will fill up quite quickly
    and is not sustainably long term. It gave me the perspective to try and allocate
    resources effectively for my projects I can be a sustainable computer professional
    and help contribute to a more sustainable future for computing.  '

    continue to work with great technology, we need find a way to preserve it.
- desc: Today we talked about Sustainability, I think it is very important for computer
    science because we should have it in mind when coding! we should be making sure
    that our coding is sustainable for the future by making code modular, updating
    it regularly, documentation to name a few ways to keep our code sustainable and
    easier to use in the future.

    including Barbie. '
- desc: Today we discussed the topic of sustainabillity and addressing climate in
    tech/computer science. We talked about planned obsolescence and discussed what

    of "How can we incorperate sustainabillity or address climate in other CS classes?".
- desc: 'Today the midterm results were announced '
- desc: An important concept I have discovered today was how we need to make computer
    science classes teach more about efficiency and sustainability.

- desc: Today's meeting consisted of going over the UR Policies, the idea of sustainability
    and avoiding planned obsolescence, Moore's law, Ryan Gosling's performance at
    the Oscars, and EDI hangman. I think the most valuable topic we went over today
    is the idea of sustainability and how we can apply it as computing professionals.
    We were asked if our CS classes could put a bigger emphasis on sustainability
    and I think it is most definitely a concept that has not posed as much of an issue
    before, but could be.
