important:
- desc: Today I learnt about ethics at workplace.
- desc: Risk of technology
- desc: We discussed about whether to extend the response quizzes or not. As well
    as covered some chapter topics about why we should care about ethics
- desc: The most important concept is the importance of ethics in tech and why everyone
    should care about it. Tech influences and directly affects human iteractions as
    more people relies on technologies for everyday use. Therefore following a set
    of code of ethics to prioritize the well being of humans or society as a whole
    is important. In addition  lack of knowldege of ethics code can leave serious
    conseqeuences both financial and legal problems. Recognizing and reporting misconducts
    should be efficient.
- desc: The concept of CARE, Consider Analyze Review Evaluate. Very important to keep
    end users in mind at all times, especially in regards to accessibility.
- desc: The Ethics
- desc: Today, I learned about the importance of ACM ethics in the field of technology.
    ACM ethics emphasizes the responsibility of developers to uphold ethical standards
    in their work. It reminds them to align their creations with societal values and
    consider the wider community's principles and expectations. This promotes a more
    responsible and conscientious technological landscape.
- desc: The concept of respecting privacy.
- desc: we learnt deeply about code of ethics in tech industry.
- desc: I encountered and learned about ethical principles today
- desc: Today we had a guest come in and talk about the CSSS and opportunities for
    CS students. We then watched a video on the importance of ethics and learned about
    the general ethical principles for computing professionals.
- desc: CARE and how ethics are discussed between people.
- desc: 'Why ethics are important and it''s related principles '
- desc: The ethics of developing programs, hardware, and software
- desc: 'ethical side of programming '
- desc: 'ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct '
- desc: code of ethics
- desc: The ACM committee proactive CARE steps were essential blocks for the ethical
    decision making in computer science. It could also be useful to analyze the case
    study furthermore and identify the risks to the decisions made by the Q industry.
- desc: The ACM Ethics
- desc: ACM and IEEE code of ethics
- desc: A framework of ethical principles, assignment, etc.
- desc: Ethics isn't just about feelings, religion, laws, cultural norms, or science;
    it's about figuring out what's right and wrong, even if those things can help
    us make better choices.
- desc: I learned about proactive CARE, which is a useful guideline (set of questions)
    that helps computing professionals make informed decisions. CARE stands for Consider,
    Analyze, Review, and Evaluate.
- desc: 'Framework of ethical analysis '
- desc: One important concept I saw in today's class was how the AMC Code of Ethics
    makes a point in prioritizing confidentiality. As a former office worker, security
    was what I was taught the most at my jobs and the steps necessary to uphold it.
    I would say I am more aware of the dangers of a security breach in a system now
    than I was years ago and I encourage others to do the same.
- desc: 'How the code of ethics is applicable in pretty much every business and that
    ACM membership is available to students '
- desc: There is no specific people to enforce the code of ethics on anyone outside
    of their jurisdiction(ACM and IEEE). So why should anyone listen to them. Anyone
    could easily break the law. Though when you are in a professional field involving
    technology, ACM and IEEE will influence the environment. People will most probably
    be neglectful of something that is not officially recognized as a law.

- desc: "I encountered the concept of breaching private data. This is shocking to\
    \ me of why someone would want to dive into someone else\u2019s data who they\
    \ have no connection to. "
- desc: I encountered in the video we watched today that even if it is not neccessarily
    illegal to use another companies' API's, the code of ethics can still be used
    in court to plead the case for the other company. I didn't realize that code of
    ethics went that deep to where they could be used in court but it is very interesting
    that using the code of ethics in court can be used as a valid argument.

    to look towards it
- desc: Update on csss

    we learned today and also about ACM.

    and ACMS codes of ehtics. '
- desc: about codes of ethics
- desc: In today's class, we had a visit from the Computer Science Student Society,
    and they talked about the upcoming events, including a seminar and a meet and
    greet. We watched a video on ethics, and discussed the importance of it as a class,
    and with our group.
- desc: "An important concept or perspective from today is that when it comes to the\
    \ creation or changing of new technologies, it is important to take into account\
    \ the public\u2019s awareness of the technology\u2019s consequences. As seen from\
    \ the case study, keeping secret the lethality of a company's makings can cause\
    \ many problems ethically and morally. There are a lot of other codes from the\
    \ ACM Code of Ethics that could be applied to many other scenarios as well."
- desc: 'The ACM code of ethics was an important concept we discussed in class. It
    is based around companies and corporations which is something I did not know about.
    They are not Laws but they can be used within lawsuits when dealing with ethical
    analysis of tech companies. '
- desc: I have learned the importance of ethics in any industry we work.
- desc: Today there was a visit from CSSS regarding the upcoming event
- desc: Video about importance of ethical code

    to the computing world. We were informed that regardless of what role we play
    in the workplace, the code of ethics will have an effect on the business. It is
    truly applicable to any field that a person may go into. I am excited to discuss
    it further with my group next class. We have an idea of which point we want to
    argue for the case study, we just need to polish and sharpen it.

    We mainly focused on ACM today and it covers 4 main areas: General Ethical Principles,
    Professional Responsibilities, Professional Leadership Principles, and the Compliance
    with the Codes. I found it very interesting that even in computer science that
    there are ethical rules that must be set in place'
- desc: 'Nothing in particular '
- desc: could not make it class today but went through the notes from friends.
- desc: Ethics
- desc: 'I found out some general ethical principles: Contribute to society and to
    human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing;
    Avoid harm; Be honest and trustworthy; Respect the work required to produce new

    think about the dangerous uses of ai in the upcoming future.
- desc: 'Today we discussed in group about automatedguns and drones should be allowed
    to use in war? '
- desc: One important concept I learned today was the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional
    Conduct. I was able to take note of a variety of general ethics that a computing
    professional should be aware of, including honoring one's confidentiality and
    respecting the work required to produce new ideas/inventions.
- desc: Automated weapons can still be dangerous because AI has no sense of morality,
    therefore it could do harm to innocent people.
- desc: I learned that autonomous weapon systems are any weapons that choose and apply
    force to targets without the assistance of an individual. I oppose Automated Response
    weapons because they are not completely reliable. It poses a danger since it is
    not always totally correct. Furthermore, I believe that humans should always have
    control over technology, not the other way around. As a result, I feel it is extremely
    unsafe to utilize.
