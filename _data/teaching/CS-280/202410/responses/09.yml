important:
- desc: Privacy issues and policies on social media.
- desc: i learned about the tesla recal for their font size of their warning being
    too small.
- desc: The importance of intellectual property and how to protect it
- desc: Everything discussed today is important.
- desc: How small things can impact in long haul, like Tesla's braking system font.
    Which impacted the company a lot and have to recall all their vehicles back.
- desc: Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) -  is an amazing program as it provided a robust
    method of protecting emails, files and basically other forms of a digital information
    through encryptions. As cyber attacks and threats constanlly rising and occurring,
    its serves as a defense and offers data integrity for all the users.
- desc: Regarding the right to be forgotten/deleted on the internet.
- desc: An important perspective I have a encountered today is how important is to
    to thoroughly discuss topics with the groups. It helps for better understanding.
- desc: 'Encryption '
- desc: we have learnt about tesla's recall and online social platform example.
- desc: Today I learned about intellectual property and privacy, moreover we also
    discussed about other social media platforms
- desc: The concept we talked about today was intellectual property and privacy. we
    talked about respecting intellectual protections, and if things like AI should
    be open. We also talked about PGP, and how encryption is a way to protect intellectual
    property.
- desc: That you always need to follow regulations and posted rules or it can back
    fire on you.
- desc: The intresting topic i learned about is the tesla recalling because of its
    font size  Like it was intresting tahy people were not conplaining about the sudden
    braking and driver monitoring alerts but about the font size been usedno mostly
    it was easy to understand
- desc: encryption
- desc: 'Intellectual Property &amp; Privacy '
- desc: acm code of ethics, article of tesla, IPs in Canada
- desc: Data encryption usefulness and the complexity of computation behind such data.
- desc: We encountered how ethical regulations can be important when it comes to the
    design and production of certain things, especially tech and electronic systems.
    We have to make things safe and egnomic in ways that follow regulations so that
    our systems are simple and straightforward to create and operate. Failing to adhere
    to things like this can lead to inneficiency, loss of money, or even injury, death
    and property damage in worse cases.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The ACM code of conduct apply to all aspect of IT and it's really important.
- desc: Encryption tool to protect the privacy and important data of an individual
- desc: Talked about the assignment submission, blown to bits theory, etc.
- desc: 'Prior to today''s class, I have never heard of the concept PGP (pretty good
    privacy). I learned that it is an encryption program that provides secure data
    communication by encrypting/decrypting messages and other confidential information. '
- desc: 'The digital intellectual property '
- desc: Intellectual Property and Privacy
- desc: 'Encryption is imperative to our individuality in the digital world, as it
    protects our digital property, and allows us to benefit from our own ideas. '
- desc: The talk about assignement and there due date
- desc: nothing
- desc: Code of Ethics
- desc: Probably just a more and clear idea about the assignments.
- desc: .
- desc: 'I learned about intellectual property '
- desc: 'Contributing to project that helps the society '
- desc: 'Example of Code of ethics '
- desc: The tesla recall due to font size and how something as little as font size
    is very crucial to ensure safety.
- desc: How important encription is
- desc: I encountered the topic of privacy and how it can be exploited, yet also covered
    up.
- desc: Encrytion is a necessary key to protect your data especially the mobile devices
    that connect to foreign networks.
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today was that platforms have a conflict
    of interest with allowing people to delete their data (deleting accounts) and
    using that data to be sold to advertisers so they can make a profit. I never realized
    that companies often times put up a fight when trying to delete your data because
    in turn they are losing money. The conflict of interest on data often times means
    that user has to be thrown in loops in order for their data to be removed which
    in my opinion is unethical. '
- desc: Acm code of ethics number 3
- desc: 'Infographic '
- desc: Intellectual Property and Privacy
- desc: 'Creating new computing artifact creates vale for society '
- desc: pretty good privacy
- desc: intellectual property and patents
- desc: The importance of encryption and its different uses.
- desc: The concept I encounter today was the dar side of social media which I was
    not aware about until today it has its own benefits and own disadvantages
- desc: 'Today we talked about a question: "Do we have a right to be forgotten?".
    I think this question is quite significant in todays world because now matter
    what you post, it stays on the internet forever. Usually you are able to delete
    stuff from your accounts and you can even fully remove your account but regardless
    information about your account, posts, photos will forever be on the internet. '
- desc: ai technology changes human beings
- desc: I learned about security
- desc: The important concept that I really noticed today was the fact that business
    models that companies use today rely on selling the users data, which makes it
    alot harder for these companies to change there models to protect the users data
    and to make sure that the pockets of the higher ups are lined with enough cash.
- desc: 'that technology does not have to be necessarily faulty to be recalled. This
    is shown in the latest Tesla''s recall, and shows how there are other variables
    that go into ensuring a technology can be used safely and for its intended use. '
- desc: We learned how to brainstorm about which general ethical principles apply
    to certain situations.
- desc: IP and Privacy
- desc: I found myself leaving class with the thoughts of right to erasure and how
    they social media platforms like Facebook make it super hard to delete your data.  Really
    makes me wonder how we haven't had the right to erasure since the beginning.
- desc: I learned that even the smallest design choices can lead to the biggest problems
    such as the Tesla recall with font size
- desc: We talked about the different ways encryption is used in our life and the
    pros and cons of patents.
- desc: Intellectual Property and Privacy
- desc: 'Today we saw an video and discuss about the deadline of assignment '
- desc: An important concept i learned today was the IP in Canada
- desc: Everything
- desc: Regarding Tesla recall

    assignments
- desc: 'About assignment '
- desc: I think it was about Tesla's latest new aout the font size of breaking.
- desc: 'something related to tesla vehicles and detail explanation on regulations
    by the proffesor in today''s lecture. '
- desc: 'About the teslas latest screwup in the font size of the breaking system '
- desc: 'Firstly we decided the dates of assignments and then we discussed about encryption '
- desc: "In today\u2019s class, we discussed what the next few weeks/ classes will\
    \ be about. We discussed our upcoming assignments and midterm, their content and\
    \ the due dates for them. We also discussed the concept of \u201Cintellectual\
    \ property and privacy\u201D as well as a class. "
- desc: An important concept encountered today is that there are multiple ways of
    claiming or keeping intellectual property digitally. There are things like creative
    commons, patents, copyright laws, etc.
- desc: 'I learned about encryption and information regarding assignments '
- desc: 'Today we discussed about the deadlines of the assignment '
- desc: 'When discussing patents today, it reminded me of Shark Tank where you need
    a patent to protect your intellectual property/creation. It is interesting to
    see how this concept translates to technology as well. '
- desc: Platforms on social media
- desc: nope there was nothing important
- desc: How important it is for us to encrypt our things.
- desc: I got to know the concept on encryption and also got to the pattern of midterm
    and how the questions will be molded.
- desc: Intellectual property + privacy
- desc: 'Explanation on Intellectual Property and Piracy by professor and details
    over midterm.   '
- desc: Today's important idea is the question, do we have a right to be forgotten?
    This is a consequence of technology that we are only beginning to see. Why should
    there be policies or requirements for me to opt out? The Code of Ethics briefly
    mentions honouring confidentiality (Principle 1.1), but is that enough? Should
    there be a law dedicated to our right to be forgotten?
- desc: The creatore"democratizing" film making with pro-sumer equipment and shorting
    schedule
- desc: An important perspective I encountered in class today is the question (Do
    we have the right to be forgotten)?
- desc: IP in canada
- desc: The concept of encryption and how encryption has been restricted and liberated
    to the public

    to me
- desc: Tesla recall was the most interesting for me
- desc: 'Focused on lectures can teach you anything '
- desc: More concepts regarding ethics with electric car as example+idea of intellectual
    property
- desc: An important concept I encountered today was IP and how it is the abbreviation
    for Intellectual Property. How we need to encrypt basically everything (devices)
    to keep our privacy; if not, our information and what we do on the internet is
    out in the open for everyone to see
- desc: 'That fewer people than I thought use encryption '
- desc: People need to consider all the issues when releasing software
- desc: I completely understood the assignment part.
- desc: From viewing the Tesla story from today, the thing that stood out to me was
    that regulations are dealt with more seriously than I had previously thought
- desc: Respecting privacy in computing means safeguarding personal information and
    only using it with permission. It involves collecting only necessary data and
    keeping it secure to uphold individuals' rights to privacy.
- desc: Encryption and Ciphers
- desc: Work expended adds value to society and therefore work should be respected
- desc: I learned quite a bit
- desc: IP in Canada
- desc: encryption
- desc: 'Assignment '
- desc: 'i did not see anything to be important , per my thinking '
- desc: "I got to know about platforms like facebook have a conflict of interest because\
    \ their basic models rely on other\u2019s  data to be sold to advertisers."
- desc: "Data encryption, how to protect user\u2019s data from being accessed by outsiders\
    \ and how corporations must work with user\u2019s data with privacy and protection"
- desc: I got to know an science fiction movies The Creator and I also learned about
    intellectual property in canada

- desc: today's class was very interesting.
- desc: Intellectual Property and Privacy
- desc: I get to know that a small issue can create big problem in this world like
    Tesla experience .
- desc: 'today we discussed about a little about encryption and also about assignment '
- desc: 'Today in class we had discussion about encryption and assignment discussion '
- desc: right of being forgotten
- desc: Nothing
- desc: I became familiar with the concept of encryption and understood the pattern
    of the midterm, including how the questions will be structured.
- desc: I learnt about Intellectual property privacy
- desc: Intellectual property plus privacy
- desc: About assignments and sample inforgraphic
- desc: "I learned about the significance of Tesla\u2019s technology, and the concerns\
    \ that come with it, for example, coding self driving: How does the car know when\
    \ to stop (safely) if there is an obstacle on the road?"
- desc: Due dates of assignments
- desc: Recall of tesla vehicle

    vehicles, can cause huge safety issues, and can raise concerns about ethics.
- desc: I learned about conflicts of interest when it comes to social media platforms
    collecting data and users that wish to delete their data from that platform.
- desc: PGP - Pretty Good Privacy, Do we had a right to be forgotten?, Intellectual
    property and privacy.

    misused.
- desc: I learned the concept about the creator who creates this codes and softwares
    for the big companies like tesla and the privacy and encryptions for the applications
    we use for social media.
- desc: 'One important concept I encountered today is the ethical principle of respecting
    privacy. In order to respect the intellectual property and personal information
    of others, computing professionals must only collect what is necessary. The data
    they collect must not only be outlined, but must also be used for legitimate ends
    in respect towards the user''s rights and the computing professional''s responsibilities. '
- desc: I learned that encryption is important in our society to prevent datas from
    being stolen or deleted permanently.
- desc: "Today, I learned that encryption is the method of encoding data so that it\
    \ is concealed from or unavailable to unauthorised users. It helps to safeguard\
    \ private information and sensitive data, as well as improves communication security\
    \ among mobile devices and servers. A comprehensive encryption system will safeguard\
    \ private information at all stages of its\_process,\_ensuring that any files\
    \ or documents are always protected from data theft or destruction."

    of AI, most people that are getting affected are writers, artist, and singers.
    I wonder what forms of technology can help them protect their intellectual properties
- desc: Encryption was an interesting topic
- desc: Nothing in particular. Kind of burnt out at the moment.
- desc: Patents

- desc: I would like to start more of a conversation on artificial intelligence portrayed
    in the movie "The Creator" mentioned in class. The movie seems try and humanize
    AI and portray it as a force for good. However, I personally think this could
    also be a message Disney might be pushing to convince people to use AI. This is
    dangerous because if this happens, Disney and other companies may start implementing
    AI to use for doing their work for shareholders.

- desc: I would definitely like to glean a little bit more info on the relationship
    between personal privacy (encryption) and the need for societal safety (surveillance).
    The crypto wars part of blown to bits was really cool, and I think that having
    a bit more discussion and debate on the topic would yield opinions that would
    be insightful to compare.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: "I would like to know more about the idea of do we have a right to be forgotten.\
    \ I think it is an interesting concept because of the different views from a personal\
    \ and company standpoint. The companies have a conflict of interest because they\
    \ want to keep the data for future uses but the person who wants to be forgotten\
    \ doesn\u2019t want them to keep it."
- desc: none
- desc: Different types of encryption,
- desc: 'Yes I would be instead to know act the recall for Tesla to its font size
    it seemed to be intrestering topic to learn about '
- desc: More about AI technology
- desc: I want to learn more about security

    shaped by the choices of our predeccesors allowing our data and information to
    be sold at the rate it is in the current era.
- desc: other cases where technology had to be recalled due to mistakes that aren't
    related to the performance of the technology.
- desc: It would be interesting to learn more about how certain ethical standards
    affect businesses such as Tesla hacving to recall their cars due to the font being
    to small on the braking system.

    \ compared to someone who chooses not to use it. Is it possible to still see a\
    \ person\u2019s data even though they encrypt their information?"
- desc: I would like to know more about the policies of keeping user data. The concept
    of wanting to be forgotten or removed from the internet or digitally is not too
    uncommon, so I would like to know if there are any general policies or if they
