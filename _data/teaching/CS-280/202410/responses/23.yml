important:
- desc: Today I learnt about Human Team by Douglas Rushkoff.
- desc: When David Rushkoff said that Social media doesn't connect people but its
    about using our data to predict/ influence our future behavior.
- desc: not really
- desc: The most important topic/perspective in todays class was the awareness regarding
    digital scam. Digital scams are rampant in todays world, many scammer use tech
    and AI to scam people nowadays through phone calls and emails. It is important
    to address such issues such that people would be aware in these situations.
- desc: Regarding the mentality of the billionaires in control of the tech market,
    how they would rather build a bunker than fix their problems
- desc: Team Human
- desc: Team Human" in the digital future
- desc: 'we encountered Multi factor authentication '
- desc: Today we learned about computer crimes and security policies.
- desc: Team Human and watch 1 TEDx video
- desc: Just discussed about some topics
- desc: information safety
- desc: Optimization  technology  for human  future  is a important  perspective  I
    have encountered
- desc: Team Human
- desc: "How companies are trying to get people\u2019s data in more humane ways making\
    \ it seem that they are using that for the betterment but instead keeping the\
    \ same goal to use that data for their stakeholders. "
- desc: ' Team Human, the concept of incorporating technology to our daily life but
    not allowing technology to admired Humanity. '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The fact that AI or social media is not really the problem but how we react
    to social media or AI
- desc: what team human is standing against
- desc: "We talked about measures that can be taken by both individuals and organizations,\
    \ including governments, to prevent or mitigate the undesirable effects of computer\
    \ crimes and identity theft, Fermat\u2019s last theorem "
- desc: Individuals should use strong passwords and avoid clicking on suspicious links,
    while organizations should regularly update their software and provide cybersecurity
    training to employees. Governments can enact laws to regulate data handling and
    collaborate with law enforcement agencies to investigate computer crimes.
- desc: 'Fundamental attributes of social media that effect society '
- desc: During our discussion for what we can do to increase security at the university,
    one idea that came to mind for me was writing our passwords for our accounts in
    a notebook instead of online. That way, in the end that you get hacked, the hacker
    won't be able to have easy access to all of your passwords.
- desc: "An important concept from today\u2019s class was considering how the way\
    \ society has changed with the evolution of technology means that people now use\
    \ the internet for basic socialization, like finding a romantic partner, which\
    \ makes catfishing and other scams possible and prevalent. "
- desc: "Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem"
- desc: how to treat your fellow human and mindset
- desc: Humane technology movement can be perceived in the same light as "cage free
    chickens," where they are kept as nicely as possible before being sent to slaughter
- desc: I found it was really important that we learned about digital privacy and
    how the more we are using digital technology, the more information we are basically
    giving away to be used against us. We are not really the consumers but rather
    we are the product and we are essentially being tricked by companies in order
    to provide them with the most possible value.
- desc: nothing
- desc: The different the impact of the .com boom
- desc: Being human in the digital future
- desc: two factor authentication
- desc: Virtual reality or argumented reality
- desc: Fermat's last theorem
- desc: I learned about the dangers of the internet and AI
- desc: "An important concept I encountered today was through the team human video.\
    \ The thought of changing technology to benefit humans rather than to scare humans\
    \ of technology is interesting but with that comes the fact of a loss of funding\
    \ because you are no longer exploiting people and their data. If we found a way\
    \ to monetize \u201Chuman friendly\u201D tech I believe the digital world would\
    \ become a place where people wouldn\u2019t have to feel like they need to delete\
    \ their entire online presence due to harmful sites. "
- desc: I saw how the elites feel they have no power even though they are a big factor
    in regards to our future
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: 'The idea that technology is using us and we are not using technology, and
    the idea that technology gets smarter about us as we get dumber about it.  '
- desc: 'Computer crimes '
- desc: 'internet security '
- desc: '2 factor authenticator '
- desc: "Don\u2019t provide important info to an unimportant website. This can mitigate\
    \ undesirable effects of computer crimes and identify theft."
- desc: Humane Technology
- desc: cybercrime, and discussing how to prevent certain online crimes
- desc: How the undesirable effects of computers interact with our lives.
- desc: important topic today was the ted talk about How to be "Team Human" in the
    digital future
- desc: Today I learned I few ways to keep myself safer when it comes to identity
    theft
- desc: 'An important concept we encountered today was computer crimes: scams. Ome
    thing that will help prevent any kind of scams is not giving out any personal
    information to anybody on the internet even if you know them. I have had people
    try to mimic a profile of a family member and ask me for money and I knew right
    away because it was an entire different account. In conclusion dont give info '
- desc: '1'
- desc: I learned about how detrimental identity theft is.
- desc: The fact that capitalism influences so much about our way of life, even the
    way we perceive education.
- desc: The fact that humans are more valued for our data than our creativity, and
    we need to be on team human for a brighter future involving more human creativity.
- desc: Team Humane, thedailyscam and discussion about crimes and identity theft
- desc: How we got to practice in class testing the reliability and trust of a site
    (thedailyscam)
- desc: We talked about how to avoid computer crimes or identity theft. We also watched
    a couple videos that went into how we should be working together as humans and
    building a "social immune system"."
- desc: "from the ted talk and during class that education wasn't always intertwined\
    \ with getting a job, also that scams usualy put up a fa\xE7ade of friendliness\
    \ to hook victims "
- desc: Team Human
- desc: 'We discussed about news, and some article topics '
- desc: I learnt about Fermat's last theorem.
- desc: ' measures that can be taken to identify theft and computer crimes'
- desc: 'Yes'
- desc: I think it was about the grades of assignment 2.
- desc: Security Policies, Laws and Computer Crimes
- desc: Today we discussed some more in the news sections.
- desc: "Today we discussed the concepts of security policies, laws and computer crimes.\
    \ We watched a view videos of Douglas Rushkoff, and learned  about why we should\
    \ all be team Human. We read about ferman\u2019s last theorem, and we also had\
    \ a discussion about how we can save ourselves from computer crimes, as individuals\
    \ and organizations."
- desc: An important idea from Douglas Rushkoff's TEDTalk, was that he says that big
    tech and billionaires have hijacked the digital future, using it only for profits
    and power.  Instead, we need to use technology for human connection and creativity
    and create a world we do not need to "escape from".
- desc: We discussed about articles, team human
- desc: "The video mentions how the purpose of education isn\u2019t to get a job.\
    \ Which I thought was a really important but rare perspective in today\u2019s\
    \ society "
- desc: I learned that there are more ways to protect ourselves online from identity
    theft and computer crimes. Some people will be loose on their information they
    give out.
- desc: Nothing
- desc: Various things about AI
- desc: In the news topic was covered
- desc: Should all education just be  focused on procducing job ready works?
- desc: we watched a ted talk and you asked us if we were team human or not but I
    am still very confused.
- desc: Today's important concept included TEDTalks by Douglas Rushkoff, both regarding
    how to be 'Team Human' in the midst of our digital future. This overlooked how
    humans compare themselves to technology and how to combat weaponized media. Each
    day that passes, we let technology get smarter about us and we get dumber about
    it. An important lesson I learned today is to be cautious of how I react to media
    because it is easily manipulated and I don't really know the reality of it.
- desc: 'Nothing really '
- desc: 'Social media '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Discussions of areas of concentration for finals
- desc: "fermat\u2019s last theorem"
- desc: are websites trustworthy?
- desc: TedX Talks
- desc: confidencial data
- desc: 'No'
- desc: We watched a couple TED videos in class today
- desc: Mostly about the ted talk and other sites
- desc: Humans no longer valued as thinking beings but as sources of data in todays
    online world.
- desc: Today we talked about 2 TedTalks on Team Human by Rushkoff where he urges
    us to re-evaluate our relationship with technology and to be on Team Human to
    ensure that our digital future is shaped by human needs and values rather than
    economic values. Another thing we talked about was the Fermat's Last Theorem and
    how machines are now approaching the challenge of solving Fermat's Last Theorem
    which had previously been a problem for many mathematicians..
- desc: being human in a digital world
- desc: A perspective that I encountered today was the thought of keeping humanity
    by keeping technology beneath us and not have it become more powerful than us
- desc: Security Policies, Laws and Computer Crimes
- desc: '- We have to stop using technology to optimize human beings for the market
    - instead, we should be optimizing technology for the human future - there should
    be a PLACE for humans in the digital future, we are moving too far away as we
    evolve - human beings should be interconnected with each other, having evolved
    ways of collaborating and communicating'
- desc: To be on team human
- desc: 'Ferman''s last theorem '
- desc: I got to know about team human.
- desc: The digital architecture must be optimized to help the human future rather
    than optimizing humans for the digital market. We need to build a good response
    to the digital marketing tactics of big corporations
- desc: In a world of technology, humans are no longer valued for creativity, but
    rather for our data and usefulness to the tech world.
- desc: "Today\u2019s lecture was interesting "
- desc: Security Policies, Laws and Computer
- desc: that education used to not be tied to a career or employment
- desc: ' what are some measures that can be taken by both individuals and organizations,
    including governments, to prevent or mitigate the undesirable effects of computer
    crimes and identity theft?'
- desc: Should all education just be  focused on procducing job ready works?

- desc: 'fermat''s last theorem '
- desc: Nothing
- desc: Measures to prevent or mitigate the undesirable effects of computer crimes
    and identity theft?
- desc: Should all education just be  focused on procducing job ready works?
- desc: I learned about the different ways individuals and organizations can prevent
    computer crimes and identity theft.
- desc: we watched a how to be human ted talk which spoke about the doomsday and we
    also found out who partook in april fools !!
- desc: 'Today I learned about a term ''team human'' from different videos we watched
    today. '
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today was the idea of Team Human and that
    we should be designing technology for the interests of the people. Rather than
    focusing on making profit and optimizing people for the market, we should be building
    a future in which humans can properly connect with each other and be able to preserve
    the value of our uniqueness/worth. '
- desc: We should be Team Human when making decisions about technology.
- desc: That I am team Human
