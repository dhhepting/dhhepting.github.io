difficult:
- desc: No, but today's topics made me think differently about using technology.
- desc: 'no'
- desc: What the group assignment is unclear
- desc: everything was understandable from today's class.
- desc: Today's class was all about small updates and breif discussion on assignment-everything
    was understandable. I am sorry to hear for your loss Dr. Hepting and appreciate
    you coming in and taking our class.
- desc: Talking about the koans in depth really helped be better understand them,
    so nothing was difficult to understand today.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: So far everything is clear for me
- desc: 'Nothing too difficult '
- desc: 'no'
- desc: Koan fifth, Bits Move faster than Thoughts i would love to have a break of
    this Koan.
- desc: I am not able to understand the point "Bits Move Faster Than Thought". How
    are the bits and thoughts related?
- desc: 'No'
- desc: The content we learned today was straight forward. The onlt thing difficult
    to understand was the group stuff. did one person have to post from behalf of
    their whole group or did everyone post for themselves. but this issue got solved
    later
- desc: 'The social context of blown to bits '
- desc: nope
- desc: nothing
- desc: 'I had trouble understanding what you were saying in class, it was loud and
    maybe the mic wasn''t working. Also, I''m confused what we will be doing with
    our groups and how that will be reflected in our grades. Are the assignments for
    this class to be done in these groups? '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No.
- desc: not particularly difficult but interesting to hear others understandings
- desc: No, everything is perfect for me
- desc: 'Nothing really '
- desc: The fact that there really isnt any way data can be deleted, it is ever going
    to be present one way or the other
- desc: How different laws will be implemented in the future to regulate ai
- desc: 'No'
- desc: "Just don\u2019t understand why we couldn\u2019t have smaller groups. "
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Not really
- desc: No, everything was clear.
- desc: 'not really '
- desc: the sixth Koam was a little confusing.
- desc: Not really.
- desc: it was somewhat difficult to understand the negative effects on some of the
    7 truths as some are very ambiguous and paradoxical so far at this era in the
    digital world
- desc: 'I found  some of the truths thats the koans difficult to understand '
- desc: Not really, it was just a bit difficult to hear you with all the annoying
    chit chatting going on
- desc: What you were announcing at the end.
- desc: Something difficult to understand was the point of Koans seven truths about
    bits
- desc: Nothing was difficult
- desc: 'No'
- desc: There was a slight learning curve since the wiki page was a new concept for
    me, although I did manage to edit a post on there without issue.
- desc: It was difficult to listen to professor in the middle of group discussions.
- desc: I had no trouble understanding the content presented today
- desc: 'Nothing '
- desc: The things you said at the near the end of the class as people were talking
    over you.
- desc: I am not able to understand why we need group, it is difficult to coordinate
    with everyone and discuss everything
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Somethings but I'll go over them again
- desc: what does koans actually means?
- desc: Illustrative Learning Outcomes
- desc: nothing was difficult to understand today as it was very easy class.
- desc: Not at all, in-fact it was interesting and absolute pleasure from learnings
    from the course.
- desc: 'Risk about the human intelligence '
- desc: No everything was pretty much straight and easy to understand.
- desc: Not really as the terminology and language of the koanes were explained clearly
    and easy to understand.
- desc: No, everything made sense to me, especially after the seven koans were discussed
    as a group.
- desc: Group assignment topics
- desc: Today we discussed about the few topics, but the fact that how to submit the
    discussion in the urcourses was really confusing. I wished everything was explained
    in more details.
- desc: 'Most of the Koans made sense to me however; number 5 is not as clear. "More
    of the same is a whole new thing", in my opinion is arguable. More of one thing
    to me in any situation is repetition. However, you could think of it as binary
    sets of 1''s and 0''s where the more of them you have does reate a new meaning.
    I found it difficult at first to understand but in computer context, in a way
    makes more sense. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Nothing was difficult to understand today.
- desc: Nopes, everything was straight forward.
- desc: no, today was like discussing what i knew about the topic.
- desc: "No I don\u2019t find anything difficult"
- desc: I think I am still just confused about how we are going to do the discussions
    with our group, but I assume that will be clarified in the next class.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: all 7 sentense is really deep
- desc: social context of a given design and its implementation.
- desc: Wiki Teams
- desc: Not really on the surface level, I am sure as we delve deeper into the complications
    of morality in code it will get harder
- desc: 'no'
- desc: 'Koams: perfection is power because no one is perfect '
- desc: Not today thankfully.
- desc: I found a few of the discussion questions to be very broad and open to interpretation
    rather than questions with a definitive answer to them.
- desc: Nothing much because we did not start anything new today
- desc: 'No'
- desc: The idea of technology being able to affect various ethnic groups negatively.
- desc: There was nothing difficult to understand today, all was good
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Everything was straight forward and easy to understand.
- desc: No, it was pretty straightforward
- desc: 'No I understand for today. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: No, as the class discussions allowed me to feel fulfilled in my understanding
    of the lecture
- desc: Not today.
- desc: Assignment topic and what to do in assignment
- desc: Perhaps the group submission through but we will figure it out among the group
- desc: 'knowing about bit , it was not that much difficult but confusing '
- desc: what are paradoxes.More of the same can be a whole new thing was the topic
    noone answered about if I am not wron and even if they answered about it,it was
    unclear to me.
- desc: There was 8 topic todays and we have to discuss any one of them with our group.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: "Yes may be the 3 rd point of perfection is normal I didn\u2019t understand\
    \ this concept."
- desc: 'Nope, All went good '
- desc: "Not really, we haven\u2019t discussed anything complicated today so it was\
    \ easy session."
- desc: 'no'
- desc: The class discussions were a little bit confusing at first because we did
    not know exactly what we should be talking about.
- desc: No I didn't find anything difficult.
- desc: I did not found anything difficult to understand
- desc: Yes, it was about the making of group for discussions.
- desc: about the uploading the summary of todays group activity.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: It was difficult to understand the purpose of making groups.
- desc: 'I didnt feel that any of concept were difficult. '
- desc: Nothing
- desc: No I was able to understand the lecture.
- desc: No, not really.
- desc: 'no everything went smooth '
- desc: 'Nothing '
- desc: How deficits in diversity and accessibility in computing affect society and
    what steps can be taken to improve diversity and accessibility in computing
- desc: 'Not really. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: "It was a good lecture today it wasn\u2019t difficult."
- desc: not really
- desc: Notreallly.
- desc: There wasn't anything difficult to understand in today's lecture.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Something I found difficult to understand was how a koan can be considered
    a paradox, and how these paradoxes apply to the digital world.
- desc: It was pretty easy since we had alot of stuff to read and follow along with.
- desc: 'No'
- desc: 'no '
- desc: I was not clearly able to understand about where we have to post the meetings
    wiki group discussion.
- desc: Nothing was difficult to understand today; everything was easy to grasp.
- desc: Once we have our group and we decided what topic we wanna do how do we inform
    that to you?
- desc: 'Not at all, each topic was easy to understand '
- desc: I feel that the koan number 3 was little difficult for me to understand.
important:
- desc: I was introduced to Koans in today's class.
- desc: how to identify the risk and reward on different concept.
- desc: About making groups
- desc: ' powe have learn about 7 types of kaons today from blown to bits. we have
    discussed about the topics in group of 8 people.'
- desc: Today I encountered social context and breif discussion on koans. Also got
    to know that from now on we will be using wiki comment section for group discussion
    posts on koans
- desc: 'The theme for today''s class was social context. We talked about the 7 truths
    about bits known as koans and then got into smaller groups to further discuss
    a koan or two in depth. We discussed the 6th koan, which was "nothing goes away".
    This concept was interesting to talk about in depth because it gave me the realization
    that once your information is fed into a database, it never goes away. '
- desc: We went over the Koans and made group discussion to understand and write something
    in the meetings wiki
- desc: Today we selected group member for our group project.
- desc: It was interesting hearing the perspective of the group who talked about how
    machines take 0s and 1s but the engineers/developers use their creativity to turn
    this into so many other things
- desc: Form a group and choose subs
- desc: koans paradox
- desc: I was intrigued at how much technology revolves around processing power. Our
    group discussions lead us to conclude that almost everything in electronic systems
    can be made more or less efficient due to the processing power of it's parts.
    Its also interesting to see despite technological innovation seeming to slow in
    the public perspective, Mohr's law is actually getting faster in that we are packing
    2x the transistors on the same size die in around 18 months, instead of every
    2 years now.
- desc: As a group 5 member in learnt the third Koan as state of Greed as people want
    get enough of the current technology and always wants to stay current.
- desc: Human intelligence is at risk and is not a risk itself
- desc: We talked what was the reason of cancellation of class on Tuesday, about the
    assignment which will be discussed more next class, and had a group discussion
    on the topic of the day
- desc: 'Human Intelligence: NOT a risk: is AT risk. 7 koans: Your computer creates
    an illusion that contains photographs &amp; letters, but it really just contains
    a bunch of bits patterned in ways you can''t see. Cand networks work differently.
    Every copy is perfect. The web is growing and has put a lot information online
    when people need information. They search it up before asking anyone. Computer
    speed is measured by the number of basic operations performed in a second. Data
    is kept forever, what you put on the i'
- desc: 'I found Koan 3 interesting. It states that "there is want in the midst of
    plenty", and I think it is referring to the explosion of information we have in
    today''s digital world. Although we have "more" accessibility to a lot of things,
    it doesn''t necessarily mean we should be satisfied as it could have some drawbacks
    such as invasion of privacy and becoming imprisoned to our personal filter bubble. '
- desc: 'Seven truths about bits '
- desc: While conversing with my group regarding the 6th koan of technology(Nothing
    Goes Away) someone brought up social media as an example and how personal information
    can be used by others for the purpose of cyberbullying. This to me is incredibly
    important because with the internet having millions of users interacting with
    each other, anyone could have hundreds or thousands of bullies harassing them
    which, of course, places more severe consequences on one's mental health.
- desc: 'i enjoyed the discussion on bits '
- desc: about the group meeting but class was rather rowdy today.
- desc: 'During our group discussion, I gained valuable insight into the fourth koan;
    "processing is power". Processing speed allows individuals or groups to gain traction
    on their competition by producing large computational results quickly. If an antagonistic
    group is provided with cutting edge processing speed, the results will likely
    be catastrophic. '
- desc: 'Discussion about the seven koan between the group member '
- desc: "Those topics from today\u2019s class for group assignment. "
- desc: i encountered my group mates unique viewpoints on the readings we discussed
    in class
- desc: I got to learn about Koan from the bool blown to bits
- desc: The internet as a human right opened up new ways to look at a lot of issues.
- desc: "We discussed the points from the Blown to Bits, and talked about how computers\
    \ will always be perfect and that making mistakes isn\u2019t something computers\
    \ can do necessarily. "
- desc: I encountered that of each of the seven Koans have many similarities to each
    other but also a lot of unique arguments for each Koan. And everyone in our group
    had a different perspective for the Koans we covered.
- desc: 'The idea with the 6th option. Nothing will ever be erased or disappear and
    we are all recorded throughout our lives. '
- desc: Context aware computing
- desc: 'The most important concept encountered today was the idea that human intelligence
    is at risk. With the rapid development of machines, people are relying more on
    AI to solve their issues, and they are putting less effort into learning to solve
    their own issues. '
- desc: I learnt about the koans used in the book "blown to bit" and our group focuses
    on koan 6 which talked about nothing Goes away
- desc: That the human intelligence is at risk (not a risk ) due to the crazy development
    of Artificial intelligence
- desc: I learnt about the book " blown to bit" and the koans used in the book
- desc: 'Our group topic, koan #4: Processing is Power. While the term "koan" is meant
    to mean that the idea is not yet fully developed, I think that this particular
    mantra stands on it''s own. The use of processing power is limited only by our
    imagination with it, given that we have the proper I/O to interface between the
    physical world and our silicon-built logical one.'
- desc: "The important concept that I have learned today is how there is wants in\
    \ a world of plenty. What I understand from this is that there is a lot of information\
    \ out there, however due to the amount, sometimes there isn\u2019t accurate/ referenced\
    \ information. If I wanted to learn about current events, I would have to cross\
    \ reference articles for accuracy. The want in these types of information is accurate\
    \ and non-misleading information, in a world full of information."
- desc: "Encountered the importance of having discussions and how they can open up\
    \ different viewpoints that I haven\u2019t thought of before. Really helps getting\
    \ your mind thinking when bouncing ideas off of other people."
- desc: 'Social context. Discussed about Koans in group discussions. '
- desc: From the book "blown to bits" and its 7 truths. How these truths describe
    a world that has yet to emerge. but as we see today more of these truths are becoming
    reality
- desc: The important concept or perspective I encountered was the seven truths of
    bit which is koans
- desc: The different koans that exist in technology
- desc: The idea that we lose our privacy as technology has advanced.
- desc: 'An important concept I learned was Moore''s law which describes that the
    growth of transistors doubles every two years '
- desc: 'Today, we focused on the 7 Koans in chapter 1 of blown to bits. Mainly, my
    group focused on the 4th rule/principle which was processing is power. We each
    had our own perspective on it and something that I noted on is that I agreed that
    processing is power but I also thought that power is processing. '
- desc: I learned about how important group communication is
- desc: That technology could be reduced to just bits
- desc: 'During the group project we encountered a number of examples of Koan 6: Nothing
    goes away.'
- desc: We discussed about Koans (from Blown to Bits).
- desc: "I found it interesting hearing what my groupmates had to share for the \u201C\
    Processing is Power\u201D koan compared to how I interpreted it."
- desc: 'Today I gained a new perspective of how computers are ran by 0''s and 1''s,
    making them unable to do many things. However, the saying "its all just bits"
    is an oversimplification because humans are able to turn these 0''s and 1''s into
    much more than machine code '
- desc: We discussed in groups and mine explored the concept of everything just being
    bits and how the complex world we see through computers is really just an illusion
    of bits.
- desc: The KOANS, from blown to bits
- desc: Our group discussion. Something that stood out to me was the discussion about
    how we have lost our fundamental rights to security and privacy.
- desc: We encountered some koans today which we need to discuss in the next meeting,
    and few things about the groups
- desc: Social implications in a hyper-networked world where the capabilities and
    impact of social media, artificial intelligence and computing in general are rapidly
    evolving.
- desc: My new team and the project
- desc: Social context
- desc: Social concept 2023
- desc: I think today's concept provide understanding between technology and society,the
    ethical consideration. These topics are important to understand.
- desc: As per the understanding in todays lecture was a detailed discussion from
    the topic given by our professor and had a conversation with new team members.
    Also, risk and rewards have vital role in many different aspects of formats as
    per I believe encountered today.
- desc: 'Internet , artificiale intelligence, social implications '
- desc: Today we decided our groups for projects and we learned about Koans, Impact
    of computing technologies and other stuff.
- desc: Today we got to learn about different koanes in computer systems and in particular
    we discussed about the processing is Power koan in group.
- desc: Today we discussed the seven Koan's of bits. This came from chapter 1 of the
    textbook. After reviewing each of the seven koans, we discussed one of the seven
    koans. My group chose the sixth koan, "nothing goes away". We discussed how once
    something is on the internet, or any information is given, unless stated the data
    will never be deleted.
- desc: Political and Cultural idealogies on Social implications (Group assignment
    discussion)
- desc: I never heard the term "koans". Got to know what koans really means and it
    was really interesting.
- desc: Learned about Moore's Law and discussed that while it still holds it's plateaued
    a bit.
- desc: Today we discussed about groups of 8 people to discuss any one of the seven
    topics of the book blown to bits. Also we covered the reason for class cancellation
    on 16th January and we discussed more about humar intelligence was  risk or is
    at risk.
- desc: 'Our group talked about how nothing ever gets deleted from the internet and
    the implications of that. Users are required to blindly trust companies with their
    information to access their services. '
- desc: 'Today I learned how much society affects technology and technological advancement.
    For example, when speaking about exponential growth, people can exponentially
    explode technology. This leads to constant change within technological fields. '
- desc: Social context and how it affects me.
- desc: I learned about bits today. Before i dont had that much information about
    bits , i only thing i know about bits was that bits are binary digits. But today
    i learned its uses, how bits works.
- desc: we did a group discussion today.
- desc: Today we discuss 7 topic from book of blown to bits. In that also we discuss
    about power of processing.
- desc: "In our group's discussion today about the koan, It's All Just Bits, it was\
    \ brought up that our computers are essentially made up of 0s and 1s, it\u2019\
    s the programmers and developers (and programs) that give these 0s and 1s meaning.\
    \ As well, I was introduced to the Humane Tech philosophy."
- desc: 'The 7 truth''s about a bit '
- desc: Social context
- desc: team work, and others thought
- desc: I think differences in access to digital technology resources and its resulting
    ramifications for gender, class, ethnicity, geography, and underdeveloped countries,
    this was the topic i felt important today in lecture.
- desc: 'We got koans today, seven of them, Prof told us to divide into group of 8(7-9)
    people, we discussed about the paradoxes and then some updates about wiki '
- desc: "As my group talked about it, an important concept i encountered today was\
    \ \"It\u2019s All Just Bits\"  "
- desc: interaction design
- desc: "Koams it\u2019s all just bits "
- desc: An important concept I learned today was the kaoms that I discussed throughout
    my group. Hearing multiple groups members ideas adding to the discussion really
    opened a new perspective for me.
- desc: The important concept I encountered was the Koan questions from "Blown to
    Bits" and the discussions I had with my group.
- desc: the discussion I had with my group was the most fruitful in todays class in
    my opinion because I got to know about their perspective
- desc: Risk taker can achieve anything in their life
- desc: The idea of the implementation of technology and internet in allowing for
    more democracy, and how communications greaty aids a lot of humanitarian aspects
    of society.
- desc: "Today we made groups and talked about the koans. My group discussed about\
    \ 6) Nothing Goes Away. In 6), we talked about how everything on the internet\
    \ leaves digital footprints so where you have been, what you have brought, etc.\
    \ We also talked about the concept of loyalty rewards from stores where we think\
    \ they\u2019re giving us discount as loyal customers and making us think it is\
    \ due to their appreciation , but in reality it's to collect out data and buying\
    \ patterns"
- desc: "The world is still developing but it hasn\u2019t fully emerged "
- desc: Today I really opened my eyes on how everything is truly just bits and how
    powerful a bunch of bits can be.
- desc: 'Today we got into groups and discussed one of the 7 koans of our choosing.
    Getting into groups to discuss was a lot of fun. '
- desc: From the koans given, I had a healthy discussion about the topics with my
    group
- desc: "We did discuss about It\u2019s all just bits and I think it is the most importance\
    \ thing I learned today. "
- desc: "The important concept i learn today was about the koans of bits in which\
    \ it has 7 koan which contains 1:its all just bits,2: Perfection is normal 3:there\
    \ is want in the midst of plenty,4:Processing Is power,5: More of the same Can\
    \ Be a Whole New Thing, 6:Nothing goes away,7:Bits move faster than thought. All\
    \ this koans contains that how we are sounded by bits and how we are using it\
    \ in daily life and what is the importance of bits and how faster it\u2019s moving."
- desc: The Koans and the importance of group discussions
- desc: Some important topics I came across today were the koams. The second koam
    about perfection intrigued me because everyone had a different thought when it
    came to perfection. Nobody is perfect however many individuals argued otherwise.
- desc: Social Implications (Group Assignment discussion)
- desc: In the group discussion we talked about Into just bits and had learned some
    important concept from our searches
- desc: 'processing  is power and bit move faster than thought and specially group
    making '
- desc: I encountred various topics of seven truths about bits which are called koans.
- desc: Social context. While everything on the internet is essentially glorified
    0s and 1s, we give those 0s and 1s real-life meaning, morals, and implications.
- desc: 'Todays class was very informative and interesting as well. '
- desc: I encountered upon a statement known as social context(koans)
- desc: The concept of Koans and the 7 truth of bits and mainly about the 5th truth
    that a small change can change the whole world.
- desc: Today we discussed the topic that we can cover in group project
- desc: "Today\u2019s class was but of fascinating because we discussed about the\
    \ group making for small project and we had a chance to take with new peoples\
    \ in the class."
- desc: the ethics of social media tech
- desc: The Koans.
- desc: Today I learnt about 7 topics from the book blown to bits. Which was something
    new I came around.
- desc: Koans
- desc: The group discussion about different koans.
- desc: about koans.
- desc: 7 different topics which we have to discuss and give summary
- desc: The concept of koans and is human intelligence a risk or not.
- desc: An important concept I learnt today was from reading CH1 of Blown to Bits
    - Algorithmic Transparency where it is the principle of knowing how a computer
    makes a decision about us. This is important for us to understand so we know how
    a computer processes data we give it.
- desc: 'I have encountered the 7 different concepts of Koons '
- desc: Certain socital impacts of technology and about seven fundamental conclusions
    from text blown into bits
- desc: On one side, when technology grows, it provide benefits. However, it also
    puts ill effects on privacy.
- desc: The idea of nothing going away on the internet has a very unique perspective
    to me, because it is known that companies collect data on people and sell the
    information to other companies. Which further adds to my belief that data will
    never goes away.
- desc: "The Koams, even though I don\u2019t know what it means yet, but I know it\
    \ will be important later on."
- desc: 'We discussed processing is power in our group discussion '
- desc: 'Topics provided for summary writing '
- desc: Seven truth about bits [from blown to bits], known as koans
- desc: The concepts about the responsibilities we take.
- desc: Social implications in a hyper-networked world where the capabilities and
    impact of social media, artificial intelligence and computing in general are rapidly
    evolving.
- desc: Today the professor taught us about social context and we made group of 8
    and we were asked to discuss about any one or two points from Koans(there were
    7 points).
- desc: I learned about the different koans of bits that can be understood, my group
    went most in depth into the fourth koan, processing is power.
- desc: Brain storming with ideas along with other team members was a really good
    concept and it actually helps us grow.
- desc: "I learned about my classmate\u2019s perspectives on one of the Koan\u2019\
    s covered in the textbook reading."
- desc: 'The concept about koans is quite important.How they tell us the seven truths
    about bits. '
- desc: We were divided into groups today, which will be used to discuss things throughout
    the semester
- desc: 'An important concept I encountered today was the idea that human intelligence
    is not a risk, but is rather at risk. This key difference highlights the fact
    that human intelligence is adaptable, and how we shape this intelligence dictates
    whether this power can be used for good or for evil. '
- desc: The 7 koans all come together to explain the concept in great detail
- desc: Seven truths about bits
- desc: the use of koams in society and tech
- desc: One of the most important concepts I encountered today in group discussions
    was how there are digital footprints of everything you do and how it is impossible
    to erase them from the internet.
- desc: Today, the important concept encountered was "koan", a practice used in Zen
    Buddhism. "Koans" are paradoxical questions or statements designed to challenge
    one's mind.
- desc: Today we learned about the 7 Koans of bits.
- desc: 'Today''s lecture contained one of the most important lecture regarding technology '
- desc: "It\u2019s all just bits. All the illusions like pictures are comprised of\
    \ bits."
- desc: Today I learned about koans also known as seven truth about bits.
know-more:
- desc: I'm intererested in knowing about the second Koan discussed in the class,
    which is 'Perfection is Normal'. I would like to know how perfection is perceived
    in this case.
- desc: risk and reward on social context.
- desc: Know more about which group I would be in and what the assignment is
- desc: i want to know about if we can able to the assignment in the same group we
    have created for our discussion for wiki page as it will be easier for us for
    Future assignment or group work.
- desc: It was difficult to understand group distribution for assignment and discussion
