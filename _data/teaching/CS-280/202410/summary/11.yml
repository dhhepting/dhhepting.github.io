    based on the three social rules'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of privacy in the tech guys so

    chapter three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the first one is great to

    have some protection of personal'
  persid: ''
- desc: information and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is part of the rate of self

    preservation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s your feeling about the

    amount of stuff you post on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'social media and do you think

    about this forming permanent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'record of your your life for

    everyone to see. Maybe was a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit before maybe doesn''t

    come up? First thing on Google'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'search and it''s there for other

- desc: Anyone concerned about that?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll put up participation I''d

    love for you, sir. After class'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone heard of reputation

    defender.com.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I saw the ad yesterday. It''s

    been an all around for a number'
  persid: ''
- desc: of years. And maybe it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because I was watching CNN I was

    curious to hear about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reactions. Trump statement about

    starting World War three on both'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sides. But the statement that

    Russia could do whatever the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hell they want. To NATO

    countries that don''t pay their'
  persid: ''
- desc: share.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We live in a time so anyway, I

    was watching and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sad came up and said we had two

    people talking about they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to one potential client

    was talking to a potential'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'service provider and said I just

    have one question. Why do you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have bad reviews online? Garbage

    is still there. So?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What about the dragon pirate

    story'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe I should give a brief

    brief Colorado Story'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is one serious

    application of social media or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'putting material on social media

    because even though it was only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intended for her friends, the

    social worker discretion was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'working out about it. Then she

    she''s encouraging greetings to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minors. The recorder and

    university decided to not get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: different education
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is the second social

    role.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it can lead to the evolution

    and development of social norms.'
  persid: ''
- desc: or societal norms.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can privacy allows us to

    test societal norms'
  persid: ''
- desc: so any examples?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Privacy being undermined in

    relation to certain societal'
  persid: ''
- desc: norms
  persid: ''
- desc: this role is not respected
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, with kids being posted

    without their consent, like what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do parents post about their kids

    or just post pictures of their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kids, their kids are consenting

    necessarily so privacy being'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opened up kind of on those

    lines.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I have enlace you tag me in

    photographs and I use.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, what about the pronoun

    policy in Saskatchewan undermine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the societal growth of privacy.

    Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would say in a way like if

    they have family that''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'supportive. Their feelings and

    privacy by having to go through'
  persid: ''
- desc: their parents
  persid: ''
- desc: any other any comments.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'place for kids to be allowed to

    express themselves'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay and the third anything

    else?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Even watch the football game on

    Sunday. Did you watch for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'football or swim or for Usher''s

    ABS I didn''t last time show. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that was a comment that other

    people have made you know, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: know the use of roller skates
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe related to the second

    principle The third principle is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'partially encouraged. So we can

    write ideas and solve without'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'develop them on our own before

    they become public knowledge'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I wanted to talk about it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Dark patterns in relation to

    privacy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are patterns that

    appear in interfaces that impact'
  persid: ''
- desc: the way people behave, change
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can change the way that they

    decisions and the way they can'
  persid: ''
- desc: gather information?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can think of them they might

    impact autonomy. So, the ability'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of someone to make their own

    decisions'
  persid: ''
- desc: and one one that I mentioned is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'privacy is occurring before Mark

    Zuckerberg'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is this pattern

    hides the privacy protecting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'options behind several layers of

    screens.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, this is the paper. I''m

    asking you to look out for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tomorrow or next day. So this

    might be an example of Microsoft'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using a dark pattern by

    obscuring their intent to use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'personal data to train AI. So

    Mozilla asked a number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experts to look at the service

    agreement and none of them could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer whether personal data was

    the is very existence.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I want to bring out the

    detail about the professional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'skills assessment assignment so

    there''s I''ll make this available'
  persid: ''
- desc: on your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s two parts that we

    agreed on. So Monday, February'
  persid: ''
- desc: '26 is part one and part two is

    due March 25. So for part one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'submission, so the KIPP student

    membership card'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's two marks so that's
  persid: ''
- desc: an easy three marks
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then another two marks for a

    certificate of completion of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'skills TX course so then when

    you complete the questionnaire'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ll get a self rated skills,

    your profile report. So this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the preliminary version that

    gets emailed to you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So attached to the assignment

    for submission. That''s one mark.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because it''s related to part two

    submission. The edited version'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of yourself reading skills

    profile report from the planner'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'view. So if you''re using Firefox

    I had an issue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when I tried to load this in

    Firefox, just kept refreshing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the screen flashing pretty

    quickly so many people are using'
  persid: ''
- desc: Firefox Chrome
  persid: ''
- desc: you stage you can use Safari
  persid: ''
- desc: Chrome does the market share
  persid: ''
- desc: 'suddenly the ACC will be

    resigning recently'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m using Firefox again.

    Support open source and really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'foundation and I know for all

    these ideas'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there may be maybe to use a

    different browser when you get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the planning stage. And so

    you can create an edited version'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of your skills profile your self

    assess skills'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s the other part of the

    three marks.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then the next see there

    there''s a spot for your current'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position and your future

    position. So you don''t have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'turn it down as current and

    future you can just build it as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a job one and job to identify

    two job descriptions the CPU as'
  persid: ''
- desc: clean as you'd like to do.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the number of Canadian job

    descriptions that I wanted to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give you I think is 300 or some

    need your job descriptions. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: hope that gives you enough
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can find something that

    speaks to you in those job'
  persid: ''
- desc: descriptions. So then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'once you''ve identified those job

    descriptions then you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: generate skill gap reports
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s another two marks and

    then five marks for generate for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creating action plans to address

    the skill gaps'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'appoint two marks for reflecting

    on the process and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'importance of ethics in your

    chosen job descriptions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that lasts for the last two

    items or the ones that require'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re being asked for something

    other than just me just using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the interface to the seals, dx,

    Sofia, tools,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'courses for beginners,

    intermediate advanced all of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those surveys and they each take

    a different amount of time which'
  persid: ''
- desc: one was the one that you want it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t matter. So So I did them

    all myself and I blocked out a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit with that. Wish my

    horse before I put it into a bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: more perspective.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think he could choose an

    early anymore you are in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'program. beginner version media

    because this this gives you a'
  persid: ''
- desc: preliminary least supportive
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s it''s a starting point.

    Makes sense.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Somebody submit the first part

    of the graphic so I want you to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when you submit the clear

    yourself or with a group of up'
  persid: ''
- desc: to four
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the submission of part

    one. But just so you know that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll have a mechanism to get

    your feedback about your whole'
  persid: ''
- desc: your group work together.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So once you pick a topic that is

    saturated and timely. Some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sources if you choose will be

    within the last six months.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I wanted to say
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t want to do good way to

    much quantify the difference'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between three to four times as

    many work orders, sources or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything like that, but except a

    little bit more in depth. So if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re in a group then you

    should have five sources.'
  persid: ''
- desc: more deaths current Cold War.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So groups should also plan for

    division of labor. So, therefore'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we say this is the non binary

    plan. Just a little sense of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. Do you want our sources

    like listed on the infographic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or can they be on a separate

    page for submission?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or you can see me where they

    make sense. They fit otherwise'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, I just wanted to lay that

    out for you. I said I was gonna'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have that information. I haven''t

    don''t have it in your courses'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yet. I will get that done today

    and tomorrow.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought for now that we

    have groups so that we might'
  persid: ''
- desc: have another group discussion
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so does that make sense what

    I''ve said'
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's not a practices
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is an absolute so what can

    we do to support a workable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'definition of privacy in the

    sage maker, some of the examples'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are listed in that chapter

    or something it shouldn''t be us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Tim Burton''s was a previous

    version of'
  persid: ''
- desc: reset any questions? On that
  persid: ''
- desc: you can save for the session
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, it says what is discussed

    needed to support privacy do you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mean like to help protect

    someone''s privacy? Yeah, tools'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or or laws or enforcement

    mechanisms'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what what can we do to support

    what was important about privacy'
  persid: ''
- desc: in this day and age?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'For example to preserve our

    autonomy or agency the idea that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if everybody knows everything

    about us, and we can choose to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reveal some things, some people

    other than other people managing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who gets to see what you create

    information about us. For'
  persid: ''
- desc: example
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I feel more I need less clear

    the idea.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Less time to talk. So we have 10

    minutes so you can begin to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'groups and have a discussion

    about'
  persid: ''
- desc: seven summarize.
  persid: ''
- desc: Up to say
  persid: ''
- desc: evening think I'm like halfway
  persid: ''
