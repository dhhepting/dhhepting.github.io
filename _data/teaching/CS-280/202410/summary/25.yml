Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How is everyone doing today?'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so we're meeting 25/26
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So as reading the comments on

    the formative feedback to me it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seemed like someone made a

    comment.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'My strength was able to teach at

    my age so I wasn''t quite sure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about that comment. But so my

    birthday is on the 17th so the'
  persid: ''
- desc: final exam is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the last day of my 58 year so

    not not quite as old as my hair'
  persid: ''
- desc: looks.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Day one safely enjoy the clips

    yesterday'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone go onto the green with

    the physics department? No'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so some of the comments were

    that I''m really upbeat so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'apologize for for being

    disturbing last last week'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, so here''s the comment.

    Response. Oh, I didn''t format it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'properly. I left that asked you

    risk unconverted to the list'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway. So the common was one

    thing that was hard for me to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'understand was how many was how

    so many people joined the tech'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'field at once. Now there are so

    many people who will be losing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their jobs due to AI however,

    government institutions may not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want and handling certain

    information so they will need a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'turtle you turn to humans to do

    the jobs. It is confusing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the comment I want to make

    was, so how do we protect jobs?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anything you want to share with

    the class?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, we were just imagining a

    final exam question based on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this class and you could ask how

    old are you turning tomorrow?'
  persid: ''
- desc: The day after the exam
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I want to write down the

    reward of AI started with a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mediocre multilingual ad

    campaign that was my Trivago'
  persid: ''
- desc: reference.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So does anyone recall that? This

    Zevon watch TV and Does anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: see it or Wago Adam? II Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s just that I don''t remember

    saying something to that effect'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the ads.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, I think the same actors

    use these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two different attributes of the

    voice'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so setting one that is really

    effective'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for having multiple actors using

    the same for the audience to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'country. Let''s say you have one

    person doing so that''s not part'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the setup that''s not in the

    press release for Bravo using AI'
  persid: ''
- desc: to enter a new ad campaign
  persid: ''
- desc: put to me
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe it's not a reward
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, we can think of some

    some other impacts of AI but I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to address the concerns.

    From Scott response'
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: the more clear reward is.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A reward is how we can empower

    people to do more.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the question is do we need

    people who understand the risks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and rewards of technology to

    mediate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is that a job description for

    the future? Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What was the concerns with AI

    like, potentially taking a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of jobs? Is there like an

    ethical dilemma that exists that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people who are losing their jobs

    through no fault of their own?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not like they can control

    AI development? Is there an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethical moment the fact that

    they then are responsible for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'having to like pay rent time or

    money or both to get education'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to find a different job to

    replace the one that they just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lost? And does that imply that

    there''s a responsibility for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'new technologies that come

    around to fund the like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'replacements of their now

    obsolete occupations'
  persid: ''
- desc: and seems like a good solution.
  persid: ''
- desc: People companies Making
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so due to the new technologies

    and people, companies, people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and companies making billions

    and trillions of dollars from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them have an ethical

    responsibility to retrain. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not sure if that''s the right

    word displaced workers is'
  persid: ''
- desc: just Okay, thank you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you listen to the last,

    the latest podcast video and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'media started, I mentioned STI,

    central government insurance was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'served as being the big source

    of graphics workstations and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forth in the 90s, late 80s,

    early 90s. And if any of you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were candles, restocking talked

    about these being $1,000'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'workstations that are time so

    then he came along and build a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics chip to plug into a PC

    and so then computer graphics'
  persid: ''
- desc: became a commodity.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then we discovered that GPUs

    can be used for more things than'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics so it became more of a

    general processing unit and US'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should be interested in video

    started making graphics are now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just being used to the ISIS.

    Anyway, to the Find out the'
  persid: ''
- desc: darling of trillions of dollars
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or maybe 1 trillion. I can''t

    remember the exact number but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s certainly a lot of

    there''s a lot of zeros after.'
  persid: ''
- desc: In the evaluation
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you''re thinking about

    equitable distribution. of'
  persid: ''
- desc: benefits from Ai.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what protections do we need

    to consider?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So if if plan A is to distribute
  persid: ''
- desc: 'requirements, the tech the tech

    companies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equally amongst citizens of the

    world that doesn''t seem to gain'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a lot of traction with certain

    people who have all the money'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right now. A lot of resources

    now and don''t want to share so'
  persid: ''
- desc: without getting too
  persid: ''
- desc: 'low getting stuck on advocating

    for radical reforms. Kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'added protections can be

    considered as necessary. To put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'limits on technology do we need

    to think about putting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mentioning human or humane

    protections protecting humans'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in collective agreements so the

    writers strike in the states'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whenever that was a few months

    ago, we''ve got to resolve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the range kind of zone before

    the actors but there is now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'language and contracts regard

    rules around the use of AI to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that, and all kinds of organized

    job descriptions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think finds this is a

    hopeful direction. If you''re in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tech and you understand the

    risks and rewards of technology'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that you can have a career a

    meaningful career'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mediating the experience of

    others with Technology'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So your new job description that

    can be listed on the SOFIA'
  persid: ''
- desc: website or the job description
  persid: ''
- desc: for example, what kind of skills
  persid: ''
- desc: meet that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, I''ll leave that for you

    just think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so have I put a pall over the

    your excitement as be studying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer science maybe was it

    mean me are just current events?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Face don't despair
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to look at a couple of

    things they had owed for your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'input. So this final exam and

    put a still open until tomorrow'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the end of the day, so you

    can if you haven''t replied to'
  persid: ''
- desc: it, you can still do that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m not asked for your

    agreement was different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'statements. Multiple choice

    questions are a fair method to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assess my learning this

    semester.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the average reading there was

    4.2. So a little bit some people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'strongly agree so let''s so

    strongly disagree as a one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disagree as to not sure is three

    agree is four and strongly agree'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is five. So the quizzes before

    meetings were fair. A little bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'less agreement with that. The

    final exam should be all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiple choice questions. 4.25

    filings actually include some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions like the quiz before

    meetings. So that''s not sure.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The final exam should include

    some short answer fill in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blank questions. That''s leaning

    towards this agree. The final'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exam should include some

    matching questions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a little bit more

    agreement there.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, I''m sorry. 2.5 is in

    disagreement three is not sure.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The final exam should include a

    medium maths or written'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question. So that''s leaning

    towards strongly disagree so not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'necessarily a lot of surprise

    there.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let me just go through these

    quickly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to mention, I don''t

    think that the common was that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any podcast should be featured

    because they know that many did'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not actually listen to them and

    do them instead on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcript. So I don''t think

    that''s necessarily bad. To read'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the transcript instead of

    listening. I personally don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like when Google gives me a

    search result for videos. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t want to watch the videos I

    just like to read a webpage.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s what I was saying.

    Transcripts are a good thing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I just want to comment here

    as per my understanding all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'main topics which are covered in

    the semester should be asked for'
  persid: ''
- desc: the required explanation
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would not lead to an exam that

    wouldn''t be easily marked in a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reasonable timeframe. So there''s

    a Technic, there''s a logistical'
  persid: ''
- desc: issue with having
  persid: ''
- desc: '267 Students write a lot of

    questions about have a lot of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'written answers say 12 or so.

    written questions so I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wanted to throw that out that

    there are some feasibility'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constraints for the exam. But I

    thought having one page of short'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer maybe a written question

    would be a reasonable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compromise. So that''s why I

    asked the questions about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'adding some other kinds of

    questions to the exam.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the midterm was judged to be

    a bullet right let the both the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right length with the last time

    generally so the exam will be in'
  persid: ''
- desc: gym too.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we won't have the same issue
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people sitting next to each

    other and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'queue that goes on forever. So

    we''ll deal with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: signature issue.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That was part of the queuing

    problem. The density of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'proximity to other students will

    be addressed by using the gym as'
  persid: ''
- desc: our example
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so anyway, you can still add to

    this discussion. But if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'haven''t responded You can still

    reply by tomorrow night.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't want to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can look at this yourself

    lately or later. Pardon me.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I just want to touch on some

    of the things to change about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this course. So the Kipps

    assignment.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe the quizzes, the forum

    meetings and responses were too'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much. I looked at as a way to

    spend a few minutes and get 20%'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of your semesters mark. So I

    guess not I was positive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m curious slow

    communication. Do you get emails'
  persid: ''
- desc: nice posted as a session for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you definitely go along when I

    send an announcement about'
  persid: ''
- desc: important information right.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because I was reading someone

    said they didn''t see the class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion posts so I asked if

    he supported and actually looked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the instructor site for your

    courses and so the settings are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used for the class discussion

    forum. We''re going to force'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everyone to be subscribed to the

    forum guiding that guarantee an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'email being sent. So I asked it

    support and they said yes it was'
  persid: ''
- desc: guarantee would send an email so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to organize things

    organized and you can find'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything and be reminded about

    things by putting everything in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the calendar for the course and

    your courses. That was my'
  persid: ''
- desc: intent.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So last time, we used to justify

    a lot of terrible things. But I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'appreciate feedback about things

    in this class. This in a way is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a class topic about how what are

    the risks and rewards of using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'online resources for class

    materials and communication so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was your courses help the

    semester?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, I don''t want to spend

    more time on that if you have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions or concerns you can

    raise them in the class'
  persid: ''
- desc: discussion.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we talked about the case of

    developing technology for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disabled people and quality of

    life, improving the quality of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'life so I come across an article

    about the Crip technoscience'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'manifesto and I''ve linked to the

    article here. The abstract is is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'presented here. But I just want

    to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'highlight refusing to comply

    with demands to cure or fix or'
  persid: ''
- desc: eliminate disability
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe it's not always about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking about how to improve

    things or normalize things or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assimilate people into the the

    groups that into the group to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which we belong so it makes

    sense.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is a way to think about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'functional dark patterns maybe

    the dark patterns are an example'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of things that we need to think

    more carefully about.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, ACM has a page called words

    matter about a welcoming all to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computing and so they highlight

    the need to change the language'
  persid: ''
- desc: around dark patterns.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So used to describe how user

    faces can manipulate or deceive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'users to take actions that they

    normally would not take dark'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pattern makes the connection

    between dark in bad or deceptive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so alternatives include

    deceptive design manipulative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'design deceptive manipulative

    pattern, which are all more'
  persid: ''
- desc: descriptive
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can approach design

    interfaces so instead of think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about design being can be

    understood it'
  persid: ''
- desc: can be set up better
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so empathy, making the effort to

    understand people''s problems,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perspective for looking at

    sympathy, approaches sympathy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe saying well, I know me

    backing up. You''ve designed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something to fix that problem.

    But maybe it''s not the product'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to actually care what the

    problem is. So maybe we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'always as careful as we should

    be. It''s terribly hard to deal'
  persid: ''
- desc: with that.
  persid: ''
- desc: This
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constraint. Let us know some

    technology can help you overcome'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that issue. So you can be part

    of the larger group again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So maybe this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me this is bad as well as my

    intentions for grad school. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can also be have an apathetic

    approach towards design.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe we think about enabled

    or not, we don''t care about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people''s experience with CCTV

    surveillance. They''re from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'somewhere concerned as long as

    we have the capability to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to provide the necessary

    functionality'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I went I have this link here.

    So the article that I''ve pointed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to above this manifesto is

    printed in this magazine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'catalyst and I have a link to

    the the cover page and I wanted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to highlight the picture here

    can you see that alright'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we just say this person wants to

    be pushed'
  persid: ''
- desc: let me see if I can make it.
  persid: ''
- desc: Get bigger.
  persid: ''
- desc: Easier to see
  persid: ''
- desc: think that conveys a message
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, Southern link here I had

    these links on the page for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thursday. So this is the World

    Wide Web Consortium is web'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accessibility initiative called

    W AI'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is about so the
  persid: ''
- desc: the ARIA is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no Aria is escaping me

    accessibility. Accessible Rich'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Internet Applications. That''s

    ARIA stands for.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that includes things like

    including hints about what''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going on with different pieces

    of the interface. So describing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the roles. Information for

    screen readers.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So are there. So it''s competing

    with computer science doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enough to address inclusivity

    diversity, equity and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accessibility. These are those

    are some examples.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how''s competing doing with

    reconciliation?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because there are 94 calls to

    action from the Truth and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Reconciliation Commission.
  persid: ''
- desc: Meeting
  persid: ''
- desc: involved as adults
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we often think about we have

    been asked that question.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I wanted to talk a little bit

    about bring in Aiza raskins dad'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who was a designer the first

    Macintosh computer so he wrote a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'book called The humane

    interface.'
  persid: ''
- desc: An interface
  persid: ''
- desc: it's here if I get it
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't see it here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah freezing.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sorry, I''m ready to to smaller

    time. So inhumane interfaces'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'respectful of human frailties

    while supporting work while'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'supporting things we want to

    accomplish with the computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: so he proposed to laws
  persid: ''
- desc: gesture and action.
  persid: ''
- desc: Do you know where to work
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, the second one is, so we

    should we should automate the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things that are tedious for

    people to do.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Things that are suited to

    computers and things that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: suited to people used to be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the last couple of years we''ve

    had a successful journey of AI'
  persid: ''
- desc: things like creativity and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'judgment was were strictly

    capabilities'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but serving pages and pages of

    numbers on a spreadsheet.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Something was done on the

    computer. electronic computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nada as we think about them in

    modern times in in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t know if modern times is

    the right word because it''s so'
  persid: ''
- desc: current
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we should think about a human

    interface doing no more work'
