Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: all right.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Good afternoon everyone. I''ll

    get the audio sorted out with AV'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or information services. For

    next day. So welcome to computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: science to ad
  persid: ''
- desc: the nurse work.
  persid: ''
- desc: That's a strange
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t expect this technical

    difficulty'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m going to record the audio

    from the meeting and I''ll post'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the transcript on the website. I

    hope it''s gonna work out okay'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I have that going on my phone

    here. So this is my website.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm, my name is Daryl Hepting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have 26 meetings. over the

    semester, so the first of those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so who had classes yesterday? So

    some of you this isn''t the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'day of class but first week of

    the semester anyway. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also going to take pictures of

    the board. So I''m gonna try and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rate large enough so you can

    have an idea of what I''m trying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to communicate but I''ll take

    pictures and I''ll post them on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the website. as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can call me Daryl or Dr.

    Hepting, whichever you prefer.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But just fees living into one of

    those two at least when I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: around
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I was born and raised in

    Regina, I did my bachelor''s and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'master''s degrees here. I did my

    PhD at SFU and I''ve been back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here for as a faculty member for

    20 Some years'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so let me show you what I

    have for the website for our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class. So I don''t have the PDF

    of the syllabus ready but I have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the basics and your horses and

    the PDF will be uploaded before'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our next meeting. I apologize

    for that. So under teaching,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll just show you this link

    that I have for today. That'
  persid: ''
- desc: tells you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is the time of day we''re

    out right now. So it gives you a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'link to the the meeting page.

    That''s one way to get to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: class
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so this is on my personal

    webpage that the links are to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you our course many of the links

    are to your courses. So when you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'come to class devices are

    welcome. So you can use your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'courses. So if you log into your

    courses, then you can do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attendance. Record you can

    record your own attendance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This shows you a calendar for

    the day. And then the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: index. Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there should be another one

    that''s on here. I don''t know why'
  persid: ''
- desc: it isn't.
  persid: ''
- desc: Off to check that out
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is the one that I

    thought was going to be there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today. I don''t know why I didn''t

    show up on the calendar'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I found a bug in your courses.

    Well, I didn''t. I''m not the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first one to discover it. So

    there are some issues but the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nice thing about your courses is

    that it''s open source. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: can,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in theory, have more agency to

    correct the problems. But it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'written in PHP and it has some

    other barriers to entry there I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think for for developers. That''s

    a discussion for another time.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is going to be the

    structure of our meetings. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the administration I''m just

    going to leave those things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'alone pretty well and I won''t

    deal with them too much in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class. So you can record your

    own attendance by clicking on'
  persid: ''
- desc: that link.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the next part is response to

    responses. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what I''m asked but the thing

    that I clicked on in your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'courses is a questionnaire or

    three questions. So what what an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important concept or perspective

    did you encounter today in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today''s meeting, like the

    meeting we''re in right now. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t ask you can you hear me

    all right now? In the back.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, that''s a good sign. So

    what important concept or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perspective did you encounter

    today? Was there anything that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gave you some difficulty today?

    And then third, is there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything about what you''d like

    to know more from today''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting? So you can if you write

    a response to one, two or three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of those questions, write a

    thoughtful response you get two'
  persid: ''
- desc: marks towards
  persid: ''
- desc: 'towards 10 marks towards your

    final grade. If you don''t, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you write something but it''s not

    thoughtful or it''s clearly not,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you just type a few

    characters into say you''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'submitted something, you won''t

    get full marks for that. Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s responses over the

    semester are going to be 10'
  persid: ''
- desc: marks towards your final grade.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so what I''ll do so the

    closes, the time for responses'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closes at 11pm The day of the

    meeting, so you can respond'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'until 11pm tonight okay, so it

    makes sense. And I''m going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'run a script and present so

    you''re not you don''t see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'results of the questionnaire in

    you our courses. But I''m going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to present the responses they

    received and they''ll appear at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the bottom here. Under responses

    what once I process them, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tomorrow more tomorrow,

    sometimes we''ll see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responses. And then beginning of

    a meeting on Thursday, we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'review some highlights of the

    responses Okay, so that''s a way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for you to participate in the

    class without having to put your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hand up and perform in front of

    class.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m going to also give you

    some things to do in your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'courses. So the response results

    from last meeting. Let''s say'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'most meetings I''ll interact I''ll

    ask you to interact with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class material on your courses.

    I will post the results here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the previous day. So I''ve

    got one. One activity for you to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do here and then so you can

    start it in class. Today. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s due at 11pm. Tonight. It''s

    not a it''s not a big thing. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a choice between two

    alternatives. So it''s not too'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'onerous. So I''ll I''ll talk about

    the results from last meeting in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that section. And then today

    will just be what we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about today. So I wanted to

    in case you''re wondering about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'having a class with 280 Some

    students in it so there is an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'option for 280 in the summer,

    July and August Monday, Tuesday,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Wednesday, Thursday, this time

    of day for 230 to 345. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s capacity of 150 Not that

    you''re not welcome here. I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to let you know that this

    is another sections being'
  persid: ''
- desc: offered okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I did the introduction such

    as it is told you about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'recording so let''s go to the URL

    courses web page then.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So one thing I''m frustrated

    about already, is that there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no way for me to get back to the

    homepage of the course. Easily'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but I think I can do it if I do.

    So I know if you''re familiar'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with this latest version of

    Moodle, I''m not sure what''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what''s changed in the latest

    version but so the course index'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is on the left here that''s

    hidden away. Usually you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bring it out and so we''re doing

    a collapse topic format so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can hide all the things or

    show them here but that''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'course index and on the other

    side there''s the block so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'haven''t added blocks to the

    calendar page.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s here that is open the

    block, drawer, whatever it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called. So the first one is the

    calendar. So you can see what''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: going on for today.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can hide that as well.

    stuff in the middle doesn''t get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much bigger though. So in

    general, I''m going to have a few'
  persid: ''
- desc: more bits of information here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when I started your courses,

    course now I get bonus email'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'activity that I can''t delete. So

    you can use your courses email'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to get in touch with me. That''s

    maybe a good way to do it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually. Even though it''s

    frustrating because I get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'email that says you received

    your courses email. And it says'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enough. It gives me enough

    information to know that I got'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an email but then it cuts off

    before it provides anything'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'useful. Anyone else frustrated

    by that? Maybe together we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'improve you make big

    improvements in your courses.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, so good news or not your

    courses has been reaffirmed as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our learning management system

    on campus so we''ll be using it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for a while still. I think

    that''s overall a good thing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So announcements. I can write to

    that and you''ll get it but you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can''t reply to them. So I had a

    class discussion forum here as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well. Where you can no just have

    one forum for everything.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can use that as our as a

    way to get in touch with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everybody. On occasion, I might

    send you a course email I mean'
  persid: ''
- desc: an email with the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the Course Email tool so

    I''ll just say if somebody''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interested in making, having

    music contact on your courses, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t do that. The reason is

    because I get messages from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people and I have no context

    about where the messages have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'come from. And people will ask

    them don''t give me context in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the message either. So it''s very

    frustrating. So I just say'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nothing personal but I''m not

    going to accept any requests to'
  persid: ''
- desc: make. Have a contact okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so here are the meetings so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m going to update this weekly

    schedule with information from'
  persid: ''
- desc: the webpage, my web page here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is giving us giving you

    all the list all the weeks of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class so the week of Monday me

    Monday, eighth of January, which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was yesterday has two meetings.

    So this meeting today and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thursday''s meeting. So the note

    for this week is the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting was January 9, which is

    today, surprisingly enough so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'February 19 is family day.

    That''s reading weeks was no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class meetings. And then meeting

    13 will have to avoid unlucky 13'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But the 14 that seemed much

    better, and it''s the 29th of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'February so that''s when we''re

    gonna have our midterm in class'
  persid: ''
- desc: and.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The final is either on the 16th

    to the 29th 23rd Pardon me. For'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those of you doing for 28 You

    know you have exams on those two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'days. But I''ll have it nailed

    down for you. Next time.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t update my office hours

    here, but I''m proposing to have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'office hours Monday, Mondays and

    Wednesday afternoons one to four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that will there''ll be a few days

    when there''s a factory science'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting or something else when I

    have to be unavailable but in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'general we''ll try and stick with

    that. And if you if you want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get in touch with me outside of

    that. We can make arrangements'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'send me an email and we''ll find

    a time to talk we can also do'
  persid: ''
- desc: zoom
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the syllabus link doesn''t

    work, but it will by Thursday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Here''s our you our courses link

    and then also here if you want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to download a calendar file for

    the meetings. You can do that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Say we''d like to put things in

    your calendars with ICS files. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did it so that this application

    I''m using to transcribe the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'audio called otter.ai knows that

    the meeting is coming up and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it gives it gives the recording

    a reasonable name. But then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realized that it didn''t update

    the calendar. I had to do I had'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to open the calendar and do

    something with it to get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'update to come on to my phone

    and it didn''t. So today I have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do it by hand. But anyway,

    since I did that created the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calendar for thought maybe you''d

    be interested in as well. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what that one is. So blown to

    bits. Second Edition. We don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a textbook. But blown to

    bits is a good resource. It''s in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the second edition. And so the

    chapters you can buy the book if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you like but it''s also available

    for download. So I''ve given you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the link to the website where

    you can get more information'
  persid: ''
- desc: from ACM Code of Ethics
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any idea what this what ACM

    stands for?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Association of country music.

    Probably not know well maybe it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does but not the one we''re

    interested in.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s an Association for

    Computing Machinery. It''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the association of Computing

    Machinery. Maybe that would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the case of Skynet. We''re active

    but so nobody gets Terminator'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'references Who''s heard of

    Terminator the movie franchise'
  persid: ''
- desc: before?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, now, this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a loaded question but who thinks

    I have a sense of humor'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'far less than the people who

    understand the Terminator'
  persid: ''
- desc: reference
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it was a loaded question

    because you''re not you''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'freely answering the question

    because you have I have this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'power relationship. I''m giving

    you marks for the class and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you think I can''t really give my

    honest opinion of his sense of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'humor because he''s gonna give me

    a failing grade. If I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'laugh at his stupid jokes. So

    that''s, that''s an ethical issue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll come up against later in

    the semester.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I know it''s the first day and

    maybe it''ll grow on you. Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the net ACM has a code of

    ethics.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, Association for Computing

    Machinery is it''s from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'States but it''s a very large

    international organization. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s an authority for many

    things. So they have a code of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethics that was updated in 2018.

    That''s the link there. And then,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more generally, they have a page

    about ethics. Where they show'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other codes of ethics and have a

    more general discussion. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the second link. And then

    ces 2023 is the new effort to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'update the curriculum for

    computer science. So last time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it was done was 2013. So lots

    has changed since over the last'
  persid: ''
- desc: '10 years or so. So the first

    link is sort of the larger'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'project and then the second link

    to ces 2023. Report version'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gamma is the latest version. So

    that was done in August. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t leave past 2023 now, but

    I''m not sure when the final'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version is going to come out.

    But that''s there for your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reference. And the last one is

    center for humane technology.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So they''re interested in

    creating humane technology'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because not all technology

    that''s available today is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking about humanity and

    people who are affected by it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so going back to the tour here.

    So did read responses to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meetings. So I''ve also got

    quizzes set up. So open the day'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the meeting, so from midnight

    if you''re up until the class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting time so 230 You''ll be

    able to have access to the class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quiz. So that''ll it will cover

    things we did in the meeting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'previous and also the material

    I''ve asked you to look out for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the upcoming meeting. So for

    Thursday''s meeting, it might ask'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a question but what we did today

    and ask you something about what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I what I assigned to look at for

    this upcoming meeting. So that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'makes sense. So that''s another

    10% of your final mark. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignments will be another 40

    marks and exams will be 40 marks'
  persid: ''
- desc: as well. So midterm 10 Final 30.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the participation will just

    will collect the activities I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'set up in your courses like the

    choice we have now. Which will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make more sense once we watch

    the video'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll collect those so Oh, I

    didn''t mention the wiki since'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm here so we talked about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'avoiding power or being mindful

    of power relationships and of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'course the factor they might the

    coercion that we might be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exerting on other people or

    perceived coercion that we might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be exerting. So we have a

    participant pool in computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'science. So that means if there

    are people in the department'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing research that requires

    human subjects not for anything'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'too invasive, but maybe using a

    piece of software, doing a task'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on a website, for example, those

    sorts of things. The participant'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pool will give you an

    opportunity to earn a bonus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mark. So if there are studies

    being done this semester, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can participate in up to two

    studies per class. So it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unlikely that there''ll be four

    studies for example, there might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be one or two but you can earn

    research credit for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participating in in the study.

  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinator. But so I have an

    arm''s length relationship, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not I don''t want to know if

    you''re participating or not. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just at the end of the semester,

    I will get a list of people who'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have participated and give them

    a bonus mark in the spreadsheet.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that that''s a way for me to

    manage or acknowledge the power'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relationship and to mitigate as

    much as possible. So we give one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bonus Mark instead of 50.

    Because for one mark, you might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say, I''m not sure if I want to

    do this or not.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But it''s not it''s it''s not

    enough to dissuade to make me do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something I don''t want to do but

    if it''s if the reward is so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'great that you feel compelled to

    do it even though you don''t want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do it then then that''s not

    giving you free and informed'
  persid: ''

    thank you but not enough to make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you do something you don''t want

    to do. So that makes sense.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I just want you mentioned the

    wiki'
  persid: ''
- desc: so for each
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a page here for all each

    meeting.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''d encourage you to

    contribute insights and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'summaries and so forth. To the

    wet to the wiki I''ve tried'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different things to encourage

    people to do this. Which have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generally not been successful.

    But I provided here''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reference as an opportunity for

    you as a resource for you if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re interested in doing that.

    To collaborate with people to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collect things it''s a

    collaborative document. So as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can write HTML, but the wiki

    part of it is just I''ll show you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how it looks. How it looks. So

    put two square brackets, opening'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'square brackets and then the

    name of the page and close those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two square brackets. If the page

    exists, then it becomes a link.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And if the page doesn''t exist,

    it''ll come up on the page on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen as a red italics. You can

    create the page but otherwise'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can do regular HTML with the

    editor. This is just the way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'manage the links in the wiki in

    this collaborative wiki'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so that's that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I''m gonna show a video

    now. It''s a little dated, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not so dated that it''s not it''s

    still very relevant. I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: even though it's from 2011?
  persid: ''
- desc: Evening do I have to plug it
  persid: ''
- desc: looks pretty funny without sound
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sure I''m just wondering if it''s

    not on some here.'
  persid: ''

    how it is gonna turn up the'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'I guess to get into the audience

    size'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you get into the audio

    settings? If I''m not wrong, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a case that is your laptop.

    hooked to the speakers in here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Concerned HDMI should handle the

    audio.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if it''s it''s hooked up to

    HDMI to the projector as the'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: that's why I was calling. See
  persid: ''
- desc: those sounds sound sound output
  persid: ''
- desc: that's going to be loud
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that might not be here. But

    let''s see, you know what this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is? Because this VGA, VGA VGA

    doesn''t fit I tried to visit'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: Good luck. Thanks
  persid: ''
- desc: okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: I appreciate the help
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so we got it worked out.

    It''s a matter of selecting HDMI'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out but which I should have

    realized, but realize not too'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soon afterwards. So thanks again

    now, so we can watch him with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sound when he''s flipping around

    at the beginning'
  persid: ''
- desc: let me know when the
  persid: ''
- desc: if it's a good volume or not.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s take an example. What can

    we do with just one person''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: data?
  persid: ''
- desc: What can we start over
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that is the word that comes to

    mind. We''re gonna use a lot of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data. We have a lot of power.

    How much power you have seen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from Apocalypse Now removed. You

    got to get our hero to Willer'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the kind of power I feel

    in this room. That''s the kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'power we have. Because let''s

    take an example. What can we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with just one person''s data?

    What can we do with that text'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data? I can look at your

    financial records. I can tell'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that you pay your bills on time.

    I know if you''re due to give a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'loan to your medical records and

    see if that pump is still'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pumping. See if you''re good to

    offer insurance to. I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re thinking when you come to

    my website. Lets me know what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you mean. You''re ready because

    I''ve seen him visit millions of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'websites before he started to

    tell you. You''re like poker,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re gonna tell. I can tell

    with data analysis what you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna do before he even do it. I

    know what you are. I know who'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you are. And that''s easy for

    them to manage those are the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kinds of things we can do with

    the data that we have. And I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually here to talk about what

    we can do. I''m here to talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about what we should do what''s

    the right thing to do? Now I see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some puzzled looks like why are

    you asking us what''s the right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing to do? We''re just killing

    somebody else''s use again. Fair'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enough. But it brings me back to

    World War Two. Some of our great'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technologists and some of our

    great physicists studying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nuclear fission and usually just

    nuclear stuff. We gather'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'together, these physicists and

    Los Alamos see what we want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people building new technology

    thinking about what we should be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing with the technology. So

    media, that guy''s paid to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collecting and gathering so he

    can make his online experience'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better to he can make money so

    we can protect ourselves up to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no good or super we respect his

    privacy protected activity and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which one is as we figured out,

    crosses across the surface. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again, to find out let''s start

    with a sort of easy question,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something I''m sure everybody

    here has an opinion about. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t understand. It''s a show of

    hands. I vote. Ever. You think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a bunch of smart people who

    wouldn''t be such suckers just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the three felonies. All

    right. Alright, next question a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit harder. Should we be

    collecting all the bad guys here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to make these experiences better

    and protect ourselves or should'
  persid: ''
- desc: we beat them up?
  persid: ''
- desc: collect this data? We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, last question. All right

    question. We''re trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'evaluate what we should do. In

    this case, should we use a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transient deontological moral

    framework or should we use a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'million to a million

    consequentialist?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thoughts No. Not Not as many

    books Yeah, that''s terrifying.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That is terrifying. Because we

    have stronger handheld devices.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Think about the more frequent

    you should use the guy that the'
  persid: ''
- desc: sickness
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How do we know what to do? With

    all the power we have if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't have more?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We know more about mobile

    operating systems, but what we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really need is a moral. What''s

    more left than a system or we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all know right and wrong, right?

    It feels good when you do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something right. You feel bad or

    you do something wrong, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parents need to set you know,

    praise for the good, the bad.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And how do we figure out what''s

    right and wrong from day to day'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the techniques that we use,

    right? Maybe we just follow our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gut. Maybe we take a vote, we

    crowdsource milkweed plants. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people don''t department CBSA is

    kind of random, ad hoc or we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'figure out what we should do.

    And maybe if we weren''t sure,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what we really want is a moral

    framework that will help guide'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'us there that will tell us what

    kinds of things are right or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wrong in the first place. And

    how will we know in a given'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'situation what to do? So let''s

    get in more frame. We''re younger'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as people living by notice, how

    can we use numbers as the basis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for a moral frame? I know a guy

    who did exactly that ruined guy.'
  persid: ''
- desc: He's been dead 4500 years.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s right. Remember, old

    philosopher. You were speaking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'during that class? Get a lot of

    the same concerns that we get.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'He was worried about right and

    wrong. He wanted to know what is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes. But he was worried that all

    we seem to be doing is training'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opinions about this. He says

    sometimes just says something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'else just kind of convinced me

    he talks. I''m just going back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and forth. I''m not getting into

    it. I don''t want opinions. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want knowledge. I want to know

    the truth of abscessus. Likely'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have truths in math, in that.

    We know the objective facts'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'taken anywhere to be a number.

    There are truths about two. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you got two or something to add

    two more, you get four that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'true, no matter what the you''re

    talking about. It''s an objective'
  persid: ''

    abstract form. We have to have'

    tooth. They all participate in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the truths. The two heads they

    all have to listen. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'therefore it''s not a matter of

    opinion. What is Plato thought?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ethics was like math. What if

    there were a pure form of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'justice? What if there are

    truths about justice, and he'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would just look around in his

    world and see which things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participate in that form of

    justice, then you would help?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What was really just you, it

    wouldn''t be a matter of just'

    a stunning thing about how grant'

    wasn''t about like Mass Effect.'

    right time to think that we'

    another way that we can use'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'out which one is better and know

    what to do. It sounds good.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, that''s a utilitarian moral

    framework. John Stuart Mill was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a great advocate of this, this

    guy sighs and only did 200'

- desc: 'years. So basically,

    utilitarianism is very familiar'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at least the three people who

    voted for him before this, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s what works. What is more,

    with what makes up more it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just a matter of if it maximizes

    pleasure and minimizes pain. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has something intrinsic to the

    act by its relation to some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'abstract form. It''s just a

    matter of the consequences.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''re just looking at the

    consequences and see an overall'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disorder good or frameworks have

    to be simple. Then we went to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get the same example. Suppose I

    go up, and I say, Secretary'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Mattis because I ran earlier

    because I made a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calculation, I thought, and what

    if you say send me a message is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in line tied up for whoever took

    over African line, and he''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually sleeping so I''m gonna

    find that out. When I find that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out. I''m going to prevent a huge

    amount of damage that he could'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cause that has very high utility

    to repair that damage repaired'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so no payment is going to cost

  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re going on its own CEUs are

    no problem and I hope it is only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for those around by the ballot.

    If you feel that way that''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'utilitarian choice. But maybe

    you don''t feel that way. Maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is as wrong as it is.

    Because he''s a person and he has'

    can''t just interfere with that.'

- desc: 'He has autonomy doesn''t matter

    what the calculation are. There'

    He said, we should use our'

    by which we should guide our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'conduct, and then to start doing

    that follow those rules. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not a calculation. Unless we''re

    right in the face of it, this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'philosophical thing. And this

    goes on for 1000s of years.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because these are hard questions

    to have only got 15 minutes. So'
  persid: ''

    should we end our decisions?'

    what should we be doing? What''s'

    form? There''s not there''s not as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simple as ethics is far. Ethics

    requires thinking. And that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uncomfortable. I spend a lot of

    my career in artificial'

    machines that could do some of'
  persid: ''

    give us answers, but but they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can''t. You can''t just take human

    thinking and put it into a'

- desc: 'machine we''re the ones that have

    to do it humans and pretend'

- desc: 'interest, and we think we must

    have Eric said. The sad truth is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that most evil is not done by

    people who choose to be evil. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'arises from not the finality of

    evil. In response to that is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we demand the exercise of

    thinking for every sane person.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let''s do that. Let''s say that

    that''s let''s start right now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Every person in this room do

    this. Think of the last time you'
  persid: ''

    were worried to do the right'

    what should I be doing? Branch'

    How did I come up with that'

    We''re going to save 30 seconds'

    nothing but thinking about this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Are you ready? Go.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when you this is the first

    step first taking responsibility'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for what we should do with all

    of our power. Now let''s try'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this. Find a friend. Explain to

    them how you made that decision.'

    you''re just finding better'
