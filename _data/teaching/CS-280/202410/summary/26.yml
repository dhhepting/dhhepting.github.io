  persid: ''
- desc: So from last day
  persid: ''
- desc: here let me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me see if your course is going

  persid: ''

    that they''ve been able to look'
  persid: ''
- desc: at this
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'll use the suggestions in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in questionnaire kinds of

    questions the last exam so, all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the different suggestions I will

    give them and craft them into'
  persid: ''
- desc: multiple choice questions okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So because the exam is on

    Tuesday I need to finalize it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quickly so that''s why I''m not

    gonna take any more'
  persid: ''
- desc: stress questions
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so one comment one suggestion

    for a question was about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information wants to be free

    they haven''t heard that'
  persid: ''
- desc: expression before.
  persid: ''
- desc: You so the full version
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, it''s a quote from the

    conference where it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'originally were said to occur.

    Conversation between Stuart'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Brand and Steve Wozniak and he

    ended those two names either of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those two names are familiar to

    anyone. Steve Wozniak was the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other person behind the Apple

    Apple computers. Anyway, not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quite as famous as Steve Jobs, I

    think. So on the one hand, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the point you''re making was

    is that information sort of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wants to be expensive? Because

    it is so valuable. The right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information in the right place

    just changes your life. On the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other hand, information also

    wants to be free because the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cost is getting it out. is

    getting lower and lower all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time. So you have these two

    things fighting against each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other. So that simplified the

    information wants to be free.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Information also wants to be

    expensive. And that tension will'
  persid: ''
- desc: never go not go away.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how does this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'play? Into the politics in

    assessing the semester'
  persid: ''
- desc: How is it really?
  persid: ''
- desc: A class discussion?
  persid: ''
- desc: Intellectual property in general
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I should have done the slides I

    could do the copy left on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: left and copyright on the right.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Miss Moore says a lot of things

    that go into the open source'
  persid: ''
- desc: umbrella
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, it''s not all about making

    information free any other'
  persid: ''
- desc: thoughts? about this?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I should say. So encryption is

    also an issue here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that belongs there. But also

    here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is So encryption is a way to

    protect intellectual property.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And it''s also used by people who

    are live free information as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way to keep information private

    and away from authorities'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right so about two thirds 1/3 In

    terms of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an afternoon somewhere not

    sending stonecrop questions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: accepting to me exactly
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but that''s what I''ll be aiming

    for.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So social dilemmas movie is

    available for you to review on'
  persid: ''
- desc: your own so that's.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There were three short clips,

    negative particular topics and'
  persid: ''
- desc: they they are available So.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the Kemp's presentation
  persid: ''
- desc: 'PowerPoint is available both as

    a PowerPoint PDF'
  persid: ''
- desc: on March 21
  persid: ''
- desc: Meeting page.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The media has been updated so

    the pictures of the whiteboard'
  persid: ''
- desc: so finish up today
  persid: ''
- desc: so, today's
  persid: ''
- desc: so I posted
  persid: ''
- desc: I posted the midterm
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone see an email about that
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to talk just a bit

    about the infographic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'submissions. So I wanted to

    share them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the class. Not sure if the

    way that I''m sharing is breaking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your course or just because

    people are using your courses'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'too server sensibly. Anyway, as

    I was trying to do this was not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the sickness whether or not

    these energies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but I notice that not all the

    submissions are in a single page'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image format. So some people

    submitted PDF so PDF can be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'posted as an image. So I

    converted I began to convert'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them at 300 Dots Per Inch to

    JPEG files. But then some of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them were not in one page. So I

    didn''t put I didn''t share the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ones that weren''t in one page.

    So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let me see if I can show you

    what I did. So far with that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: There's 12345
  persid: ''
- desc: Nope. Still 45678
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you want
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought about having

    infographics. Infographics as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'topic for some exam questions.

    But I think that may be a bridge'
  persid: ''
- desc: Too. Far.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seemed more fair. So they saw

    you have some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'great observations about your

    exam question.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I said if you if you''re not

    on one page, fix it and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'resubmit. So I would say don''t

    worry about that either.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you''d like to do it well

    nobody is short. of things to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: at this time. of year.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll just take some time to go

    through the suggestions and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can talk about things from the

    class in general. related to'
  persid: ''
- desc: those suggestions.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the first one assuming your

    team designed a software and is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'planning to launch it but they

    decide to not give you credit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the work you''ve done. What

    can you do in the situation so'
  persid: ''
- desc: the inspiration I take from that
  persid: ''
- desc: is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, this was imagine a scenario

    so maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll lay out a situation a case

    study, perhaps and then give you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some options to how we might

    approach it with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: implications are
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that seem fair?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Comprehensive question

    concerning ethics it should not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be to should not revolve around

    definitions and keywords but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rather the main idea. Question

    should concern the big ideas we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learned in class and details of

    how to understand and take'
  persid: ''
- desc: action against them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that doesn''t necessarily look

    like a multiple choice question,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but it''s maybe like the first

    one. What would you do in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: situation? What is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for this? It came in with the

    code of ethics and what is.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And the other formulations that

    are appealing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I suggest mainly all important

    topics that help in our future.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So, how many people
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forecast around vertical for the

    reason any urgent forecast'
  persid: ''
- desc: there was a joke a few years ago
  persid: ''
- desc: that came up in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Fortran was assessed in the

    programming languages section of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Warrens oral exam last year

    C stands for Formula'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translation. That was one of the

    first ones first line high level'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'language was developed and the

    job was even years and gray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soccer to get back to a soccer

    she was involved with COBOL'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'COBOL common business oriented

    language so, these are very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'early languages and groups joke.

    Here''s the honest COBOL and non'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use of Fortran but you''re still

    with us. So.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s me trying to be a bit

    more positive'
  persid: ''
- desc: comments of recent days so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I suppose I can have some true

    and false questions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t have to use all five

    responses for the Scantron sheet'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who would be in favor of true

    and false questions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay. Thank you for raising your

    hands'
  persid: ''
- desc: all right
  persid: ''
- desc: ethics, AI and encryption
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so one thing that came to me the

    other day was what if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'google accepted search strings

    and if it didn''t find any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'results it would pass on to the

    general AI and create what you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'requested so the lines vary

    between the things that exist'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we can search and we can

    know about and of the things'
  persid: ''
- desc: that are fabricated
  persid: ''
- desc: think I did this already.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe there's a question there.
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: just start over.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s ethics are important for

    computing but ethics are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important also because computing

    casts such a large shadow and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'impacts every aspect of our

    lives.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when we''re talking about

    financial services or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applications talking about

    convenience, but what if the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people who need to have access

    to these accessory services'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t have access to the

    computing power they need. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s in general the digital

    divide'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not sure the title is called

    Robots ramblings.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, by the way, but Sir talk

    to Yes I think so.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up so in general Blair

    remembered is some of the film'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was the company went on to sell

    the latest and greatest products'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so the she''s an actress saw

    the supply of cards that allow'
  persid: ''
- desc: owner loves to repair themselves
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in the non animated world we

    have something similar'
  persid: ''
- desc: expressions of a directory pair
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. fallacies.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think I can work with that

    fallacies and the ethical issue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are related or we could

    apply fallacies or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe an example of ethical

    analysis required to root out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fallacies. So maybe. Second look

    at some examples of fallacies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and arguments that were made and

    then you can identify the'
  persid: ''
- desc: fallacy.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So dark patterns lists the

    levels of Bloom''s Taxonomy.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Find dark patterns
  persid: ''
- desc: so, there is a common
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one of the responses is

    cognitive if we need to why we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to make those patterns more

    inclusive and not use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not to be too sensitive a

    phrase?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What are the issues there? So,

    that''s in the ACM droid words'
  persid: ''
- desc: matter.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, another example of this I

    remember I was meeting for FIRST'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Robotics FIRST LEGO League and

    talking about the challenge for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the year and one of them they

    talked is on collecting garbage'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'waste represent the waste they

    take black'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I know what shame was I thought

    then maybe that was a poor'
  persid: ''
- desc: choice. So, I'm not saying
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saying things are wrong, but I

    think there''s room to broaden'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our horizons and realize that

    words aren''t the same way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everyone competing more

    inclusive and more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'representative of the

    demographics of the population'
  persid: ''
- desc: around us than we have to be.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That helps our cause if we are

    mindful of messages that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'communicated to other groups.

    Does that make sense? Just for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'practical point of view,

    diversity in computing helps'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'improve computing. So the thing

    is facial recognition example'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we have people of all

    different skin colors involved'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the process and then the

    technology gets better and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uses are maybe more thoughtfully

    considered as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, the next question here is

    what can we do to mitigate bias'
  persid: ''
- desc: in AI?
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, that's about all of them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that leaves to the feedback

    that another questions at a time'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're about right so.
  persid: ''
- desc: So keep roughly the same ratio.
  persid: ''
- desc: '100 to 120 questions. That''s

    what I''m looking at.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, one last response. I want

    to mention was paraphrase and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can look at the response

    yourself.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Why do we need to worry about

    creating negative cases why on'
  persid: ''
- desc: just that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'invisible hand where our API

    czar create the interface works'
  persid: ''
- desc: best and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so why do you need interfaces?

    It''s important to engage humans'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the process
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not just because computers are

    more trustworthy by nature. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s better to be human and work

    with human interface design'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should be working on routine.

    Anyway, so last few minutes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here. Do you have any questions

    or concerns'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, well thank you very much
