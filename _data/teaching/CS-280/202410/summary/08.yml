  persid: ''
- desc: 'is. I don''t want to make a

    bigger thing than'
  persid: ''
- desc: what we have.
  persid: ''
- desc: Here notes shift.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A small group of students class

    discussions and so forth.'
  persid: ''

    so do a professional skills'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assessment that''s an individual

    Simon Darby worth 50 marks'
  persid: ''
- desc: create an infographic
  persid: ''
- desc: so let me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'most sitting there is tempting

    always. Even though it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connected to the computer that

    I''m using.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so professional skills

    assessment. We use the skills'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'framework for the Information

    Age Sofia. So you can assess'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your professional skills. So

    there''ll be an individual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment. So to get started,

    there''s a few'
  persid: ''
- desc: links here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m asking you to get a free

    membership student membership'
  persid: ''
- desc: and Kipps. Let's look at that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you need to select

    Saskatchewan. You want to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: kept Saskatchewan student
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then here you input your

    information.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a note about COVID

    ethics and eligibility'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'confirmation so you''re

    certifying that you''re a full'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time student and a recognized

    educational institution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so yes, we''re accredited by

    Kipps.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can certify that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the second part is I

    hereby affirm that I subscribe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the purposes of Eclipse and

    adhere to the Eclipse Code of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ethics and Standards of Conduct

    and understand that my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'membership is not transferable

    not refundable.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s $0. So the non

    refundable part is I wish I knew'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where to stand so I wouldn''t get

    the feedback. Oh, keep'
  persid: ''
- desc: experimenting. Speakers
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not very close to the

    speakers. So anyway. So you need'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to initial that. Let''s just take

    a look at the Eclipse Code of'
  persid: ''
- desc: Ethics page.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You so there''s there are two

    versions here. So there''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'code of ethics and standards of

    contact conduct from June of'
  persid: ''
- desc: '2018. And the kips ethical

    ethics exam is based on the 2018'
  persid: ''
- desc: version
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is the 2022 version of

    being approved by provincial'
  persid: ''
- desc: authorities.
  persid: ''
- desc: The 2022 version.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'borrows a lot from the ACM Code

    of Ethics this code is adapted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the ACM code of ethics and

    professional conduct.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you''re familiar with that,

    then you can initial that spot'
  persid: ''
- desc: on the application.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So your graduation date expected

    student number'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'University of Regina and the

    program if you''re doing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Bachelors of Science in Computer

    Science or something else'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe it''s it''s easiest just to

    say bachelor science computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: science four years
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then contact information and

    you can choose whether or not to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be listed in the directory so

    that''s step one is up seem okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then once you''re received

    notification that your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'membership has been accepted

    there''s more you access the'
  persid: ''
- desc: SOFIA tool assessment tool.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So assess your current IT

    skills. This is not the link'
  persid: ''
- desc: that gets you to the tool
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I wonder if that was anyway, it

    gives you some information about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the responsibilities and the

    latest version of the framework.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So get started, assess your IT

    skills and plan your IT career'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the one they need to

    click on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So here's me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can see my smiling face

    there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve already completed the

    questionnaires. So now I''m in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the planning stage. So hi. I''m

    going to update this and I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: share it with you
  persid: ''
- desc: as I get further along
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s skilled this Sofia

    skills profile and gaps'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the questionnaire to start

    with is'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Don''t worry about your answers.

    To the questionnaire getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them precise the specified

    because you can go back in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: stage and edit them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe they understood a

    little'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit better than what the

    questionnaire was going for. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I had done the training that I

    did after the fact then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: wouldn't have
  persid: ''
- desc: selected multiple levels
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I need to review this and

    clean it up a bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so once you''re done the

    questionnaire then this will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give you a better chance to to

    read is to refine your skills'
  persid: ''
- desc: assessment.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is the course that might

    have been helpful for me to look'
  persid: ''
- desc: at.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s called skills to extra

    personal career development. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can get a certificate at the

    end of it. Yes. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go through all this stuff was

    that once we complete like the X'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rays of the sections that were

    given 15 marks are we doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: something with taking six
  persid: ''
- desc: 'USD worth of the two marks we''re

    getting are we doing the sips'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then you can look at our

    profile marks and we''re doing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: reading assessment on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how so when you say sips

    prancing kipsang With a soft'
  persid: ''
- desc: fussy
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay yeah, so there are a few

    things here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: All
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there are a few things that can

    be submitted as indications'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ve done the whole process.

    And so I''ll detail that collect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those outputs, and then that

    will be graded'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s basically doing the

    Kipps membership but then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through the Eclipse membership

    you get access to the SOFIA'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'framework tools. To assess your

    own personal professional skills'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: so you'll be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ll have your skills

    assessment, and then there''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way to look to identify gaps for

    the the career that interests'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you. So I will detail all the

    steps, all the deliverables have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'artifacts to submit. So doing

    the process and collecting all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this the outputs of the process

    you''ll get a mark based on that'
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then the other assignment is

    about creating an infographic'
  persid: ''
- desc: and that can be done
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in groups of four up to groups

    of four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can see which group

    you''re in. So I''ve made groups'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everyone''s in their own group to

    start with.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I picked someone at random to

    piggyback on'
  persid: ''
- desc: my apologies to hear Cara.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the key is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you want to make a group of

    somebody'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you want to work with our

    groups'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so one of the ones to say and

    you want to work 345 So send a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'note to me that you will solidly

    234234 and five July when I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make that change, we''ll go

    forward from there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll have much more detail

    about the process. So the idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'idea is that you do research

    about a topic that''s current'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'based on our our course

    discussions and and things that'
  persid: ''
- desc: are appearing in the news.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Something that''s topical related

    to society ethics and'
  persid: ''
- desc: professionalism.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And you research so as someone

    who despite appearing sad but'
  persid: ''
- desc: instead of writing
  persid: ''
- desc: '100 words expressing those ideas

    and ventures so it''s really a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'poster so we''ll create an

    infographic which is'
  persid: ''
- desc: are so good, reliable sources
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it still requires research and

    development this session is'
  persid: ''
- desc: different. And I say that's.
  persid: ''
- desc: Time to write
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this will give you a different

    perspective perhaps.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, does that make sense?

    About the possibility to work in'
  persid: ''
- desc: groups? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how''s that established for

    each of these assignments?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes. Well I was contracted for

    us so give us the class. Your'
  persid: ''
- desc: preference.
  persid: ''
- desc: Me check their dates
  persid: ''
- desc: '2008'
  persid: ''
- desc: Evening Friday
  persid: ''
- desc: feel that there
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are too many individual lines

    later or hostile work is also'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, last choice of courses for

    that'
  persid: ''
- desc: you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'finalize articulating what you''d

    like to explore and encouraging'
  persid: ''
- desc: to the semester
  persid: ''
- desc: the things
  persid: ''
- desc: from time to time
  persid: ''
- desc: just chatting
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: far still encouraging
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was your silence was saying at

    the price'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we need to recycle these paper

    in your description'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you so in terms of evaluating

    sources I found this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sources very information it''s

    not without informed moves in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the academic set, start,

    investigate the source, find'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better coverage and trace claim

    schools and we have the original'
  persid: ''
- desc: context
  persid: ''
- desc: so your time
  persid: ''
- desc: 'groundbreaking story was stopped

    before we this is the truth and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'evaluate so source say what is

    the source beforehand before'
  persid: ''
- desc: reading the article
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, there''s a video here I

    believe. Again I keep lying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: you. Okay, so let's try this
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, that should be set up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fascinating one, a simple set of

    rules that continue to do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: same for all nations
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Some people wonder what does it

    matter Thanks for your comments'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we'll see you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soon my name is the best

    possible'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to CES this year is the first

    lesson and you see this this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the American Academy of

    Pediatrics. The American Academy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of Pediatrics is an organization

    found with like 30s funding of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something like e million 60,000

    members considered by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pediatricians, scientists and

    governments as one of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'premier authorities on the

    health and well being. Okay, on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the other hand, this is the

    American College of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pediatricians. So the American

    College of Pediatricians was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'founded to protest the adoption

    of children by same sex couples.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not a professional

    organization is considered by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'many to be reasonable shipping.

    So these two sides are from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different universities and it

    should be pretty easy to tell'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them apart, right? So Stanford

    researchers recently looked at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just that issue. They took three

    sets of people, Stanford'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'students, professional

    historians, and professional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fact checkers second down from

    here and gave them five minutes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to figure out ways to be more

    credible source. So how do they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do? Well, the answer is not very

    well, first of some of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'historians, half of the stories

    couldn''t say for sure we just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like before pregnancy. The

    Stanford students have been aged'
  persid: ''
- desc: '65% actually chose the website

    considered by many to be a site'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as the war credible source.

    Finally, we have professional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fact checkers. Professional fact

    checkers 100% of men right in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'order to behave right we''ve got

    a lot of people will the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'groups use it for five minutes

    respect gender status, right? Is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sentence. So what accounts for

    make difference? The fact'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'checkers they use a set of

    skills that are women need a set'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of skills that help them very

    quickly get to the truth of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matter. I want to show you how

    to use those skills and that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: what we're going to start to do.
  persid: ''
- desc: Our first video
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about how factors help form

    social smartest people listen to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at work should be one of the

    techniques you use to listen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back to original. Hey, we''re

    looking at these two sites. One'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of them was respected

    professional organization, one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of them was considered by me to

    be basically a heat site, right.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how can the fact checkers

    quickly discern that? Now this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'makes observed listen, he came

    to the speech the American'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'College of Pediatricians. When

    they hit me, they got off, they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'went to another page. They went

    and did a Google search. They'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'started asking themselves who

    are these people posting this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information? Once you put in a

    search like that, a Wikipedia'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'page comes up that talks about

    it as a socially conservative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'advocacy group. Its membership

    it says is estimated at 500'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''ll see that they have a

    robot somewhere around 1000.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is what comparable

    organization to the American'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Academy of Pediatricians. The

    point here is in order to find'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out the truth about an

    organization you''re looking at,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do not look at what organization

    says about itself. Look at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'web is telling you about the

    organization that''s where you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to find truth of the

    matter.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll show you one trick you can

    do that makes this technique'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'super fast. Most accuracy is

    what he does. So it''s usually a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'great first stop for

    investigating journalistic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sources and organizations

    painless example A article from'
  persid: ''
