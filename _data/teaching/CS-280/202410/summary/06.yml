    deciding which path is the right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'path to go down for particular

    purpose. And this is something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where a lot of technical people

    get hung up, because they''re so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'focused on the analysis, that

    they don''t look at the very top'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decision to say, You know what,

    we can go deep in the tree, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that very first decision was

    actually the one that was wrong.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And from a judgment point of

    view, we might very well have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'circumstance where any path on

    the right is better than any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'path on the left. And further

    analysis on the details of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'path on the left is not going to

    change that fundamental'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decision, because we actually,

    we actually made the right or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wrong decision at the very, very

    first decision on the tree. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is something that a lot

    of technical people who are very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'analytically focused, have a

    really hard time wrapping their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'brains around. They have a hard

    time wrapping their brains'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'around the idea that in some

    cases, further analysis doesn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matter, that it''s okay to ignore

    detail, that more details are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually not going to influence

    the overall outcome of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decision. And so this would be

    characteristic of judgment, not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'analysis of judgment to the

    degree that technical people are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uncomfortable with that good

    systematic of them,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'overdeveloped analysis muscle

    and maybe an under job, judgment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'muscle. So, what are the other

    interesting aspects of your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'judgment is because we''re so

    analysis heavy in software, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'often mistake analysis for

    judgment project, we will what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the circumstances are really the

    call for documents. We''ll see if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any application analysis

    instead, and we''ll make the best'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'judgment even though it''s not.

    So example might be something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like criticize each of the

    technology patents that not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'judge that is analyzing each

    other to path finding faults and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three design approaches. Well,

    if you''re tasked with choosing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the best of the three design

    approaches, then it kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looks like if we were finding

    faults in each of those three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that that might kind of be sort

    of like judgment, but actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'finding the faults in the house

    is that and that will be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'followed by a genuine step.

    Depending on how blatant the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'faults are, there might not be a

    lot of analysis needed actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because the right path might

    actually be determined much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'higher in the decision tree.

    Identify limitations of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'current system to justify re

    architecture project.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Identifying limitations

    fundamentally and often.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Advocacy propriety doesn''t get

    beyond hashtag beyond the idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of one favorite project. So

    that''s interesting to you. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can advocate for one project,

    but that doesn''t apply judgment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really implies a lower level on

    the set on assessment, a new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'methodology enough to religious

    accuracy for one methodology. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again, their assessment kind of

    a family has evaluate or judge'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and advocacy for one that he''s

    understanding how to set up set.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assessment project plans focuses

    on minutiae. That''s the whole'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'idea of not able to see the

    forest for the trees and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'certainly do that fairly often

    in our field, or root cause'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'analysis on a build project is

    just rehashing unpopular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decisions, same kind of issue

    where, again, rather than really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feeling judgment as characters

    that might be for something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called Root Cause Analysis,

    which did a fine job when we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually get hung up on just

    looking at it again, have you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dealt with me on so Jeremy

    capability my view is even rarer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'than synthesis in software

    engineering, and I think we are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just waiting for genuine in our

    recruiting and recruiting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'practices at all. For example,

    Microsoft sales interview'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions, and nearly all of

    them did this, which is higher'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on Bloom''s Taxonomy than typical

    interview questions, which are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'often more about analysis, but

    poor business judgment. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'commonly technical sounds that

    it is a cliche, you spend much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time with the people that is

    CEO, CEO, CFO, exactly as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'company. They just shake their

    head is judging demonstrated by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technical staff and I''ve had

    numerous experiences where I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would actually confirm that

    myself. So rather than just kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of saying, Wow, terrible TV, I''d

    be happy with that. The $64'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question is, then how do we

    develop good judgment in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software professionals, if they

    don''t buy it naturally, if we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not recruiting for it? How do we

    develop that good judgment? So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s not a weakness of our

    field. I think the right way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do that, by the way that I

    proposed today is what I call'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the four factors model. I have

    another presentation that goes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into a lot of detail on the four

    factors model. But I will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'summarize very briefly today the

    four factors model basically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'says that we have a deep

    understanding of the project'
  persid: ''
- desc: size or the crop
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: Buying okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I just wanted to check in so

    there''s some comments and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responses about people. Talking

    and making difficulty hear me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wanting to hear what''s being

    said at the front of the class.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, maybe we do says a font that

    clarifies some rules and some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'guidelines that we can have for

    having a respectful environment.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can discuss ideas to class

    instead of other things.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So those of you who are

    interested in watching the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video, you could you could do

    that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Some ways that we can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'developing good judgment good

    ethical judgment amongst'
  persid: ''
- desc: computer professionals.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, maybe think of a tree what

    is the way to organize the tree'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that will be making the ethical

    decisions with prioritizing'
  persid: ''
- desc: ethical decisions
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any thoughts? So, question makes

    sense'
  persid: ''
- desc: so, we often ask
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, what the question is how to

    do something?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You we ask why something should

    be done whatever we prioritize'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'asking why something should be

    done why should we collect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'somebody''s data? Pretty much

    video should be required to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collect the data today makes the

    experience with the app more'
  persid: ''
- desc: convenient.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or CFPs he or she that they''re

    up to no good or possibly are'
  persid: ''
- desc: doing it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, sell data to other companies

    or third parties for other'
  persid: ''
- desc: purposes so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve been too much about keeping

    quiet nobody wants to talk to me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, I''m trying to strike a

    balance here. I''m trying not to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I just tried to encourage

    discussions where everyone can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participate. So I still value

    their contributions just'
  persid: ''
- desc: informal dorky ways.
  persid: ''
- desc: Standing Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: Asking why before how I sets
  persid: ''
- desc: what the question is what do you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think? So, the devices have

    downstream decisions. Notation'
  persid: ''
- desc: else we're not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a question about the Tim

    Hortons out how to keep track of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collect geographic data about

    where people are different times'
  persid: ''
- desc: and maybe not case
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so tracking.
  persid: ''
- desc: Tracking us in the app
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe in production a

    malicious and yet we create an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'output still tracking people''s

    locations and collecting more'

  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we might think about

    approaches being in landlines'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I need to be able to find

    logical fallacies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can do something because I

    read on the internet it was a'
  persid: ''
- desc: good thing to do.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s the fallacy of

    appealing to authority.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If we do just that means we''re

    going to end up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing something well. Being too

    general, we can say that if if'
  persid: ''

    if we do one thing that''s going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to lead to terrible

    consequences. That''s a fallacy'
  persid: ''
- desc: as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: Have a list from Wikipedia
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a fallacy is the use of

    invalid or otherwise faulty'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reasoning in the construction of

    an argument.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can have an appeal to

    probability taking something for'

  persid: ''
