  persid: ''

    around'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'March or being like the landlord

    like the line that seems to work'
  persid: ''
- desc: will see
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so
  persid: ''
- desc: morning so midterm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thoughts flow mentor we''ll

    discuss that more towards the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'end of the class. I hope to have

    results ready to talk to you'
  persid: ''
- desc: about on Thursday
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the Kipps presentation is

    coming up on March 21. I talked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the executive director

    yesterday what kinds of things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, I would invite you to have

    questions or comments what you''d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like to hear in the blog as

    well?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, let's do it right now.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'May maybe let''s do it now. Let''s

    see. I''m just gonna add a'
  persid: ''
- desc: discussion topic about this.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Imagine your courses getting an

    extra workout. These this time'
  persid: ''
- desc: of year was midterms.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll come back to that in a

    minute. Any questions you''d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like? Any thoughts about the

    Kipps presentation right'
  persid: ''
- desc: now okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: a seat.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ve been able to as I

    mentioned in the email, I think,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get permission to screen the

    classroom version of the social'
  persid: ''
- desc: dilemma.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe for the for each we''ll

    try to get more details. Soon.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Now still nothing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I have a couple of news

    stories to bring up and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a video and then we can

    discuss'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'midterm the infographic if you

    like. So they want to hear the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'story about vending machines at

    University of Waterloo.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe it''s my internet

    connection'
  persid: ''
- desc: add your own will should be fine
  persid: ''
- desc: see if I switch to my cell phone
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, well I won''t do it every

    day but so vending machines had'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eyes all over this Ontario

    campus until students wised up.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a company who had

    installed cameras in the vending'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'machines. And what happened was,

    there was an error message that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'popped up on the screen can you

    see that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Exception unknown software

    exception, blah, blah blah'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'occurred in the application that

    location blah blah, blah. In'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vendor vending facial

    recognition app dot exe,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'application error. So people who

    were waiting to get some m&ms'
  persid: ''
- desc: for other things
  persid: ''
- desc: we're being
  persid: ''
- desc: analyzed
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the company says they''re not

    doing facial recognition they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not come here to databases of

    bases on the internet or using'
  persid: ''
- desc: data for
  persid: ''
- desc: the school furnaces
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t say they were using

    facial analysis to understand'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the demographics of people who

    are coming to the vending'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'machine and what they''re

    ordering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is that is that a whole new

    thing?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, what do you think the issue

    is here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'companies attract when people

    are bought for a long time, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'difference here is that it''s not

    incentive rewards program and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you tell the tale in grocery

    store who you are, and then that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reward program they can kind of

    see what you bought who''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: consenting?
  persid: ''
- desc: What is your name? Was
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is there another comment up

    here?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so I get my c plus points

    or whatever rewards program is'
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe not, maybe not eating.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, I think he''s just saying

    in that, in that scenario, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sign up for the rewards program.

    So you''ve given them your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'demographics, your age, gender,

    and so they can build their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their data based off of that,

    but with these vending machines,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like it''s just pulling data

    without anybody giving it to'
  persid: ''
- desc: them conceptually Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: That
  persid: ''
- desc: is an important distinction.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So because giving your consent

    to have your data taken is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'essentially consenting to your

    privacy. You''re getting that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information. It''s not a privacy

    violation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not saying that isn''t an

    important distinction, but I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: wondering from practice
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what the difference is. When we

    think about rewards program'
  persid: ''
- desc: assessing the privacy policy,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'merely existing near the vending

    machines, profit data, that you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'aren''t even giving away you''re

    just standing there Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's a story in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this chapter three, I think

    about target states'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there was a case of teenage girl

    who was buying certain things at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Target and we analyze the data

    and guess that she was pregnant.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'She had told her family about

    it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that was not the way that she

    wanted. To break the news.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Because we are sending for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coupons to expectant mothers.

    When this became an issue with'
  persid: ''
- desc: parents going to the store
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the idea was the parent

    wasn''t wasn''t upset that they'
  persid: ''
- desc: had profiled
  persid: ''
- desc: her daughter
  persid: ''
- desc: that I wouldn't be.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then machines is about the

    data that'
  persid: ''
- desc: neither gain
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nor is it about video being

    recorded'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like there should be no when

    you''re being recorded.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So is it
  persid: ''
- desc: this is different than being
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the more general public place

    and having video cameras around.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t believe the university

    is public property.'
  persid: ''
- desc: As like according to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what I''m trying to say like you

    could openly have a camera and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the university as far as I''m

    aware, I think I don''t think I''d'
  persid: ''
- desc: be public property. Here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But it says you may be recorded.

    So at least from people.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Says only during the exam

    periods,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'university if I can just take on

    the camera and the University of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Regina and be legally allowed to

    record. I could however, like go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the last counterpart because

    that''s a public property where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'photographing video at tents

    allow my so this company would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have to have like a legal

    agreement with the University to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'allow these cameras to to you

    know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question uses investigating. I

    invite everyone to also do some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'investigating to come back with

    some.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the other news item I want to

    mention'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was an item about abusers using

    Interact e transfer to contact'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'victims and thereby skirt

    restraining orders and more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contact orders so add some

    details and there''s a warning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just little pictures. So I don''t

    want to get into details.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But I want him to raise the

    issues.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the story talks about action

    Australia realizing this was a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'problem a few years ago that

    they'
  persid: ''
- desc: undertook to be proactive in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stopping these messages from

    going through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and one of the banks has even

    made their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their software and their models

    available to others. But in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Canada, it''s up to the person

    receiving the text messages to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make a complaint. So this leads

    I think in relation to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'online harms stack. Build a

    system introduce and this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'indicated as an area that''s

    missed by that will.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Help so what what are the pros

    and cons of having these'
  persid: ''
- desc: interact? Correctness reading
  persid: ''
- desc: messages
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, they could just make this

    like, because there''s no way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that someone could like,

    feasibly have a person there to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen every single interview

    transcript so they''re using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, some kind of thought to do

    it. And so who''s to say they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not just going to block random?

    Like the transmitters that since'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s money involved are

    inherently going to be of some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'importance. Just because they''re

    bought says, oh, no, this is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bad message. You must be doing

    something bad. And then from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reporting that factory walks the

    train transfer. Money that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'message is like something like

    message is like I use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transferred a payment of rent

    and I need to have like my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'address with lost the message at

    all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But occasionally, something''s

    like a false positive. All of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: sudden my rent payments
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah so so one of the cases

    mentioned here first was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transferring and at the time. So

    unless you have a really good'
  persid: ''
- desc: deal for when
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the pending transfers when they

    fly that amount your rent'
  persid: ''
- desc: payment be safe
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I haven''t seen that plus

    should be not burdening the'
  persid: ''
- desc: recipient.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we were talking yesterday

    about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'design for the most vulnerable

    population. So this qualifies as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a case where we could do more to

    protect the most vulnerable.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let me show a video that

    talks a bit about some of these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'issues. See surveillance

    capitalism has anyone heard that'
  persid: ''
- desc: term before? Anyone?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, well I guess that''s good

    and bad.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, what is surveillance

    capitalism? It rests on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Discovery. That private human

    experience was to be the last'
  persid: ''
- desc: virgin wood
  persid: ''
- desc: 'available for extraction.

    Production,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'commodification and sales

    people. That means we did become'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a chatbot. For comments read

    aloud is exactly what happened.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And the results are shaking

    democracy to its core they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transforming our daily lives.

    They''re Ciao challenging the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'social contracts that we''ve

    inherited from the enlightenment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and indeed threatening the very

    viability of human freedom.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Justice was predicted. Under

    Siege, though it may be. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'only possible remedy for all of

    this is democracy. And that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'why we''re here tonight, of

    course. So I think about it this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way. I know that you know, the

    story of Alice in Wonderland.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes. Everybody has a story of

    Alice in Wonderland. And you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'remember the white rabbit who

    had the clock and he was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rushing? And I''m reading plays a

    very important day and then he'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'goes down the rabbit hole was

    aware as he''s about it is two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decades ago. We were all Alice

    and we encountered the White'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Rabbit and he was rushing down

    his hole. And just like Alice,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we rushed after him. We follow

    the White Rabbit into wonder'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what happened in Wonderland in

    Wonderland. There are various'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things that we learned and it

    took us two decades to learn'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that okay. First of all, we

    learned that we can search'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Google, we search Google. But

    now two decades later, there is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a fragile new awareness domain.

    And it''s occurring to us that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not so much that we search

    Google instead Google searches'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in Wonderland, we assume that we

    use social media but now we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'begun to understand that social

    media uses us. We thought that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these are great free services.

    While these companies were'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking these are great people

    who are free, free raw material'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for our new operations of

    analysis, production and sales.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We barely questioned why our

    television sets or our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mattresses came with privacy

    policies. But now, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'beginning to understand that

    privacy policies are actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surveillance policy. We admired

    the tech giants as innovative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'companies. But now is a bit of

    companies by the way, who'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'occasionally made some big

    mistakes, and those mistakes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'violate our privacy. The

    difference now is that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'beginning to understand that

    those mistakes actually are the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'innovations. Those mistakes are

    the innovations. In Wonderland,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we learn to believe that privacy

    is private we fail to reckon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the profound distinction

    between a society that cherishes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'principles of individual

    sovereignty, and one that lives'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the social relations of the

    one way mirror. Privacy is not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'private. Privacy is a collective

    action problem. Privacy is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'political challenge. Privacy is

    about the kind of society that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we live in. Finally, our most

    dangerous illusion of all in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Wonderland. We believe that the

    internet offer unprecedented'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'access to proprietary knowledge.

    But in the harsh glare of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surveillance capitalism, we have

    come to learn that for pot from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'primary knowledge, now has

    unprecedented access to us.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Surveillance, capitalists, self

    certainty. So they''re competing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on their predictions. So let''s

    reverse engineer these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'competitive dynamics and see

    what we''re saying. Well, number'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, everybody knows an AI needs

    a lot of data, right? Everybody'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'knows that. So the first thing

    is economies of scale, drives'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them toward totalities with

    information, we need to we need'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data at scale. Okay? That''s an

    easy one. Competing on scale is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good, but not good enough.

    Because eventually they realize,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hey, you know what, we need a

    lot of data but we also need'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'varieties of data. Now we know

    that we need economies of scale.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But we all see variety. So we

    need economies of scope,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different kinds of data. Now,

    even though you''re not old'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enough to remember the.com loss,

    many of you are old enough to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'remember the mobility

    revolution. Right? So this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the idea that, well, you have a

    little computer and you put it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in your pocket and you''ve got

    well, well we''ll kind of funny'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what the heck and it will go

    everywhere with you. And now we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can get economies of scope, like

    where you are and what you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking about who you''re with,

    and what transactions you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making and maybe where you''re

    eating, what you''re eating and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who you''re emailing or texting

    or what kind of browsing you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing while you''re walking in

    the park or walking through the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'city. We can get your voice, we

    can get all kinds of things now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, and don''t forget what''s the

    most important thing of all that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can get with this new

    computer? Get your face. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna get all your faces. Okay.

    So we''ve got economies of scale'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and economies of scope.

    Prediction continues to evolve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and competition continues to

    intensify and pretty soon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a new realization. The

    most predictive data comes from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intervening. Intervening, excuse

    me in your behavior, intervening'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in your behavior, intervening in

    the state of play, in order to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually nudge close to herd

    your behavior in the direction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the outcomes that we are

    guaranteeing for our business'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'customers. hurting your behavior

    in the direction of our revenues'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and ultimately our process.

    Okay? Because what is new here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is that at no other time in

    history, have the wealthiest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'private corporations have at

    their disposal? A pervasive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'global architecture of

    ubiquitous computation, able to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'announce on parallel

    concentrations of information'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about individuals, groups and

    populations, sufficient to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'robots the pivot from the

    monitoring to the actuation of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'behavior remotely? And at scale?

    This, my friends, is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unprecedented. What is this new

    power? It works its will through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the medium of digital

    instrumentation is not sending'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anybody to our homes at night to

    take us to the Gulag or they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can''t. It''s not threatening us

    with murder or terror. It is not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'totalitarian power. But it is a

    new and unprecedented form of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'power just as totalitarian

    totalitarianism. totalitarianism'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'presented itself as a new and

    unprecedented power in the 20th'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'century. This new power is what

    I call instrumentarium power. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'works its well remotely. It

    comes to us secretly, quietly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And if we ever know it''s there,

    they might actually greet us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a cappuccino and a smile.

    Nevertheless, it represents a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'global means of behavioral

    modification, and is the engine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of growth for surveillance

    capitalism.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so here we are. We''ve now

    climbed a mountain. We''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'climbed the mountain of the

    division of learning. And we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'peeked inside the fortress into

    the AI hall into these backstage'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operations. And what have we

    said? A friend to your operation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'run by geniuses, funded by

    immense amounts of kappa are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they solving the climate crisis?

    Are they curing cancers? Are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they super now how to get rid of

    all those plastic particles that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now even are detectable in the

    Arctic snow? No, they''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing any of that. Instead, all

    of that genius and all of that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'capital is dedicated to knowing

    everything about us and pivoting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that knowledge to the remote

    control'
  persid: ''
- desc: people for profit.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is how the age of

    surveillance capitalism becomes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an Age of Conquest. So, you

    know, we''re meant to sleepwalk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through all of this. We''re meant

    to be ignorant. This is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'engineered for our aprons. Mark

    Zuckerberg says privacy is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'future, very confusing. So now

    we''re living in a time when we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'understand that privacy is a

    collective action problem. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have to look now to only one

    source for remedies here. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that source is democracy. That

    is law. And that means new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'regulatory paradigms. And when

    we''re talking with Toby, we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be getting into more details on

    this. But I want to call your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attention to at least two things

    that I think are immediately'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important. And once we start

    talking about them, and begin to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get used to them a little bit in

    our imaginations, they won''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sign as strange as they might

    sound when I say them right now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The key thing that confronts us

    here is to interrupt the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incentives for the surveillance

    data. We essentially need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'outlaw the surveillance

    dividend. Once we do that, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'open up the competitive space

    for the 1000s and hundreds of'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1000s And indeed, millions of

    young people, entrepreneurs,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'companies, who want to produce

    digital products and services'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that will address climate that

    will address our real needs that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will cure the cancers that

    plague us that will do all of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the things that we want to be

    expected from the digital. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they will be able to do them

    without having to compete on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surveillance data. That''s what

    we need. So, two things I want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to suggest. One is that we

    interrupt supply and the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is that we interrupt demand by

    interrupting supply. I mean,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the illegitimate secret

    unilateral taking of human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experience for translation into

    data should be illegal.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The surveillance capitalists

    have fought this fight that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ve heard about in 1997 and

    continues literally every day.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They are sought for the right to

    take our faces, whenever and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wherever they want to. They take

    our faces on the street. They'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take our faces in the park. They

    take our faces when and wherever'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they want to our faces built

    into their facial recognition'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'systems, facial recognition

    systems training data sets, data'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sets, we now find out often sold

    to military operations military'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'divisions, including those

    military operations that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'imprisoning members of the

    Uighur minority in central China'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and open our prison where the

    only walls are faithful and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'finishing systems. That''s what I

    mean by the way, privacy is not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'private. Okay, so we interrupt

    supply. The next thing that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can do is interrupt demand. And

    that means we eliminate the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incentives to sell predictions

    of human behavior. How do we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that? We make markets that trade

    new and futures illegal. Other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'markets are illegal. Market

    situated human origins are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'illegal. Why? Because they have

    predictably destructive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consequences for people and for

    democracy. markets and trade in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'human slaves are illegal because

    they have predictably disruptive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consequences. Market situated

    and human babies are illegal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because they have predictably

    disruptive consequences markets'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that trade human futures should

    be illegal. Because first they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are the enemies of human

    autonomy. Because their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'competitive dynamics require

    economies of action, for which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'human agency is the enemy. And

    second, because they inevitably'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'produce the extreme asymmetries

    of knowledge and the power that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accrues to knowledge. The Kree

    epistemic inequality, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'epistemic injustice.

    Surveillance capitalists are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rich and powerful that they are

    not invulnerable. They have an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Achilles heel, do you know what

    that is? They fear law. They see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lawmakers who are not confused

    in and intimidated but'
  persid: ''
- desc: ultimately
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they fear citizens who are ready

    to demand a digital future that'
  persid: ''
- desc: we can call home thank you
  persid: ''
- desc: swear Do you think
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some people are empowered and

    they want to get up and start on'
  persid: ''
- desc: actions right away
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a time of class

    that''s good'
  persid: ''
- desc: man questions
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see, I said that because of the

    dedicated team and I want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: reward the dedicated people
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dedicated people want to be

    rewarded.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I heard one yes anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: that was too much
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I thought about making it

    illegal in the way that we made'
  persid: ''
- desc: like the slave trade illegal.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So surveillance capitalism

    that''s what''s behind your'
  persid: ''
- desc: camera.
  persid: ''
- desc: In the vending machine.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not sure from puts the error

    messages maybe it''s somebody'
  persid: ''
- desc: working against capitalism.
  persid: ''
- desc: Clinically
  persid: ''
- desc: 'food for thought whether people

    were exposing things in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'engineer, the scientist who was

    forced to build the Deathstar'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that he worked to put a backdoor

    in a way of vulnerability'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that could be destroyed.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sidewalker in the Force? Maybe

    this is an example of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exposing the thing that''s

    supposed to be invisible.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when she talks about

    integration mistakes being the'
  persid: ''
- desc: innovations
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so are these mistakes? Can we

    also think about them as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'examples of dark patterns? That

    over work so. Oh, gee, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sorry. I didn''t do that very

    well. Why I was saying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Could that be like a Trojan

    horse perhaps.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I wanted to talk about the

    midterm for a bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Smartphones. This was supposed

    to be an R and then a V. Kinda'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looks like a WD. Observation

    observations'
  persid: ''
- desc: so the exam is too short.
  persid: ''
- desc: The first version finishes No.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I'm thinking file will be.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But one sinking around 1.4

    minutes per question.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So not everyone is an English as

    English as a first language.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So having the sign out sheets

    broken down by the first letter'
  persid: ''
- desc: of the last name
  persid: ''
- desc: cause problems
  persid: ''
- desc: so last was
  persid: ''
- desc: 54 pages long
  persid: ''
- desc: was also an issue. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the signup process could have

    been done differently.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe the signup could have been

    at the back. Exams could have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'been collected by the TAs as

    people were finished.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes. What if instead of having

    to search through the list of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'names and faces for the mentor?

    It''s just like a sign up sheet.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Write your name student number.

    Search through a whole list of'
  persid: ''
- desc: students
  persid: ''
- desc: yes that's possibility.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would say it''s even just

    enough to get to the student'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'numbers. So and that''s only as a

    way to prove people say I wrote'
  persid: ''
- desc: the midterm. I wrote the exam.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I can go through the list to

    see whether or not they''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'written the student number on

    the list.'
  persid: ''
- desc: That's one possibility.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the reason I''m bringing this

    up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is we''re discussing about

    surveillance capitalism is about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to have a barcode scanner for

    your student ID card. or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'less the cuts of biometrics.

    Prove that you are here and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re who you say you were. And

    you''re not a ringer completing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the exam for somebody else. Who

    likes that idea? Nobody is that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a real goal? Or is it I''m not

    matter what you say? You''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'leveraging silence in class

    right? Now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, computer science students

    are not the most interactive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'classes. So yes, I''m really good

    at profiling there. I suppose.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So are your thoughts about this?

    Really. So the idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for invigilator says check the

    ID some people aren''t the desks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but the exams were too short.

    And the start times are sad. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some people finish quite quickly

    after other people started'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, could you check IDs before

    somebody has given the exam?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like everybody sign in instead

    of signing out? And that way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everybody when they''re done

    their exam can just give the'
  persid: ''
- desc: exam and go.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Also, maybe be better to just

    have someone like at the back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we come into the room

    because then we check our idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and don''t have to worry about

    it. Everybody in the room has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'already had their IV check. Just

    go to balancer exam bouncer'
  persid: ''
- desc: so you saw the lineup start
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the lineup before the class is

    better than having to wait for'
  persid: ''
- desc: '20 minutes after you''re done

    your exam especially since I had'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a midterm the same like the next

    class after that. So if I had to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wait, that would have not been

    very good. I would have missed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part of my midterm sort of

    thing. So to wait before I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s better than waiting after.

    If you have to wait any time'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: That's a good suggestion.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is this in the Bible? The Bible

    exam? Is'
  persid: ''
- desc: it the same?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can talk about this because

    there''s there''s some variation'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we can talk
  persid: ''
- desc: about not sure if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the intent is that would be the

    same kind of setup as the exam'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the final exam is going to be in

    the gym'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I didn''t come to class and

    thinking that it was gonna be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: walk in the park
  persid: ''
- desc: with the midterms.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I didn''t I was not trying to

    be frivolous in the way that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: set things up.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But lots of things have changed.

    In the past few months even I'
  persid: ''
- desc: suppose.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I appreciate your feedback,

    your comments and suggestions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and maybe this will help to

    streamline things in the future.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The way you think about the

    barcode idea really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just like the gym has a barcode

    scanner that''s on your face and'
  persid: ''
- desc: students stuff on it.
  persid: ''
- desc: In the gym for exams, or why
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, no like the actual fitness

    center running track, their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'barcode scanner, you scan it

    that they kind of just look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you and make sure that you''re in

    the person walking'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the business
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so I think those are good

    ideas that may be practical in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the not too distant future.

    Maybe we can write midterms in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the gym teacher as well. Because

    I think this is classic Twitter'
  persid: ''
- desc: '96 So 260 296 There''s not a lot

    of spare space. So, going into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'desks and checking ID is not

    really practical. We have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'barcode scanners, Fitness and

    Lifestyle Center.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Solution
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a gymnasium. My job was put off

    in aisles and check to remember'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''ll be easier in the gym

    compared to make sense out of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the water bottles. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s why we''re going to have

    the gems at all possible'
  persid: ''

    there was a sign about it sounds'
  persid: ''
- desc: that would be see what
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they didn''t have my Chroma sorry

    people in the back row. I turned'
  persid: ''
- desc: it off.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I apologize. Those diligent

    students who were put in an'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'So anything anyone like to say?

    Baldness'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. It was pretty long.
