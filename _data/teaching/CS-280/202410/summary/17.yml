- desc: All right Hello
  persid: ''
- desc: How's everyone today
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to underscore the word

    preliminary or emphasize that or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'underscore is emphasizing

    limitary'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay so I said I would give you

    grades today I have we''ll see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this suddenly change go up but

    these are the results from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: scanning drawings
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so those are there so the other

    thing was about the camera we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talked about this camera and I

    don''t know if there''s another'
  persid: ''
- desc: one
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what does that sign mean to

    you attention cameras'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operational during this exam

    period'
  persid: ''
- desc: seemed like it's on now
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we turned it on, we turned it

    on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Are you able to turn it on?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can. I went. So I asked what

    was formerly known as ad'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'services. We''ll have the camera

    because I thought this would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a good thing to turn on during

    the exam. One of the rumors back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'almost to capacity. They said

    no, we don''t do those cameras.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We have to talk to Protective

    Services, which is the new name'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for campus security. So I made

    some inquiries there and let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: see what we can do with him.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would ask how to request to be

    turned on for exams can I see a'
  persid: ''
- desc: sample of the video
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learn that it''s always on for

    safety reasons so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no fly became agitated because

    of my frustration with you our'
  persid: ''
- desc: courses groups
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you were worried for your

    safety cameras they''re being'
  persid: ''
- desc: monitored at protective services
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the reason I mentioned your

    courses or groups it was not'
  persid: ''
- desc: straightforward
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to take the individual groups

    and put them together I thought'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'after a while I would become

    better at it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s missing a button or two I

    think maybe combine groups'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway you don''t have to worry

    about that. So is there anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who submitted assignment one for

    the infographic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, I know last people

    submitted where you indicate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your group on your submission

    but you haven''t set it up and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you haven''t indicated through me

    working horses to set up set it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up with your horses so if anyone

    indicated your group only in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'submission send me a note so I

    can set it up in your courses'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because I will make it go more

    smoothly.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I don''t want to think that

    you''re not safe here with me I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t want to even raise that

    possibility.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sure you the policy for filming

    on campus or the closed circuit'
  persid: ''
- desc: TV policy
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s the policy to which I

    was referred by Protective'
  persid: ''
- desc: Services
  persid: ''
- desc: 'installation use of video

    surveillance systems'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see if we have questions about

    the camera after skimming this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'policy describes it so describes

    acceptable installation and use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of video surveillance and view

    of our cameras can provide a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'visual deterrent to crime right

    protection of people and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'property assistant overall

    security and increase the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'likelihood of identifications of

    persons who made reach'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'university policies and or

    committed crimes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so they don''t mention academic

    misconduct in particular but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that would fall under the

    identifications of persons who'
  persid: ''
- desc: may breach university policies
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video surveillance equipment

    view a bar to assist in efforts'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to maintain the personal safety

    of students and staff on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'public university campuses to

    assist with the application of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'university policies with regard

    to university property and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Property Brothers to provide a

    visual deterrent to crime to'
  persid: ''
- desc: increase the length
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to assist in practice okay

    personal information contained'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the recording shall not be

    used or disclosed for purposes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other than describing this

    policy cetera'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so senior administrators or

    designee will have access to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'view any video surveillance

    information available for that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'area only for the purposes which

    supported the installation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the answer I''ve asked

    protective services when I asked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whether there is video of the

    town whether they say that you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'told me that request has to come

    from the dean''s office so we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very protective of that video

    which is reasonable.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Should feel safe that protective

    services is rigged protecting'
  persid: ''
- desc: the surveillance footage but.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There or if there should be a

    way to say exams in this room'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are going to be recorded and

    made available to the instructor'
  persid: ''
- desc: for review
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is it''s actually more of

    a cabinet installation than the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'news service services is more

    interested in crimes deaths and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so on
  persid: ''
- desc: well
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe if you''re interested in

    this then'
  persid: ''
- desc: there anyone else on campus
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I just did a question booklet
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was for today it looks like

    there were no questions posted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or not getting marked off it was

    just not counted.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will add I will make the quiz

    available I will get to quizzes'
  persid: ''
- desc: and seven one next day
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking about besides being

    being new and managing groups I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought let people focus on

    getting the assignments sorted'
  persid: ''
- desc: out first.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought maybe we have a

    group discussion on this topic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that question what does it mean

    to be a sustainable practitioner'
  persid: ''
- desc: or professional
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s a good question Is that

    clear enough'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay shall we begin
  persid: ''
- desc: What's Up All right
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks is obviously
  persid: ''
- desc: Better
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you showing up last last year

    for extra set up See you soon'
  persid: ''
- desc: babies
  persid: ''
- desc: you seen some trends point is
  persid: ''
- desc: yours next section
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I suppose that''s all so, yes sir

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'literally put them underneath

    the TV'
  persid: ''
- desc: you ever
  persid: ''
- desc: seen
  persid: ''
- desc: for watching
  persid: ''
- desc: day to the fact that summer has
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blossomed philosophers call

    strategist also suffers'
  persid: ''
- desc: from
  persid: ''
- desc: really freaked
  persid: ''
- desc: out get an edge and being able
  persid: ''
- desc: to branch out
  persid: ''
- desc: this
  persid: ''
- desc: video basic is sense
  persid: ''
- desc: like they were
  persid: ''
- desc: like
  persid: ''
- desc: there was like to be seen as
  persid: ''
- desc: a failure for all the rest
  persid: ''
- desc: so glad you're here Good to
  persid: ''
- desc: see you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for more discussion continue for

    a few minutes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay I want to do three more

    minutes and then last session'
  persid: ''
- desc: see there's
  persid: ''
- desc: a lot of police
  persid: ''
- desc: officers
  persid: ''
- desc: morning I am live here noticed
  persid: ''
- desc: is definitely I like
  persid: ''
- desc: to do exactly what it was
  persid: ''
- desc: just like
  persid: ''
- desc: this segments
  persid: ''
- desc: for us
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to get around these

    organizations are also making a'
  persid: ''
- desc: huge loss just because he
  persid: ''
- desc: or she can't
  persid: ''
- desc: possibly
  persid: ''
- desc: 'together me thoughts about what

    it means to be a sustainable'
  persid: ''
- desc: practitioner or professional
  persid: ''
- desc: brand officer obsolescence
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All right obsolescence I don''t

    think so correct well I''m not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sure that it''s spelled correctly

    so the idea is we also design'
  persid: ''
- desc: products to be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exposed to yours iPhones or

    other smartphones it''s very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attractive to think about

    getting the latest and greatest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technology but the frustrating

    so I''m on this treadmill is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'updating phones every couple of

    years because my family is'
  persid: ''
- desc: interested in and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway the thing that was

    frustrating it''s an old phone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and a new phone I can''t use no

    pigs because there''s one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'measurement the camera just off

    by a millimeter it''s so go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'places and fit the basic

    dimensions of a full member'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saying suddenly the details

    aren''t so considering how to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'design products so that way

    we''re not creating more jobs to'
  persid: ''
- desc: be processed and recycled.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So another example of last

    lesson so I guess it''s my old'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'MacBook words from 2017. And

    became unable to be updated, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I couldn''t get the latest

    version of Java system installed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the laptop because it didn''t

    have the minimum requirements'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone have experience with that

    as it goes or Mac'
  persid: ''
- desc: Moore's Law Section right
  persid: ''
- desc: the same more, more or more.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I guess the way it goes is that

    every, whatever 18 months, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'double your computing power or

    something. And so over the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'course of five years, you''re

    gonna have 32 times more power,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I guess.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But yeah, essentially your old

    computer gets exponentially'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'slower. So they have been cut

    off at some point because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re trying to program for

    their new machines.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, how many people have switch

    their computers to Linux instead'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of Windows or Mac OS hello

    people are here anyone else'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that being a sustainable

    practitioner'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, what about supporting open

    source projects more generally'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is that an aspect of

    sustainability'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of supporting sustainable

    alternatives'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this side of the room many

    discussions to share for me the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sessions about being sustainable

    practitioner in information'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technology a lot of

    environmental impact happens at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the level of corporate

    organizations so, senior'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'practitioners inside of the

    software'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m paraphrasing a little bit

    but of course within industry to'
  persid: ''
- desc: change the culture
  persid: ''
- desc: okay anyone else
  persid: ''
- desc: this is a safe space
  persid: ''
- desc: 'safe space to consume camera and

    I hope I asked you to do that as'
  persid: ''
- desc: well
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, I''m not going to twist

    arms just have a mental picture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of me going down the aisles and

    twisting arms'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I heard about this

    organization on the podcast What'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on earth? And CDC? We''re talking

    about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'raising climate stories into

    film. So they did a test that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had the film was heard today by

    this current film set on Earth.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is was there a mention about

    climate change? And so they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tested the Oscar nominated

    films. And for me, is one of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'paths because there''s a

    reference to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'film killing the planet. So that

    was a way to raise the issue to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'movie did anyone watch the

    Oscars on Sunday night?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ryan Gosling and number boys

    seeing the clip'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re working. I''m going to show

    you this first. So the question'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is to think about, can we do

    something like this to help'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people raise the profile of

    sustainability in computing?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I''m certainly going to be

    through in 10 years, it''s been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just so hoarse from our lives

    climate. I mean, shooting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'burglar everyday conversation,

    right, good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'energy strives to inspire

    courage to face Crisis. They'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will also provide tools and

    support for those brave enough'
  persid: ''
- desc: to tell these essential stories.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re here tonight to ensure

    that we are reframing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'climate crisis in a way that

    people are at the center of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shore, especially black and

    brown, and did this and our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mission is to inspire, support

    and accelerate stories in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scripted television that reflect

    the world that we live in now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and help imagine a better

    future, but we''re missing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stories that can help us

    navigate it. The purpose of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'playbook is to change that. We

    wrote the playbook to help'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'explore the endless ways the

    climate crisis can be portrayed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on screen, from casual

    admissions to using climate as'
  persid: ''
- desc: character drive. In fact,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'USC analyzed over 37,000 stretch

    from 2016 to 2020, and found'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that only 1046 That''s 2.8% of

    the scripts included any climate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'change towards 2.8%.

    staggeringly low,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'acknowledging the climate crisis

    in our stories will help'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'audiences process their own

    difficult emotions. We need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about it in our stories so

    that we can talk about it in a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'real way. And the most important

    thing that you can do for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'climate is to write a damn good

    story, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'every story right now, that

    stuff climate change, stories'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shape our society, they shape

    our policies, and they have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'potential to make the

    impossible. Feel tangible. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'playbook is a tool extender

    provides you with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inspiration or guidance that you

    need to write powerful clients'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'towards climate change is an

    unprecedented challenge and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surviving and thriving will

    require unprecedented'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creativity. This is probably one

    role of a lifetime.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You wouldn''t recognize Bill Nye

    the Science Guy'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: Saved My Life So?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Evening Right What is

    sustainability pink sparkles'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway any other requests video
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Barbie passed the test this

    year when they were talking'
  persid: ''
- desc: about climate related mentions
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so are this just ideas to do

    something similar in computing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that we can raise the profile

    of these issues'
  persid: ''
- desc: what is EDI stands for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know Ed or I could say and we''ll

    fill it out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'counting the number of blacks in

    the board'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I don''t spend all the time

    doing a six letter word sorry II'
  persid: ''
- desc: end and
  persid: ''
- desc: alternative information
  persid: ''
- desc: use last
  persid: ''
- desc: Hi
  persid: ''
- desc: up what is that birthday what is
  persid: ''
- desc: diversity inclusions
  persid: ''
- desc: yes this is
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll take social metrics 400
  persid: ''
- desc: Thanks for playing over there
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay so what does that do

    diversity and inclusion has to'
  persid: ''
- desc: do with sustainability
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re designing software and

    systems and we''re making made'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sure to design the most

    vulnerable but also so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re thinking about our

    population of users or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stakeholders as being the entire

    population so when you think'
  persid: ''
- desc: about designing software
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think about it in terms of

    inclusion not integration or'
  persid: ''
- desc: segregation or exclusion
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right so maybe you can say

    manage'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'separately so we''re not leaving

    particular group might be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'underrepresented so we focus on

    making sure that everyone''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'representative and so don''t

    leave somebody else to'
  persid: ''
- desc: consideration
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so thinking about going back to

    Planned Obsolescence many laptop'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has one one terabyte of disk

    space solid state disk so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think Sure, I can create files

    that are gigabytes large because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can have a terribly if I

    thought like that too much I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wouldn''t have much left on my

    desk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so as we''re getting more and

    more capabilities'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are demands on the increase. So

    in computer graphics sleeves,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is not just an example

    whatever the heart, you say,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whatever the hardware rendering

    a high quality image so the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'capability of computers have

    grown a great deal over the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'years, but the algorithms become

    more sophisticated and realistic'
  persid: ''
- desc: as an example so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'another example of cars and say

    cruise control systems lets you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drive more quickly steering

    capabilities in cars and make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them safe for the officer that

    is that you can drive real'
  persid: ''
- desc: quickly.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, you may not realize the

    safety benefits because as much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as you do otherwise, because

    people are pushing the limits'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe we need to think about

    when is when things are enough'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'session on how to reduce instead

    of more Save'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as much as possible with the pay

    bills we have now'
  persid: ''
- desc: I just said it's
  persid: ''
- desc: again
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, one can 115 I guess if you

    can could there be more focus on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'resources so, you''re thinking

    about using things efficiently'
  persid: ''
- desc: and you're writing code
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not just those class with other

    ones'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think it was a few lessons

    proper data types and do not use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up all your storage which kind

    of complicated'
  persid: ''
- desc: so, we have this question
  persid: ''
- desc: could you see us classes
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, maybe think about the higher

    level classes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, it used to be the garbage

    collection and so on was the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'topic that programmers have to

    be more concerned about. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now, some of those details are

    hidden to handle the black'
  persid: ''
- desc: language environment
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone want to have a lot of

    thought about ways to increase'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the profile sustainability in CS

    classes here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more or less can draw complete

    PDF'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, the question is so can we

    read information that''s out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computing is a more sustainable

    alternative.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay another time I guess great
  persid: ''
- desc: to see
  persid: ''
- desc: Take care
