  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I did some research into the

    class so much to be the creator'
  persid: ''
- desc: has anyone seen
  persid: ''
- desc: nobody said
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay now that sounds very good.

    It had a 66% on Rotten Tomatoes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think that was I think that

    was quite harsh. So it''s it''s an'
  persid: ''
- desc: interesting discussion about AI
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, given the fact that I''ve

    seen it so it''s interesting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because of the story and I think

    it''s about more than just the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'director the writer, the

    director, the writer, camera'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operator. character''s name the

    Behringer global watch'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when you grow it, it was a it

    was a pressing issue than it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today. So it has I think it''s

    even more meaningful in our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'current climate. So there''s a

    story that''s interesting and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought provoking, because it''s

    also the way he produced when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they shot the film produced that

    was interesting. So we talked'
  persid: ''
- desc: about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I started on Disney plus so

    there''s a documentary wow the'
  persid: ''
- desc: game
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different locations and did a

    lot of shooting and then ended'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up with lots of footage which

    they edited and then they decide'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which shots you''re going to have

    the CGI treatment and so I get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lot of like natural like to hear

    successful big budget films.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This was at a much, much smaller

    budget and was able to produce'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very, very realistic high

    quality images'
  persid: ''
- desc: so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think it''s interesting to

    where if you had the opportunity'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two reasons to look at it. One

    for housemaid and one for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: story
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is it clear about how about

    making give you the option to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create groups for the

    infographics assignments are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'groups of up to four. So if

    you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking to form a group, but you

    don''t know people will not let'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you use a wiki today some age

    and a lengthy list your name if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re looking at form a group

    from infographics. So I''ve got'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an instruction here. So that is

    this game you need to this page'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re looking for a group to

    join. Once you''ve navigated you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'choose data from the drop down

    menu above will be set to view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when you arrive at this page. So

    is that clear? Select Edit here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and while I''m editing I''ll fix

    the missing parenthesis'
  persid: ''
- desc: ready to go.
  persid: ''
- desc: there anything else?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay any questions? Or concerns

    about setting up groups?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s a sample infographic

    from the Center for humane'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technology to give you an idea

    of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what might be possible so I was

    looking for format'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you can download this as an

    example.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s what comes up when you

    download it. So you can see us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very tall and skinny. So I think

    there''s different choices but I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think this is a preferred

    format. You can have your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'patients be able to scroll

    through so this is 2000 by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 12,000.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that gives you an idea of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what might be possible or how to

    think about organizing things.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said we talked about

    intellectual property and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'privacy. So let''s start with

    what it says. In the code. Here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let''s go as part of the code

    of ethics. Principle 1.5 says we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should respect the work required

    to produce good ideas and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inventions created worse than

    computing artifacts, developing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'new ideas inventions, creating

    worse and competing artifacts'
  persid: ''
- desc: creates value for society.
  persid: ''
- desc: So as always true
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, given that we have the

    assumption that we''re creating'
  persid: ''
- desc: value for society
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe not so caching with

    always keep the public interest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in mind in the forefront. Some

    of the things that we''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to go in and create value for

    society.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So those who send the effort

    should suddenly gain value from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their work. professionals should

    therefore we should therefore'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'credit the creative ideas. Since

    so on, and respect Congress has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trade secrets, license

    agreements and other protected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'office works. For the customer

    the law recognizes some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exceptions to creative control

    work are necessary for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'public. Refreshments should not

    unduly impose reasonable use of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intellectual words and risks and

    help others like in keeping time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and energy to process and help

    society illustrate the positive'
  persid: ''
- desc: aspect as its principal.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Jack is really free and open

    source software and were put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the public domain. The

    professional should not be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'private ownership of work. They

    are as a share of public'
  persid: ''
- desc: resources.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we want to encourage you

    encouraged to continue to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'progress in health society in

    open source or Public domain'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because moving on we''re not

    always being helpful or creating'
  persid: ''
- desc: value for society.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe we have two different

    ideas or theories. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: there's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s some questions about

    solar one kind of protection we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have is creating a patent on

    software so creating a board'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that requires examination of

    prior art'
  persid: ''
- desc: Is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe it''s an issue of hands as

    one side that somebody has to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: justice
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some years ago Amazon got a

    patent for the one click shop'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and is that what kind of tests

    are being applied to these'
  persid: ''
- desc: ideas?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So patents are very compact

    ideas. So the creators can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'benefit from the ideas and

    commercialize them, place to'
  persid: ''
- desc: some and so forth.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So on the other hand, we have

    other options to protect ideas'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can use our license Creative

    Commons.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Very common zero is about to

    sign things to the public'
  persid: ''
- desc: domain.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then also have creative

    power generally attribution then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'licenses some means to say that

    these ideas should remain open'
  persid: ''
- desc: to creativity
  persid: ''
- desc: using these factors we can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can leverage a larger

    infrastructure to protect.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The question we have here also

    is great to have things open'
  persid: ''
- desc: and do some things.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the idea of open AI
  persid: ''
- desc: everybody needs work
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we need geniales model to

    quickly here. So, is there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something I''m sure we can use

    to.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Bow Violence

  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that I didn''t have access to

  persid: ''

  persid: ''
