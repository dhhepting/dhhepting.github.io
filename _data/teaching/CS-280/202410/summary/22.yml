- desc: 'okay, so Eli Pariser was an

- desc: 'had a popular TED talk about

  persid: ''

    believe.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is anyway let''s have a

    look and then we can discuss it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s try that again. Goes to

    sound on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was talking to a guy at a

    party in California, about tech'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platforms and the problems

    they''re creating in society. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he said Man, if the CEOs just

    did more drugs and went to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Burning Man, we wouldn''t be in

    this mess. I said I''m not sure I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for one thing, yeah, most of the

    CEOs have already been to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Burning Man. But also I''m just

    not sure that watching a bunch'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of fascinating people run around

    and burn things is really the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inspiration they need right now.

    But I do agree that things are a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mess. And so we''re going to come

    back to this guy but let''s talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the mess. Our climate is

    getting hotter and hotter. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'getting harder and harder to

    tell truth from fiction. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ve got this global migratory

    crisis. And just at the moment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we really need new tools

    and new ways of coming together'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as a society. It feels like

    social media is tearing at our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'civic fabric and sending us

    against each other. So got viral'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'misinformation on WhatsApp,

    bullying on Instagram, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Russian hackers on Facebook. And

    I think this conversation that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re having right now about the

    harms that these platforms are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creating is so important. But it

    also worried that we couldn''t be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like a kind of good existential

    crisis in Silicon Valley go to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'waste. If the bar for success is

    just that it''s a little harder'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for Macedonian teenagers to have

    a spot published false news. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'big question I think is not just

    what do we want platforms to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stop doing? But now that they''ve

    effectively taken control of our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'own public square, what do we

    need from them for the greater'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good? To me, this is one of the

    most important questions of our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time. What obligations do tech

    platforms have to us? In'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exchange for the power that we

    let them hold over our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discourse? And I think this

    question is so important,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because even as today''s

    platforms go away, we need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer this question in order to

    be able to ensure that the new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platforms that come back are any

    better. So for the last year,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve been working with Dr. Talia

    Straub at the University of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Texas Austin. We''ve talked to

    sociologists, and political'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scientists and philosophers to

    try to answer this question. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at first, we asked the viewer,

    Twitter and Facebook and you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to rank content for

    democracy, rather than for ad'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clicks or engagement. What might

    that look like? But then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realize, you know, this sort of

    suggests that this is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information problem, or a

    content problem. And for us, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platform crisis is a people

    problem. It''s a problem about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the emergent weird things that

    happen when large groups of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people get together. And so we

    turn to another older idea. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'asked what happens when we think

    about platforms as spaces. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know from social psychology,

    that spaces shape behavior. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'put the same group of people in

    a room like this, and you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to behave really

    differently than in real life.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s when researchers put

    software furniture in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'classrooms, participation rates

    rose by 42%. And spaces even'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have political consequences.

    When researchers looked at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neighborhoods with Parks versus

    neighborhoods without after'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'adjusting for socio economic

    factors, they found the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neighborhoods with parks to

    higher levels of social trust,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and were better able to advocate

    for themselves politically. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spaces shaped behavior, partly

    by the way they''re designed, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'probably by the way, that they

    encode certain norms about how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to behave. You know, we all know

    that there are some behaviors'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are okay and a bar that are

    not updating library, and maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vice versa. And this gives us a

    little bit of a clue because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there are online spaces that

    encode the same kinds of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'behavioral marks. So for

    example, behavior on LinkedIn'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seems pretty good. Why? Because

    it reads as a workplace. And so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if people follow workplace

    norms, you can even see it in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the way they dress in their

    profile pictures. So it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'LinkedIn is a workplace. What is

    Twitter life? Well, it''s like a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vast, cavernous expanse where

    there are people talking about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sports arguing about politics,

    yelling at each other for in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to get a job all in the

    same place with no walls, no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'divisions and the owner gets

    paid more collaborative noises.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No longer it''s a mess. And this

    raises another thing that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'becomes obvious when you think

    about platforms in terms of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'physical space. Good physical

    spaces. are almost always'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'structured. They have rules.

    Silicon Valley is built on this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'idea that unstructured space is

    conducive for human behavior.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I actually think there''s a

    reason for this myopia built'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the location of Silicon

    Valley itself. So Michelle Phan'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a sociologist who studies how

    norms vary across cultures and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'she watches how cultures like

    Japan, which she calls tight and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very conformist very well

    following and cultures like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Brazil are very loose. And you

    can see this even in things like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how closely synchronize the

    clocks are on a city street. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as you can see the United States

    they want to lose their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'countries and lose a stake in

    the United States says, You got'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. California. And Silicon

    Valley culture came out of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1970s California counterculture.

    So just to recap the spaces that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the world is living in, came out

    of the loosest culture and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'elusive state and one of the

    looses countries in the world.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No wonder they undervalue

    structure and I think this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really matters because people

    need structure. You may have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'heard this word anime. It

    literally is a lack of norms and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'French and it was quoted by

    Emile Durkheim to describe the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vast overwhelming feeling that

    people have these cases. Would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have marks. No, he has political

    consequences. Because what delta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has found is that when things

    are too loose, people crave'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'order and structure and that

    craving for order and structure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'correlates really strongly with

    support for people like these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'guys. I don''t think it''s crazy

    to ask if the structure lessness'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of online life is actually

    feeding anxiety that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'increasing responsiveness to

    authoritarianism. So how might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platforms bring people together

    in a way that creates meaning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and helps people understand each

    other? And this brings me back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to our friend from Burning Man.

    Because listening to him, and I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realized, you know, it''s not

    just the Burning Man isn''t the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'solution. It''s actually a

    perfect metaphor for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'problem. Yeah, it''s a great

    place to visit for a week'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because amazing art city rising

    out of nowhere in the dust, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you wouldn''t want to live there.

    There''s no running water.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There''s no trash pickup. At some

    point the loosen the gyms run'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out, and you''re stuck with a

    bunch of wealthy white guys in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the best in the desert. Which

    you know, for me is sometimes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how social media feels in 2019.

    I''ve read fun hallucinatory'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'place to visit has become our

    home. And so if we look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platforms through the lens of

    spaces, we can then ask'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ourselves, who knows how to

    structure spaces for the public'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good. And it turns out that this

    is a question so the main'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought for a long time about

    cities. Cities is worthy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'original platforms. two sided

    marketplace check plays to keep'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up with all friends and distant

    relatives. Check Becker for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'viral sharing, check. In fact,

    your cities have encountered a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lot of the same social and

    political challenges that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platforms are now encountering

    is dealt with massive growth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that is overwhelming to existing

    communities, and the rise of new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'business models. They even have

    new frictionless technologies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that promise to connect everyone

    together. And that instead,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'deepen existing social unrest

    divides'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of because of this history of

    decay and renewal and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'segregation and integration,

    cities are the source of some of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our best ideas about how to

    build functional, thriving'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'communities. Faced with a top

    down harder than vision of city'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'life. pioneers like Dean Jacobs

    said, let''s instead put human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relationships at the center of

    urban design. Jacobs and her'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fellow travelers like AMI wiper

    editor, were these really great'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'observers of what actually

    happened on the streets they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'walked, you know, where did

    people stop and talk when the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neighbors become friends? And

    they learned a lot. For example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they noticed that successful

    public places generally have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three different ways that they

    structure behavior. So there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the built environment you know,

    that we''re gonna put out the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'year with a playground there.

    But then there''s permanent like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s put a banner that says,

    and get the kids out. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s this idea of Mater''s

    people will kind of take this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'informal ownership of the space

    to keep it welcoming and clean.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All three of these things

    actually have analogs online. A'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platform is mostly focused on

    code on what''s physically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possible in this space. And they

    focus much less on these other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two software social areas. What

    are people doing here? Who''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'taking responsibility for it? So

    like Jane Jacobs did for cities,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'totally. And I think we need a

    new design for online space, one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that considers not just, you

    know, how do we build products'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that work for users or

    consumers? How do we make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something user friendly? But how

    do we make products that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'public? Because we need products

    that don''t serve individuals at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the expense of the social fabric

    on which we all depends and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need it urgently because

    political scientists tell us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that healthy democracies need

    healthy public spaces. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'public friendly visual design

    movement is high. Imagine, ask'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this question, you know, what

    would this interaction be like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if it was happening? In physical

    space? And then ask the reverse'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question, what can we learn from

    good physical spaces about how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to structure behavior in the

    online world? For example, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'grew up in a small town in

    Maine. And I went to a lot of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those town hall meetings that

    you care about. And unlike sort'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the story about surgeon they

    weren''t always next. Like people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have their conflicts and

    feelings. It was hard sometimes,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but because of the way that that

    face was structured, we managed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to land it. Okay. How? Well

    here''s one important piece. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'downcast lands the dirty love

    the raised eyebrow, cos when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people went on to won or lost

    the crowd, it didn''t get banned'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or blocked or hauled out by the

    police. It just got the soft,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'negative social feedback. And

    that was actually very powerful.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think you know, Facebook and

    Twitter could build this'
  persid: ''
- desc: something like this.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think there''s some other

    things that online spaces can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learn from offline spaces.

    Although you might observe that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in coffee, public spaces are

    often in many different places'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that afford different ways of

    relating. So the picnic table'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where you have lunch with your

    family is going to be, you know,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'may not be suited for the

    romantic walk with a partner or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the talk with some business

    colleagues. And it''s worth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'noting that in real space, and

    none of these places, Are there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'big visible public signs of

    engagement. So digital designers'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could think about what kind of

    conversations do we actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to invite. And how do we

    build specifically for those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kinds of conversations? Remember

    the part that we talked about,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that built social trust? That

    didn''t happen because people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were having these big political

    arguments? Most appraisers don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually even talk to each other

    for the first three or four or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five times they see each other.

    But when people even very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different people see each other

    often develop familiarity, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that creates the bedrock for

    relationships. And I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually, you know, maybe that

    early idea of cyberspace is kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of this body less meeting place

    of pure mind secure ideas, send'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'us off in the wrong direction.

    Maybe what we need instead is to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'find a way to be in proximity,

    mostly talking amongst'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ourselves, so all sharing the

    same warm sun. And finally,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'healthy public spaces create a

    sense of ownership and equity.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And this is where the city

    metaphor becomes challenging'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because if Twitter is the city,

    it''s a city that''s owned by just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a few people, and optimized for

    financial return. I think we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really need digital environments

    that we all actually have some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'real ownership of environments

    that respect the diversity of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'human existence. And then give

    us some say, and some input into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the process. And I think we need

    this version. Because Facebook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right now I sort of think of

    like 1970s, New York. The public'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spaces are decaying, there''s

    trash in the streets. People are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of like mentally and

    emotionally warming themselves'
  persid: ''
- desc: over burning garbage. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the natural response to this

    is the hole up in your apartment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or considerably into the

    suburbs. It doesn''t surprise me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that people aren''t giving up on

    the idea of online public'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spaces, the way that if given up

    on cities over there. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sometimes I''ll be honest, it

    feels to me like this whole'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'project of like wiring up a

    civilization and getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'billions of people to come into

    contact with each other is just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'impossible. But modern cities

    tell us that it is possible for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'millions of people who are

    really different, sometimes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'living right on top of each

    other, not just to not kill each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other, but to actually build

    things together. Find new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experiences create beautiful and

    important infrastructure. And we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cannot give up on that promise.

    If we want to solve in the big'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important problems in front of

    us, we need better online public'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'spaces. We need digital urban

    planners, new JJ versus Oregon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to dog parks and park benches of

    the online world. And we need'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'digital public friendly

    architects who are going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'build what Eric claims are cost

    palaces for the people libraries'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and museums and town halls. And

    we need a transnational movement'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where these spaces can learn

    from each other, just like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cities have about everything,

    from urban farming to public'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'art, to rapid transit. Humanity

    moves forward, when we find new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ways to rely on an understanding

    and trust each other. And we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need this new era more than

    ever. If online digital spaces'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are going to be our new home.

- desc: good start.
  persid: ''

  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''

    advertising?'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''

    it comes to web design given'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the internet is generally

    considered free, like to just'
  persid: ''

    advertising space.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe you could look at

    subscriptions.'
  persid: ''

    office and the teleworking'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'this vessel. I meet people every

    Wednesday 10am to 10pm is my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'office hours. Anyone can come

    and talk to me as long as it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pretty far conversation can be

    posted to the internet. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called radical transparency. And

    so this space itself is a co'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creation with more than 100

    social innovators who come to me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and say for example, a team of

    designers and artists work with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people was trying some of the

    difference is instead of sitting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'down and say, Oh, look at the

    world in a very different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'geometric lens. So how about we

    make the artwork real and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consolidate this public

    installation of like the socket.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is the leaves a spirit

    of creativity and just talked to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me everyone said you can make

    the space grow more interesting.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s not just human this

    case, we have this self driving'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'robotic disappears for three

    times now each time for a month'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or so. So there''s self driving

    tricycles from the MIT Media'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Lab. The freezing a web pulse is

    that first is really slow. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t harm anyone if it runs

    into buildings or anything to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people. But the second thing is

    that it''s open source and open'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hardware, meaning anyone who has

    any knowledge of computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'programming or public can

    continue to fix that what the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'society wants. So for example,

    people saw that it only had one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'audit to read are in the middle

    beside the sidewalk, and it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not very thorough. So people

    would change it so that it has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two eyes, it can wake and flip

    it to and integrate center with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the society. And this is how we

    figured out there''s more how to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'AI should live with humans,

    instead of having the technology'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dictating the Society for Social

    Innovation and working with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technologists. And this is

    infused with what our president'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that good sign was said to me

    five years ago. That are in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operation. She said before

    democracy is seen as a clash'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between two opposing values.

    From now, democracy must become'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a conversation between men. And

    indeed, the traditional thinking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the government is like a row in

    the middle with each minister.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe they''re not as each

    different forces like for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'economic development versus

    environmental eco friendliness'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is like the tension that pulls

    the strings that is the dominant'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'itself. But now we have a new

    way of thinking of social'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'innovation and social

    innovation. We can develop'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'business models that further the

    social and environmental goals,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the government''s role has

    changed. Instead of asking, what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the fair the best

    arbitration, we asked two new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions. Firstly, ask even our

    different positions. Is there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some common values after that

    everyone can move? And the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second question is even

    Coronavirus, can come up with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'new innovations that delivers

    the size to everybody. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'indeed, in Taiwan, we use a lot

    of very novel regulatory'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'policymaking tools like the

    sandbox system that makes the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of innovation possible.

    What is the sandbox? A sandbox'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is essentially the innovator

    come to us and say, I have this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very interesting new idea. It

    could be about platform economy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could be about it could be about

    self driving vehicles you name'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it could be anything. And I

    think the individual says the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'government''s regulations is our

    fit. Now instead of fighting was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the innovator, leader regulator

    now saying, Okay, now you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'even a year. And during the

    idea, we''ve agreed to run this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your new version of the

    regulation, what we call a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forked version of regulation,

    and try it out for a year. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that whole society knows what

    this wonderful new idea really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looks like. And by the end of

    the year, everybody looks at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this hybrid models of

    transportation in the self'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'driving vehicles can save

    together whether this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually beneficial. And if it

    works, I feel the air version of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the regulation become our

    version of the regulation. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if it doesn''t work well is open

    innovation. So we think that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'investors are paying the tuition

    fee for everyone and the new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'innovative can begin where the

    previous unit Richard left off.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And whenever the members of the

    parliament think that we want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make a new law, that innovators

    are given up to four years,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'essentially a monopoly because

    everybody else''s will be equal.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And while that in theory that of

    course, by the time they figure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it out, the law and pedigree

    would enter the market. Now how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do we actually discover what a

    reasonable design how do we even'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this out that word indigenous

    the rural the remote island'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'since well, I for around

    sidewalk every couple of few'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seconds or so. So let''s say

    people come to our capital city,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and our queue states I traveled

    around so far. The greatest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing about San Juan, is that we

    have brought that as a human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'province. So anywhere in Taiwan,

    if you don''t have two megabits'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'per second of economic value,

    this is my fault. You can talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to me and unlimited data

    transmission with 4g network is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'less than 20 euros per month for

    everybody. And because of this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anywhere around it''s one of his

    setup is high speeds to with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video conference connection with

    the Taipei Social Innovation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Lab. So I''ve talked with the

    local social enterprises, NGOs,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'call us and so on and to figure

    out what your local social'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'issues and meanwhile inside les

    Paul''s different ministries'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people gathered in social

    division, but to meet it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through telepresence with the

    local people. And so this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better than the previous way

    where the Ministry of Economy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would get an idea. And then they

    will say, oh, we''ll have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consult the minister of interior

    for the world consult the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Minister of Health and Welfare

    and so on. And after like three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'passes, nobody really remembers

    what was the original social'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'situation. They''re just some

    PowerPoints. So in this way,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people cannot just say hello, I

    have to continue to serve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material because Minister

    interested in by next year. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people are really happy to bring

    some on the spot and to figure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out some ways to make this ocean

    and so the Emperor we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'public demonstration of

    facilitating people''s free'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'energy and things like that with

    a public demo that''s in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shower, racy, it''s near and icy

    real estate. Another great thing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about San Juan is from the most

    most to the sales most sci fi'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'serious, it just an hour and a

    half. So even though we''re just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you know, for the 3 million

    people, actually it is a really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tight knit community. So if

    everybody can just hop on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'high speed rails and visit those

    self driving cars like that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will resume at having the

    opportunity to try out the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interaction style ourselves.

    Now, when I said everybody does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a consultation to get each

    other''s feelings, whether it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'acceptable to the society, the

    emerging technology out there to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get what do I really mean by

    that? Usually, we run an AI'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moderated conversation. This is

    called polls is a open source'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tool, meaning just like your

    self driving vehicles, anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can see and modify it to your

    liking. And this is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consultation, the map that we

    have on the modular briefcase,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that is the first piece that

    Taiwan handled in front of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing. And here you can see that

    1000s of people have different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maps of the opionion canvas and

    view the blue surface in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'middle so you can see what your

    friends and family think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one particular social issue of

    your own place. And when we run'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a consultation like this, we''ve

    said focus conversation method.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And this means first we ask

    everybody for data. insight on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we sit over data. We don''t

    just input the government data'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have a system for that as

    well. Everybody contributed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'factual data for people to have

    a reflection on. And somewhat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interestingly, we allocate y max

    for people''s feelings about us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the data. And so that still

    sucks. You can feel happy. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think you''re angry. So okay. So

    after a loss of checking in with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each other, it seems to be moved

    to ideation. And by that we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say the best ideas are the ones

    that takes care of the most'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people''s feelings. And that was

    we have a rough consensus within'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just scandals, consensus asylum

    into new laws and regulations.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so we put a lot of fear into

    the design of the interaction.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for example, self driving

    vehicles, you can see one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'statement my feeling from your

    fellow citizen, you can agree or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disagree with it, as you agree

    or disagree dramatically move to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where the people that feels

    pretty much like it. But unlike'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'many other online forums,

    there''s one thing missing here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There is no reply button with a

    sub ID that if we don''t have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Reply button that shows shows

    Thrive probably because they can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attack that person, multiple

    statements. But if you take away'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Reply button, if you see

    something that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you really don''t agree with, you

    can just delete this. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of course, you can propose

    something else for other people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to resonate with. So after

    running a consultation for a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'month or so, we always get this

    case, this is maybe the most'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important slide in this entire

    deck. If you live on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mainstream media, or at least on

    social media, people often think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that society is divided by two

    dogs or whatever, right? And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re mostly focused on the

    Sci Fi thinks that is the most'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'divisive, either using POTUS, we

    can see clearly that most people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'agree with most of their

    neighbors, or most of the things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'most of the time, it''s just it

    doesn''t formulate the regular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion on social media. And

    by giving people a reflection of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the class consists of the actual

    paths, we can put those into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'regulates us, because it''s

    already more while cabling or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'deferring that legislation with

    the divisive issues. We can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experiment from another idea so

    that everybody has some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experience before deciding and

    so that that is how we deliver'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the social innovations. That is

    a picture of the people''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: consensus.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Lesson 14 The government was

    working the regulatory system.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There is wonderful launches

    series technology you can read'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and see inside one already

    started from Taiwan and went'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everywhere. In the world. And so

    the secret or God is someone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a really similar idea. All

    the government websites in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Taiwan as was G O V that either

    way, and this demand is G zero v'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that TW for each of the service

    of the public service that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people don''t like, or think that

    is too boring, or fake, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'isn''t the same. Instead of

    blaming, why everybody''s doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this, this multiple affairs zero

    is nobody that can do this. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in every public service website,

    in fact, it''s something that you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that it should you change it oh

    to the zero, they have gotten'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the shutdown and that is

    interactive, that is open source'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that delivers a fork, a new

    version of the public service.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when you find the 12 the

    first go zero project is called'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the national budget

    visualization. It used to be the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'national budget of Taiwan is 500

    pages two years and nobody wants'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to read it. But God zero makes

    it so that they become a de'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'facto there''s nothing you can do

    that to the particular that is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it that you care about as a real

    client. And visitors. And after'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''d come to additional minister,

    of course, I merge this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'innovation back into the

    government. So now it the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'purpose station platform of

    Taiwan, of which 5 million'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people out of 53 million is a

    part of. You can see 1000s of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different ministerial projects

    on procurement API''s and things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like that. Anyone can comment on

    it as a career public service,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'respond to your record without

    the delineation of NPS or of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'journalists, and this enables

    state over the effect of this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'isn''t stealing. Another recent

    example of good zero is this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'airbox experience in Taiwan

    people care about the air'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quality for example, PM 2.5 and

    so on. And so, about 2000 people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or individual can purchase some

    small devices IoT devices called'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'air box, and it measures air

    quality for less than 100 euros'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can be put down your

    schools and your balcony or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anywhere. And this lecture is

    measured for you people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'publishes to a distributed

    ledger or blockchain so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people can rest assured that

    people will not mutate or change'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each other some of us and

    measurements can suddenly see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much more because people can

    contribute their synthesizer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'measurements or thoughts that is

    not just limited to Taiwan'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because the airwalk system is

    open source anywhere in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'world. People can just download

    and run with it. And the great'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing about autonomous democracy

    is that we will we see this kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of legitimacy, strengthening

    service tech projects is easy.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then of course we join them. And

    so we look at systemically where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the map is missing, maybe the

    industrial parks, maybe above'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Pescador islands, and then

    we set up the gearboxes where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the people think you should be

    participating is quite theater.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So every year, we run a

    presidential hackathon based on'

    intelligence, the CI system, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'environmental data system. In

    the presidential hackathon,'
  persid: ''

    every year we get hundreds of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ideas and each idea is shuffled
