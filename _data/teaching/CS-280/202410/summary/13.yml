  persid: ''
- desc: think it is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how''s everyone today have a good

    break'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how did that first assignment

    go? Okay?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Morning day I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: Tracy Brewer drinking
  persid: ''
- desc: 'areas okay so can can we focus

    in front here? Yes comments can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you make them? Put your hand up

    so we can share them with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: whole class please?
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone happy that winter is back
  persid: ''
- desc: this brings to mind some
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ideas that maybe people are

    getting disinformation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the reasons for the wild

    weather'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so just ask the question Is

    there something computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: professionals
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can do to clear up some of this

    disinformation?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone wants to offer a common

    vote'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some of these are maybe

    sensitive issues'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, here we are in our meeting

    page and I didn''t check that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had formatted things properly

    and we see if it looks sorry I'
  persid: ''
- desc: think it does
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Was anyone at John Oliver fan

    so, there was a new episode of'
  persid: ''
- desc: Last Week Tonight. Yesterday
  persid: ''
- desc: we're talking about Peak
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Peak butchering, is the thing

    that happens to pigs to get from'
  persid: ''
- desc: German to bacon and other
  persid: ''
- desc: pork products. Scam
  persid: ''
- desc: so I thought was interesting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instead of people if there''s an

    app for something, people will'
  persid: ''
- desc: react positively.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So some of these scans are using

    apps that are available on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: App Store. Or Google Play.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So they''re on the App Store. And

    Google Play and are highly rated'
  persid: ''
- desc: so the comment that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was made about apps legitimizing

    things is Uber. Get into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nondescript car with no

    constraints, you don''t commit to'
  persid: ''
- desc: memory.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s generally a red flag. A

    few red flags there. But if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: have an app that's okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, maybe makes things more

    interesting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, Paul, I''ve caught up I think

    with photographs and'
  persid: ''
- desc: hair transcripts and responses
  persid: ''
- desc: 'record I forgot to do recording

    today'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you ever noticed that phenomenon

    that having an app or seeing a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer did it gives it more

    legitimacy?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh I forgot skipped over a

    little bit here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there are questions about the

    midterm or common so the midterm'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dark patterns and for whom we

    should design'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and also privacy. So we''ll talk

    about the midterm. So it''s gonna'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be multiple choice, so you''re

    going to answer questions on a'
  persid: ''
- desc: sheet like this.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Scantron sheet you see us one

    can.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Scan okay. So
  persid: ''
- desc: questions are not very big five
  persid: ''
- desc: options
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the key is to bring a pencil

    and an eraser because then you'
  persid: ''
- desc: suck so
  persid: ''
- desc: so basically there
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the current directions are

    used like lead pencil the number'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two do not use interval plans to

    make a black marks to fill the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'circle completely. There a

    screen any answer you wish to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'change with no stray marks on

    the answer sheet. So, degraded'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by this stupid sand and I''ll be

    graded according to the key that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I your application makes it more

    trustworthy. See what they did'
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's lots of examples of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wrong way to sell in the circle.

    biggest market don''t twirl'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'halfway all the way to clear

    which change the answer make'
  persid: ''
- desc: sure that he
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was clear which was which is

    your five slots. Okay, and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s versus last name first.

    name, middle initial. So these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are straightforward. If somebody

    has a longer name,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this many letters in this year

    for the fifth. But I think the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important thing is to get an

    invitation number so all I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have instructions on the screen

    there is a way to do this so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen closed book No

    electronics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'far as the number of questions

    I''m making a few. I haven''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quite finalized things. Yet. But

    there will be more than 50'
  persid: ''
- desc: questions
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t say there''ll be 150

    questions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when I said this to other

    people, I didn''t have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'violent reaction I heard from

    the audience just now. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s 75 minutes I won''t be

    more than 50 but more probably'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closer to 40 See, that seems

    better already. I''ve cut it down'
  persid: ''
- desc: by 20%
  persid: ''
- desc: 'still thinks I don''t have a

    sense of humor.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we had a response last time

    or a choice question. Are you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'concerned about having your

    personal information on the web?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so we had 116 responses. So

    the vast majority 96 of the 116'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, sir. 16 So the minority

    said no and then for people have'
  persid: ''
- desc: not decided to decide yet.
  persid: ''
- desc: So they put off decisions
  persid: ''
- desc: that gives us a sense of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe being in control a bit. We

    don''t have to.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Push it off to a later date. And

    then'
  persid: ''
- desc: now
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s appealing but it''s maybe

    not the best strategy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there were lots of people who

    said that the social dilemma'
  persid: ''
- desc: looks interesting. Last time
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve been in communication with

    the Center for Nanotechnology'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and exposure labs who produced

    the documentary. And I''ve tried'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again to request the screening

    that occurred from both exposure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'labs and times, technology

    checking my spam folder for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'email that''s been promised to me

    multiple times. Requested again'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yesterday. And then I know

    nothing has shown up yet.'
  persid: ''
- desc: But I have
  persid: ''
- desc: more email addresses to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ask for action on that. So

    hopefully we''ll get it sorted'
  persid: ''
- desc: out for next month.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So do you want to hear about the

    online hard Mac those of you'
  persid: ''
- desc: introduced yesterday?
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone hear about it?
  persid: ''
- desc: Nobody?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Left
  persid: ''
- desc: easier not choose that and again
  persid: ''
- desc: So.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Some people might say but

    doesn''t go far enough. Other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people might say goes too far.

    And maybe some other people in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'addition to one of those options

    that think that it''s also going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to lead to you proposed

    legislation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the question I asked you in

    the quiz was about matters year'
  persid: ''
- desc: of efficiency. And that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was Mark Zuckerberg talking

    about how Facebook was?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Prioritizing innovation
  persid: ''
- desc: or safety adding
  persid: ''
- desc: safety teams
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so apparently faced after those

    hearings, in the states make us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so even though the story says

    it''s the biggest stock price'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ever traded a lot of things

    increase composition or is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hidden the shareholders and they

    also bought that stock. So a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of effort to sweeten the deal

    for to make the cycle for'
  persid: ''
- desc: attractive
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so I went through
  persid: ''
- desc: our meetings
  persid: ''
- desc: So I am not going to
  persid: ''
- desc: be too small here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, here is my collection of the

    major things but there are a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'couple of links. Not a couple of

    there are some links in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting pages that might that

    were also used in our'
  persid: ''
- desc: discussions so.
  persid: ''
- desc: Last one so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a comment about what

    the midterm exam questions will'
  persid: ''
- desc: be like and what it will be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'based solely on the ones that

    are in the discussion forum.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So no, it won''t be solely based

    on that. Some of the questions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'suggested in the forum are

    multiple choice. So that we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'move on to make versions of

    those questions can be on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exam but they''re not all they''re

    not done covering a range of'
  persid: ''
- desc: materials that we've discussed.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can just go through these
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the video we need a moral

    operating system let''s multiple'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'choice question I can ask about

    that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Should I ask questions? Now?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s see the question of

    Apocalypse Now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: One person 234 5/6
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Question what needs to be said

    mentioned in class?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m just wondering if they lit

    up my hallway anyway.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any other thoughts go to talk

    about the more operating system'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video of David David Horowitz. I

    wasn''t really serious about'
  persid: ''
- desc: asking about Apocalypse Now
  persid: ''
- desc: your question?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the second one is how a

    handful of tech companies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'control billions of mines every

    day'
  persid: ''
- desc: and he talks about that one.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'touches on some of the same

    things that we''ll see you will'
  persid: ''
- desc: see and social dilemma
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Stranger Than Fiction case

    studies of software engineering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'judgment What are any ideas

    about questions related to that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Remember what
  persid: ''
- desc: was presented me.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'He''s talking about what

    programmers lack so not just'
  persid: ''
- desc: software engineering
  persid: ''
- desc: any comments
  persid: ''
- desc: to share with the class
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re right and then the

    privacy.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Any comments
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the the podcasts are all from

    your undivided attention what do'
  persid: ''
- desc: you think about that podcast
  persid: ''
- desc: scary sometimes
  persid: ''
- desc: 'focus on the positive things so

    much it seems there''s lots to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: wary of to be vigilant.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, book chapters I''ve put the

    links to the individual PDF'
  persid: ''
- desc: files there.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Chapters one three and five. One

    talks about combs. That''s seven'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'columns any questions would be a

    fair assessment of the learning'
  persid: ''
- desc: chapter
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I could do you think it would

    be fair to ask questions about'
  persid: ''
- desc: those seven cones
  persid: ''
- desc: again, I'm not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to steer pieces of

    chapters and trip you up.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ve used the example of

    this. This is the paper that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had you read what makes a dark

    pattern dark?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Question about whether or what

    Naval Academy has'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's a symmetric
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two choices you have days that

    are not equally inviting to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'privacy securing for example,

    one, the options that preserve'
  persid: ''
- desc: your privacy are the way
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and there are a number of

    namings.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here are some of the other

    links so, ACM ethics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'proactive care for computing

    professionals there''s the case'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'study we looked at another

    framework for ethical decision'
  persid: ''
- desc: making.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So other things you''ve mentioned

    we''ve talked about in class are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fallacies like appeal to

    authority. It''s true because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a highly rated app. Or it''s

    true because I heard read it on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the internet
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or they say experts say that

    this is the case'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feeding nature fallacies which

    is used less. I''m not going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ask the seer details about that.

    I''m going to focus on those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particular lines or encounters.

    Slippery slope view this very'
  persid: ''
- desc: way that have managed examples
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''ve also talked a little

    bit about the Tim Hortons out'
  persid: ''
- desc: that Vioxx is a violation of
  persid: ''
- desc: the privacy laws Canada.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'felt like there was one more

    thing I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: gonna read the board but
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t recall it at the moment

    are there questions or concerns'
  persid: ''
- desc: about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what we''ve talked about today

    what I talked about in'
  persid: ''
- desc: lesson two
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that okay, so I see most people

    got the assignments submitted.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Did you see that the infographic

    assignment has been updated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everyone see more detail the

    detailed version I''ve put onto'
  persid: ''
- desc: the Web.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a little bit about

    forcing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on communication and

    communicating above'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, individually or in groups of

    four so, by the 11 due date'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which is in 13 days, eight hours

    and 37 minutes'
  persid: ''
- desc: one minute before midnight. On
  persid: ''
- desc: March
  persid: ''
- desc: just under two weeks
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, when you submit it then

    you''re going with your'
  persid: ''
- desc: submission you're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'logging into that group so you

    can still send requests in form'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'groups if you like or change

    them'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the timely I''ve clarified to

    say one or more of your sources'
  persid: ''
- desc: so not
  persid: ''
- desc: I said earlier some one or more
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, the infographic is going to

    be submitted as the second part'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so choose a topic indicate your

    sources and provide a tentative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'plan for realizing your

    infographic. So there''s a sample'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there so we''re creating one

    graphic not a set of slides.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Here are a couple of tools you

    might use Canva and chart'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'session if you want to share

    other ideas of what tools to use'
  persid: ''
- desc: and are you not.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, here to do it on your own

    not have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a dolly or something else for

    you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so three years five excellent

    sources. evaluate these specific'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'method. So if you do this on

    your own, you''re gonna have'
  persid: ''
- desc: three
  persid: ''
- desc: out of five sources
  persid: ''
- desc: Everyone okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we find your infographic

    so I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wanted to bring up a couple of

    ideas navy. So you might start'
  persid: ''
- desc: with a resource
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and cognitive class. Not limited

    to things that we''ve done by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'March and anything that relates

    to the topic of survives assess,'
  persid: ''
- desc: is reasonable.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can think about how you

    address the society Ethics and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Professionalism issues.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, yes classes. So we have

    activity of seeing what other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'classes are being taken by

    students a semester so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that might be a way to say

    here''s an issue that comes up in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class last semester. And we did

    consider the ethical issues'
  persid: ''
- desc: related to that, or how
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we might be better deal with

    those fascicles. So that''s it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possibility of loss of strategy.

    Create your plan for drafting.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So find a new story that

    illustrates issues or themes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are related to the class.

    You''re online. Our bill'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'introduced yesterday that might

    be dangerous as'
  persid: ''
- desc: creating a guide that can be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used to become aware of

    important personal issues that'
  persid: ''
- desc: impact your daily lives
  persid: ''
- desc: and to take some action
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll use a password manager

    effectively'
  persid: ''
- desc: be boxed in or out.
  persid: ''
- desc: Make your
  persid: ''
- desc: 'online footprint as safe as

    possible. There was a sense.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a comment in the

    responses from the other day'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inside the possible inspiration

    for an infographic so I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: encouraged by
  persid: ''
- desc: why quiet.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t feel like I can let you

    go. 15 minutes. Early. So.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So thinking about privacy you

    might think we have a right to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'privacy. I just want to explore

    the issue of rights a little bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So right think of grades as

    being'
  persid: ''
- desc: due sorry.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We rolling the excise agency for

    ourselves and make our own'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decisions. I can study for the

    midterm'
  persid: ''
- desc: one or not.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Last example of liberty right

    so. So we can we can make those'
  persid: ''
- desc: choices or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have the right to our own

    opinions. So we can see those as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Liberty grades. And then there

    are rights that rely on ethics'
  persid: ''
- desc: to me so
  persid: ''
- desc: right off the
  persid: ''
- desc: bat sick so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Not that it wouldn''t happen here

    but smashed up slightly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I have the right to my

    personal safety and public.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s say something that

    requires'
  persid: ''
- desc: like a claim that requires
  persid: ''
- desc: cooperation or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re evolved into agreement

    that other people can enable'
  persid: ''
- desc: that way waiting for me
  persid: ''
- desc: so how can we think of privacy
  persid: ''
- desc: or other ways that we think
  persid: ''
- desc: can we use this dichotomy
  persid: ''
- desc: to describe some other things?
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone want to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be brave and offer a comment

    here?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry I didn't mean.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you''ve taken a picture of

    that'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I concerned about that
  persid: ''
- desc: breach of privacy. Yeah. So it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'probably me not having the right

    setting saying it''s anonymous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if I ask you, the author your

    opinions about other choice'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matters and I don''t take care

    privacy setting with his full'
  persid: ''
- desc: name or nonnamous

    participate was asked you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something more contentious than

    Are you concerned about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information or information

    online then I''m.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Space I see no easiest for me to

    violate that agreement that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trust between us with your
