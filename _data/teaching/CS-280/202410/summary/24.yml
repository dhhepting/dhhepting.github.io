- desc: 'sorry So Okay. Can you

    hear me already?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, I wanted to focus on

    inclusion diversity, equity and'
  persid: ''
- desc: accessibility today
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you laughing with me or at me or

    something? Else'
  persid: ''
- desc: so?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So is that an important

    improvement on EDI? Or is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same the state''s EDI safe to say

    reverse v and v. So they talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about Diversity Equity and

    Inclusion and as opposed to in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Canada where we talked about

    Equity Diversity and Inclusion'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Have you seen discussion about

    idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as, as the acronym for

    Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accessibility to me this seems a

    bit new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you we''ll talk about it in more

    detail I just wanted to touch on'
  persid: ''
- desc: stuff from last day
  persid: ''
- desc: first
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, there are a few comments

    about the team human the video'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the concept being a bit

    confusing maybe questions or'
  persid: ''
- desc: comments to begin with.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it touched on the idea of

    people are not done against'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people that are data sources

    that companies make predictions'
  persid: ''
- desc: about their behavior.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, I understand that whether

    you are going to be on Team'
  persid: ''
- desc: human or not, is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'working forward towards

    technology that augments human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ability and values human

    contributions more than'
  persid: ''
- desc: technological advancements.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, as you Keishon as
  persid: ''
- desc: 'education is compensation for

    working in service to the job'
  persid: ''
- desc: market.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s an aspect of the

    issue regarding'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inclusion diversity, equity and

    accessibility when we think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about what education is and what

    it could be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then the other thing that camp

    in some comments was about scams'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I just wanted to bring up

    that website once more.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I did a bit of research after

    class there''s no Wikipedia page'
  persid: ''
- desc: for this website.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Website deserves a Wikipedia

    page that look trustworthy. No,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t think so either. So

    there is I found some tools that'
  persid: ''
- desc: we recommended on the website.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I reviewed the website with

    those tools and one interesting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one I don''t recall which one it

    was with it said it looks okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But it seems to be very focused

    on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything I get isn''t

    everything that the website is'
  persid: ''
- desc: about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or has is related to

    pornography. So Google Sites'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t have enough data on this

    website.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And there were some others that

    it was apparent he didn''t have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bad information about it. They

    didn''t have any good information'
  persid: ''
- desc: either so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah. And your email address is

    spoofs at the daily scan.com'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t know that I would trust

    investopedia.com For information'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about top internet scams, but

    evington Police, Kaspersky,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Kaspersky Pardon me fbi.gov and

    the Canadian anti fraud Centre'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are much more reliable looking

    sources so.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So there we have it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like there might be like a trade

    off here though. Like the daily'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scam seems like fun. If you go

    back to the website really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quick. It doesn''t actually seem

    that untrustworthy like it seems'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to mimic some of the more common

    question like scam sites almost'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like intentionally, but it

    doesn''t outwardly sell you. Like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not asking you to purchase

    anything like free newsletter.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Send us your scams and then

    check out the podcast all of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which are like free to do and I

    think that while it may not be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an authoritative source, like

    the FBI, it''s the trade off'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there is that since it''s more in

    a niche, it gives more specific'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'information than like the

    guideline not whereas the FBI'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might just be like, Don''t give

    out your sin. There''ll be like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s this new scam that popped

    up yesterday and the detailing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exactly what it does. So I think

    in that regard, it might be more'
  persid: ''
- desc: trustworthy for certain topics.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so I would say not

    looking. Trustworthy is about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the web design here a little

    bit.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, HTML that ends up rendered

    is a concern.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I could fit on let me see. If I

    can find.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thought it was here, but so

    think that went to the archives'
  persid: ''
- desc: and there was nothing there.
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sorry. I thought I had to edit

    it to some things that don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: show up here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is from 2023 curriculum

    report, gamma version there now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not been finalized. But

    since we''ve been referring to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this version, already this

    semester. Computer science has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had since its inception, as a

    field of diversity problem.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Despite being a creative, highly

    compensated field with a myriad'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of job and other opportunities

    racial gender and other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inequities in representation are

    pervasive. For too many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'students, their first computer

    science course is their last.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There are many factors including

    the legacy of systemic racism'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ableism, sexism, classism, and

    other injustices that contribute'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the lack of diverse

    identities within computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'science and there is no single

    Quick Fix that''s inaccurate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s inaccurate based on page

    views, talked about and looked'
  persid: ''
- desc: at the semester.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like I just talked about all the

    women in computer science to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like that original programmers.

    Yeah, but anybody really seem to'
  persid: ''
- desc: know the word.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So those kinds of stories are

    suppressed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So is that an underlying issue

    that we need to address in'
  persid: ''
- desc: computer science?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how can we how would you feel

    about blank?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sake of long for

    computerization,'
  persid: ''
- desc: This
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second of these two choices, so,

    is the appropriate approach to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the bat. The way people do

    things now, to use new'
  persid: ''
- desc: technology is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that a viable alternative or do

    we adopt new technology? To suit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'current and well established

    human processes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can also add that qualifier to

    the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: the first option
  persid: ''
- desc: that difference makes sense
  persid: ''
- desc: Could you give an example?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is a bit more complicated

    example. The Phoenix miracle'
  persid: ''
- desc: system
  persid: ''
- desc: 'juicing process was in place and

    Harper was Prime Minister data'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'side processing started riding

    and we''re going to computerize'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it and it''s going to be graded

    saved millions of dollars'
  persid: ''
- desc: so they
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can take some off the shelf

    software to use and adapted the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software the attempted to adapt

    the software to the processes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Changing the processes along the

    way was the net effect that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people for years were underpaid?

    overpaid.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Lost houses became ill This is

    not a very situation. I''ll put a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'link to some of the stories

    about those things.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe another case so they

    were adapting the current'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'processes in the software.

    Instead of understanding what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the processes we''re creating

    software to support the simpler'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'case regional standards for

    doing things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are respected. They say

    well we''re going to search the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Microsoft Office for So do these

    things. So the users the people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have to adapt to the new process

    instead of people creating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technology and maybe it''s a

    different path technology or in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very little technology at all,

    to support what people are doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: what they have to do for years.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Facebook used to have this

    motto'
  persid: ''
- desc: great thanks.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Way to encourage innovation, but

    it doesn''t encourage many other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'types of values that we''ve

    developed over the years'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how would you describe it

    approach of saying you know what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you need here it is Be glad that

    we''re doing this for you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are we showing empathy towards

    the people?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Who are serving with that

    approach or getting something'
  persid: ''
- desc: else?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I wanted to show I want to show

    you a video.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think this is the one that I

    intend to show. They''ve changed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that a bit but they used to have

    three different versions. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s watch this and we''ll go

    from there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see if we can get through the

    video without ads in the middle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So team when I first got access

    to a computer, my parents bought'
  persid: ''

    sixth grade.'

    first semester. Enjoy computer'

    tic tac toe.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It was pretty humble beginnings

    of the first program I wrote'

    favorite color? Or how old are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you? I first started seeing a

    green circle and a red square'
  persid: ''

    time I actually had somebody'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'and say hello world. I made a

    wanting to learn all the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer science or trying to

    master this discipline or'

    started off because I want to do'

- desc: 'this one simple thing on

    Facebook. That was fun for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'myself and my sisters and I

    wrote this little program that'

    to it. And then when we learn'

    learned. And I know it can be'
  persid: ''

    are intimidating. But you know,'
  persid: ''
