- desc: 'the answer is no the assignment

    I had to talk to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you okay today it was

    worthwhile,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I felt it was worthwhile I

    thought it gave me a good idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of where I need to go as an IT

    professional and gain the skills'

    understand what it was asking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for you have any specifics Okay,

    well, I appreciate your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opinions. And that''s certainly

    welcomed. So from the hips.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. I have to go there was

    really good smile, but I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the thing is, is that there''s a

    lot of students that may be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'secondary, like, third first

    semester that might not have an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exact skill set to help those

    steps and so they''re all kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just saying no to everything. So

    it''s kind of like, where they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t really they can''t really

    decide what steps is actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to help. So I think it''s

    just like, it''s good. If you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'later in reverse, and you know

    which direction you''re wanting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to go to some help you improve

    the skills that you want those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specifics, but if you don''t

    really know where you''re going,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can''t really help you decide

    because there''s too many'
  persid: ''
- desc: options. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s some references for

    this class. So it shouldn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shouldn''t be as close to be

    their second semester, taking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this class taking one can and

    some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'English English is not

    necessarily giving you a lot of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'skills assessment so that''s a

    valid point.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I appreciate the comments
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is the mission and purpose of

    Kipps? Clear?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, that''s good to know. So

    the neurally article was popular'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I won
  persid: ''
- desc: there's another link here inside
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some of its some of nerlynx

    animal testing practices have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'been subject to federal

    investigation. And that kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relates to our topic today about

    economies of computing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s maybe typical quote

    pressure from neuro link founder'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Elon Musk to accelerate

    development it has led to faulty'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experiments and hence higher

    death rates. Need to Be.'

    you slay since the company was'

    they had a bomb strapped to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their heads in an effort to make

    her move faster. So is that the'

- desc: model of an ethical employer?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Many would like to work for Elon

    Musk with the bomb strapped to'
  persid: ''
- desc: your head
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, I thought I thought I''d

    highlight that for you. Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment. Part two skills

    assessment is due at the end of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the day today. Any questions

    about it? So in particular, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had someone ask about a month

    asked me again, the login'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'problems and some people came to

    see me yesterday asking about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'login problems. So for those who

    haven''t finished it says the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'logins and campstove skills

    tx.af/login.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I am logged in already so

    let me log out and log in again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so this is the login page.

    So you don''t click Login. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: click login with Kipps.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when you''re Kipps login is

    the same as men be dark com'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s where you log in for your

    Kipps membership.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay so the other thing Some

    people mentioned that when'
  persid: ''
- desc: you're doing the action plan
  persid: ''
- desc: 'manage your action plan. Some of

    you see show all add new action.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But you don''t have a print

    button on that line.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Who has who sees a screen like

    this with a print button Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s good but some of you

    don''t. So the people if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t see the credit button at

    the end of the line right most'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part of the line beside manage

    your action plan. Can you send'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me a screenshot and then you

    know which browser you''re using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a version of the browser so you

    can report it to the developers?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Any other questions?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So people who are not able

    to practice what would we submit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that as our assignment

    submission? Oh yeah. screenshots'
  persid: ''
- desc: of what
  persid: ''
- desc: is available there on that page
  persid: ''
- desc: or Yes, should
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we attempt to use a different

    browser to get a print off'
  persid: ''
- desc: a proper report?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You can try to take browsers but

    it''s also acceptable to make do'
  persid: ''
- desc: the screen captures
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I did that here. If you don''t

    have a print button, please'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create a document from the

    screen captures of the action'
  persid: ''
- desc: plan slash List screen
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I think I have some actions

    here are hidden'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are examples of actions

    that are have been created to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'address my hypothetical, the

    skills gaps for the requirements'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anything else any comments about

    Kipps presentation or or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: assignment
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m sorry if I''m breaking that

    news to you here'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this was
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first result and when I look

    for Kate Middleton news so, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'conversation says it has

    academic rigor and journalistic'
  persid: ''
- desc: flair.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I didn''t deal I didn''t do a

    lot of investigating why shared'
  persid: ''
- desc: that link with you so I'm guilty
  persid: ''
- desc: guilty of spreading increasing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'leads to get into this website

    because I''ve created to share'
  persid: ''
- desc: the link with you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I wanted to mention another

    other use is you lost a.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Canadians are less happy
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how much do you think social

    media issues were social role to'
  persid: ''
- desc: play I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think a lot of Canadians under

    30 seconds or less are probably'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the majority of the population

    on social media'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so the question is.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So does it make people unhappy

    or is this vibe here to society?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are you happier after you finish

    installing for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'us another article recently

    about smartphones making us more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anxious more unhappy in general

    and how it''s just changed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because of the way that we

    communicate with the world.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rounds down social media right

    encourage that unhappiness by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'amplifying divisions in society,

    encouraging us to join groups'
  persid: ''
- desc: that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t seek to foster

    communication and build bridges.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we also have an item about

    the 3d printed guns. I was on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the news last week. The Fall we

    made the multi provincial the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cross Canada operation that led

    to a number of arrests and'
  persid: ''
- desc: seizures. of printed guns.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So and the reality was the

    internet so Canada can have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'prohibitions but United States

    we have a different view of'
  persid: ''
- desc: dance
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I am the lead for device

    simulator'
  persid: ''
- desc: was founded by Cody Wilson.
  persid: ''
- desc: So Wilson is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you want some lawyer with that

    term?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe less anarchists and

    libertarians have no idea is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'freely available typography

    people have more is the more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'freedom they can hide from the

    government so Defense'
  persid: ''
- desc: Distributed
  persid: ''
- desc: user making
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some other states they talk

    about freedom of speech and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right to bear arms. So these go

    together in this case'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a little bit

    disturbing I think. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cryptography isn''t bad. You can

    use it to protect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'personal information and improve

    our personal security but'
  persid: ''
- desc: photography is also used for us.
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Perspective idea what''s your

    public interest in Republic good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at different again what the

    general population might think?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Have you heard about this apple

    anti trust case? In the States?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'green bubbles are the iMessage

    on iPhone.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So back to our iPhone or Android

    So who has Android? Do you ever'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feel pressure from people with

    blue bubbles? Or do you talk to'
  persid: ''
- desc: people who love
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to chat with a bit of a page and

    don''t receive messages that'
  persid: ''
- desc: everyone else received?

  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, I just recently switched

    about six months ago, away from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my phones. And I haven''t really

    found much of a difference is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like doing things there''s a it''s

    literally just group chats and I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have one group chat with my dad

    and my brother that sometimes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'once in six months has been my

    stuff.'
  persid: ''
- desc: experiences with that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in this article they talk

    about the difference in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approach for the Department of

    Justice in phrasing it in terms'
  persid: ''
- desc: of.
  persid: ''
- desc: See
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Apple is currently affirmatively

    undermines the quality of rival'

    which investigators might focus'

    been proven consumers pay higher'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m curious, do you use other

    messaging apps like WhatsApp or'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is that a viable alternative? Or

    should should the basic software'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'in theory it sounds okay that

    you could use a whatsapp or'

    knowing that because I was there'

    and I think iPhone is taking'

    go into it and encrypted'
  persid: ''

    was sometime in 2020. When it'
  persid: ''

- desc: 'So keep an eye on that. So this

    is what they''re a couple of came'
  persid: ''
- desc: up today.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Large language models emergent

    abilities are a mirage'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I just wanted to point out
  persid: ''
- desc: so on the one hand
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the big bench is about The

    Imitation Game. Standard so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'getting getting the correct

    results is the usual way that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The Imitation Game is related to

    the Turing test that it appears'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like you''re not dealing with a

    computer. You''re dealing with a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'person as the size of the models

    grow, so the number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: parameters tend to the night.
  persid: ''
- desc: That's a lot of parameters
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the buildings that existed

    when the large large malls have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this order, grounders or

    cableless didn''t exist, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'size of model. Trump here when

    we increase the number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameters so we''ve seen the

    sharp incline of the curve using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the standard metric but using

    other measurements this the game'
  persid: ''
- desc: isn't as isn't as unexpected
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so an example in the articles

    about addition as emergent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'property. So these large as long

    as that larger chat chat TV 3.5'
  persid: ''
- desc: and four
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have in addition but another

    another way to look at that is'
  persid: ''
- desc: just making good guesses
  persid: ''
- desc: such
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So on one hand, we have an

    exponentially increasing number'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of parameters. Then things

    become'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possible and when we used to be

    viewed as a big ad'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so taking the devil''s advocate

    approach and saying once upon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'guessing the right number of

    digits and a sum that''s the way'
  persid: ''
- desc: we get to the exam results line.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is an early line of

    inquiry.'
  persid: ''
- desc: The senator scene
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like to say the profs progress

    of AI is not impressive.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So don''t believe your eyes fig

    floors have been a problem. For'
  persid: ''

    posted today and so it''s talking'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''

  persid: ''
