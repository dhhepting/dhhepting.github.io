- desc: 'okay, I got the excuse me, I was

    gonna get some water which would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have helped a bit. I''m going to

    try and do my best to project'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'even without the microphone. So

    I''d appreciate your attention'
  persid: ''
- desc: now please.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How''s everyone doing today? I''m

    sorry. I''m a few minutes late'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m use I have another class and

    some food. So I just zoom into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that call and I don''t have to

    walk five minutes down the'
  persid: ''
- desc: hallway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll do a better job of

    watching my time. Before I. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m here five minutes before and

    not five minutes later. Anyway,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I appreciate your patience.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is meeting clients today
  persid: ''
- desc: 'English from Hungary and again,

    just to remind you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this happened to me once I was

    taking it when I was a grad'
  persid: ''
- desc: student here some years ago.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I won''t say how long ago, but it

    was a small grad class we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking about. Something about

    operating systems, I think and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then someone said after one or

    two minutes'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that stuck with me
  persid: ''
- desc: I should or shouldn't die
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I have honor sorted out

    today.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll get the transcript of

    the recording then.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I think what the only thing

    that happened was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re going to collect Drupal

    the price that I''m paying for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the service, but I think it''s

    still valuable to have that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcription. So has anyone

    checked? Well, that first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcript I posted so far? I

    think it does a fairly good job.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay anyway, the APA seems to be

    happier today. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's the main thing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how does the group activity

    go? Up people were able to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: something onto the wiki
  persid: ''
- desc: Nobody
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I know there''s some because I

    checked yesterday. And there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were 11 groups at something

    there. So to give you an idea,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re looking at something like

    27 groups for the class.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You get an email about my

    addition to your courses'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we had this discussion in my

    earlier class, so I thought I''d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bring it up here as well. So

    everything is in the calendar.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the quiz for today closer to

    30 response for today. opens at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 345 and closes at 11pm.
  persid: ''
- desc: So some things
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are listed as opening and

    closing times. But the quiz for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tomorrow. Our next meeting

    pardon me. Our next meeting on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thursday opens tomorrow at 6pm

    and closes the class time on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thursday. So the idea with the

    quizzes is to get give me a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chance to reflect on what we did

    in the class in today''s class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and have a look at what''s coming

    up in the material for the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: meeting.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s why you it''s I''m I''m

    doing that''s why it closes at'
  persid: ''
- desc: the start of class the next day.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And it opens I''m opening at 6pm

    So you have some time in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'evening. Before so you don''t

    have to rush over. I don''t know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what your schedule is like

    before 230 in the afternoon.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway so it''s almost it''s about

    18 hours. That''s open. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, that''s the idea. So how

    many people are using the course'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calendar I''ll show you a place

    where you can see it as well. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: let me go back here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so but I think they start out at

    being closed. So the left menu'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is sort of the table of contents

    for the webpage. And the right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'menu or the right drawer has a

    calendar in it at the top so you'
  persid: ''
- desc: can go the full calendar
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can choose your course and

    what kind of view you want. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: what I've done
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s no way for me to I don''t

    see the way for me to navigate'
  persid: ''
- desc: back to the homepage
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t think home is going to

    do it. We''ll see. Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how many people have used

    Moodle over the years? Is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: getting better?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I mean it''s you our course is

    based on shingle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, so I want to show you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'under the heading of general

    I''ve added the upcoming events'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the course calendar so that

    link will take you to a new page'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that opens the course calendar

    set up for this course. Upcoming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'events so you get the quiz for

    the next meeting included.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there were lots of good

    responses.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But I just want to focus on one

    comment about projects. So I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not saying I didn''t need to

    indicate that we''re going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t mean to indicate

    they''re going to be group'
  persid: ''
- desc: projects are the proofs
  persid: ''
- desc: for in class
  persid: ''
- desc: and outside of class.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we''ll get into groups

    again today. How''s my volume?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Good, good. I''m glad to hear the

    front row can hear me about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: back row. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you may notice that well,

    will you notice when you send'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'email and you are courses that

    there''s another person listed on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the two line
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, this is we have a TA

    Harris a skill is going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'holding some office hours to

    supplement mine and helping with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the administration of your

    courses so.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll get him to send an email or

    post to make a post to the class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion so you get to know

    who he is. So I apologize I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'still a bit behind on

    administrative tasks like email.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But I''m hoping this is I''m

    expecting this will be resolved'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soon. So some of you may have

    gotten an email from me last'
  persid: ''
- desc: night early this morning.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I got through some of the the

    backlog. And for those of you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who haven''t heard from me, but

    you may have noticed that your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'grade for the quiz on Thursday

    improved'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try and as I get further along

    in the semester I''ll be better'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at writing the answers for

    matching'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so set up the groups in your

    courses after today'
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So thank you for the

    contributions to the wiki. Let'
  persid: ''
- desc: me look at that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'See how many groups we have

    posted there'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the documentation for the

    wiki, there''s nothing about how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to get the table of contents to

    appear or to appear correctly or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consistently. So this is

    different than the table of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'contents that was there

    yesterday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It has something to do with

    headings but I''m not sure what.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This happens more than you

    realize and you are courses. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not the it''s not a top

    secret text they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'communicating well, here''s

    here''s what we wrote. But we'
  persid: ''
- desc: can't show it to you.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's actually
  persid: ''
- desc: its background color.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s like riding in lemon juice

    on a piece of paper. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'holding it over a candle to

    reveal that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So just be aware that this can

    happen and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m bad at it. So I wanted to

    thank you for following my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instructions about giving the

    user ID for the group members'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you want to have in your group.

    That''s very helpful. So we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: set up groups based on this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you. So as of today, there''s 269

    people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the target is to have 27

    groups'
  persid: ''
- desc: too. Small.
  persid: ''
- desc: Tiny seven groups of 10
  persid: ''
- desc: Sell
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decide whether I had too much

    coffee or not enough coffee'
  persid: ''
- desc: today
  persid: ''

    speak. It doesn''t matter. We got'
  persid: ''
- desc: a few more virgins.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's go into
  persid: ''
- desc: 'groups today a bit later and if

    you want to add some people to a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'group or if you''re new today,

    and you want to get in, get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'associated with some people who

    are already in groups you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'add to the list of the groups on

    the page from yesterday''s'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: if that make sense
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so I''m happy that we have

    had such good participation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So more about assignments.
  persid: ''
- desc: Is bye
  persid: ''
- desc: up. So there's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two assignments one would be to

    create an infographic above'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'photosphere some aspect of our

    course discussion.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m wondering if maybe we can

    make an individual or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an option to work in small

    groups'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'small groups that if you want to

    work on your own, you can do'
  persid: ''
- desc: that as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then I''m still working on

    it''s in the public interest.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Right. I don't buy it
  persid: ''
- desc: or I didn't buy it, either.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But what are some ways we can

  persid: ''
- desc: trading joke on that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, was the question clear

    enough'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''

    doesn''t make sense'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all the damn Hornets thought a

    need a moral operating system'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how do you make decisions about

    whether this guy is gay? Or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'leave us alone? And then make

    those kinds of decisions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'regular utilitarian approach

    where we maximize benefit and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minimize harm. Didn''t have to

    deal with the ontological'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approach where we say this is

    the way it is. Always we should'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'never use this data or do we

    have another approach?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when there are difficult

    decisions approach?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So last year I mentioned a prop
  persid: ''
- desc: 'browser it''s not hard to make a

    decision about whether it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right or wrong something''s right

    or wrong. It''s difficult to make'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the decision to make the

    decision'
  persid: ''
- desc: to ignore the question.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in my own course of action to

    decide like that kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decision would be for a vote. It

    doesn''t seem like any other way'
  persid: ''
- desc: would be morally correct.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So, if we want to vote
  persid: ''
- desc: do we have required
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do we require people to be

    informed to make a decision yes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So should we
  persid: ''
- desc: do that with our elections?
  persid: ''
- desc: Should there be a test
