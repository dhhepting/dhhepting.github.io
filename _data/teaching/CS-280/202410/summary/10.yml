    everyone I''m good thanks for us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wondering how long winters back

    for my scores minus four Yes?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re continuing our

    discussion of last table'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intellectual property and

    privacy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t update the title or the

    theme for today with us'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's where we're at
  persid: ''
- desc: so I wanted to say
  persid: ''
- desc: 'formatting problem I didn''t

    catch but I asked you two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions and I posted them

    after I said I would lit it and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I said I would so I''ve made them

    open until three today so if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want if you haven''t contributed

    your response to these'
  persid: ''
- desc: questions, you can do it now
  persid: ''
- desc: it's cold in here today
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''ll look at them a little

    bit later'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I wanted to talk a bit about

    the difficulty of material in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the podcast so I don''t want to

    be insensitive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I understand that some people

    can engage with that but if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have an issue with it and you''d

    like to talk to me you can send'
  persid: ''
- desc: emails or horses
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so do you think there are

    different populations of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'journalists because the second

    one was like I don''t know that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people are actually there''s a

    big push to call it smart'
  persid: ''
- desc: listeners Alexa
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the thoughts are that there is

    between deepfake and digital'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forgery deep fakes even more

    innocuous?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Examples
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think that''s the term that''s

    being used also gas natural gas'
  persid: ''
- desc: the last one is Big
  persid: ''
- desc: Data farming is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe a friendly term but data

    mining is necessarily an'
  persid: ''
- desc: unfriendly term.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So many people have an Alexa or

    similar'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four or five ads I''ve saw so

    concerned that your personal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'conversations are being

    transmitted Jeff Bezos'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might do Google so not Jeff

    Bezos but i It''s the minor'
  persid: ''
- desc: concern
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are some concerns that

    are what concerns are relevant'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or not practical in this era of

    easy digital forgeries so it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not even that people have needed

    a great deal of skill to to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create digital forgeries. It''s

    not necessarily about conceptual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'imagery either to be exact where

    the podcast was the reporter who'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was on stage and the people

    front and center technologies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reverse they got judged me say

    some nice things for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'journalist generate some

    attacks. ways that they might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'impugn your character so what

    Andy said in spirit he had these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these in depth interviews with

    Mark Zuckerberg. But then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have sidestepped well recently

    how to treat individual cancer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cancer relationships. And so it

    doesn''t take much to find'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'images. Maybe some sound

    theories is the other person.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You get some audio, video and

    they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then create some attack

    articles and tabloid style'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'headlines. Some images that will

    create the journalists'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bloodhounds Mark Zuckerberg, and

    green Some argue that was taken'
  persid: ''
- desc: out of context. These are
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's a burden on us security
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so any thoughts about whether

    it''s up to us to make sure that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we don''t have material that''s

    going to be used against us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, I mean there''s no way to

    really have any information back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'against this like if you exist

    at all I mean, if you have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'speak that any syllable you say

    be turned into like basically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they can say whatever they want

    so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, it''s pretty difficult

    unless you want to stay stay in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your home and not be a public

    person'
  persid: ''
- desc: at all public then there's risk
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so as computer professionals we

    can take that on to educate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people about the importance of a

    lot of reports so seeing as safe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as it has no contract with

    anyone but the risks that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'involved in this technology and

    it''s important to leave some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these emerging threats any other

    comments.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This one is versus an all the

    questions that came up in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responses, but there was

    something about software'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'patents. So, here''s the

    Wikipedia page about software'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'patents and it''s highlighting a

    debate about software patents.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's not a settled question.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So they said they''re not granted

    for code that does something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that people could do with paper

    and pen.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s not just about the code

    which is an expression of an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'algorithm because recipes for

    example you might think software'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is like recipes you can patent

    recipes so it''s talking about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'realization of the code in an

    environment with the hardware'
  persid: ''
- desc: and so forth
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, any feelings about whether

    software patents are a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: thing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone right hoped to write have

    get a patent on a piece of'
  persid: ''
- desc: software
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone hoped to get have a

    startup with commercialize and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'commercialize some intellectual

    property'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called the junior college campus

    cultivated by Connexus that''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: startup incubator.
  persid: ''
- desc: He's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just had a fifth birthday so

    we''ve had a number of companies'
  persid: ''
- desc: proceed through their programs
  persid: ''
- desc: so include us blog post talks
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a little bit about little more

    detail about software patents'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s three o''clock now. So

    anyone here still good to'
  persid: ''
- desc: respond to the questions
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so the questions were
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so, first question is two

    or three parts for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: professional skill assessment
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, let''s 6040 for two parts

    compared to three parts so well'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will keep it in two parts would

    you prefer to have the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part due before the break or

    after the break so 80% went'
  persid: ''
- desc: after the break
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the question was would

    you like the infographic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment broken into two or

    three parts the due date for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last part is April 8 So 6040

    again for two parts so we''ll do'
  persid: ''
- desc: that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and higher desire to have it

    after the break'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, that information on any

    discussion about that question'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, essentially having the

    second part due on'
  persid: ''
- desc: You Evening so how about
  persid: ''
- desc: '2626'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Right results are so many people

    have signed up for membership'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing that may concern some

    people rather than a yet an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'objection to doing it just want

    to address the concerns about it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay so this means that we''ll

    have deliverables and 72 weeks'
  persid: ''
- desc: after the break okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so given this I''ll I''ll have the

    details of the assignments and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the breakdown between the first

    and second arts sorted out and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can review them if there any

    questions on Tuesday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''d ask a question on

    encryption'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so are you aware of available

    encryption tools available to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you for protecting your personal

    devices?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So 60% said yes. 40% said no.

    And somebody said, maybe you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'aware of some of them, but not

    all of them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what are some popular tools?

    Those of you who are using them,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but I didn''t actually ask if

    you''re using them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone likes to chime in with

    some tools that are being used'
  persid: ''
- desc: or that are well known
  persid: ''
- desc: you anyone
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay so regarding Password

    Manager 60% said yes three 4%'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said no and few people selected

    what is the password manager so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what are some popular some

    password managers that are being'
  persid: ''
- desc: used?
  persid: ''
- desc: Use LastPass
  persid: ''
- desc: one password
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is the one recommended by

    Information Services yeah one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'person anyone else so I''ve seen

    so it doesn''t use the cloud'
  persid: ''
- desc: right it's just on your device
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was just gonna say I use the

    password manager a bit Warden'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so are you I once used LastPass

    now he''s one password and I got'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a thumbs up from a colleague

    who''s a security analyst for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using one password so I''m

    feeling better and'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes, I use em secure
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the advantage of using a

    password manager is you can have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'difficult to guess passwords 20

    characters long that you don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: have to remember
  persid: ''
- desc: keep up with you all the time
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he''s encryption on any of these

    devices so 22% said yes for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'desktop 60% for laptop 64% for

    phone and other was 24%'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you use encryption on your

    electronic communications were'
  persid: ''
- desc: '340 3% said yes 33% said no and

    22% are not sure because there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are different claims that can be

    made and if everyone else is'
  persid: ''
- desc: using something then it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but it''s fine to just go with

    the flow I guess our prime'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'concern and lots of other issues

    related to choose a'
  persid: ''
- desc: communication platforms.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought this is a nice

    diagram to illustrate public key'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'encryption so that''s so it''s

    called asymmetric keys.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, initially, encryption was

    done with symmetric keys, so any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comments so we had to have both

    the same keys to encrypt and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decrypt messages. So they might

    have been delivered by trusted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'courier might have a book of

    thieves or glittery black dress'
  persid: ''
- desc: courier certain name
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and occasional transparent

    security that you could operate.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And messaging secret
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was a that was a big it''s a big

    ask to be able to transmit the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'key security. So these

    asymmetric keys involve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transmitting information on a

    public channel. So each other so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we''re talking between two

    people to communicate with you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two people, we have a secret

    each person can have a secret'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but then they have a shared

    public key. So Alice and Bob'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'agree on a public shared key to

    us. And each have a secret so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their keys look different So

    they take this shared the public'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'key and combine it with their

    own secret key to come up with a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'new key that they can share with

    each other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the way the math works is

    that these are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the keys that result from the

    secret key and the public key'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be transmitted over the open

    channel and once transmitted key'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'combines with the secret key of

    the other person they get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: new secret so we don't have to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can we don''t have to worry

    about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'keeping many things secret here

    you don''t have to keep this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'public key secret you just have

    to at least maintain our own'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'secrets we don''t have to

    communicate these to the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: person
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s important that it not be

    too easy to guess what the keys'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with these capital A and capital

    B keys are at this stage so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the final shared secret key is

    not is not easily discovered'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s the same idea with paint

    colors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s many licenses to

    choose from. So if we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back to the blood show property

    protection'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one way to do this is a license

    to protect things in an open way'
  persid: ''
- desc: so they keep remain open
  persid: ''
- desc: Mr choose a license
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s quite a long list of of

    licenses here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: A simpler list
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You I was looking for a link

    there we''ll look we''ll I''ll get'
  persid: ''
- desc: to it in a minute
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here are a number of choices

    for licensing so we can put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things into the public domain so

    it''s not really a license so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much as its granting says that

    the work is part of the public'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'domain so Creative Commons zero

    is one of those things one of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the ways to do that
  persid: ''
- desc: your permission license
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it just gives it lets people

    do what they want to do with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: software copy left is that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'means that you you can make

    changes to the software but you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to publish you need to

    share your changes as well so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s protected against

    proprietary isation of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software. So those three or

    three versions are options for'
  persid: ''
- desc: free software.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you might have a non

    commercial license to grant'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rights for non commercial use.

    So an option is Creative Commons'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by and see the pie is refers to

    attribution seated saying who'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wrote it and then C says you''re

    not allowing any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'commercialization of the

    results.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Who''s heard of Creative Commons

    before?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So is a proprietary license

    traditionally used for copyright'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no rights need to be granted.

    Something''s a trade secret that'
  persid: ''
- desc: no information is made public.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So first software''s Some

    examples are'
  persid: ''
- desc: public domain and CC zero
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for a permissive license MIT and

    Apache'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and for copyleft protection of

    GPL and a GPL versions of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: GNU public license
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, is anyone writing writing

    software and putting out an open'
  persid: ''
- desc: license on it?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, the last line is for other

    creative works aside from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software so, we can say Creative

    Commons by Creative Commons BY'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Shara lake or Creative Commons

    BY which means a attribution of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who created it and see is not

    commercial'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, now that we have group set

    up inside of your perception'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, here are the questions my

    soccer fans Vic Thank you prefer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direct Salford proprietary or

    open license license which'
  persid: ''
- desc: license we use sense
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay so no that doesn''t make

    sense afterwards okay so once'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you get into groups and having a

    professional battle'
  persid: ''
- desc: with as a surgeon
  persid: ''

    discussions going anything you''d'
  persid: ''
