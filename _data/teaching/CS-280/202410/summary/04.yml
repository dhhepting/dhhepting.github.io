  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s my feeling about your

    courses email. I can''t get rid'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of it. So I''m going to embrace

    it this semester. And so I would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'prefer that everybody uses your

    courses email to get in touch'
  persid: ''
- desc: with me about class stuff
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve updated my office hours

    information here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can see the office and the

    office link that gets you to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Zoom office. So he can come and

    see me in person or via zoom.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And if for some reason I don''t

    have the Zoom meeting started'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'suddenly and you are courses

    email and told me to smarten up.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll run the Zoom between one

    and four on Mondays and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Wednesdays that seem okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll in my response to

    responses, I would like to give'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more, a more detailed response

    than I have there. But there was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one comment that stuck out when

    I wrote on the board last day'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about risks and rewards. And I

    put human intelligence in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'category of risk and somebody

    wrote that they couldn''t believe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that human intelligence is

    regress. And that''s not what I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intended to say. I meant to say

    that human intelligence was at'
  persid: ''
- desc: risk
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinks human intelligence exists

    at risk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and who doesn''t want to put

    their hand in class?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'As an acquired taste, my sense

    of humor. So I want to make that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clear. I don''t know. Not trying

    to diminish humans in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equation I am. I think we need

    to work harder to empower them,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'augment them. Give them more

    power and not less. So the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing about response and

    response This was there''s a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of mention of risks and rewards

    so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t want you to think that

    every day you need to use risks'
  persid: ''
- desc: and rewards in your responses
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s in the title of the class

    so that''s not unreasonable to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mention that from time to time

    but just talking about risks and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rewards isn''t enough to be

    considered a thoughtful response'
  persid: ''
- desc: so make sense
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I promised on for Tuesday

    that I''d have information of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: assignments
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m still working on some

    details but I can tell you there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will be two assignments and I''ll

    have them out before Tuesday and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we can discuss them as

    required'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in the balloon to bits so I

    want to talk about social'
  persid: ''
- desc: context today
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then I want us to get it by

    us I need you to get into groups'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of around eight or so and have a

    discussion so you can follow as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you move around get into the

    groups that you''re comfortable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with. And then you if you really

    like the group percent solely'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this semester for us discussions

    then wiki is when you make some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comments about once your your

    process and the names of people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who are in your group and all

    also class work groups based on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that if you''re just happy to

    talk was never'
  persid: ''
- desc: you don't have to worry at all
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he gets into a group and then we

    can we''ll use that from time to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time as we discussed assassins

    in small groups don''t seem okay'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so in the lone lone

    Tibet''s book chapter one that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'asked you to read the other day.

    So the authors present some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cones and there I call them

    cones because they''re paradoxes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like Zen verbal puzzles that

    provoke meditation and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enlightenment. These cones are

    or simplifications and over'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generalizations. They describe a

    world that is developing but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hasn''t fully emerged. But even

    today, they''re truer than we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'often realize. These seams will

    go through our Caleb will echo'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through our tales of the digital

    explosion'
  persid: ''
- desc: so is your Commodore here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a test of my

    handwriting legibility as I'
  persid: ''
- desc: transcribe these two
  persid: ''
- desc: there is one that's plenty.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how did I do with my writing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can see it what physician who

    said that in the room I''m just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'curious how far back you are can

    you see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'until one point you''re gonna see

    what number in the back or in'
  persid: ''
- desc: the front maybe number five
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe I should not read below

    here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can everybody see the first four

    items on the list? Okay, next'
  persid: ''
- desc: question. Can you read them okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and if there''s a word that this

    doesn''t allow me to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'understood you concern the ask

    and I''ll try and fix it up so'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's more legible
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Why don''t we do the group thing

    now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what I''d like to discuss in

    groups is you can pick one of'
  persid: ''
- desc: these seven cones
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or maybe more than one but talk

    about your group. What they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mean? Have some examples.

    Questions about this? Okay Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m looking for about eight

    people I don''t know how many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people are in fifth day not at

    capacity but still a good crowd'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe on the sides of the

    world or half the room you want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to try and try and get involved

    in a more natural science class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you right up You? You Are you

    Morning right Right You Right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'day right Right Right You don''t

    need to make my make'
  persid: ''
- desc: someone I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to say somebody''s using Wi

    Fi has something to do with'
  persid: ''
- desc: whether it's a collaborative
  persid: ''
- desc: thing trying to give you a space
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to grow sculptures bags This is

    mostly'
  persid: ''
- desc: for business
  persid: ''
- desc: purposes
  persid: ''
- desc: initial class okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah so the group I decided

    today to go with it we''ll have'
  persid: ''
- desc: same for this one
  persid: ''
- desc: that this meeting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be changed before and after

    today''s discussion'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is for an expert standing

    and what is the deadline to add'
  persid: ''
- desc: somebody
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay so, how are you doctor

    happening today?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. Okay, so we are just

    wondering like we are six people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right now and two of my friends

    I didn''t come because we are not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fitting back. So can we able to

    edit in assignments as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'designed for assignments or for

    a group for thoughts,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussions and so on. Okay, so

    we have six that you had two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more people who weren''t here

    just to their naming the meet up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. Yeah, just because you

    want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right, so your email address? I

    don''t use it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can make it the same no

    matter what if it doesn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represent or something like

    that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'For this reason, I did write an

    essay or maybe to just discuss'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, you won''t have a beautiful

    day on the side. Okay. So we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: think about assignments.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, and assignments, is it

    mandatory to do it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I may offer an option that you

    want to do, but I''m not sure.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for now, just think of it as

    being individual science. Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank

    you, Robin.'
  persid: ''
- desc: '16 But if you make a different

    hat, that''s okay.'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: categories
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, just to review the wiki is

    under the reading section click'
  persid: ''

    you can when it''s available you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can paste it into the wiki so

    maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit better idea to use like a

    discussion forum layout for this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because if there''s like 100

    people in here it might take'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'until like next Tuesday with all

    the groups in place'
  persid: ''

    page but we can go to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comments page so like on wiki

  persid: ''
- desc: 'sharing student numbers too

    widely that''s an important piece'
  persid: ''

    private anyway so based on this'

- desc: 'access to information you can

    connect to people we lose out on'
  persid: ''

    so much like you know like all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of this knowledge on this

    connection we still lose out on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that piece integral needs portal

    once and you got to come'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
