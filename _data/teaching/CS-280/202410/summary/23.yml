    want to mention apologize for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the website issues over the

    weekend so I have a version I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a program that I run I can

    run well I''m using Jekyll to'
  persid: ''
- desc: build my website
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone familiar with Jekyll? One

    person okay'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but I am a static site generator

    so I have to build the website'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I have versions on my laptop

    like check the bug and then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'publish the version of the

    website when I''m satisfied that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I realized when I was publishing

    house the local program. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: think
  persid: ''
- desc: 'files were commingled. The ones

    that have been referenced in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last website so your URLs,

    laptop local groups'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I apologize for that problem.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think it was fixed Sunday.

    Evening. But I sent a note about'
  persid: ''
- desc: yesterday at noon
  persid: ''
- desc: so so great.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s see at noon seven emails

    because all pranks should be'
  persid: ''
- desc: done by noon.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They didn''t want to partake. In

    April Fool''s Day.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I didn''t debug this well

    enough Fermat''s Last Theorem'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should be on a new line with the

    daily scam. And discussion topic'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should anyway we''ll deal with

    that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or I''ll fix it later. But we can

    still proceed here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I just wanted to

    mention that the part one of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: infographic is
  persid: ''
- desc: Karen's release.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can have a look at that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions or concerns then we

    will also send an email to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marketer who should get another

    five years view of science'
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's just
  persid: ''
- desc: have a peek at
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there were four marks for the

    topic.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, four marks for the topic. So

    not only should it be relevant'
  persid: ''
- desc: to class,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you should have a personal

    connection or personal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interests. Explain why you chose

    to partner.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Then five marks
  persid: ''
- desc: let's try number three.
  persid: ''
- desc: sound better or not?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You? So we talked about having

    one being within the last six'
  persid: ''
- desc: months
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but the rubric is focused on

    doing the SIFT moves for each of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the sources so the for

    individual'
  persid: ''
- desc: are groups.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then a plan as to Mars
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re not You''re not going to

    be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accountable for your class, but

    this'
  persid: ''
- desc: couple marks
  persid: ''
- desc: 'encourage you to make a plan.

    Think about what needs to go'
  persid: ''
- desc: into producing your infographic
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so that''s a couple pages

    of text maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any immediate questions or

    concerns about that? Okay'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I thought watch the video

    that we didn''t see on Thursday'
  persid: ''
- desc: about rush calm.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now
  persid: ''
- desc: let's take a look at that first.
  persid: ''
- desc: Watch it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let me see if I can find another

    version of it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Well
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this isn''t a TED talk, but I

    hope it''s going to deliver here'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see if I can do this
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, that's it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I hope that I was going to be

    able to not have to fiddle with'
  persid: ''
- desc: things.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'problem that I''m trying to

    address is that human beings'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think of ourselves in terms of

    our utility value. And that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to be us partly because

    machines when people are always'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'developing machines then again,

    to be consistent of what we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing here. I was arguing with

    the guy in cybernetics when he'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was thinking about feedback from

    robots that we''re gonna have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think about what''s the human use

    of human beings. But to me, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really speaks of a reversal of

    figure and ground reversal of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subject and object we''re

    thinking about how does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technology treat humans rather

    than how to human beings use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technology. So you''re no longer

    the figures we are no longer the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actors, the intelligent agents

    agency. So we ended up living in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a world where even those who

    want to make technology or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theory that that''s nicer to

    people are still thinking about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'technology as something that

    plays us and that''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'experience I have and I can end

    I believe is real right now is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I''m not using my technology

    my technology uses me every time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I slightly smartphone. It gets

    smarter about me and I get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dumber about it. But the

    response that I''m trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'provoke is not another technical

    response. I don''t think it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about let''s write algorithms to

    beat the algorithms that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hurting us. Yeah, let''s do a new

    rd of that and let''s develop a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better social media network.

    That does this or a better'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smartphone. How would you know I

    think what I''m trying to do is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit more homeopathic in

    spirit or naturopathic rather'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'than fighting the disease and

    even giving more weight and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'authority to that digital or

    digital monster. Let''s get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'offline. No, Let''s enhance our

    human resilience. And let''s face'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, enhance our own our own

    vitality, our cultural immune'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'response, you know, there''s

    weaponized news out there that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t want my kid using a

    weaponized meme filter. I want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my kid being strong enough to

    not respond to the weaponized'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right when in the states will

    have this Twitter phenomenon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where there was this video of

    some maca kid that she was a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mogga hat facing off with a

    Native American and it was a 20'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seconds it started like a 22nd

    video and I saw all my friends,'
  persid: ''

    media friends, tweeting that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'retreating I got this horrible

    fascist child and I was I was'

    minute, can you be as human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'being for a minute take to be

    smart enough to realize you''re'

    happened. Your risk theory'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'whatever the rage you have

    against the Trump presidency or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'against Maga people are against

    racism. And of course, you know,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as they pull back and became

    another story, and they pulled'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back a little bit more, and it

    became to get a long story. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the object of the game is not to

    teach Twitter how to make sure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that things bad messages don''t

    come through. That''s like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saying, well, let''s just read

    the world and viruses. No, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object of the game is to

    increase our own immune'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responses. People are collected

    cultural in response, and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way to do that is to have enough

    solidarity between people who'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can sit in rooms together, make

    eye contact, have conversations'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and not feel so threatened. They

    can''t tolerate one another.'

- desc: 'Every semester that I teach only

    taught for five years now every'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'make him a good worker. You

    know, anyone in the UK who knows'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the history of public education

    here, you know, common education'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was not to make better workers

    public education was started to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give dignity to the cola. So

    they worked in the mines all day'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with Lisa can come home and

    revenue dignity of any ever made'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a novel or participate

    intelligently in representative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'democracy. When we turn

    education to extensions and put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an extension on work. All we''ve

    really done is taken the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Corporate cost and externalized

    it to the public sector, as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ve devalued education, so

    it''s no longer to teach people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that they have essential dignity

    when they come in that room. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re going to have to learn

    something in order to be useful,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'valuable members of society, and

    the principles of the soul meet'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the CEOs of the companies

    to find out oh, what do you want'

    to know Excel means you know'

- desc: 'Java, you want them to know

    Python will deliver you the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'employee of the future. You

    know, employees are jobs. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s another story. Right in

    point but it''s fine five minutes'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'Renaissance. It''s not it''s not

    as simple to work. It''s just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s really employment was a way

    to prevent people from owning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their own businesses. They had

    to go work for troubled'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'monopolies. Excellent.

    Employment was born. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s a whole other story. So

    yeah, so I''m arguing that once'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can learn to establish and

    maintain basic rapport with one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'another, that''s when the

    graveyard conspiracy can begin.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And the word conspiracy

    literally conspired to bring'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'together people breathing

    together right now. That'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constitutes a conspiracy, if you

    can breathe together and other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people, because then the whole

    thing the whole artifice begins'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to unravel. And you''ve got to

    experience your power in terms'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of experience, the dignity of

    yourself and the dignity of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other people that go red. And

    once you touch that core of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dignity in yourself and others,

    then it''s much much harder to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: controlled by anywhere.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m going to try this link. See

    if that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I certainly believe that the

    opportunity that we have as'
  persid: ''

    systems is to generate new'

- desc: Some reason this works

- desc: 'I got invited to an exclusive

    resort to deliver a talk about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the digital future to what I

    assume would be a couple of 100'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tech executives, and I was there

    in the green room waiting to go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on. And instead of bringing into

    the stage, they brought five men'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the green room, sat around

    this little table with me. They'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were tech billionaires, and sort

    of peppering them with these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really binary questions like

    Bitcoin or Aetherium. Virtual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reality or augmented reality.

    That sir Well, and as they got'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more comfortable as they age

    towards their real question of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'concern, Alaska, or New Zealand.

    That''s right. These tech'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'billionaires were asking

    immediate viewers for advice on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where to put their key

    stakeholders. We spent the rest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the hour on the single

    question, how do I maintain'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'control of my security staff

    after the event? By the event'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they mean the thermonuclear war

    or climate catastrophe or social'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unrest that ends the world as we

    know it, and more importantly,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'makes them money obsolete. And I

    couldn''t help but think these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are the wealthiest, most

    powerful men in the world. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they see themselves as utterly

    powerless to influence the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'future. The best they can do is

    hang on to the inevitable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'catastrophe, and then use their

    technology and money to get away'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the rest of us. And these

    are the winners of the digital'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'economy. The digital Renaissance

    was about the unbridled'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'potential of the collective

    human imagination. It''s fed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything from chaos, and

    quantum physics to fantasy role'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'playing and the Gaia hypothesis,

    right? We believe that human'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'beings connected could create

    any future we could imagine. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then keep the.com bubble. And

    the digital future became'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'socking tricks. And we used all

    that energy of the digital age'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to pump steroids into the

    already dying NASDAQ Stock'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Exchange. The tech magazines

    told us a tsunami was coming and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'only the investors who hired the

    best scenario planners and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'futures would be able to survive

    the wave. And so the future'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'changed from this thing we

    create together in the present'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to something we bet on some kind

    of a zero sum winner takes all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'competition. And when things get

    that competitive about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'future, humans are no longer

    valued for our creativity, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we''re just valued for our

    data, because they just use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data to make predictions.

    Creativity is anything that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creates noise that makes it

    harder to predict. So we ended'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up with a digital landscape that

    really repressed creativity'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'repressed novelty, and repress

    what makes us most human. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ended up with social media and

    social media really connect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people and new interesting ways.

    Social media is about using our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data to predict our future

    behavior, or when necessary to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'influence our future behavior so

    that we act more in accordance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with our statistical profiles.

    The digital economy is that like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people know if you have a

    business plan, what are you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'supposed to do get rid of all

    the people, human beings they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want health care, they want

    money, they want meaning. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can''t scale when people hear our

    digital apps, they don''t have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this form a room for solidarity.

    I mean, where''s the button on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ride hailing app to the

    drivers to talk to one each to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk to one another about their

    working conditions or to'
  persid: ''

    tools, they don''t allow us to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'establish new work for however

    good the resolution of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video, you still can''t see if

    some of these irises are opening'
  persid: ''

    things that we''ve done to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'establish rapport that we''ve

    developed over hundreds of 1000s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of years of evolution. They

    don''t work you can see if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'someone''s breath is syncing up

    with yours. You''re so the mirror'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'neurons never fire the oxytocin

    never goes through your body.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You never have that experience

    of bonding with the other human'

    likely to creepers even just a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'few to really get me and we

    don''t we don''t blame the'

    we blame the other person. Even'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the technologies and the digital

    initiatives that we have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'promote humans are intensely

    anti human at the core. Now'
  persid: ''

    blockchain is here to help us'

    know the blockchain design'

- desc: 'trust in a new, even less

    transparent way or the code'

- desc: 'movement. Mean education is

    great. We love education as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wonderful idea that we want kids

    to be able to get jobs in the'

- desc: 'digital future. So teach them

    code now. The sixth one is'

    Education was about getting'
  persid: ''

    compensation for a job well'

    education was for coal miners'

    all day that they''d come home'

    be able to read a novel and'

    we make it an extension of the'

    guys, the former guys used to'

- desc: 'in our social media feeds so

    that we get addicted. Now we''ve'
  persid: ''

- desc: 'more humane. But when I heard

    the expression, humane'

  persid: ''
- desc: So why do you think
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, that's I'm missing most.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So who enjoyed the day guys? He

    made technology'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how many have an association

    between education and work?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's hard to think about
  persid: ''
- desc: especially these days.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You should study and not think

    about work.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Think about employment.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because Buying a house is not so

    realistic anymore.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There''s lots of things that come

    up so I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a new issue of the

    your undivided attention podcast'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I have linked to here for

    you to listen to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Moore''s Law and they say well,

    there''s some disagreement'
  persid: ''
- desc: between AI researchers
  persid: ''
- desc: say like the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last night at Monster for AI is

    good enough to replace'
  persid: ''
- desc: programmers
  persid: ''
- desc: I won't spoil the whole thing.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any thoughts that we haven''t I

    haven''t addressed here. That'
  persid: ''
- desc: came from those videos.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So a couple of things. In the

    news. This is from Popular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Mechanics. Try I''m getting some

    of these things when I get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blank screen in Firefox. I have

    some listed and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this one is current from

    March 27. So last week, machines'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are on the verge of tackling

    Fermat''s Last Theorem, a proof'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that wants to find them. So a

    sign about another indication'
  persid: ''
- desc: about the progress of AI
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then so this is the article

    that came across'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and it was reprinted from Wired

    but first ran in 2019.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So they mentioned a website

    called the daily scam.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s your sense of this

    website? When you look at it?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does it look trustworthy?
  persid: ''
- desc: name is Marcus
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is there something you can point

    to this?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'title sounds like it''s promoting

    scam but it''s the opposite.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let''s let''s do that trick

    with Wikipedia.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Guys. So wouldn''t pass the wiki

    pedia test I thank.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You and the thumbs down is also

    not helpful. I would say.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what I I did a quick search

    for the title of the article'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I didn''t see it. It didn''t

    come up in the search result on'
  persid: ''
- desc: Wired. So I'm not
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not sure
  persid: ''
- desc: whether it appeared on Wired.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Got a title or some other

    details. I''m not sure about this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quality of the search on why I

    think generally wired is made'
  persid: ''
- desc: more of a commercial
  persid: ''
- desc: website resolved by
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cutting edge technology magazine

    and website'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m not sure how to feel

    about this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the fact that we''ve got a

    mix of styles and fonts and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'typefaces there was an increase

    my feeling about it. I presented'
  persid: ''
- desc: it to you because it came up
  persid: ''
- desc: so the article talks about.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the that's one aspect.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Computer Crimes running running

    scams like this so.'
  persid: ''
- desc: On the heading of cat fishing,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the subsidy mistakes have

    talked about some chatting with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the end. Some of those claims is

    talking to a teenager who was'
  persid: ''
- desc: not at
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all listening at so we had had a

    conversation with the person we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought it was it was Andriy

    teenage girl. He didn''t say'
  persid: ''
- desc: anything explicit.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anybody called
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the girl''s parents so to speak,

    or present themselves as the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'girl''s parents saying How dare

    you proposition my underage'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'daughter you''re jail for this.

    Unless you pay for your cell'
  persid: ''
- desc: phone bill or use money.
  persid: ''
- desc: You can extract some money
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the person in the story

    committed suicide in jail so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sometimes catfishing is more of

    a creating relationships and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'asking for money to help them

    personnel'
  persid: ''
- desc: but in general, these are
  persid: ''
- desc: scams that I worked on the fact
  persid: ''
- desc: we don't have personal
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connections anymore that we

    relying on online to provide'
  persid: ''
- desc: closure socialization.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I want to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I want to focus on security

    policies. In the disk with a'
  persid: ''
- desc: discussion.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, to discuss what are some

    measures that can be taken both'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by individuals and organizations

    including governments to prevent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or mitigate the undesirable

    effects of computer crimes and'
  persid: ''
- desc: identity theft. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I took this from the ACM

    document'
  persid: ''
- desc: and I thought about if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we start specify undesirable

    effects I don''t know if there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are desirable effects computer

    crime'
  persid: ''
- desc: but anyway way
  persid: ''
- desc: you can think about if there
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are some other kinds of effects

    other than undesirable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I invite you to warm up to

    groups or people who are nearby'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you and think about the things

    you can do for yourself and when'
  persid: ''
- desc: University
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minimize the opportunities for

    computer crimes and identity.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s take 10 minutes to get

    back together as a class Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: To ice Cream
  persid: ''
- desc: village
  persid: ''
- desc: it
  persid: ''
- desc: going
  persid: ''
- desc: on right things I just said no
  persid: ''
- desc: to it try to think
  persid: ''
- desc: logically
  persid: ''
- desc: this video
  persid: ''
- desc: 'memorizing everything you one of

    them I don''t know but I can just'
  persid: ''
- desc: try it
  persid: ''
- desc: everybody
  persid: ''
- desc: families
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my number is number seven all

    the way down'
  persid: ''
- desc: my
  persid: ''
- desc: first
  persid: ''
- desc: video all
  persid: ''
- desc: you have
  persid: ''
- desc: to start far
  persid: ''
- desc: as finding the website it's like
  persid: ''
- desc: oh I would say
  persid: ''
- desc: check
  persid: ''
- desc: it out was
  persid: ''
- desc: a tragic
  persid: ''
- desc: event
  persid: ''
- desc: right so, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just started okay should we get

    together again'
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's some good discussions
  persid: ''
- desc: sessions
  persid: ''
- desc: anyways
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so anything any ideas for what

    individuals can do to blunt the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'impact of computer crime and

    identity theft in particular?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, do applicants do the

    application to use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and handle two factor

    authentication well'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think reputable ones that you

    probably shouldn''t be using at'
  persid: ''
- desc: this point Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I want to also think about

    whether it''s done well when the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'slide so I''m thinking about BMO,

    for example. Use vehicle anyway,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what I discovered is that

    they''ve they''ve gone through a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'process where the experience

    more seamless across platforms.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s what they say but it''s

    even more painful on smartphones'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for me because I have a password

    manager so it doesn''t if I want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to deposit and interact transfer

    I click on deposit and maybe it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t open the app on my phone

    and goes to the website.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It makes the login, which is

    terrible. But then it says Now'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to verify that you

    liked the message that when we'
  persid: ''

    seek at work, so I go back to'

    fine. So I use a regular plans'

    that I''m going to do in behalf'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'authorizing My Account

    authorizing the code to be sent'

    and then next page, they get a'

    so you don''t have to do this in'

    it never remembers'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'the process again. My interact

    transfer so'
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't feel there's any bloody
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s anywhere I can direct my

    analysis of their system. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: just deal with it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, anyway, that''s my story or

    two factor authentication.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or anything else is individuals

    can do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it not important like Twitter or

    something. You can just buy more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and putting in your data. The

    flip side is that a lot of these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'platforms don''t need to have

    like your first name, your last'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'name, your address, your phone

    number, your email address. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not something where it''s

    like a legal document and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'identities that is there still

    is a data who''s live to be like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m John Doe and email addresses

- desc: online
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all. Don''t provide useful

    information to websites'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I think he the password

  persid: ''
- desc: This was so easy.
  persid: ''
- desc: Line Manager
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So security questions. This is

    my wife like and she wants to'
  persid: ''

    what about passwords?'

    Because in my right banking, I'
