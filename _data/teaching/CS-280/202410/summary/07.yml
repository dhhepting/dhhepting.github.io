    thank you'
  persid: ''

    with we''re going to have a'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: Hi
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hello Can everyone hear me well?

    So I''m sorry to interrupt'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today''s class. I just came in

    because I have a quick'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'announcement to make about the C

    triple s. I don''t actually know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how many of you here might have

    heard or have any of you heard'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of this eternalized support.

    Okay. Well, that''s been our main'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'objective was to try and get

    more and more people aware of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this feature to us because we

    have a lot of amazing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opportunities that help you in

    your career. So I am Satish. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say I''m one of the executives on

    the board. I am the information'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'officer. And for that I''m here

    to spread information about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'society. So the main thing about

    the C Triple S is that we''re a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'community we''re here to build

    support for you guys being an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'area where you can come learn

    about other people learn about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the people in the CSS, the

    feature blessed and learn with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each other and get to know each

    other better. And because of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we''re hosting events such

    as the meet and greet that is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming up tomorrow. Tomorrow at

    Lassie take room 132 were'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'holding me angry is what we''re

    calling it for you guys to meet'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who the execs are. But it''s also

    pretty good to meet each other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to build a network. Because not

    only do we have high networks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'within our professors, with

    other communities with other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'companies, but everybody in this

    session I can bet has some sort'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of connection with somebody at

    some level of interests and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'knowing each other can be a big

    help in this in this field.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because not only is CFA very,

    very demanding field. It''s also'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a place where it''s really hard

    to try and get yourself out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there if you''re not doing things

    to try and make yourself grow so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in that regard, we also offer

    tech seminars. Technically, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is coming up at the second week

    of February. It is a if you guys'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'haven''t heard of Git or GitHub,

    has anybody heard her name? And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again, I''m assuming a decent

    amount of you have, but I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know how many of you knew how to

    use it. I honestly have actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used it for projects in the past

    and I still don''t know how to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use it well. So one of our

    executives actually an expert in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this field, and routinely is

    hosting a seminar trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'invest in knowing what Git and

    GitHub is, because some of you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might not know it. I''m gonna

    tell you right now every single'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'person in this we''re going to

    get the CFO is going to use us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at some at 100 venture to it is

    basically a record helps you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'host your project so you can be

    able to work with other people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in different fields and meeting

    that is very, very important'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when you''re going to go into

    them when you''re gonna go into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software development teams that

    assigns teams and resources as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well as networking amongst each

    other network. Honor Societies,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like faculties in general is

    heavily important because of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fact that every single person

    MCs can go into many different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fields, bio technicians working

    with doctors is an important'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part of our jobs, working with

    different agricultural'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'companies, because we work for

    their data collection industry,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my important job and knowing

    people in these different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'faculties is heavily important

    to get you growing in that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'network. So due to that, I''ll be

    coming on February 3 is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'annual science gather happens

    every year and is one of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'most renowned science. One of

    the most amount of gallows that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'happens in this university every

    single year. Beating the records'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last year pretty minor ticket

    sales and the amount of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'appreciation that came out of it

    last semester or last year last'

    place where you can come and'

    regard, but also get to meet'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each other. I am aware that I

    believe there is in the works'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that some of us yes professors

    will be at that event which you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can network with, as well. Other

    professors will be there as well'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as people coming in to give grad

    talks. It''s very important time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to try and meet other people and

    just trying to network. I know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I went to network last time

    when I went there last semester,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I hope to see you guys there

    this semester. In general'

    morning that tickets are the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'early bird tickets are sold out.

    If you want to still go it''s $35'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instead of 30 but you have to

    after some moving around and'
  persid: ''

    offices back to where I was when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was a undergraduate student.

    Anyway a little bit of trivia'
  persid: ''
- desc: How's everyone doing? today?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we did the sea trip

    last update'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, I''m gonna get your opinion

    about something here. So you may'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'notice maybe you don''t notice

    yet, but I''ve set the due date'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the response for today''s

    meeting at noon tomorrow to try'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it out. So I''d like your input

    about whether it''s better to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'keep it as it is. I forgot to

    see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Keith as his celebrity and the

    same day as meeting making it'
  persid: ''
- desc: '59pm The same day as meeting

    so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s as close to the end of

    the day. As a convenience so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gives you an extra hour, extra

    59 minutes 9am With the fall of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the day following the meeting,

    new day for the week,'
  persid: ''
- desc: or something else you can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'indicate in a post discussion

    forum.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any thoughts about other

    responses and quizzes are going'
  persid: ''
- desc: now okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so is everyone checked out

    groups?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m not in any group but if

    you click on this link you will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see a group that you''re in for

    coursework. With me, everyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: found that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is everyone able to work with

    the groups they''re in? Yes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'may try a group activity again

    today and see how that goes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s also a separate

    password blog'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I think as a group member you

    can write to one or you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: write
  persid: ''
- desc: to your own group.
  persid: ''
- desc: Or you can see everybody's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can write your own group and

    you can see everyone''s posts.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So regarding quizzes, would it

    be maybe it''s helpful if I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about answers to lists in

    class? Now we'
  persid: ''
- desc: need to clarify the clay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intended answer your course

    email if you read it and going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through the quiz, this training

    results looking for your answer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reviewing and saying yes. Just

    going back to the template me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'grading all the quizzes you

    involved process Okay, so the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question of the day is that

    large enough for people in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: back?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so today''s answer is

    utilitarian.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so here''s if I didn''t

    label this as a video, but it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a video produced by ACM seven

    minutes long, it''s not too long.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let''s why everyone in tech

    should care about ethics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this video you may have to

    fiddle with the audio again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: All right.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'World''s largest supplier

    protects sounds so boring.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Seriously, your founder,

    executive or worker in the tech'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'industry in your work is likely

    covered by one more codes of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethics. Lack familiarity with

    codes can have serious financial'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'legal consequences for you and

    your business. Now the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing you should know is that

    there are two main professional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'organizations that have covered

    the tech industry. ACM'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'association of Computing

    Machinery and I triple E'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Institute for electronics,

    electrical electronics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'engineers. Between them ACM and

    the IEEE sponsored most of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'conferences, so many

    publications, journals, they set'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'curriculum standards and they

    said code of conduct for people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are working in computer

    science and computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'engineering, software

    engineering and electrical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'engineering. So there''s the ACM,

    and the IEEE each has a code of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethics, and they also jointly

    collaborated on the code of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethics for software engineering.

    So if you''re practicing software'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'engineer, for example, you might

    be a bit surprised by some of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the things that are in principle

    why software engineers shall act'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consistently the public

    interest. I mean, really, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was the first principle of the

    software engineering code of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethics and professional

    practice. So everything that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software engineer does every day

    is supposed to be consistent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the public interest should

    be in your mind all the time.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Software Engineers shall assist

    colleagues in professional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'development. So does your player

    help pay for you to attend'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'conferences or to increase your

    technical or leadership skills?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you know that a code of

    ethics says that they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'supposed to do that? Also got

    some some mail? These are sort'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of frequent objections I hear

    about the code of ethics. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: this one was sent in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from New York in 1990. Maintain

    I guess. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Dupo stop wasting my time. Come

    back with these logs NOC codes?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, I got some bad news for

    you. You know, there isn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really any law on us requires

    adherence to these codes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They''re starting to find a way

    to some court case, you might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'remember the Oracle versus

    Google case. Oracle sued Google'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because Google had copied some

    Java API C to the Android'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operating system. At trial,

    Google argued that illustrates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that Oracle''s letter snapback

    reciting the ACM code of ethics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and professional conduct

    violations of copyrights,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'patents, trade secrets, and in

    terms of license agreements is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'prohibited by law in most

    circumstances, even when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software is not so protected.

    such violations are contrary to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'professional behavior.

    Conferences software should be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'made only on proper

    authorization and unauthorized'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'location materials does not

    conduct so soon see, you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna bring in a new convincing

    to cancel my memberships and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that ACM and IEEE okay. Yeah, I

    mean, I hear that, but Well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s true. ACM and IEEE can''t

    enforce the codes of ethics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'against people that aren''t

    members of ACM and IEEE. Know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what a big professional

    organization creates a code of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethics and publishes it out in

    the world, the public and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'courts can see that as a

    statement. Of the conscience of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the profession. You know, so,

    you know, we saw in the Google'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'case or home or school case that

    even though the the people that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were involved in that case, you

    may or may not have been ACM'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'members, the borders horrible

    thoroughly considered the ACM'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Code of Ethics will apply to

    Google engineers that were'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'involved in that case. The one

    last postcard here. Dubeau'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'targeting laws regulating our

    company wide in our professional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'organizations waste all this

    time creating burdensome'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'regulations on us. Okay, two

    points first. of all, these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rules are to be the basis of

    self regulation, you know, sort'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the philosophy of regulation

    of the professions is that we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a good job of regulating

    ourselves that hopefully it will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'avoid some more burdensome

    regulation from outside forces.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s part of it. But also,

    remember these rules are also'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meant to help workers stand up

    for what''s the right if they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in a situation where they''re

    under pressure to do something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s incorrect. You know, for

    example, I have a recent op ed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here from the New York Times. So

    here if Apple employees refuse'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to perform the software

    engineering tasks that would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'necessary to provide FBI access

    to the contents of the iPhone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used by one of the students in

    the December mass killings in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'San Bernardino, California. The

    decision wouldn''t be explicitly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'supported by the code of ethics

    and professional organization'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called The Association for

    Computing Machinery. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pretty controversial example.

    And you may not agree that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everyone''s here would have been

    in the right to refuse to help'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'unlock the San Bernardino

    shooters phone but the codes in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the news and it could have

    played a role in court because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Apple had decided before the

    government decided to try to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compel Apple to unlock that

    phone. So what I want you to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take away from this video is

    that regardless of what career'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stage you''re at, what role you

    play if you''re in the tech'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'industry, then the ACM Code of

    Ethics IEEE code of ethics, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the joint IEEE ACM software

    engineering code of ethics are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to have an impact on your

    business. And if you want to'

    the full code of ethics do go to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'http ethics dot ACM dot orgy and

    you can also like and choose to'

    want more materials that will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'help you discuss ethical issues

    with your co workers or when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your boss then just subscribe

    that you know professional'
  persid: ''

    next couple of years.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Wishful thinking because seven

    years'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''

    video they''re leaving. This out'

    why the code of ethics is'

    gives it a net anyone really'

    watching that video is that a'
  persid: ''

    all the people are going to'

- desc: 'focus as a service. Kind of

    crazy learning.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'crudest show of hands who

    doesn''t like about the hands on'
  persid: ''
- desc: class?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It seemed worse than I

    remembered.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So who remembers the San

    Bernardino shooter with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: iPhone? Case?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll add some names to the

    context. So it was a question of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Apple was talking about privacy.

    there for the people involved in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this terror attack, shooting had

    an iPhone and you would have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'been nice to get access to the

    phone. So this is a little bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like the video to the look at

    that guy''s data. In case he''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'menace to the public. Why should

    we leave them alone?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I want so building on our

    discussion of ethics from last'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our last reading in our earlier

    discussion. So here''s the ACM'
  persid: ''
- desc: code of ethics.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''d like you to read this in

    detail. Well, I mean, read the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whole thing. For tomorrow for

    our next meeting. I just want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go into the main points. So it

    has some general ethical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'principles. And it has some

    fresher, more focused principles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for computing professionals and

    then it has some additional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comments for people in

    leadership roles. So general'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethical principles. Computing

    professional should contribute'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to society and to human

    wellbeing acknowledging that all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people are stakeholders will get

    a feeling right. So even though'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not everybody is in a position

    of writing software are employed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in making software that other

    people use computing is really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, I guess they didn''t like

    the video. either.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what does that mean to you?

    Acknowledging all people are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stakeholders and competing

    because we think about this in'
  persid: ''
- desc: common for everyone
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hear somebody talking. And just

    want to know if you want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: share on us Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well the comments off the

    ethical principle well as what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'principles are very important in

    other fields of IP as well, such'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as cybersecurity and whatnot, so

    that you know, you''re basically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in charge of like a database for

    a company and stuff like that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So kind of be like the

    gatekeeper and kind of have very'
  persid: ''
- desc: ethical conduct.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so this is a general code

    that applies to people working'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on an acceptance of it. The

    people who were in the news'
  persid: ''
- desc: recently or BestBuy, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other places who took people''s

    devices and looked through their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data. It''s not necessarily that

    they''re ACM members. But they'
  persid: ''
- desc: should be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an example for unethical It''s

    Mark Zuckerberg, you know,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stealing everyone''s information

    from Facebook. Yes, kind of like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'having access to medical data

    and stuff like that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. So there''s lots of

    specific examples like the'
  persid: ''
- desc: Cambridge analytic
  persid: ''
- desc: 'case a few years ago. Again,

    back to the technology that all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people are stakeholders in

    computing. To use Facebook as an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example. We don''t all have to

    use Facebook to to feel the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'effects of democracy democratic

    institutions, being threatened'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by people posting

    disinformation. And Facebook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using algorithms that so

    division instead of'
  persid: ''
- desc: collaboration and conciliation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we should avoid harm,

    and if voiding harm is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'impossible, you need to take

    steps to minimize harm.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Be honest and trustworthy and

    honest and trustworthy. Yes. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: even if it's an aspiration.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ve said that it''s an

    aspiration. I mean, if we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'honest and trustworthy, we''re

    working on it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You be fair and take action not

    to discriminate. So this is an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example of equity, diversity and

    inclusion, as we call it in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Canada. I think in the states

    they call it diversity, equity'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and inclusion. Same same letters

    just in a different order.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So that means
  persid: ''
- desc: 'treating everybody the same and

    in terms of data, that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making sure we have

    representative data to train,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'facial recognition systems and

    so on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Respect to work hard to produce

    new ideas, inventions, creative'
  persid: ''
- desc: works and computing artifacts.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we take care of with people

    other people''s intellectual'
  persid: ''
- desc: property. respect privacy.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Even if some people don''t value

    it themselves very much. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'still an important thing to

    consider'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and honor confidentiality. So

    this is an example for people'
  persid: ''
- desc: that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at Best Buy, but not just at

    Best Buy. All in all the times'
  persid: ''
- desc: we see data or information that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is sensitive or may not be

    sensitive, which is certainly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the person whose last night out

    late to watch you know, an actor'
  persid: ''
- desc: wants to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'play ball. Anyway, he said, My

    life is an open book, I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'choose not to read it aloud. So

    we don''t want to broadcast'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things will be I asked. When I

    asked that goes to the secret he'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said everything is a secret. So

    that''s a better way to operate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by default is to think that

    people are telling you something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'confidence. You want to share

    maybe you want to share some.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Key professional

    responsibilities, strategy for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Hi Paul quality and both the

    processes and products of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'professional work. maintain high

    standards of professional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'competence conduct an ethical

    practice. Human respect,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'existing rules pertaining to

    professional work. Accepted'

    thorough evaluations of computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'systems and their impacts

    including analysis of possible'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'risks. To perform work only in

    areas of competence. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: anecdotally, people say
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can do this, when surely this

    is this is my chance to learn'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about doing this. So strictly

    speaking, as professional you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wouldn''t say you will

    communicate that to say I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'learning about this stuff This

    job'
  persid: ''
- desc: makes sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So foster public awareness and

    understanding of computing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'related technologies and their

    consequences.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for example, what it means to

    what potential harm you''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by sharing the story on Facebook

    with other reading it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not to pick on Facebook.

    Although I know that asked this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'morning the teacher bless the

    president who spoke to my class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this morning who said no, we

    don''t really use Facebook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anymore. And she made some lots

    of comments and made me feel old'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for using Facebook. I don''t

    really use Facebook that much.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But I know how to except for

    certain times of year when I'
  persid: ''
- desc: post messages anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Twitter or is not as as no one

    just acts. As another example of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a platform it has some serious

    issues as well. Anyone using x'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'couple people so what''s what''s

    the platform of choice?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Instagram, Snapchat know I''m

    dating myself aren''t I?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I hear that's a thing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay. So if we''re aware, or part

    of our job is to communicate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'potential risks to people who

    maybe overshare or you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'understand, we don''t necessarily

    understand how the algorithms'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are used on these platforms

    are magic, maximizing attention'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the platform nor we don''t

    really care of other people'
  persid: ''
- desc: using the systems
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we should access computing

    and communication resources only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when authorized by the public

    good.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'design and implement systems

    that are robustly unusably'
  persid: ''
- desc: secure
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that we talked about

    minimizing harm earlier. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that was a point of principle in

    the code. This is this is an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example of maximizing benefit or

    creating benefits'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'avoiding hire and maybe

    embracing embracing benefits'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so as a leadership as a leader

    in computing, we should ensure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the public good is a central

    concern during all professional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computing work. That sounds good

    doesn''t it? But then what what'
  persid: ''
- desc: is the public good
  persid: ''
- desc: what does that mean in practice?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will also be in leadership roles

    we should articulate encourage'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'acceptance of and evaluate

    fulfilment of social'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responsibilities by members of

    the organization or group'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in the C Triple S, or as the

    Department of Computer Science'
  persid: ''
- desc: or the University of Regina.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You should think about social

    responsibilities'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, as you did last night,

    social media literacy as well'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as Marissa was there developing

    competencies in the membership'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'manage personal personnel and

    resources to enhance the quality'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the work working. So think

    about the people who are working'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for us working with us. So we''re

    gonna respect the quality of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their lives as well. It''s not

    just about writing code, sitting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in front of a terminal at all

    hours of the day and night.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we should have articulated

    applied support policies and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'processes that reflect the

    principles of equality. Create'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opportunities for members of the

    organization or group to grow as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'professionals. Use care when

    modifying or retiring systems.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Recognize and take care of take

    special care systems that become'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'integrated into the

    infrastructure of society.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any comments you''d like to share

    that no? Okay, checking. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can say Facebook again here for

    3.7 but there are some other'
  persid: ''
- desc: ones as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I''m thinking of three and

    2.6. Use care whose care when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'modifying or retiring systems.

    Does anyone remember the story'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the Phoenix payroll system

    that was a system used by the'
  persid: ''
- desc: Federal Public Service
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because much heartache and

    sorrow because people were'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Miss Miss pay for years and

    years, so Nestle has been'
  persid: ''
- desc: cleaned up.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that was a case where not

    enough care was used.'
  persid: ''
- desc: as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: Lesson 3.6.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we should uphold promote and

    respect the principles of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'code and treat violations of the

    code is inconsistent with'
  persid: ''
- desc: membership in the ACM.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How many people are members of

    ACM or have considered joining'
  persid: ''
- desc: the ACM
  persid: ''
- desc: well I encourage it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'student memberships are

    available'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how do we use the code for

    making decisions and so they''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'provided some resources for

    computing professionals to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'proactive in evaluating it so

    it''s an acronym, cares, consider'
  persid: ''
- desc: analyze, review and evaluate.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So lots of questions to ask so

    it''s not always the case that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we have a dilemma that

    comes up that there is a very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clear path to resolution. It

    might be that we''re not if we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the ones making decisions,

    decide, you can decide to decide'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do your first person getting

    orders from somebody else. Our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ability to influence decision

    making is more difficult,'
  persid: ''
- desc: possibly.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if it''s a serious issue, then

    we should practice and asking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ourselves the questions to think

    about. This is a place where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to make us take a

    stand'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'somebody has turned up volume

    because I''m getting feedback'
  persid: ''
- desc: here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'guess a little bit of feedback

    is better than not enough'
  persid: ''
- desc: volume.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So consider who may be affected

    and how, whose behavior'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'circumstances job were

    experiences might be affected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'positively or negatively by the

    proposed solution. I''m not going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to read the whole thing.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Analyze the situations details

    through each plausible,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'plausible alternative solution,

    what stakeholder rates and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relationships between

    stakeholders are likely to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'affected so what what are the

    unique circumstances?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'view we have other obligations

    and limitations or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responsibilities or authority

    practices or policies seemed to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be most important to the

    alternatives in your analysis.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there is a place to return to

    consider and analyze if other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'solutions come to mind. Then

    evaluate the best course of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'action. Which of the

    alternatives considered seems to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be the fairest and just or most

    just I guess.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any questions or concerns about

    that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so here's a case study.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the idea is there''s an

    international defense contractor'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that specializes in autonomous

    autonomous vehicles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so they were doing things at

    first law like bomb disposal but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now they''re being deployed in

    conflict zones and win non'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'violent protests. So as they''ve

    ventured into these new areas,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''ve suffered losses of

    equipment as protesters and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other individuals have

    physically attack. The vehicles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sought to protect their assets

    they''ve considered it has'
  persid: ''
- desc: celebrated
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cyber threats and other crowds

    of tomorrow blocks away from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: equipment.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so the government is having

    secret talks with them about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making these deterrence lethal

    so that we may have targeted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shooting and unknown individuals

    or or releasing small scale'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'explosives. When the company

    agreed to pursue these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'capabilities, many of the

    original engineers resigned in'
  persid: ''
- desc: protest
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of engineers periods expressed

    concern that the non lethal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responses had inadequate

    protections against tampering,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'such as replacing tear gas with

    a lethal poison knowing that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these individuals plan to speak

    out publicly Q sued them for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'violating terms of the

    confidentiality agreement.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So this isn't too far fetched.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You heard recent news about

    drones that are being purchased'
  persid: ''
- desc: as
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, commercial drones and

    quadcopters and those kinds of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things being repurposed as

    weapons in the war. I''m not sure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if they''re both sides, but

    Ukraine is using them as a cost'
  persid: ''
- desc: effective way to.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Physicians in Russia for Russian

    physicians.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So also the exam was really one

    day data there was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'militarized on Korea. There''s

    examples of automated machine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'guns being able to acquire

    targets and the question was,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should we be given the

    capability to make a decision on'
  persid: ''
- desc: whether to fire on that target?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One of the manufacturers of

    those machine comes with'
  persid: ''
- desc: Samsung.
  persid: ''
- desc: Right so how about we take
  persid: ''
- desc: '10 minutes for every discussion

    about how to think about AI'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Excuse me. Not enough coffee

    today. The dots that I know that'
  persid: ''
- desc: for sure.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Think about how this case study

    how we can use the code of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethics to give us some direction

    for actions in this case. That'
  persid: ''
- desc: makes sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, which was regarding this

    issue, with regards to the code'
  persid: ''
- desc: of ethics
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so how, how can we use the

    code of ethics to guide our'
  persid: ''
- desc: decision
  persid: ''
- desc: making?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So are the engineers in the

    right is the company in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: right to sue them?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So on analysis of the ethical

    issues as their as indicated by'
  persid: ''
- desc: the Code of Ethics
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better Okay, any other

    questions?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll talk about this again on

    Thursday but also on Thursday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: top the agenda is assignments.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m not waiting for a search

    for my mom''s on Saturday. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then Saturday evening, we heard

    that my mother in law'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so my wife has gone to look

    after her and this happens'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway. Just a few days. So the

    Thursday we''ll talk about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignments and the sleeves are

    on the agenda. Okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: at this time discussion,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or walk around and then we can

    have questions or comments come'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up in the session. You could

    post them on the blog.'
  persid: ''
- desc: seem okay. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Group of Five
  persid: ''
- desc: up morning. With up righty
  persid: ''
- desc: course, was more than one to me.
  persid: ''
- desc: Let me show it to you.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is anyone not sure where the

    goodness Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: First listing Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 90 now okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Hello, everybody
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if you''re having an issue

    with your groups that you didn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mention before. send a note to

    course editors. Singular Harris'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you know as the person who will

    contact but maybe it seems here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to branch to side note of course

    editor and just explain the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'situation. If you''re happy with

    the group, so people who need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'send Harris''s to note and sit

    down. People who aren''t sure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where the fruit is. They can

    speak and say here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''ll go through so if you

    Sam Harris Sam here and we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: find it for you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m I got put into groups 17

    I don''t know where that is.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. Group seven. Under the i

    17. They went from group 17 Here'
  persid: ''
