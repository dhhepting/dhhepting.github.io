- desc: 'I asked a question during the meeting: what does someone with agency on the
    internet look like?

    Many people viewed them as a specialist - either someone knowledgeable in virtual
    machines, cookie blocking, security, or a lawyer who can read and understand the
    TOS. If this is true, then that means that most people on the internet today do
    not actually have agency.


    Some people felt that it depended on the definition of agency - and that''s true,
    the OED has like 15 definitions for "agency," which makes it difficult to figure
    out what that means, and it is difficult to determine what something looks like
    if the definition is unclear.


    In my opinion, someone with agency is someone who has the ability to make informed
    decisions and act on those decisions unhindered and uncoerced. I feel that nearly
    nobody has true agency on the internet these days, as either one or many of those
    criteria are not satisfied at most given times. I really hope that someday soon,
    any regular person can be a person with agency on the internet.'
- desc: "Privacy and WhatsApp\n\
    \nThe TED Talk on Digital Communication and Privacy, published in June of 2020,\
    \ sees interviewer Chris Anderson debate with Will Cathcart, Head of WhatsApp\
    \ at Facebook. Will gives an insightful view on how the end-to-end encryption\
    \ allows users to communicate matters of importance, especially during times of\
    \ Covid where members are unable to meet online. End to End encryption is a form\
    \ of cryptography where the sender scrambles their message using some sort of\
    \ hashing algorithm (for example SHA-256) and only the receiver knows of the private\
    \ key to decrypt the data. This encryption applied by Facebook is yet another\
    \ instance of a tech giant enabling user privacy. Similarly, in the past, Apple\
    \ has caught flak by refusing to allow governments access to phones. Even going\
    \ so far as to say that they will not create a special government backdoor since\
    \ not all governments can be held accountable. They feel unable to secure the\
    \ privacy of their users if someone made such a backdoor algorithm. In my opinion,\
    \ I believe the this is the only way to move forward in the realm of user-based\
    \ privacy. Creating a secure channel directly corresponds to not creating any\
    \ methodology that acts like a backdoor or from the Ancient Greek Mythology: Orpheus\u2019\
    s Door. The only way to prevent bad actors on this platform would be for the governments\
    \ and organizations to increase the artificial intelligence capabilities to track\
    \ and pickup metadata."
- desc: I would like to understand U of R's reasoning for using proctor track better.
    With a lot of other universities opting not to have this and to do open book exams
    instead why did U of R decide to use this program that invades privacy more than
    necessary. With its clear faults is it worth invading students privacy, even after
    the servers were hacked? Could these resources that the university spent be better
    spend somewhere else?
- desc: I think privacy is very important. It's our private stuff. In today's online
    environment, because our devices record and store a lot of information, like credit
    cards, or home addresses. It is very important to protect our privacy because
    the Internet is full of traps and our privacy will be exposed by the slightest
    mistake. It's not hard to steal information from our devices, and sometimes a
    piece of software we download can do it. So I think when using the Internet, we
    should pay attention to download links, otherwise, our privacy will be threatened.
- desc: The most important thing, in my opinion, I learned from the past meeting was
    from the discussion we had regarding online privacy. During discussion, I researched
    a couple different ways to protect my privacy online. From this information, I
    think the easiest way to protect yourself online is through software. For example,
    VPN's can make you less traceable online. There's software out there that will
    read Terms of Service for you. If you're really into tech, you could try something
    like onion routing. The only problem is that software can often cost money, so
    the trade-off is money for privacy.
- desc: In our 16th meeting we discussed what are online terms of service (TOS). The
    TOS are used in every online service with very few exceptions, It is a contract
    between a user and the online business. Since time is considered as money most
    TOS are made to be as expansive and as unreadable as possible. With time and attention
    restraints the TOS can force users to immediately use the service and to just
    accept any privacy concerns that can arise.
- desc: With our talk about privacy and our personal agency to maintain our privacy,
    I would like to learn more about the tools we can use to maintain our privacy,
    such that I will have more agency in the future. I know about the popular tools
    like VPNs and some more obscure tools like websites that review private policy/TOS
    for us (such as TOSDR.org) but is that really all we have at our disposal? It
    appears that the demand for privacy is ever-increasing and thus I would find it
    probable that there are many tools I have not heard of.
- desc: "Protortrack or get Covid-19? I honestly don\u2019t believe even the data\
    \ is stored in Canada is even safe. This could mean anything as there could be\
    \ some Canadian privacy laws that are not updated with the current world. I would\
    \ say corporation have team of lawyers that can help with them bending around\
    \ the law.\nSecond, we can talk about privacy for the entire course of the semester.\
    \ As there are always some kinds of news about privacy breach or laws. I think\
    \ privacy laws need to be revamped or update every 3 years or so."
- desc: The way in which privacy matters to a person and affects their life could
    be understood. The pandemic has led a great number of people to shift their work
    to online method and this is the reason that the privacy of the user should be
    protected at any cost. Even if the person say that privacy does not matter, there
    are times when an individual has some sensitive information that should be protected.
    So, privacy matters.
- desc: In this meeting we had an early discussion about what privacy rights online
    and why the organizations need to consider the privacy issues which can arise
    with the use of their applications.
- desc: "I found the quote \"people that say privacy isn't really important \u2013\
    \ they don't actually believe it\" from the 'Why Privacy Matters\" TED Talk a\
    \ significant point to highlight because, at least in my own opinion, I find this\
    \ an entirely accurate statement. Take VPN's for instance, why are they so popular\
    \ right now? Is it because their users have something to hide? Or is it protect\
    \ identities, protect sensitive data? Or because privacy matters..."
- desc: "In the video Why privacy matters, I heard that only people doing something\
    \ wrong have things to hide; I think that is very naive. When your privacy is\
    \ monitored, whether you are a good person or a bad person may be between others'\
    \ thoughts. Moreover, Privacy has been increasingly capitalized, and many companies\
    \ can use your privacy to make money. on the one hand\uFF0COur personal information\
    \ and privacy often are obtained, used, and even exchanged and profited without\
    \ our knowledge or authorization now. On the other hand, we do not get any benefits\
    \ or even have to pay the price. It's not fair, so it's important to protect your\
    \ privacy."
- desc: Can you please discuss the content of the final exam. I feel like privacy
    is important because, it gives us the power to choose our thoughts and feelings
    and who we share them with. Privacy protects our information we do not want shared
    publicly (such as health or personal finances).
- desc: In the digital world, the concept "social life" is changing rapidly. To emerge
    social media, users should publish articles which are generally supported, and
    those materials should be communicated in public areas. Location-tracking, surveillance
    systems, facial-recognition innovations, and technologies for recording messages
    and calls have all advanced in sophistication. Will Cathcart, on the other hand,
    believes that "to our enhanced reliance on online communication methods during
    the COVID-19 pandemic, our basic right to privacy is much more essential than
    ever."
- desc: In meeting 16, we discussed about the privacy. After discuss, I got few conclusion
    about it. First, privacy is important for everyone because it is a human being
    things. second, we can not totally get rid of the environment that being monitor,
    it already become a normality in the internet. Third, people want to have privacy
    not meaning they done bad things that don't want others know, Sometime the embarrass
    things they done also don't want others know.
- desc: "We learned many things in this meeting, the video \u2018why privacy matters?\u2019\
    . In this video, I learned many things like mass surveillance is an important\
    \ thing that people are unaware of. \u2018If you are doing something that other\
    \ people does not know those things should not be done\u2019 an interesting comment\
    \ by Eric Schmidt. The privacy is something that people does not wants others\
    \ to know the activity and there are few people those deliver themselves to be\
    \ transparent, but their social activities negate that. So, privacy does matters\
    \ from everyone\u2019s perspective.\n\n"
- desc: We discussed why privacy matters. What are the issues one can face due to
    lack of privacy in a medium. Also wanted to know more about what are the ways
    programmers and developers are using now a days to improve for better results.
- desc: Ted talk "Why does privacy matter?" was one of the best talks I've ever encountered.
    I like it, maybe, because of the subject that was really fascinating and attractive.
    I believe that although we don't do anything wrong, we have things to hide from
    others. Everyone wants to keep their private life a secret, but when it comes
    to famous celebrities, people want to know everything about them, including every
    single aspect about their personal life that I think is unfair. In my opinion
    even they want some privacy, so we should respect it and should not interfere
    in their personal lives.
- desc: 'in response to the question in our previous meeting: how to exercise some
    agency about your online privacy?


    I think the only way to exercise some agency about online privacy is by using
    VPN or by also reading the terms and conditions before joining a social network
    platform. Online there companies that would usually state what data would be collected,
    so I think taking the time to read about it before signing up can be a way to
    excercise some agency online. Otherwise, I think the best advise for those who
    really worry about their whole privacy online is for them to just stay offline.'
- desc: "Rights online is an interesting subject matter to discuss, as with what we\
    \ discussed in class, many of the rights we have online are claim, not liberty.\
    \ Realistically, we don\u2019t have any control over our data online unless we\
    \ choose to simply not use the services that we know are abusing our privacy,\
    \ but even then, take Facebook for example, can still have a online profile on\
    \ you from using websites that have integrated like/share buttons, analytics,\
    \ or advertising from them. It isn\u2019t a liberty right, generally speaking\
    \ we aren\u2019t giving them direct access to our information, it just comes along\
    \ with us using the web with the way it has been designed so far."
- desc: "Response\nIn the last meeting, we watched a TED speech named why privacy\
    \ matter by Glenn Greenwald. To be honest, i think his opinion is right and i\
    \ want to talk about my understanding of privacy. First, i want to say those people\
    \ who say that privacy isn't really important and don\u2019t believe it are double\
    \ standard. Cause when they are saying these words, they are taking all kinds\
    \ of steps to safeguard their privacy like put passwords on their email and their\
    \ social media accounts or \_locks on their bedroom and bathroom doors. In my\
    \ opinion, People\u2019s awareness of privacy is not born, we have no privacy\
    \ and we are not aware of this need when we are young. At that time, we are dominated\
    \ and controlled. At this time, we are both mentally and physically. It is dependent\
    \ on the parents. When our personality is gradually improved and economically\
    \ independent, the need for privacy will gradually become stronger. In other words,\
    \ the existence of privacy is a sign that we begin to control our lives and not\
    \ be controlled by others. Human behavior is not only driven by instinct but also\
    \ restricted by society. Human is a huge body of information. When he publishes\
    \ all information to the public, the evaluation and guidance of others on the\
    \ information will affect the individual's domination of his own life. So privacy\
    \ is extremely important to any of us, and respect for privacy is the prerequisite\
    \ for all good relationships. The existence of privacy can soothe our nerves just\
    \ like sleep at night, calm our emotions, and make us more independent and self-reliant."
- desc: The most important thing I leaned from last meeting was that not many people
    actually read the policies and agreements for the services they are using. The
    concept from the last meeting that was the hardest for me to understand was how
    much the user can do to be private. Whether its just being careful of what they
    put out on the internet to using a virtual machine and a VPN, there is so much
    variance in the levels of privacy. I would like to learn more about how private
    I need to be online, and how much companies are taking and using from my experience
    online. I have seen privacy leaked from content creators on YouTube and twitch,
    in worst cases they end up being swatted. Even if there are many steps taken to
    be private, privacy is always a concern.
- desc: Last Thursday, we saw two TED talk videos. One was "The future of digital
    communication and privacy" by Will Cathcart(head of Whatsapp)which was regarding
    how social media chatting platforms like Whatsapp messenger has the feature of
    end-to-end encryption and they say billions of text messages on the daily are
    protected from government firms, some institutions and the company of Whatsapp
    themselves. The other video "Why privacy matters" presented by Glenn Greenwald
    at TEDGlobal 2014 brings a whole different point of how and why do people need
    to know and take proper care about their privacy even though there's nothing you
    share that needs to be kept confidential.
- desc: In this meeting we discussed about the threat to our privacy from the social
    sites like Facebook. How these applications are using our personal information
    for their own profit even without us knowing about it.
- desc: The Internet is developing very fast now. Personal privacy will be leaked
    out inadvertently. Privacy is one of the serious problems at present. Every year,
    there are countless property losses caused by privacy leaks. Therefore, you must
    protect your personal privacy when surfing the Internet, and do not disclose it
    at will.
- desc: "In the last class we talked about privacy and its importance in our life,\
    \ especially about the digital world and the privacy concern. In the breakout\
    \ room we had a short discussion about it too. We also talked about how violation\
    \ of said right can be violated and are we willing to allow limited violation\
    \ in return of free stuff. We also talked about using proctortrack and how some\
    \ students felt unsafe about it.\n\nIn the ted talk Glenn Greenwald discussed\
    \ why privacy is important and mass surveilence is problematic for individual\
    \ freedom and liberty. When we surrender our privacy its not just odd or weird\
    \ or anything, but this open unrestricted information can be used against the\
    \ society, the individuals depending on profit margin. To me the basic idea of\
    \ \"privacy is not important\" sounds stupid, no offence. If privacy is not important\
    \ just give me your bank detail, id number and password. I'll just check how much\
    \ money you have. Since I have nothing to hide and I also believe in what you\
    \ said, don't worry, your money and property is safe with me. Jokes aside, in\
    \ a broader sense we see that violation of privacy is the norm in places with\
    \ dictatorial powers and little to none human rights. So yes, handing over privacy\
    \ is a terrible terrible idea. But fun or fact, a lot of people from my country\
    \ do not care much about this survailence. The reason is that apart from birthday\
    \ and what restourants they like, internet does not have other informations. Almost\
    \ every information is spread through paper, like 1940's. So they are more like,\
    \ you want my info, take it, there is no info in the first place. So I guess this\
    \ mass surveilance system can fail in certain places involuntary but I can also\
    \ be massively wrong.\_\_\n\nWith a bit of irony however, with the recent update\
    \ of whatsapp that privacy will be violated massively and there is an existing\
    \ furious online debate about it, I had to hear the future of digital communication\
    \ and privacy from the head of Whatsapp itself\n"
- desc: In meeting 16 we discussed about online privacy policies of the online websites
    in terms of terms and conditions. We discussed how can we have an agency for our
    privacy online. We were divided into groups to discuss further on the given topic.
    The terms and conditions posted by the websites are hardly read by anyone. People
    generally skip reading and go straight for agreeing to all the teams and conditions
    written on those online contracts. There are obvious reasons for skipping those
    long agreements, the most common one being that they are really time-consuming
    and boring. Most of the information given on those terms and services is unnecessary
    in my opinion, and I've seen a few websites just copy and paste the terms and
    conditions of another website, hence the developers don't even give much attention
    to them. Although it is also important to read to those conditions before agreeing
    to them since there could be a huge risk of an online scam. There one a couple
    of solutions to this problem, for instance, website developers could reduce the
    length of all the terms and conditions to just the main points or they can highlight
    the main information which should be known by the user before entering the website.
- desc: "Thinking about the Ted Talk that was linked about privacy, when it comes\
    \ to the internet there really is no such thing as \"privacy\" -- you may have\
    \ anonymity, but you are still vulnerable to hackers, large technology companies\
    \ (like Google and Facebook) and the government. One of the things the talk mentions\
    \ near the beginning is touching on the idea of 'if you\u2019ve got nothing to\
    \ hide, you\u2019ve got nothing to fear'. This reminded me of the blog I wrote\
    \ earlier this term, Amnesty International did a good article on why this line\
    \ of thinking is fundamentally flawed:\_https://www.amnesty.ca/blog/7-reasons-why-%E2%80%98i%E2%80%99ve-got-nothing-to-hide%E2%80%99-is-the-wrong-response-to-mass-surveillance"
- desc: I think privacy is power and power is something that needs to be contained.
    In the video 'why privacy matters', Glenn brought the point where he said that
    people who say privacy doesn't matter still put password on their social media,
    emails, etc. and keep it private. It shows that actually they do care about their
    privacy they are just not aware of how deep far it goes.
- desc: Privacy is something that we should hold close to ourselves, especially in
    this digital age that we live in. Companies like Facebook and Google have access
    to so much of our personal information, it is kind of scary when you think about
    how much these companies actually know about us. I also think these companies
    are hypocrites since they want to know anything and everything about our personal
    lives but when the public wants to know about them they don't like it because
    it is an invasion of their privacy. Yet they expect us to give them all of our
    information whether we know we are doing so or not.
- desc: Nowadays poor mental health has become one of the major issue, which needs
    to be deal, although there might be many ways but one of them is about connection
    with people there are many platforms and groups on internet who shares there experience
    and help other masses which is actually fascinating and interesting
- desc: "The video that the professor shared on his website about \u201CThe future\
    \ of digital communication and privacy\u201D. The use of WhatsApp has increased\
    \ drastically due to covid and it is because people believe in Whatsapp. The end-to-end\
    \ encryption that WhatsApp uses to secure the conversations is that they scramble\
    \ the message once it is sent and then only the person on the other side can see\
    \ it. Not even WhatsApp can see it. This was the biggest reason people trust WhatsApp\
    \ and it should be this way. There are so many benefits to have the technology.\
    \ Governments can talk to other governments or the military without the fear of\
    \ getting the information leaked. Doctors can talk to their patients and teachers\
    \ can talk to their students. It makes me really happy to see the use of technology\
    \ in a positive way."
- desc: 'The most important thing in the meeting is about the privacy matters and
    future of digital communication

    the topic related to previous class is about privacy concerns

    the difficult part was to understand how future digital communications have privacy
    concerns

    i want to learn more about this privacy concerns'
- desc: In the last class, we talked about the privacy policy of the companies. We
    talked about how to make the privacy policy easily accessible i.e, to make it
    more readable to the common public. The more people who are aware of all the platforms
    they are using, they would have less chance of getting scammed by the big tech
    companies. We also proposed some ideas of how companies can try to make their
    privacy policy more readable to the common public but it is also the duty of the
    people who use the app is to try to understand what does the company is offering
    and what does it want in return.
- desc: "On meeting 16, we\u2019ve talked about privacy, And we have read the two\
    \ source site which has deeply study of public communication and privacy, The\
    \ two websites with Ted talk :The future of digital communication and privacy,\
    \ Why privacy matters gives us the how the privacy influence public, individual\
    \ and our culture. On The future of digital communication and privacy, there is\
    \ a conversation of a reporter with head of WhatsApp talk about how to design\
    \ the model for the software to protect privacy for users and One the why privacy\
    \ matters which Greenwald makes the case for why you need to care about privacy,\
    \ even if you're \u201Cnot doing anything you need to hide.\u201D"
- desc: "In the last class, we talked about how encryption one of the best inventions\
    \ in computer science has helped so much in the current covid times. Due to lockdown,\
    \ people were forced to stay at home and have conversations virtually but due\
    \ to end-to-end encryption provided by companies like WhatsApp people can trust\
    \ that their information stays private. Even governments and doctors have used\
    \ WhatsApp in order to send out the word about prevention and the information\
    \ that government sends needs to be secret. It\u2019s good to see technology for\
    \ the greater good of humanity, It proves that we can use technology for the betterment\
    \ of human society and not just our own benefit."
- desc: I find the issues of privacy to always to be an interesting debate. I have
    noticed there is a growing concern, or at least an acknowledgement of privacy
    issues by most people I encounter, but in the end we are powerless. Surveillance
    is ingrained into our daily lives. From the voluntary participation in social
    media platforms such as Facebook, to the compulsory use of Proctortrack in Universities,
    there is no escape.
- desc: 'When discussing online activity, an important question arises: do we, as
    users, truly have agency over our online privacy? Although we have the ability
    to grant or deny applications access to our personal information, I do not believe
    that this ability involves full liberty. While it is our choice to accept conditions
    or policies, this process does not always seem transparent. Few users, including
    myself, take the time to read such lengthy documents, simply pressing accept instead.
    Applications often require users to accept location sharing and grant apps access
    to our devices in order for the applications to function properly. It appears
    that large tech companies coerce users into giving up some of their privacy, thus
    stripping us of agency.'
- desc: In last meeting we discussed regarding how we can exercise some agency about
    our online privacy. That means how how an individual can protect their privacy
    online. Nowadays our privacy online is very fragile, for instance we all know
    our mobile phone keep track of our conversations and search history or almost
    all of our activities and finds out the information that they send online. That's
    how we get those daily advertisements of the products on certain websites and
    social media that we have never mentioned on that platform. Sounds scary but it's
    true. Moreover whenever we agree to the terms and services posted by the websites,
    we basically give them an access to our device from where there companies can
    go through our information. People don't bother to go though those terms and services
    because that would take a lot of time. And I believe the websites developers purposely
    make those agreements long so that the user doesn't bother reading and miss all
    the loop holes and important information that has been provided regarding our
    privacy and what kind of information we are allowing them to get access on our
    devices. There can be a few solutions to that, for example both the parties should
    be transparent with each other, and the website should provide all the key information
    on a separate page than the other unimportant information.
- desc: In the last meeting we talk about the privacy and the ways in which we can
    protect ourself to get our data protected. In the break out room we discussed
    about that their are much better plaforms where our data gets protected instead
    of this big social networking sites such as facebook.
- desc: "From the videos about privacy I saw how important privacy is as people usually\
    \ do not do things as they usually do when their monitored as well as how WhatsApp\
    \ tries to put in effort in order to safeguard the users privacy by encrypting\
    \ the messages being sent and I believe other platforms should imitate their efforts\
    \ \_In protecting the privacy of users\_\n"
- desc: In this class we talk about privacy in digital world. The companies guarantee
    the privacy of the people information from being miss used but who knows what
    might happen because in digital society anything can happen. People are always
    worried about thier privacy and raising flag against some companies.
- desc: "The discussion about maintaining privacy through WhatsApp's encrypted messaging\
    \ service is intriguing. It seems as though we have reached a point where we can't\
    \ have both privacy and crime-prevention on the same platform. I enjoyed Will\
    \ Cathcart's comment saying that we _could _cameras in the living room of every\
    \ household to catch criminals, but all of the law-abiding citizens would suddenly\
    \ lose so much privacy for nothing.\_"
- desc: From the video " Why privacy matters " I learnt about the importance of privacy
    and how privacy is important in the society we live in now.
- desc: "After watching the video \u201CThe future of digital communication and privacy\u201D\
    \ by Will Cathcart, I learned how WhatsApp encrypting the messages that the health\
    \ care and government are using this app for sharing data during COVID. I think\
    \ having privacy in apps where we can share data without worrying about it being\
    \ lost is important."
- desc: In the past meeting, the importance of privacy on the social media platform
    can be understood. It is the most important thing that the privacy of the user
    should be protected so that it does not go in the wrong hand which can lead to
    misuse of that information. The amount people joining the social media and interacting
    with each other has grown during this pandemic, so it becomes a critical thing
    to be looked after.
- desc: When it comes to ethics surrounding the collection of data particularly on
    social media platforms, these big companies are taking advantage of misinformed
    consumers. While the legality of it all is valid (they disclose everything they
    are collected/doing with your data) in the fine print agreement, they take advantage
    of the fact that consumers don't take the time to read and analyze this contract.
    So from a legal standpoint it is technically fine, but from a morality perspective
    they are taking advantage of their consumers.
- desc: "\u201CWhy privacy matter\u201D by Glenn Greenwald talk about the privacy\
    \ and how there is someone who are always watching us. Even though, if we want\
    \ to do something in private but it is hard to say that the work is actually getting\
    \ done in private because there is always someone watching. He also said that\
    \ long-time google CEO Eric Schmidt said \u201CIf you're doing something that\
    \ you don't want other people to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the\
    \ first place.\u201D I think this is not correct if I want to keep my data private\
    \ I should have my right to keep it private."
- desc: In the past class meeting, we discussed about the importance of privacy on
    the social media platform can be understood. Well we know that It is the most
    important thing that the privacy of the user should be protected so that it does
    not go in the wrong hand which can lead to misuse of that information which is
    not good at all so The amount people joining the social media and interacting
    with each other has grown during this pandemic, so then it becomes a critical
    thing to be looked after. We discussed in BRooms also about this discussion topic
- desc: "In this lecture most important thing that I have learnt is about privacy\
    \ in online space.I learnt how can we protect our privacy online through various\
    \ softwares.I also learnt about terms of services,I learnt the important of TOS\
    \ as a contract between user and company.I learnt about TOSDR.org a site who review\
    \ the policies of different information technology companies.\nOverall in this\
    \ lecture I learnt about privacy,it\u2019s importance and ways to protect it in\
    \ online space."
- desc: Its cool to know that there are technologies like end-end that provide privacy
    to us. I recently learned about this in another class. The positives are certainly
    massive of this technology and obviously, this is used to conduct business that
    can be good or bad but id like to think or hope that the good is better than the
    bad or evil that happens.
- desc: I myself have thought, "I have nothing to hide, I don't care if the government
    knows what I'm doing", but after watching this Ted Talk, it is so true, privacy
    is very important and I wouldn't want people to parooz my emails and social media
    accounts. It's easy to say, when you don't believe that anything of yours will
    ever become public but in actuality if my information was published it would be
    a traumatic experience. Privacy is so critical, it allows us to have a part of
    us all to ourselves, I think this is a necessity.
- desc: In last lecture we discuss about the business strategy and how online agency
    companies represent their business online.we also discuss that are we doing something
    wrong by agreeing to the term and service privacy policy of every website. sometimes
    because of it they can see some of our personal information also. May be This
    topic take a long discussion in class also.
- desc: 'I learned in the meeting that what do companies to make privacy?

    Companies have IT experts, and they guide them in many ways.'
- desc: Although the world is becoming more public with the advancement in technology
    and social media, privacy is one of the most important rights that we should protect.
    In a democratic society, I believe there should be no surveillance of its citizens.
    It is mistaken to think that privacy doesn't matter unless you have something
    to hide. It is one of the government's responsibilities to prevent crimes without
    the full surveillance of every citizen.
- desc: It's alarming to see how we are forced to do more things online but unfortunately
    the thing that the head of the WhatsApp talks about it and focused most on is
    how their app is encrypted end to end but the thing they didn't talk about is
    how they collect users data even when its unnecessary. For example Signal the
    same app for text messaging does not collect any data on it's users but on the
    other hand WhatsApp collects over 50+ different types of data on it's users which
    tells you all the talks they put about privacy and security is noting more than
    marketing.
- desc: I learned from the video that end to end encryption lets you send a message
    directly to the receiver and no one else can see that message, not even WhatsApp.
    It is also very helpful for doing business online where you can do it privately
    without any doubt.Due to COVID-19 we are force to do everything online so will
    it remain same after COVID-19 or it will change is a question which will have
    an answer after the pandemic ends completely.
- desc: In the last lecture, we talked about the privacy policies of the companies.
    We talked about how to create a privacy policy so that it is easily available
    to the common public. The more people are aware of the privacy policies the less
    is the chance of them being scammed by the so-called big tech companies.. We also
    proposed some idea of how the companies can try to make their privacy policy more
    readable to the common public but also the duty of the people who use the technology
    to understand what does the company has to offer and what does it return.
- desc: 'Meeting 16:

    In this meeting, we discussed the different aspects of privacy and various avenues
    that we have available or lack thereof to protect our privacy online. There were
    mixed opinions as some people thought that we have to give up our online privacy
    in exchange of free and better(optimized) services while others thought that we
    need better and stringent regulation from government to protect our privacy.


    Meeting 15 response (I was unable to do it in previous forum):

    In this meeting, we discussed our rights and responsibilities on the Internet.
    I feel that any rights that we have offline should automatically extend to our
    lives online. This opinion is similar to what UN has to say on this topic. As
    far as responsibilities are concerned, we should all assume responsibility and
    expect others to display the responsibility to not share misleading and baseless
    information online. While some of that type of information may be harmless, other
    such fake news can be provocative and lead to social disharmony. We should all
    assume the responsibility to fact check the information to the best of our abilities
    before sharing unconfirmed and deliberate misleading information.'
- desc: "In class we talked about the basis of privacy and how to keep privacy well\
    \ still using the internet. A question that I have that stems from this topic\
    \ is how can you keep privacy if we\u2019re loving more and more technologically\
    \ because we\u2019re beginning to store almost our entire lives online. Some company\
    \ has to have that information so there isn\u2019t true privacy."
- desc: 'The most important thing in the meeting what I learned was about the privacy
    matters and how it is interrelated with each and every individual and future of
    digital communication using AI.

    the topic related to previous class is about privacy concerns.

    The difficult part for me to understand was how future digital communications
    have privacy concerns.'
- desc: I think it is important to understand the different types of "rights" one
    has in a certain place. On the internet it becomes obscure what ones rights and
    responsibilities are but in my opinion we should try to accommodate the rights
    which we can at least prehensile, such as freedom of speech and right to express
    an opinion.
- desc: In the zoom meeting we discussed about privacy rights and also about the need
    consideration of privacy issues in organizations which can increase their usage
    of applications or number of users. according to my perspective privacy is very
    important in every field.
- desc: In the recent lecture, we talked about privacy on internet platforms. The
    Ted speaker has coded the scenario very correctly as he implies the shift from
    freedom to mass surveillance from the company services we use such as Facebook,
    google and many others. We also have had a breakout session regarding the topic
    and interesting points were raised to tackle the privacy such as legal obligation
    from the government, conventional way to making a platform in the context of ethics,
    and many others.
- desc: "\u201CThe future of digital communication and privacy\u201D by Will Cathcart\
    \ taught me a lot about WhatsApp and the technology it uses. I already knew that\
    \ WhatsApp uses end to end encryption but I was unaware of the business model\
    \ and the scale of the application.\n\n\u201CWhy privacy matters\u201D by Glen\
    \ Greenwald is a brilliant video. Very powerful speech. His arguments are very\
    \ strong. I will definitely be recommending this video to people who think that\
    \ if someone is being secretive that they are hiding something. I would love to\
    \ see more video from Glen Greenwald."
- desc: I think that privacy is very important in the age of technology because companies
    and governments have the ability to get so much information about a person; keeping
    that information private is vital. Surveillance can be used for important reasons
    such as stopping criminals and terrorists, but more often it is used to invade
    the privacy of normal people who are doing nothing wrong, which I think is a problem.
    I think the freedom and privacy of the majority of people should be valued more
    highly than fear of a small group of wrongdoers.
- desc: Nowadays, with the development of Internet, online privacy becomes a common
    concern of many users. Recently, it appears many businesses operating and working
    by collecting online users' data, personal information and selling them. It is
    definitely harmful to our privacy on the Internet because we do not know whose
    are bought our information, as well as what would they do with our information.
    However, that is basically how many businesses make money in this modern world.
    Everyone makes money by somehow doing something ethically wrong to other person.
    In general, when everything we do is highly dependent on the use of Internet services,
    they need to change the legality of it to protect our privacy.
- desc: In this lecture discussing about the privacy why it is important? So if for
    example the transaction detail of your account is leaked and the confidential
    detail is shared every where it will have a great concern regarding it. So the
    privacy play an important role in persons advantages and disadvantages. Talking
    about future communication so it really has a great preferences regarding the
    future digital communication. In todays world we see a great change in our communication
    which is going fully digital. The future communication will be still more that
    will have a great preferences. Privacy is a thing that identifies and defines
    our daily digital communication relationship with this fast growing environment.
    Through the digital life it gives a privacy that people have a meaning and a behavioristic
    way of communicating with each other in todays world.
- desc: From meeting 16, I understand why privacy matters. I believe that having privacy
    as human beings helps us to understand a sense of who we are and gives us the
    freedom to live without fear of our information being compromised. After watching
    the TED talk video on why privacy matters, I understand how privacy helps us define
    our self-relationship.
- desc: The most important thing I leaned from last meeting was that not many people
    actually read the policies and agreements for the services they are using.
- desc: In this we mainly discussed about the privacy polices of the websites and
    how these privacy works. Every website has different policies which requires to
    be accepted by the user. But all these policies are protected for the user safety.
    However these policies are too long to be read and sometimes user misses the important
    information and accept the policy. Which sometimes may lead to trouble, but these
    issues can be sorted by shorting the lengths of the policy and only mentioning
    the importance information.
- desc: In the last meeting we discussed about how privacy matters in all social media
    apps that we use day to day.
- desc: In class we discussed about the proctor tracking and how it can breach our
    privacy. This will be helpful for next assignment of empathy map.
- desc: We talked about the privacy issues regarding the procter track software and
    it is really nice of the professor he understood the major concern.We debated
    on the topic how the information stays in Canada only and do not go anywhere else
    when we enter in Proctertrack software but still it goes through our network layers
    without seeking permission from us
