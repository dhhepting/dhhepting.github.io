- desc: <div>the last meeting was really interesting as we get to know about the members
    of CIPS. we had an interesting talk, the part about today's meeting that I liked
    the most was the difference between a mentor and a coach. I think mentoring involves
    emotional connection but coaching is all practical.</div><div>this subject was
    a little different from the other computer science courses as it is more related
    to social and beyond little things. I learned many little things and their big
    consequences.<br></div>
- desc: "<p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In our 26<sup>th</sup>\r\nmeeting we discussed\
    \ more about CIPS. There is also a CIPS mentor program. Many\r\nin the CIPS mentor\

    dir="ltr">In the last class, we had a lecture from Abhishek shaksena and his team
    from cips. They talked about how they offer to mentor future students and they
    talked about the benefits of mentoring and instructing and the difference between
    them. They explained how they help the students and IT professionals to be better
    at what they do and help them through all the ethical and technical help in the
    future. </p></b><br><br></p>
- desc: <p>Today nothing to discuss about or nothing to respond. But just wanted to
    say thank you very much for helping us throughout the semester, organising different
    events specifically from CIPS. It was very much and knowledgeable. You are a great
    professor who his always willing to help and make ways to design the class better
    so we can understand stuff easily. I hope I will see you in-person on campus.
    Thank you!</p>
- desc: "<p><p>I had no idea that there were mentoring programs out there. After\r\
    \nworking 15 years in SAP and implementing other ERP systems, the company I\r\n\
    worked for never made any mention or had ties with CIPS. One of the main\r\nreasons\
    \ I left my career was because there was no mentoring or room for growth,\r\n\
    so I appreciate being made aware of programs like these. <br></p><br></p>"
- desc: <p>I would like to know more about the CIPS mentorship. It is nice to know
    there is a place where you could get a person to help you figure out coding problems
    and IT stuff when your out in the world. I did like that he said it takes strength
    to say no to someone who asks you to do something unethical.</p>
- desc: <p>I like how engaged the speaker was with the chat this meeting. A lot of
    people brought up their own views and thoughts on what they need and he was quick
    to respond, build on, and encourage those sorts of things which I thought was
    really nice to see. I hadn't really considered this sort of program before, and
    I agree with some of the other students that as I'm still in my first year I can't
    really take advantage of it, but I'd like to look into it more in the future as
    I'm closer to finishing my program. It sounds like a pretty great resource.</p>
- desc: <p>We had guest from CIPS mentor program who gave presentation on mentorship
    program. I got to learn more about the importance of mentor in a person's life.
    I would surely look more into it. Lastly, we had discussion about final exam and
    had the last class of semester.</p>
- desc: <p>There were guest from cips and we discussed about the differneces between
    mentor and coach i really loved it and later discussed about finals i really loved
    these class for these semester</p>
- desc: "<p></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Today\u2019s meeting,\r\nwe had 3 guest speakers\
    \ from CIPS\r\nSaskatchewan. They were giving us pep talk about the mentorship\
    \ program in CIPS Saskatchewan. One of the guest Abhishek mentioned, for mentorship\
    \ people need average 20 to 25 years of\r\nexperience. Experience cannot be replaced\
    \ with knowledge. Experience is really important.\r\nHe also mentioned, as a mentee\
    \ we should look for mentors who will always\r\nencourage us. They won\u2019t\

    \ a valid reason and raise concerns if needed, so we can be a\r\nmentor and leader\
    \ in future.&nbsp; </span></p><br><p></p>"
- desc: <p>In the last meeting we had a presentation on CIPS Saskatchewan.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>It was pretty cool to learn about the Mentor/Mentee program through CIPS.
    Honestly it's nice to see a local organization working hard to make tech a better
    place to be, and knowing that this is an option for me in the future of my student
    career is important to me. I'll definitely be looking into these programs and
    certifications closer to the end of my degree because this kind of initiative
    is really awesome to bring integrity and consistency to our profession.<br><br>Thank
    you for organizing these talks, Daryl! :) <br></p>
- desc: <p>We had a guest from CIPS Saskatchewan at the last meeting of our course.
    It's about three of them. The one who introduced their slides was Abhishek. I
    did not know the difference between coaching and mentoring until today. We discussed
    about our final examination later.<br></p>
- desc: I always enjoy seeing guests come, it was very cool to talk to them about
    the mentoring program, especially since ill be in my last year next semester,
    its an opportunity i can consider. I was also able to ask them about volunteer
    opportunities and hopefully, i get an email back from them, it'll be really nice
    to get some experience this summer. Aside that it sucks that it was our last day,
    it was a very interesting class, with lots going on which made it very fun! Thank
    you!<br><br>
- desc: <p>In todays class we talked about CIPS and had a brief discussion with the
    members about leadership, mentorship and other stuff. Later we also talked about
    the final, the process and timings</p>
- desc: <p>In last lecture we had meeting with CIPS management team people Mr. Abhishek
    was explaining us about the mentoring and case studies and we also discussed about
    the final exam in the last half an hour. we also discussed how the final exam
    is going to come on URCOURSES on Monday 5 pm to Tuesday 5pm. overall it was good
    experiencing with the crew if CIPS.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>The most important thing I learned in this lecture is that there are even
    more CIPS resources available to me that I don't even know about. Even after attending
    a CIPS meeting that went over the details about certification (which I previously
    didn't know about), there were additional perks that one could benefit from via
    the mentor program. It just goes to show that there are many ways that UofR CS
    students can get quality help and information (and help/information that can really
    mean something for the next professional step of any individual).<br></p>
- desc: <p>We learnt more about CIPS and discussed about final exam.</p>
- desc: <p>In our last meeting, we had a visitor from CIPS Saskatchewan, and we also
    discussed about the final test.<br></p>
- desc: "<p><p><span lang=\"EN-CA\">In my final lecture of the semester, I loved\r\
    \nlistening and studying stuff that will be really beneficial in the long run.\r\
    \nSince I am the kind of person who thinks ahead, and so learning more about\r\
    \ncareer windows when attending lectures is great for me. I believe that if I\
    \ am\r\nable to do anything in CIPS code, it will undoubtedly lead to a bright\
    \ future.\r\nSince everything is being computerized, I would certainly like to\
    \ work with\r\nthose organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\
    \  </span></p><br></p>"
- desc: "<p>In the last class, had some representatives from CIPS. We talked a lot\
    \ about their mentor program. And I learned the difference between mentoring and\
    \ coaching, mentoring is an informal association that\u2019s focused on building\
    \ a two-way beneficial relationship for long term career e.t.c while Coaching\
    \ is a formal association that\u2019s focused on building improvements in behaviour\
    \ to resolve present work issues e.t.c</p>"
- desc: <p>It was nice to get a more "practical" application of what a CIPS membership
    would entail, specifically regarding the mentorship program and possible lifelong
    benefits that can occur with the connection, both employment and furthering knowledge-related.
    Will certainly be good to keep in mind when I enter my third and fourth years
    of this program.</p>
- desc: <p>We had an interesting topic in the last meeting on experience. Experience
    does not mean that a person sits in the darkroom for over 100years, but having
    connectivity of a network of people and people can encourage or discourage us
    here; trust is the crucial factor. Our passion guides us in the right direction
    to select a career. We need to focus on personal and professional development
    from a bigger vision.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>:)</p>
- desc: <p>meeting 26 also have a guest talk coming into class. They talking about
    CIPS (I'm not sure the name). They said they will pick 3 student to work for them.
    I sure that's not me, because I have low grade, low work ability. And final is
    24 hour start from Monday 5pm to Tuesday 5 pm</p>
- desc: <p>Mentorship is an interesting way to ensure that you are conducting yourself
    as an IT professional. You have a reference that you can follow and use to make
    informed decisions because they have the experience that you are lacking. I would
    say that experience is the most valuable asset to any new members of the workforce,
    and mentorship can provide a stand-in for that experience as you build your own.</p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting, we had more members from the CIPS program to tell us about
    importance of mentor and mentee as well as to tell us about the mentorship program
    within CIPS. They also told us about group mentorship if we are unable to secure
    a dedicated mentor.</p>
- desc: <p>In last meeting, we had guests from CIPS who talked about the importance
    of being a member of CIPS. He referred CIPS as one of the most credible designation
    to have to get a upright in getting a job in an IT firm. We also have had question
    and answer session where many students asked really crucial question. Eventually,
    it was a learning experience.</p>
- desc: "<p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">We learned many things in this class, the\r\n\
    class begins with the wide introduction of CIPS guests. We all learned many\r\n\
    important concepts of mentor. They all guide us about, how the certification\r\
    \nhelps us all in multiple ways. They explained many different concepts that relates\r\
    \nthe professional conduct for safety and security.</span></p><br></p>"
- desc: During the last presentation I learned the importance of having a mentor throughout
    your career. The CIPS Mentorship program makes it easy for CIPS members to find
    mentors which is nice and convenient. I am only in my second year of university
    but as I get closer to graduation I definitely plan on looking into getting a
    mentor through the CIPS program.
- desc: It was a privilege to have top members of CIPS Saskatchewan in our meeting.<br>It
    was awesome as they introduced us to the concepts of "Mentoring and Coaching".<br>I
    learnt that 'Mentoring' focuses on building a two-way, mutually beneficial relationship
    for long-term career movement and personal growth while 'Coaching' focuses on
    improvements in behaviour and performance to resolve present work issues.<br><br>From
    my personal understanding, i think mentoring has to do with the whereby mentee
    learns by example and hands-on stuff from the mentor<br><br>This meeting was actually
    meant for me in the sense that i really need a mentor in my field of IT where
    i can be guided with the right decisions to make, how i can be effective and successful
    in the field of IT.<br><br><br>
- desc: <p>In meeting 26, we have the guests from&nbsp;CIPS Saskatchewan,&nbsp;CIPS
    (Canadian Information Processing Society) is responsible for the certification
    of ISP (Information Systems Professional) and ITCP (Information Technology Certified
    Professional).</p>
- desc: <p>In this lecture some prominent members from CIPS Mentorship Program Committee
    Members came.They discussed about their certifications program.Maria Galati,Abhishak
    Saksena,Doug Lawrence.Every member has some very deep insight in them.They told
    how this certification program will give confidence to an employer before hiring
    us.They also discussed how Canada is emerging as another hub of IT.After it Prof.
    Daryl discussed about the final exam.</p><p><br></p><p>At the end of the class
    everybody appreciate Daryl and thanks Daryl for always gives us extension for
    assignment when we need it.</p><p>Thank You Daryl this class was most stressless
    class of this semester.</p>
- desc: <p>Last meeting was all about the guest lecturers from cips, they were explaining
    the importance of mentors and mentorships and also ways of getting into the same.</p>
- desc: <p>Knowing about CIPS was a great experience. It was good to know about an
    organization that offers IT professionals networking opportunities as well as
    professional certification. It also helped me to understand in-depth about a field
    that has a vast variety of opportunities.</p>
- desc: "<p>In\r\nthe meeting, we had 4 guests from CIPS Saskatchewan \u201CAbhishek\
    \ Saksena\u201D,\u201D Susan\r\nSutherland\u201D, \u201CDoug Lawrence\u201D, and\
    \ \u201CMaria\u201D. They spoke about mentors and mentees,\r\nwhat I learn and\
    \ understand that mentor is the one who is teacher, they teach mentee\u2019s\r\
    \nby telling their lived experience and provide them feedback of where mentee\r\
    \nneeds to improve. Mentors are the one who can lead you to the success. The\r\
    \nmentee is a student who is following the mentor\u2019s path to learn what they\
    \ should\r\ndo to achieve their goal. Mentor and Mentee is a two-way trusted relationship.\
    \ They\r\nalso talked about if there are students who wants to sign up for membership\
    \ or be volunteers. After, we had quick Q&amp;A session then We had discussion\
    \ about\r\nfinal with professor.<br></p>"
- desc: "<p>I found it very interesting that there is a system of \u201Cmentors\u201D\
    \ for graduating cs students. I am a lot more confident in my future knowing there\
    \ will be support for me to find my way into the computing world outside of school.</p>"
- desc: <p>In the last meeting we had special guest Mr. Abhishek Saksena I.S. P from
    the group of CIPS Saskatchewan. He is CIPS SK board member. It is always great
    opportunity to discuss career opportunity with the people from computer field.
    He made excellence points on monitoring and coaching. As my own inclination mentoring
    a is kind of guidance from someone on a specific subject&nbsp; and coaching is
    like getting training from professional. The last part of meeting was loaded with
    nutshell of final exams. To encapsulate will say CS280 is highly proficient for
    introducing youngster to risk and reward in information technology. It is fun
    and worthy to getting introduce to unknown fact in the cyber space. Thanks to
    Professor Hepting and Grateful for the semester</p>
- desc: <p>I found the CIPS presentation, in particular the discussion on the mentorship
    program, the most informative, personally of course. Although, I don't think the
    level and/or degree of mentorship possible with CIPS is comparable to something
    like a graduate student-supervisor relationship (at least that is the feeling
    I got from the presentation), and I do think they are a worthy comparison, since
    any individual actively engaging in a sort of mentorship program is obviously
    looking for that experience. I am obviously not graduate, so I do not have personal
    experience, but I do have an idea as my brother has completed graduate studies.</p>
- desc: In the last lecture of the semester, we all discuss our final exam, how it
    went be and what is the pattern of the exam, and at what time it will be uploaded.
    how we have to write it and all the stuff related to the final exam we discuss
    in class. overall I like to attain the lectures and our professor is very helpful
    and his teaching method is also good. he always answers all the questions and
    makes us understand very well about every topic. so, I just want to thank you
    professor for all your efforts in the whole semester.
- desc: <p>In the last lecture, i would say some about code of ethics as they play
    important role in computer science, it ensures the thing we do is build are for
    good not to harm others, checking is needed everywhere even in new gadgets to
    checkout if they are under the moral values.<br></p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting we had guests from CIPS mentoring program. One of the guest
    was Abhishek who was a board member of the CIPS mentoring program. He told us
    about the program and what they do. Explained the meaning of a mentor and how
    through their programs mentoring we can increase our strengths to do more in the
    job sector. It's always a pleasure to hear such things. Thank you professor for
    bringing such guests.</p>
- desc: <p>This was the last class for the semester and we have discussed the final
    exam and its model. There was a presentation by Mr. Abhishek and his team about
    his career and how the software has changed his life and also how having a good
    mentor is important in your work life. There was also a discussion on what is
    difference between mentor and coach. <br></p>
- desc: <p>The last lecture was the last day of that amazing semester. I really enjoyed
    this whole semester but in the last class, because of my job, I was not able to
    attend the whole lecture. We had new guest and had a talk about CIPS again but
    unfortunately I was not able to listen to it. I would like to thank you professor
    for sharing your great knowledge and for sure, I would like to have more classes
    from you in the upcoming semesters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you again.</p>
- desc: In the last lecture, we saw a lecture presentation by Abhishek Shaksena and
    colleagues of CIPS which is the leading UK-based global firm and their main work
    is of purchase and supply. Basically, they explained the different ways they've
    implemented to counsel and instruct upcoming future students and how they can
    be benefitted from that. Also, they briefed about the ways for helping the students
    and people working in IT department for their betterment and bright future.
- desc: '<p>In our last lecture we had&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.9375rem; -webkit-text-size-adjust:
    100%;">Abhishek Saksena, Doug Lawrence, and two more guests who shared their experiences
    and knowledge with us and then we discussed about final exam.</span></p>'
- desc: It was helpful
- desc: <p>The meeting was interesting. I learned about the mentorship program that
    CIPS offer "CIPS Saskatchewan Mentorship Program". I will be joining CIPS soon
    for my AITP certification as well as for the mentorship program. This will definitely
    help me&nbsp;advance my career in IT.</p>

- desc: <p>Well for this meeting it was interesting tp learn more about the orginaztion
    and beeing able to ask questions. Like that fact that am eligible to sign up and
    be part of the mentoring program and I can get in for free.</p>
- desc: <p>At the last meeting, the meeting 26, there was a speech from CIPS again.
    The CIPS is an organization which offers the certificate for AISP, ISP, ITCP.
    At the meeting, the high-level members gave us more detailed information about
    the CIPS program. Now we know more information about CIPS like the background,
    how to apply, etc. I think the certificate is necessary for students. We can have
    many benefits from it. It is an important provement in computing skills.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>Last class we discussed about the mentoring with the guest who came to
    explain us about that. Mentoring plays a very important role in our lives as it
    involving you and your capabilities with a different perspective , a good mentoring
    builds confidence in a person. A mentor trusts and provides feedback to help you
    improve.</p>
- desc: <p>There is a lot I have learnt from this class this semester. From the organised
    lectures and seminars from people in the computer science field to learning about
    morals, code of ethics and principles used in the field. That is one of the most
    useful pieces of information learnt so far, thanks to Dr Hepting for a great semester.</p>
- desc: <p>In last meeting, the guests discussed and highlighted the importance of
    mentors or coaching. We also talked about the difference between a mentor vs coach.&nbsp;
    Coaching is more inclined to being performance driven. While, mentoring deals
    a more development driven approach. A reading I've read that's related to this
    is found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231620/why-performance-development-wins-workplace.aspx">https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231620/why-performance-development-wins-workplace.aspx</a>.
    Interesting to learn more of how coaching is a more effective approach. because
    it revolves on developing people by creating expectations, intentionality, and
    accountability.</p>
- desc: <p>In class we had a presentation presented by the CIPS. A question that I
    would raise regarding their program is similar to the one that I raised during
    our last class presentation. Just how hard is it to be accepted into something
    like this and do you need a degree in order to excel? There is a lot of things
    within the computer science world where I have seen you don't necessarily need
    a degree but it helps.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: '<p>In this meeting we discussed about a lot of things. One thing that I liked
    the most was that we do not have a proctor exam. I think this can help me in focusing
    more on exam without stress of proctoring. I also like the idea of 24 hours take
    home exam.</p><p>Thanks for always understanding us!</p><p><span style="font-size:
    0.9375rem;">It was a great experience on this class and with you this semester!</span></p>'
- desc: <p>In this meeting we had another presentation by CIPS. It was an informative
    session about what mentoring is and how to find the right mentor for yourself.
    They also talked about the benefits we can get as a CIPS member and the mentoring
    circle that we can access. Towards the end of the class, the professor discussed
    the final exam. This has been a wonderful semester with Dr. Daryl Hepting. There
    were some great discussions during the lectures related to the ethics of information
    society. Thank you Dr. Hepting for this wonderful semester.<br></p>
- desc: <p>Having CIPS come to speak to the class one last time was really nice. If
    it were not for this class I do not think I would have heard of them, which I
    really appreciate. I really enjoyed this class thank you for the thought provoking
    discussions throughout the semester, I hope you have a good summer.</p>
- desc: <p>The most important thing I learned last class was that CIPS has a mentor
    program and mentoring circles. The hardest thing to understand from last meeting
    was specific benefits from these programs. I feel like there wasn't enough discourse
    related to what CIPS mentoring offers that just talking to other industry professionals
    does not. I do believe it makes it easy for people who want to talk to industry
    professionals in general and don't know where to begin, but I think individuals
    can do a better job at reaching out to professionals involved in the jobs they
    want in the future.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p><span id="docs-internal-guid-452451c7-7fff-93a8-50e8-e8b17980a661">Although
    I do not plan on applying for a CIPS membership, their information on the mentorship
    program was beneficial. The presentation taught me about the main differences
    between mentoring and coaching. While coaching is often a formal, training-based
    approach, mentorship focuses on a two-way informal relationship based on trust
    and mutual growth. Learning about this type of relationship has widened my perspective
    about mentorship in my life. As an instructor at a learning centre, I find that
    I learn from my students as I teach them. Instead of simply being an instructor
    and student, we have fostered a relationship of mentorship together.</span><br></p>

    \ some really cool\r\nguests, from a varied background and associated with CIPS.\
    \ I think highlight of\r\nthat discussion was the talk on mentorship. How CIPS\
    \ not only encourages\r\nmentorship between senior and younger professionals,\
    \ but actively nurtures it\r\nby creating the necessary connections at various\
    \ events. While a lot of events\r\nare cancelled in person due to COVID, we wouldn\u2019\
    t be computer scientists if we\r\nwere unable to user computers and solve that\
    \ problem. Sites like Meetup.com and\r\nEventbrite can be used facilitate this\
    \ process.</span></p><br></p>"
- desc: <p>For our last meeting of the semester about half the class was for the lovely
    presentation, so I'll comment on the class as a whole. Throughout the semester
    the importance of ethical computing has been paramount, with an emphasis placed
    on either a company or personal code of ethics (such as CIPS's) alongside the
    importance of professional certification. On top of that it is also important
    that we as future computer professionals are cognizant of the applications of
    our programs or algorithms and to ensure that we are upholding the public good
    and trust. A little civil liberties and sustainability also goes a long way, as
    well.</p>
- desc: "<p>I feel like you've really listened to me this semester. once again those\
    \ \r\nguys were grate guest speakers and I learnt a lot from them for example\
    \ \r\nproper way to build resumes, more about the CIPS program and so on.it's\
    \ been a grate semester and i hope i get a grate mark too. You've been an excellent\
    \ professor thank you!.<br></p>"
- desc: <p>I enjoyed learning about things like ethics and cybersecurity this semester.
    I'm interested to learn more about things like hacking and cybersecurity in future
    computer science classes. I feel like after taking this class I will always try
    to think about what kind of impact technology and computer code will have in relation
    to the public interest, and about ethical concerns surrounding software and hardware.</p>
- desc: pretty good discussion about CIPS. Gives us a better scope of the IT community
    in canada.
- desc: <p>Last meeting of the semester, it was really fascinating and interesting.
    there were guest speakers in this meeting who talked about CIPS Saskatchewan it
    was really informative and the conversation was pretty fun with them. Overall,
    it was a great last meeting and a great semester.</p>
- desc: In the last class, we talked about the mentoring opportunities that entail
    by the CIPS Sasketwechan. We had a speaker from CIPS SK, to address the difference
    between an instructor and a mentor. He described his life's journey of how a mentor
    is very helpful in your career and helps you make ethical decisions. He talked
    about the mentoring services that CIPS offers.&nbsp;
- desc: "<p>I am happy to learn the moral principles of programmers. If I have a chance,\
    \ I hope to join the Canadian Information Processing Society.And\uFF0Cthank you\
    \ for your guidance this semester. Have a good vocation\uFF01<br></p>"
- desc: <p>Recently since last few lecture we are having sessions with CIPS team.
    In the same way in our last lecture of this semester we had a great discussion
    with Abhishek Shaksena. He explained that how mentoring is beneficial for us and
    so on. By the way was a great semester with all of us. Great support from Professor.
    Excited to study CS 428 with Professor. Thank you so much. Stay safe.</p>
- desc: <p></p><div><div><span style="font-size:.9375rem;">The last class is our last
    class of this semester, we invited some guests from CIPS(<em>Canadian Information
    Processing Society</em>) to our class.&nbsp;They talked a lot about CIPS organization.
    For example, what does this organization do and the benefits of joining this organization.
    Now the organization in the computer field is getting better and better. A large
    number of talents in all aspects.&nbsp;Need to do more understanding in the future.&nbsp;I
    will strive to use the computer knowledge I have learned to benefit society.&nbsp;The
    future needs to pay more attention to the relationship between computers and society.&nbsp;</span><br></div></div><br>
- desc: <p>In the last lecture we had a talk with Abhishek Sakshena and his team from
    CIPS. They talked about how they built the future student and mentor them. They
    also talked about how they hire the student so that they can built their future.
    They also explained that what is the difference of instructing and mentoring.</p><p>This
    was the best class for me this semester. I also have taken CA 428 in Fall 2021
    and I am very excited to see you in fall.</p><p>Thanks for the great class</p>
- desc: <p>We had three guests from CIPS who talked more about mentoring and how we
    should chose our mentor. There was a discussion of difference between coaching
    vs mentoring and I personally think coach is someone who wants to see a specific
    result and in shortest period of time possible from you while mentor is someone
    you trust and based on this mutual trust he/she is someone who helps you in life
    for years and try to make you learn as you grow. So a coach is more of a formal
    relationship while relationship with a mentor is more of informal where most of
    the time you can share or discuss things with a mentor easily.</p>
- desc: The last meeting was very informative and useful for our future and career.
    We had a group of Committee members for a membership program, organized by CIPS
    Sask. For starters, we learned the difference between Mentoring and Coaching.
    When I think of a wore mentor, the things that come to my mind are, A person whom
    I can look up to, and freely ask questions without any hesitation. I learned others'
    perspectives on mentors and mentorship that how it can help me in a long run.
    And what should I look for in a mentor. We also discussed about how to get into
    the mentorship program. In the end, we had a quick discussion about our finals.
- desc: <p>In the last meetings, we had some guest speakers from CIPS Saskatchewan.
    They were committee members of a Mentorship Program, and we discussed about what
    a mentorship program is and what Mentorship means to us. For me personally, a
    mentor is who can help me with experience, and can help me grow alongside them.
    During the end of the lecture Professor explained more about our final exam.<br></p>
- desc: <p>I enjoyed the talk about mentorship and I also enjoyed the class.</p><p>It
    was really fun&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>in the last meeting, we met with some committee members related to membership
    program, which was organized by CIPS sask. They made my opinion change regarding
    mentoring and coaching, as they explained these terms so well.</p><p>on the whole,
    the class was really good, as it cleared my thoughts related my future, and at
    the end of the class we discussed about final, which is going to be a blog submission.</p>
- desc: In the last class meeting, we had a meeting with a people of committee members
    for a membership program which is held by the CIPS SASK. this meeting is very
    useful for us because in this emitting we got information about our career as
    about the membership mentors and coaches. we ask any questions to them and get
    answers without any hesitation so it is a very useful knowledge class for us as
    it helps a lot to us to get into the membership program.
- desc: <p>Last class, we had a kind of seminar, with Committee members of a mentorship
    program from CIPS Saskatchewan. We basically learned about what mentorship and
    a mentor are, and how they can play a vital role in our future. We also discussed
    how these mentorship programs work and how to enter one. At the end we got more
    information regarding our final from Prof. Hepting.&nbsp;</p>

    a good eye opener for me as I haven't been involved in much mentorship asides
    my 6 years in highschool
- desc: <p><p>The past meeting was informative and I learned many things. The guests
    from CIPS explained us the difference between mentoring and coaching. It was a
    good conversation between us and the guest. We also discussed about the finals
    at the end. I had a great semester with professor and look forward to see him
    in other courses.</p><br></p>
- desc: <p><p>The last class of the semester was great and interesting. We had guests
    that explained us about mentoring and coaching. They were from CIPS and had a
    good understanding of the the topic. Overall, I enjoyed the last class and had
    a great semester with professor. Looking forward for him to teach us in CS428.</p><br></p>
- desc: <p>I found the information presented from CIPS very enticing. I am currently
    a third year about to go into my fourth year and I will definitely consider the
    program. It could definitely give me valuable knowledge. Thanks for everything,
    it was a good semester!</p>
