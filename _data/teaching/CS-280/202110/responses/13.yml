- desc: in today's class, we discussed firstly the due dates such as the extension
    of the discussion forum so that this is a really good thing that professor decided
    for us because all we are going with our midterms so it really had to do everything
    within a time limit so prof gave us a pool in which about 97% vote for an extension
    so that's really a good thing now that we have a good time for our project and
    blog submission. apart from that, we had a good discussion about project description
    and a short discussion about the internet and social media that were quite democratic
    in the way they empowered people also we discussed it in BRomm so it was a nice
    class.
- desc: "First, I would like to say thank you to Dr. Hepting for being considerate\
    \ of all the students\u2019 schedules by giving them the extension. I don\u2019\
    t need it however I know that lots of them do, considering the overwhelming majority\
    \ voted yes to the deadline change.\nI would say two of the most noticeable logical\
    \ fallacies are bandwagon and ad hominem. Bandwagon can be highlight by social\
    \ media platforms such as the like/dislike ratio or the number of retweets, etc.\
    \ Just because a large number of people believe in it doesn\u2019t mean it is\
    \ correct. Ad hominem fallacy is fairly used in any political argument over the\
    \ internet."
- desc: "In my mind, the one of the more dangerous fallacies we can come across is\
    \ the False Dilemma Fallacy. This is a logical fallacy that presents only two\
    \ options, an \u201Ceither or\u201D situation. However, there is often a very\
    \ large grey area that has to be taken into account.\nAs an example, with privacy,\
    \ we cannot view it as either a \u201CWe value your privacy\u201D or a \u201C\
    we should know everything possible about you\u201D, there are many things that\
    \ can be beneficial to know to improve a user\u2019s experience. So, there are\
    \ intermediate phases between the two that we need to look into, and weigh the\
    \ benefits and downsides of each."
- desc: 'We had a discussion about fallacies and what kind of fallacy is the worst
    and which one is the most widely known. For me the worst kind of fallacy could
    be the Ad Hominem. This happens when one side runs out of arguments and instead
    attacks the opposite person instead of trying to hold their ground or conceding
    defeat. Even in day to day conversations, this fallacy creeps in when one person
    cannot agree to the other persons views and they start attacking them. It is a
    sleazy fallacy but it can ruin your relationships with people if your only counter
    to any argument is to attack the opposition.

    '
- desc: 'I really enjoyed today''s discussion on the danger of fallacies and how they
    interact with technology. My experience with them is moreso from a philosophical
    and discussion/rational persuasion point of view and I''d like to see how they
    play into technology, especially from the development side of things.

    I liked Daryl''s point about the fallacy of misplaced correctness -- we discussed
    something similar in my PHIL 277 class, where often times important innovation
    or change can be disallowed due to fears of uncertainty or risk, but I think it''s
    worth noting that we cannot predict anything. Just as there are unhappy surprises,
    there can be happy ones as well, and the model cannot predict everything.'
- desc: Democracy is certainly harmed by technology, at least in some capacity. I'm
    sure it can be improved, but I think an obvious example of this is the 2020 US
    election. There is a sizable portion of Americans that believe the election was
    rigged, largely due to Youtube, Twitter, and Facebook posts. Now two groups of
    Americans believe completely different realities. Even though technology is what
    provides us information, I would argue disinformation is likely more harmful than
    no information at all. However, I don't think the solution is as simple as rejecting
    the ad model, like Jaron Lanier suggests.
- desc: At the beginning of class, it was mentioned that democracy and technology
    might be incompatible. I find that a very interesting idea I would like to know
    more about. What are the points for and against this statement? Is democracy actually
    incompatible with modern technology, or is it just that technology moves so fast
    that democracy and regulation have trouble keeping up? I think this would be a
    great breakout room discussion to have sometime in class.
- desc: In the meeting, I learned about fallacies, and these are in every sector and
    field. Technology is one of them. Common misconceptions in it that are like mobiles
    and their app like calculators are not good for humans. The dangerous misrepresentation
    about Information Technology that is Coding is more challenging, and sometimes,
    people neglect it.
- desc: The part that I enjoyed the most about the meeting today is to postpone the
    due dates. Of course, this in my mind is very positive because we will think more
    and eventually get more thoughts if we have more time. But everyone can have different
    preferences, so we did with a majority. I did not, however, obtain any specific
    ideas on the subjects of the proposal and the project proposal structure. So I
    look forward to coming to grips with that.
- desc: In today's meeting we discussed about fallacies and also about the deadline
    of the project proposal. We also discussed about what topics we can choose for
    the project and what's their word limit should be.
- desc: 'in this meeting, we discussed the logical fallacies, in the breakout room
    our topic of discussion was the straw man: mainly on the existence of God. there
    is no evidence that God exists so due to lack of evidence this is a fallacy also,
    on the other hand, some people tried to prove that God doesn''t exist, but lack
    of evidence makes it a fallacy. The discussion was very interesting but there
    was very little to discuss.'
- desc: Due dates were discussed today and I appreciate Dr. Daryl Hepting for providing
    us this extension. There was a discussion on fallacies and also there was a little
    bit discussion on "democracy is incompatible with technology". I would like to
    know more about this, what makes it incompatible with technology.
- desc: Ad hominem and appeal to emotion of the red herring fallacies are popular
    and dangerous fallacies. There are many groups of people today who attack the
    arguers and appeal to the emotions of the situation instead of focusing on the
    problem on hand. I won't mention any examples because they are too controversial
    but these methods are proving to be ineffective as they led to no progress. Appeal
    to novelty and appeal to tradition are some of the fallacies we face in the tech
    industry.
- desc: From meeting 13 I learned the scale of danger that we are in due to tech giants
    peeking into our lives. What I realized is right now as future computer professionals
    if we can not compete with these companies and their super powerful A.I we should
    at least spread awareness, educate others about the best way to tackle this and
    help them to keep their private life private. Also, the part where the professor
    took into consideration the due dates, I am thankful and appreciate that.
- desc: Since social software is part of our daily lives, it seems to be all the more
    important. Behind the software, however, there are a number of people who are
    working on algorithms and trying to attract people's attention. In addition, our
    privacy is often at risk of being exposed, and online fraud is not uncommon. So
    some people have come up with the idea of reconstructing the online world. I think
    that's good, but how to get there is a topic worth discussing, and at least for
    now, reconstruction seems unlikely. However, there is no doubt that people should
    start to think about the current network environment, perhaps through regulation
    and other ways to protect the interests of users.
- desc: I would be interested in learning more about this surveillance capitalism.
    I think before anything can be done about big tech companies taking peoples personal
    data you would have to remove big corporations donating to political campaigns.
    People are too easily influenced these days and this vast amount of money keeps
    politicians in power. By accepting this money to stay in power they are essentially
    saying that, for them, taking the money is worth the cost. So for anything to
    be done about this I think you would need to stop big money from entering politics,
    since with that money you can easily influence undecided voters.

    Title: On surveillance capitalism


    Surveillance capitalism is a unique concept best outlined the book The Age of
    Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff, a professor at Harvard Business School.
    She discusses the modern impact of how corporations actively perform data collection
    on our activities and interests in a variety of ways. Methods as complex as monitoring
    streams of metadata from photos to which push notifications attract us the most.
    Once these corporations have obtained the data, they run it through their internal
    algorithms, often embedded into the existing applications that recommend us similar
    activities of interest. The most widely used format is YouTube, where if a fresh
    account clicks on some food recipe videos, that account will be bombarded in the
    next couple of weeks by food related channels and food related published media.
    Even going cross functional into other applications like Google News. The concerning
    action on this is not that they process our data, but the way they store that
    on their servers. Creating an artificial and dynamic profile of us and attaching
    keywords to it to better build the model. The security aspect is just as frightening,
    since not only does big tech like to know what we purchase, but so do banks and
    other financial institutions. However, technology companies often have better
    security than most financial institutions. Apple routinely blocks access to government
    based organizations or any organizations, access to their data. Financial institutions
    do not invest in technology and do not actively innovate in the security space
    as much as tech. Case in point, when Equifax got hacked in March of 2017, millions
    of individuals, even those outside the US, were severely affected with cases of
    identity theft. Therefore, we should be worried more about our personalized profiles,
    spending habits and other titular data being stored within those organizations
    far more than big tech.'
- desc: Well the discusision was very interesting talking about fallacy. That on how
    the different one even when i think one is more dangrous a niether person makes
    a point on a niether fallacy which makes it much more dangrous like for example
    the fallacy where you based it on the people belief that we are judging people
    based on now that is scary. Makes me want to re look at the fallacy and reevaluate
    them
- desc: I think there should be an initiative to inform people about social media
    and their uses of user data so they can decide for themselves rather than expect
    sites such as facebook to change methods that will likely be to their detriment.
- desc: First of all thank you very much for extending the deadlines for assignments.
    It is helpful because we are having midterms this week for after exams now we
    can focus on assignments.
- desc: The most interesting thing I learned in yesterday's lecture was about the
    effect of technology on democracy and I would say that technology 100% supports
    democracy; case in point being Wallstreet frenzy happening. Now finally retail
    investors are able to stand up against hedge funds thanks to technology.
- desc: "Response\nIn the last meeting, the professor provide a presentation video\
    \ named \u201Chow we need to remake the internet\u201D by Jaron Lanier . To be\
    \ honest, this speech impressed me and i very agree with his opinion.\nIn his\
    \ speech, he mention an earliest computer scientist named Norbert Wiener. This\
    \ scientist describe a very amazing suppose in his book (from my perspective,it\
    \ can be said to be a prophecy): \u201Ca global computer system where everybody\
    \ has devices on them all the time, and the devices are giving them feedback based\
    \ on that they did,and the whole population is subject to a degree of behavior\
    \ modification.\u201D Think about it , don\u2019t the society we lived look like\
    \ this now? It seems like we lived in a big Skinner box. Then Jaron Lanier extended\
    \ a point that (i very agree with) current advertising model is a big mistake.\
    \ In his opinion, maybe the early ads are really were kind of ads. That ads maybe\
    \ like your local dentist or else. But during the development of technology and\
    \ algorithms, current ads can\u2019t be called advertising anymore. It more like\
    \ behavior modification. Maybe someone think it\u2019s exaggeration. But i want\
    \ to use an example to show how the ads change our behaviour. Most current ads\
    \ have a certainly psychical hint, it more communicated with our subconscious\
    \ and find\_the link between what they are selling and what you want to have\_\
    . For example,when they advertise a dating social network , they show you pictures\
    \ of beautiful couples hugging , they show you what you need , you imagine yourself\
    \ in this happy state ! they do the same for the sports equipment like the AB\
    \ stuff , they show you a great muscled body which you would like to have .. and\
    \ then the guy meets a beautiful girl , who seems to be attracted to him .. so\
    \ they not just advertising the AB flex , they are also advertising something\
    \ that can get you in a love relationship with a beautiful girl ! that\u2019s\
    \ what they do ! they communicate many hidden messages , and they add illusion\
    \ to the value of their products , and some people go for it. I think the original\
    \ internet shouldn\u2019t like this . We shouldn\u2019t let the social network\
    \ become \u201Cbehabvior modification empires\u201D just like Jaron Lanier said\
    \ :\u201D the new social media world should be when you get on you can get really\
    \ useful,authoritative medical advice instead of cranks. It could mean when you\
    \ want to get factual information, there\u2019s not a bunch of weird, paranoid\
    \ conspiracy theories.\u201D"
- desc: "On meeting 13, we discussed details about a project that was coming soon,\
    \ and some fallacies. I would like to talk about fallacies: there are numerous\
    \ fallacies in philosophy and society forms. some are formal some are informal.\
    \ We say the formal fallacy is the fallacy that has logic errors, informal fallacies\
    \ do not have logic errors. However, they have factors that cannot support the\
    \ statement. So, for instance, a formal fallacy with \u2018Affirming the consequent\u2019\
    : something causes something is true then both of them are true. An informal fallacy\
    \ with \u2019Equivocation\u2019: to mix up the same word with different meanings\
    \ like honey can be a sweet food or a romantic calling. So we need to avoid these\
    \ fallacies when we want to argue a topic or make a statement."
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed the project proposal and later discussed fallacies,
    and if fallacies are good or bad. I think that fallacies are bad and we should
    avoid them because they try to create misconceptions about truth.
- desc: The thing that fascinated me was a large bundle size comes hand-in-hand with
    a rich app experiences. App developers are increasingly concerned with ensuring
    their app bundles remain as small as possible. So they choose lightweight SDKs
    or download content just-in-time where possible.
- desc: I disagree with the idea that technology is not compatible with democracy.
    I would argue that it is because social media, in spite of its flaws, provides
    a platform for an individual to express their own thoughts and ideas. It is a
    tool to enhance communication and it can, as a result, optimize democracy. The
    problem is just that these apps decide who hears who via filter bubbles, so the
    reception is heavily manipulated by these 'echo chambers'.
- desc: The discussions about fallacies (and how they can be detrimental to computing)
    reminded me about something equally dangerous -- bias. Both bias and fallacies
    impact our reasoning and thus we should be aware of both and how they impact computing
    (wiki link for more detail about bias - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias). For
    example, we might be favorably biased about a certain software because we like
    using them (say google, Facebook, or Door-dash), and thus might be more dismissive
    about some of the poor business practices they do (say high fees in the case of
    Door-dash). After all, its reasonable to say that it is difficult to critique
    or evaluate something with good reasoning when that reasoning may be clouded in
    bias. Thus, just as important as understanding fallacies is understanding bias,
    otherwise our critical thinking will be compromised.
- desc: First we talked about the deadlines of project and blog, then discussed about
    project proposal and in breakout room we had talk about most dangerous thing.
- desc: I have a growing interest in surveillance capitalism and I look forward to
    any kind of conversation that arises from the topic, and the video posted if we
    get a chance to return to it. I am curious to know where up-and-coming computer
    professionals stand. Data is useful, but the methods in which it is obtained raises
    an interesting debate.
- desc: Thanks for explaining the groups better. i added a link from the zoom like
    to urcources useful links. The link is for an example of a research template.
- desc: 'In this meeting, we studied many things about the thoughts about the fallacies
    are dangerous or not in reference to IT. So, as per my opinion there are many
    facts which focuses on the type of situation. And in general, it is dangerous
    if it has risk of privacy. One important thing that we learned which was the fallacy
    of misplaced concreteness and of humane interface.


    '
- desc: "Last day we were discussing logical fallacies -- of which there are plenty\
    \ that we can find ourselves trapped in. In our modern digital age wherein we\
    \ have the entirety of humanity's knowledge at the click of a button, we need\
    \ to be sensitive to this quantity of data and how we go about using it. Are we\
    \ committing to good faith interpretations of the data and representing it as-is?\
    \ Or are we perhaps using it for nefarious reasons (i.e. correlation != causation)?\
    \ Perhaps relying to heavily on anecdotes or appeals to authority? When we are\
    \ engaging we need to be cognizant\_of fallacies and bad argumentation.\n\nThis\
    \ website does a good breakdown of the 15 most common logical fallacies:\_https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/common-logical-fallacies"
- desc: 'In the last lecture, we had a long discussion and argument over extending
    the due date and also did a poll, in which majority of the participants voted
    for extending it, including me. To be honest this is really helpful for everyone
    as these weeks are loaded with so much work and exams, thanks to Dr. Hepting.
    Apart from this, the most interesting part of last meeting was discussion about
    fallacies . For me, It was a new thing to learn and i would love to discuss it
    more briefly.


    Thanks:)'
- desc: 'the most important thing you learned from this past meeting:

    the most important thing in the meeting was about discussion of technology and
    the due date extension of the project.


    the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:

    there is nothing that i felt difficult concept from the past meeting.


    what you would like to know more about:

    i would like to know more about that facebook being incompatible and about the
    dangers of fallacies


    something you encountered that is related to the past meeting

    discussion about fallacies was from past meeting'
- desc: Last meeting was actually quite fun and interesting to participate as firstly
    we discuss about the extension of due date in which almost all students plea for
    extension and that was the end decision. Along with that we also had a discussion
    about fallacies, which was really interesting to discuss . In the breakout rooms,
    we discuss about the fallacy of straw man. Though, it is a vast topic but also
    unclear and do not have enough evidences to go on any end decision.
- desc: 'in meeting 13, I had an idea of how technology and democracy works. I had
    an understanding of how technology influences democracy. To me, I feel technology
    has its positive and negative impacts on democracy. like the wall street frenzy
    that happened that''s a good impact of technology on democracy.

    but there are other big technology companies that have underlying costs and this
    explains the negative impact of technology on democracy.'
- desc: We discussed Logical Fallacies in class. Logical fallacies are errors in argument
    which can be irrelevant points or illegitimate arguments because they lack evidence.Circular
    argument, ad homimem, and ad populam are some different kinds of logical fallacies.
- desc: "I am interested in the \u201Cfallacy of misplaced concreteness,\u201D where\
    \ one treats an abstraction of real life as a real entity. This is common in Computer\
    \ Science, where we make models of real phenomena, often forgetting that these\
    \ are just models and not the real phenomena itself. This relates to the way we\
    \ view data: a series of numbers devoid of meaning. Viewing data this way, and\
    \ stripping it of its context, is dangerous. We miss all of the nuances that make\
    \ data unique, that make it human. The topic of data humanism is further explored\
    \ in Giorgia Lupi\u2019s TED Talk titled \u201CHow we can find ourselves in data:\u201D\
    \ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFIDCtRX_-o&feature=emb_title."
- desc: I learnt about different types of fallacies - reasoning that is logically
    incorrect. I also learnt about sunk cost fallacy which was mentioned by a student
- desc: "I learned about fallacies in class and also did my own research to understand\
    \ different kinds of fallacies. I will definitely pay more attention to my own\
    \ arguments as well as other\u2019s arguments to find the use of these fallacies\
    \ so that they can be avoided.\n\nBoth videos \u201CHow we need to remake the\
    \ internet\u201D by Jaron Lanier and \u201CHow Surveillance capitalism is undermining\
    \ democracy\u201D by Shoshana Zuboff were full of knowledge. I learned about Norbert\
    \ Wiener and his predictions, which have come true. The behavior modification\
    \ of masses by corporations need to be stopped. Also, I joined the Movement for\
    \ Human Technology."
- desc: In the last meeting professsor explained about the project proposal and shifted
    the due dates for upcomming assignments to next week which was great. After that
    we continued our discussion on the fallacies. in the break out room we discussed
    about which are the most popular and most dangerous fallacies in our room we agreed
    that the gambler's fallacies is the most popular one as it appeals to everyone
    and appeal to tradition is the most dangerous one as in this people think everything
    in the traditions are true, even if it doesnot appeal in todays world this can
    creates barriers in the community.
- desc: 'I preferred the discourse, and it surely came to me when we are generally
    pondering about the social issues encompassing stages like Facebook, Google Adsense,
    and Twitter.

    In any case, I don''t think I concur that the answer for the promoters who rule
    our lives is to cover the data behind paywalls. Online media doesn''t need to
    be business by any means.'
- desc: In regards to last meeting's topic of fallacies, I agree the the bandwagon
    fallacy imposes the most danger. It can be dangerous when truth is defined based
    on popularity. Especially, when it comes to designing and implementing systems.
    I think in a level it can potentially hurt creativity. For instance, as software
    developers, when it comes to implementing an application there can be a tendency
    to implement a design similar to an already existing popular application killing
    the developers creativity. The disadvantage is that the problems concerning ethics,
    lack of protection etc in these popular applications just gets replicated and
    increases in numbers thus increasing the problems. I believe this fallacy is also
    applicable for end users. End users can be susceptible to this fallacy by joining
    social media by the pressure that everyone is using it. These users don't tend
    to look at the security drawbacks when signing up and usually have no clue what
    potential danger these apps can be when it comes to their data. I guess I'd like
    to know more about how we can avoid this fallacy as a computer professional.
- desc: The fallacy my mind is revolving around right now is people thinking after
    getting governments stimulus checks they will be able to live happily after. reality
    is those checks proof of invitation to global inflation in coming years.
- desc: 'In the "How We Need to Remake the Internet",


    If people can get beyond the appearance, he''s actually making some valid points.
    The interesting thing is that we wouldn''t be here today if the open source community
    didn''t exist. These large companies have their entire infrastructure running
    on open source code.


    When you try to profit from content, it gets tricky because people will try to
    game each other and act in dirty ways to get you more hooked on their product.
    I don''t think a subscription-based service is the solution either, although it''s
    a step in the right direction. We can''t reach steady state if someone is always
    trying to succeed by charging less or offering more lucrative features.'
- desc: In the recent lecture, professor accepted our request to extend the submission
    date for project proposal. Professor also gave some context regarding the content
    he requires in the proposal. This gave us a reference to make an apt proposal.
    We also talked about humane technology, and how that we are at the risk to be
    vulnerable by our own conscience.
- desc: Observation free enterprise is a one of a kind idea best illustrated the book
    The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff, an educator at Harvard
    Business School. She examines the cutting edge effect of how enterprises effectively
    perform information assortment on our exercises and interests in an assortment
    of ways. Strategies as perplexing as checking floods of metadata from photographs
    to which message pop-ups draw in us the most. When these companies have gotten
    the information, they run it through their inner calculations, frequently inserted
    into the current applications that suggest us comparable exercises of interest.
    The most generally utilized arrangement is YouTube, where if a new record taps
    on some food formula recordings, that record will be assaulted in the a little
    while by food related channels and food related distributed media. In any event,
    going cross useful into different applications like Google News. The disturbing
    activity on this isn't that they cycle our information, however the manner in
    which they store that on their workers. Making a fake and dynamic profile of us
    and joining watchwords to it to more readily fabricate the model. The security
    perspective is comparably startling, since not exclusively does enormous tech
    like to understand what we buy, however banks do as well and other monetary foundations.
    Nonetheless, innovation organizations regularly have preferable security over
    most monetary foundations. Apple regularly obstructs admittance to government
    based associations or any associations, admittance to their information. Monetary
    establishments don't put resources into innovation and don't effectively improve
    in the security space as much as tech. For example, when Equifax got hacked in
    March of 2017, a huge number of people, even those external the US, were seriously
    influenced with instances of data fraud. Consequently, we ought to be stressed
    more over our customized profiles, ways of managing money and other nominal information
    being put away inside those associations undeniably more than huge tech.
- desc: 'In meeting 13, I had a thought of how innovation and majority rules system
    functions. I had a comprehension of what innovation means for popular government.
    As far as I might be concerned, I feel innovation adversely affects majority rules
    system. like the divider road craze that happened that is a decent effect of innovation
    on majority rule government.


    yet, there are other huge innovation organizations that have basic expenses and
    this clarifies the negative effect of innovation on vote based system.'
- desc: In class we talked about fallacies and it got me thinking on what the greatest
    fallacy of computer science was. In my opinion the most common fallacy is that
    it is super complex. Yes it's hard to do but once a person gets to doing it, it
    makes sense, just like everything else. People make it out to seem like programming
    is the most complex thing in the world when in reality most people with basic
    knowledge and drive could learn it.
- desc: '1. The most important thing you learned from this past meeting?

    We discussed the extension of the due date for the project proposal

    2. The concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand?

    There was no such difficult thing I experience from past meeting with this meeting

    3. what you would like to know more about?

    The danger related to the fallacies and would like to know more about the incompatibility
    of using FaceBook.

    4. Something you encountered that is related to the past meeting?

    Nothing'
- desc: I don't think technology will bring democracy, but it could lead to a more
    efficient autocracy. In fact, the continuous development of science and technology
    will lead to industry monopoly. The resources will be more and more concentrated,
    and the gap between rich and poor will become bigger, which could eventually lead
    to a monopolistic dictatorship. In the world, the government is the highest monopoly
    group, monopolizing media resources, import and export resources, high-tech talent
    resources, and so on through legal and violent groups, controlling taxes, and
    other measures. At the same time, the government undertakes part of the responsibility
    of allocating resources and promoting development. In the Internet era, the government
    can control all kinds of information of the people through various Internet portals,
    including public opinion, food, clothing, housing and transportation, work, etc.
    In the novel 1984, the government uses technology to monitor everyone, which improves
    the efficiency of despotism. Without resources and voice, it is tough for ordinary
    people to achieve democracy. However, there is nothing wrong with science and
    technology being the primary productive force, but it is difficult to bring about
    democracy.
- desc: We discussed fallacies in today's class. I think fallacies are bad because
    they create misconceptions and most times they are far from the truth.
- desc: In the last meeting we discussed about extension on our project and blog entry-2.
- desc: Surveillance Capitalism is a very interesting concept. The speaker is absolutely
    right, they are stealing from us without any repercussions. It is manipulative
    and affecting our choices and decisions without us even really realizing it. The
    brain is very complex and it feels like big tech has figured out a way to hack
    our brains. When she talked about the trump campaign targeting black voters, that
    absolutely disgusted me. This undermines democracy and it is crazy the amount
    of uses this behavioural information has.
- desc: Professor provided an outline of how to write a project proposal at the last
    meeting. How to submit them, if you are working in groups. The best part of the
    last lecture was the creation of polls for the Project Proposal and Blog Entry
    2 extensions.
- desc: In lecture we discuss the project proposal and the topics for it and also
    the due date is extended for it. and then we discuss technology, democracy, and
    all. the relation between technology, the internet, democracy is in a Past investigation
    has offered an assortment of clarifications on the connection between the majority
    democracy and the web. The discoveries propose that web entrance and online control
    both adversely affect majority rule democracy and the web's impact on vote-based
    system scores is molded by online restriction. also we discuss about some other
    stuff. that's all.
- desc: In our last class we talked about why democracy and tech are incompatible.
    A lot of people now believe that because technology is becoming a deeper part
    of our lives, the environment, and, ultimately, what we perceive as reality. Democracy
    is increasingly tasked with the necessity of looking ahead into an uncertain future
    as people will not be able to govern themselves.
- desc: "Capitalism does undermine democratization to some extent. Financial oligarchs\
    \ can control all aspects of society. Social media has now become a new type of\
    \ financial oligarchs who can control the direction of public opinion. To some\
    \ extent, people cannot freely express their opinions on the Internet. Social\
    \ media can control information, promote what they like, and eliminate what they\
    \ don\u2019t like\n\n"
- desc: In last meeting we studied about the fallacies are dangerous or not to the
    IT. there are so many facts that in general it has risk of privacy. and, the important
    thing which we learn is fallacy of misplace concreteness where people treats the
    abstraction of real life with entity and this is common in computer science and
    IT.
- desc: In this class we discussed about the project proposal and blog post 2 and
    the due dates. At the end of the class we had group discussion on fallacies and
    what it meant to us. I would like to learn more about the fallacy on IT fields
    and programmer jobs.
- desc: 'In the meeting 13 we talked about Surveillance Capitalism which is undermining
    democracy and also an assaults'' to human autonomy that cause problem to people.
    The Artificial intelligence the process from them is they just collect our all
    data and through that they also predict about us. This behavioral prediction that
    is "Market" is sold and modified.

    The A.I backbone produce data that is in Trillion. The concentration of knowledge
    which is considered as power that is used to come back to people through the data
    gathered. This power shape, tune and modifies at scale which is digital born of
    power used into different forms. The systems in digital market has been taken
    secretly without asking and selling this database called "stealing" which is missed.
    In this modern world people steal the data from the platforms and are selling
    for the different purpose which is a illegal work and against the law. This also
    is undoubtedly a wrong step which is missed by the software builders amongst us.
    The logic of racism brought that black people cannot vote and those information
    to analyze to get idea. The categories were organized by this software which was
    a human anatomy and caused harm to people.'
- desc: In group discussion we discussed about fallacies but not much and I was not
    able to relate with our course so I would like to know more about it how it relates
    to our course
- desc: 'n the past meeting, we learn about the way in which our alograthims work.
    It has more control over the privacy of the users and it control what we in the
    searched options. The data collect by the applications we use is also used for
    the personal benefit of the computer applications. This should be stopped and
    users must be made aware of the things.


    '
- desc: 'The way in which the computer professionals are developing the applications
    for the use of general public and using their private data for personal benefit
    can be understood. The software work on the basis of behaviour of user and shows
    the output accordingly. The problem of fallacies is also a thing to be looked
    at. The spread of wrong information on the internet can result to miscommunication
    which can harm the society. Trusted sites should be believed and used for future
    use.


    '
- desc: In the last meeting, we discussed about Project Proposal. Adding to that,
    professor also extended due dates for submissions.
- desc: the
- desc: In last lecture, we just discussed about the project proposal and what we
    have to do in that .
- desc: "In the last meeting we discussed about the project proposal.\_\n"
- desc: "In the last class i enjoyed how considerate you were as to give us an extension\
    \ for the project proposal as well as the second blog\_\n"
- desc: in the last meeting was based on the topic of the video about surveillance
    capitalism basically it all adds uptogether and makes a cycle in which we are
    in, the algorithm was shocking in the video and how their chronology the cycle
    works for example the "A.I backbone" of the facebook and how they secretly collect
    the data in terms of behavioural recognition and this is such a big threat and
    so little knowledge about it. In the lacture we also talked about project proposal
- desc: "In our 13th meeting we discussed how our project proposal will be marked,\
    \ what to do with our 2nd blog essay, what kind of oath should every programmer\
    \ have and finally what were fallacies people used in the media and in daily life.\
    \ With our 2nd blog essay we have to discuss and argue a topic discussed in class.\
    \ An example of a fallacy is the Post-hoc fallacy which describes if an event\
    \ or object A proceeded event or object B, then \u201CA causes or caused B\u201D\
    \ would be a false assumption and a type of fallacy."
- desc: In the past meeting, we discussed about the project proposal and blog entry
    2. We also had a breakout meeting room where we discussed about fallacies (good
    and bad). In our group we discussed about the false dilemma fallacy.
- desc: I think the most important thing that we learned from this meeting is that
    how technologies are threating our democracy. Like how much data these companies
    collect and how much that they know about us that they can easily use it to impact
    people's decisions and using these data they can predict our future behavior and
    decision. In worst case for example these companies can use that against us like
    impacts who we vote and chose to vote for in an election or sell it to somebody
    else and that's very scary and a threat to our democracy.
- desc: I like that we pushed project proposals back a bit, I had a very hectic week
    and still going about it so it helps a lot and lifts the stress. Id like to mention
    that again Facebook is being the center of attention along with these other major
    things, it feels like those movies where a demon comes and you pay them to make
    your life easier but at the cost of your soul and identity, in this case, Facebook,
    and Google are the demons who just can't get enough of sucking us drying, but
    people still use it because it makes life easier and the alternatives aren't as
    good or strong if we are still referring them as demons.
- desc: 'In meeting 13 was talk about how is internet if use internet technology in
    wrong way (war is one of it). behavior modification empire is shown in some movie,
    people are living in a perfect world with no crime no war build by data, and because
    of the manager of internet won''t let it happen. Then the main character found
    out conspiracy behind the world then they will try to escape that world. It about
    benefit, if using internet company use technology earn benefit with no baseline.
    It also disturb the society not less than war. So everything in internet should
    be transparent.

    '
- desc: In the previous lecture we saw a video on TED2018 about How we need to remake
    the internet. Jaron Lanier is basically trying to explain how the technology that
    we ourselves created is doing nothing but eventually destroying mankind. He further
    talks about the creativity and ideology of people in the past for enhancements
    in technology. SO basically the invention in technology and all this social media
    platforms and in general the whole internet is a curse to humans and a big mistake.
    Hence, in-order to survive, someone should undo this creation.
- desc: In meeting 13, we discussed about the project marking, blog entry 2 and the
    project proposal. Also went through the extension for both of the upcoming assignments.
    After that we had a group discussion in breakout room about fallacies.
- desc: 'In the beginning of the class i got to know about the extension about the
    due date of the assignment. The another important concept i learned from the class
    was fallacies and from the point of view of project its was very important for
    us to know what we can choose. however, the discussion about the internet was
    really short but was useful for sure.

    '
- desc: The topic in today's meeting about whether technology helps democracy or not
    really intrigued me. I think technology, in a moderated manner, could be the best
    thing for people. Because of it, now in the time of need more people have come
    together than ever and can support acts of democracy from even the other side
    of the world and that in my opinion makes the world a better place to live in.
- desc: in last meeting, firstly we did a poll to extend the due date of project that
    is really helpful for us. As in this week we all have hectic schedule as this
    is the midterm week. i am really thankful to professor. Also, we discussed about
    fallacies and what kind of fallacy is the worst and which one is mostly known.
- desc: In last lecture we had a discussion about fallacies and project proposal.
    Had a breakout room to discuss something more about that!!
- desc: In the last lecture, we talked about the fallacies in computer science. There
    are a lot to discuss about. I think all of them are wrong.
- desc: With the development of Internet technology, updates of algorithms and hardware
    generation after generation, the internet is breaking away from the original intention
    of the developer with many social problems. There is no doubt that internet has
    change our society dramatically, but also bring some new challenges and problems.
- desc: 'The class starts with the discussion about extension to the due date of the
    project and majority of individuals were in the support. I would like to appreciated
    professor for providing extension because we all are having hard time in between
    preparation for the midterms. As per the perspective of project submission many
    important points were made in the class. Such as word limit and what topic we
    can choose.


    From the point view of the study i learnt an important concept about the fallacies
    an how they are interacting with the technology.in the class it was also discussed
    that democracy and technology might can be incompatible. We had a really small
    discussion about it and i would like to know more briefly about this with the
    help of examples,
