- desc: "While not directly related to the main topic of today's lecture, I found\
    \ the original discussion on where you should post the event invitation online\
    \ fairly interesting. Despite being what is ideally an \u201Copen\u201D environment,\
    \ many of the different social media/community sites have vastly different use\
    \ cases, despite falling under very similar classifications. What may be seen\
    \ as appropriate to post onto Facebook, can be inappropriate or out of place to\
    \ post in Instagram or Snapchat, despite the three of those platforms having a\
    \ large overlap in user bases. To me at least, it seems like a form of segmentation,\
    \ where despite the fact that we could technically have one website/profile that\
    \ does everything, it is important for us to have almost different personas or\
    \ modes on differing websites."
- desc: 'In today''s meeting, I had a bit of trouble navigating claim rights and liberty
    rights and how they interact with regards to the internet.


    "Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has
    a liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person
    who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person
    has a claim right against someone else, that other person''s liberty is thus limited."


    Looking at these, it seems like they defeat each other and you can end up with
    a cyclical sort of interaction between them. Do you even have liberties if responsibilities
    supersede them? Can you be held responsible if personal liberties supersede those
    responsibilities? How can we regulate this and ensure that people are protected
    and safe on the internet when it is unclear what will always take precedence?'
- desc: "Something we discussed in class that I would like to know more about is the\
    \ Aspen Institute. We discussed in class how the Aspen Institute is funded by\
    \ Facebook and was made to help address social issues across the United States.\
    \ As we have discussed in previous classes, Facebook and other social media platforms\
    \ have exacerbated many social issues like polarization and social distrust. So\
    \ is Facebook using the Aspen Institute as a \u2018band-aid\u2019 PR move to help\
    \ with their current negative public image, or was it built with good intentions\
    \ in mind? This sounds like an interesting discussion topic."
- desc: 'It was another interesting meeting in which we discussed about Claim rights
    and liberty rights.

    Claim rights are the rights that entitle the responsibilities, duties on other
    parties regarding the right holder.

    Liberty rights are the rights which does not entail obligations on other parties.


    These rights are applied on many different things such as essays, research papers,
    informative article, videos etc.


    We also did the breakout room to discuss the same things.'
- desc: 'I would suggest doing a multiple-choice poll of what kind of social media
    platform do the students have. That would be a wiser choice for time than waiting
    for people to answer in the chat.

    There are laws that companies usually follow when operating online. While people
    can do whatever they want with some consequence. If they are an online troll,
    then they could get banned from one platform; then they can just create another
    account. There are instances of people losing their job because of the kinds of
    stuff they posted online, so they are held accountable for their actions.'
- desc: 'After reading an article "Weave: The social fabric project I learned a new
    word called weaver. Weaver means the people who make efforts to build connections
    between people and make each person valued. They see the community as their home.
    In America their are crisis of connection between people they feel isolated and
    weavers is the community of people that are helping them to lead love in all people.'
- desc: 'the most important thing you learned from this past meeting:

    The weave topic, claim rights and the liberty rights as discussed and the registration
    for them Robotic Mars Exploration.


    the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:

    The concept from past meeting is the democracy of the internet usage


    what you would like to know more about:

    I would like to know more about the liberty rights as a software developer


    something you encountered that is related to the past meeting:

    the empathy discussion and democracy of internet'
- desc: "Our discussion during class about \u201CWhat are your rights and responsibilities\
    \ online and upon what do they depend?\u201D was quite exciting. I also learned\
    \ about the differences between claim rights and liberty rights and how they are\
    \ inverse of each other. I would like to know more about how these rights play\
    \ a role in advancement of technology and how they shape technology."
- desc: In meeting 15, There is a topic name "Weave The Social Fabric Project ", it
    about America need to build communication system for their citizen and arrange
    worker to spread this idea. Because America had many social problem came out since
    last year, Most of their citizen have their own survival system. If other want
    to break the balance of their system, it won't work. Liberty rights in America
    is unlimited, their citizen thinking of right is important to anything. So appropriate
    restrictions are necessary, even if it is unacceptable at beginning.
- desc: In our 15th meeting we discussed claim rights, liberty rights, online rights,
    online responsibilities and the rights to privacy. Claim rights are rights that
    other people or parties have responsibilities to do for the right holder. Liberty
    rights are liberties and freedoms a rights holder have. When it comes to online
    rights we discussed how much of claim rights to liberty rights should there be.
    Another discussion that came about with rights is what exactly were the kinds
    of online responsibilities should internet users have. Lastly we discussed about
    privacy and how much should people have or be willing to give away to use a service.
- desc: in meeting 15, I learned about the act of weaving. Weaving is a project that
    aims to build social trust to address the root cultural cause behind many social
    problems. I actually believe this would help solve the issues of isolation and
    help people connect more helping reduce the use of social space as a comfort means.
- desc: Today's society is different from before, computers play an important role
    in our life. I think its right to computer use also becomes very important. For
    example, freedom, people have the freedom to use computers. Since computers are
    our private property, we also have claims and rights to them.
- desc: we discussed about mars exploration, talked about rights on wikipedia.
- desc: We'll for this one, it was quite interesting talking about rights that these
    big companies will have since if we don't really have right for privercy and really
    currently we have no way to go and protect knowelged but at the same time if we
    do have rights will cause that we might lose people talking about things that
    they don't know about but they still have a useful perspective.
- desc: "Topics discussed today were quite different but something new for me. I like\
    \ the concept about the claim and liberal rights. As the claim right requires\
    \ other persons' liabilities, duties, or commitments, it seems to me like the\
    \ right of some managers or authorities who can control their employees\u2019\
    \ work in a professional manner. A liberty right, on the other hand, is a right\
    \ that confers no duties on third parties, which is like the employees who work\
    \ under those managers."
- desc: "The ethics of rights\
    \ on the Internet\n\nLast class we had a brief discussion and breakout room on\
    \ the subject of rights on the Internet. Or more specifically which rights should\
    \ we have on the internet. One of ideas my group came up with alluded to information\
    \ processing. The internet is an undisputedly a hub of shared information to be\
    \ gained by anyone who is willing to spend the time to learn. Therefore, it should\
    \ be us who are held accountable when presenting varying pieces of information\
    \ on the web. Be it on social media, email or even over the phone, the internet\
    \ is so large that it encompasses all three and allows us to be in the know. The\
    \ critical point in this is that the people presenting any sort of information\
    \ on one of these digital platforms should be presenting with the facts in mind.\
    \ Garnered from justifiable sources, and findings presented with key data bits\
    \ and figures. Ultimately, misinformation should be cut down via the community\u2019\
    s approach not just the corporations."
- desc: In our last lecture, we talked about claim and liberal rights. A claim right
    is a right that requires other parties' responsibilities, duties, or obligations
    in relation to the right-holder. The right to liberty, on the other hand, is everyone's
    right to personal liberty, including freedom of movement and freedom from arbitrary
    imprisonment by others.
- desc: I think we need to look over claim rights vs liberty rights online. My group
    discussion came mostly to you should have the same rights you have in person.
    However people tend to be more rude over the internet with that loss of human
    contact making it easier to be rude to people you cant see. So I would like to
    disscuss this further with what else people think would be the best way to solve
    it.
- desc: In, Weave, The Social Fabric Project from the Aspen Institute. In this nation,
    people get an interaction recession. Individuals feel alienated, invisible and
    in prison camps. Community resentment and separation underlies our most important
    matters, from ongoing economic and racial unfairness to political deadlock, a
    pandemic of hopelessness, and increasing suicide and overdose deaths. Resentment
    helps to keep us all from addressing problems such as poverty, unemployment, starvation
    and global warming. Weave encourages the several Americans in every society that
    perform to build social trust and weave neighbours together to enhance their societies.
- desc: 'Claim rights and liberty rights

    In the last meeting, the professor talked about claim rights and liberty rights.
    A claim right is a right to entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on
    other parties regarding the right-holder. And liberty right is a right that does
    not entail obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission
    for the right-holder. So, claim rights and liberty rights are inversed.'
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about the online event by Larry Matthies on
    Robotic Mars Exploration and how to register for the event. Later we discussed
    about Weave project and then about claim rights and liberty rights in society.
- desc: according to me the rights and responsibilities of a person online are in
    the hands of the developer. what he/she expects from one while using their interface,
    accordingly the preamble of rights and responsibility would be created for the
    users. To me as a future professional here learn to provide users a safe and objection-free
    digital environmnent.
- desc: It's interesting talking about liberty and claim rights. It makes me think
    of people being censored online for saying inappropriate and seemingly evil things.
    There is a lot of talk about the freedom of speech but there is also an obligation
    to censor awful hateful speech. I want to make it clear that I think people shouldn't
    be able to spread hatred. It's interesting because out in the real world you can
    be hateful with words and people won't react well to it but it's not necessarily
    illegal, but in online spaces it's a whole new world where censorship is real.
- desc: In terms of the internet when it comes to rights and liberties it seems to
    mostly revolve around personal reasonability. The internet is to an extent the
    "wild west" (although this has been rapidly changing) there are not many limits
    on what can be accessed, posted, and viewed online. When it comes to rights the
    internet is a very difficult thing to legislate. One could say they have a right
    to the internet, but everything that follows gets muddied. Does one have the legal
    right on the internet to access say, pirated material, for example? Each country
    can set different restrictions on internet access, and as a result it is impossible
    to say if you have any rights (be they claim or liberty) on the internet.
- desc: I believe your rights online come from the rules (and what is socially acceptable)
    of the platform you're participating on. If you're a platform designer, then the
    rights you provide come from law. The more interesting part is responsibility,
    which some people would say you have none. Personally, I feel that everyone has
    a responsibility as a user or creator to at least try to not be a negative on
    society. However, I'm not sure that we can realistically expect anything of everyone,
    but I also don't like the idea of limiting rights. It's still unclear to me if
    limiting online rights would improve society.
- desc: I found the claim rights vs. liberty rights a very interesting concept that
    goes well beyond simply the scope of this course and technology as a whole, and
    in that sense I would like to know more regarding this argument. Being a CS student
    who is very tired of math, I think its definitely a fresh change of pace to dive
    into a more philosophical type of question.
- desc: "On meeting 15, we\u2019ve discussed Rights and responsibilities, Especially,\
    \ I would like to talk about the claim rights and liberty rights. The claim right\
    \ is the right that takes the responsibility or obligation for a right-holder.\
    \ However, the liberty right is the right that not taking the responsibility or\
    \ obligation for a right-holder, but rather only freedom or permission for the\
    \ right-holder. The claim rights more likely tells you what you can't do, the\
    \ liberty right is what you can do."
- desc: "The last meeting was quite interesting to participate as our last meeting\u2019\
    s discussion topic was about liberty and claim rights. What i got from the overall\
    \ discussion is that liberty is synonymous of freedom, i.e. every person has the\
    \ liberty to live according to themselves. It doen not"
- desc: I Was wondering if you could talk about the final exam. A claim right is a
    right which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations on other parties
    regarding the right-holder while a liberty right is a right which does not entail
    obligations on other parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder.
    could you talk more about the Robotic Mars Exploration too.
- desc: There is a relationship and precedence that links liberty rights and claim
    rights, especially online. While we, as users, have the liberty of expression,
    we also have to ensure that our online speech is not hateful, inappropriate, or
    harmful. Making this moral decision and enforcing it universally is difficult,
    if not impossible. Thus, regulation of online activity is required, but by whom?
    Should we rely on governments or online committees of people to regulate activities,
    or algorithms and bots? The former option is difficult due to the profound amount
    of online media that exists, while the latter lacks human context. Therefore,
    it is essential to consider whether regulations can be enforced in our existing
    forms of online communication, or if these systems need to be redefined and redesigned
    altogether.
- desc: In the last lecture, we discuss the responsibilities and rights of online
    and what they depend on. Computerized rights, firmly connected to the opportunity
    of expression and privacy, are those that permit individuals to get to, use, make
    and distribute advanced media, just as access and use PCs, other electronic gadgets,
    and correspondence organizations. what's more, the duties are to Respect the feelings
    and thoughts of others. Submit to all licensed innovation laws. Try not to utilize
    or share others' work without authorization. Observe rules or potentially implicit
    rules for each Internet webpage.
- desc: "The last meeting was quite interesting to participate as our last meeting\u2019\
    s discussion topic was about liberty and claim rights. What i got from the overall\
    \ discussion is that liberty is synonymous of freedom, i.e. every person has the\
    \ liberty to live according to themselves. It does not defines anyone\u2019s obligations\
    \ towards the right holder. On contrary, claim rights are just inverse of liberty\
    \ as it does say that other party or we can say authorities have the responsibility\
    \ regarding right holder, to make sure that their claim rights are not violated\
    \ by anyone. Other than that in breakout rooms we discussed some basic privacy\
    \ rights and in which genre the fall. Moreover, the weave topic was also interesting\
    \ one. I have read the article weave: the social fabric project. Weavers which\
    \ are people who make people feel valuable and loved and help isolated people\
    \ to connect with others. This was quite new topic to me as i have never heard\
    \ about it so would surely love to know more about it."
- desc: I really liked the discussion about the relationship and precedence between
    claim rights and liberty rights. Although we have liberty, there is a responsibility
    that supersedes this. So we have freedom of expression and speech online, but
    a limited free reign. We also need to have responsibility and regulation of hate
    speech, cyberbullying, false information and spamming which is annoying a lot
    and so on.
- desc: In the last meeting professor showed us how to register for the webinar by
    Larry Matthies and in the later part we discussed about the liberty and civil
    rights for a developer.In the Breakup room we discussed that cannot do anything
    in terms of protecting our privacy once we post something on internet its out
    of our rich to protect it. we need an independent body which deals with our data
    privacy form this big tech companies link google and facebook.
- desc: I believe that a perfect a perfect balance of claim and liberty rights should
    be sought after especially in the tech industry. Sometimes people can feel entitled
    when they own products or pay for services, that they believe they can just do
    as they please without needing to think of how actions can affect others. If we
    also lean towards too much claim rights then things will be too restricted which
    can hinder progress or entice conflict within the community.
- desc: "After reading about the Weave project I realized that they were right about\
    \ how with all the technology we have today we can connect to anyone but we rarely\
    \ connect as people and get to know each other. Which has created walls and barriers\
    \ between us as a society.\_\_\n"
- desc: The most important thing that I have learned from this meeting is about our
    rights and responsibilities online. I believe you have the freedom to do whatever
    you want online as long as it is not illegal. Online activities that promote hatred
    and lies should be discouraged as well similar to what Twitter decided to do recently.
    Several students mentioned privacy which is important as well. I believe the online
    community would be a better place if people behave similar to how they do in real
    life. We have a responsibility to create better online communities.
- desc: The most important thing I took out from last class was the difference between
    claims rights and liberty rights. The concept that was most difficult for me to
    understand was second order liberties, such as powers and immunities. Although
    it was not discussed in depth during meeting 15, I am very excited, and would
    like to learn more about, robotic Mars exploration. I am eager to learn about
    this from the guests speaker via virtual webinar. Other than that, I would also
    like to learn more about Weave. I have encountered discussed about the topic of
    claim rights and liberty rights with my friends in regards to large companies,
    or our favorite services/companies.
- desc: In the last meeting, we get information about an interesting topic which is
    an article about the weave the social fabric project from here we get a new word
    that is weaver which means the people who makes the effort to build connections
    between the people and make each person valued and also learn about that the Aspen
    Institute is funded by the Facebook and also the other social media platforms
    have helped many social issues such as polarization. apart from that wed discussed
    in Brooms some privacy rights that are under liberty which is the synonyms for
    the freedom that means every person has the liberty to live according to themselves.
- desc: "As the internet lets a user use the information collected from different\
    \ sources it\u2019s user\u2019s right to make the decision .Privacy setting plays\
    \ an important role as it lets a user protect the information but there should\
    \ be a user guide for how to manage the privacy settings that makes it easier\
    \ for a user to make changes because sometimes the media is set up with the full\
    \ privacy."
- desc: Something I would like to learn more about is the responsibility differences
    between online and physical environments. Originally, I thought it was intuitive
    that we could find analogs between the physical and online environments, and thus
    relate the responsibility through these analogs. For example, we could find that
    Wikipedia (online) is analogous to a public library (physical) and thus we should
    share many of the same responsibilities (i.e. don't add books/text that spread
    misinformation for example). However, there are very distinct differences between
    the two (such as anonymity of Wikipedia), so is this analogous method appropriate
    to use?
- desc: In last meeting professor was asking everyone to join a facebook event call;
    Robotic Mars Exploration. It Seems very interesting. Beside that he again talked
    about the project topics. We also had a breakout season about online rights.
- desc: In the past meeting, we discussed about the upcoming seminar by Larry Matthies
    about Robotic Mars Exploration. We were discussing about the correct platform
    to invite many people to join this seminar. After that, we had a bit discussion
    about project proposal. Then, we had a breakout room where we discussed about
    the online rights and responsibilities.
- desc: 'In meeting 15, we discuss about Robotic Mars Exploration, it about Dr. Larry
    Matthies uses his expertise and technology to autonomously navigate robotic ground
    and aerial vehicles on Earth and space.

    And talk about the Social Fabric Project, which solves the fundamental cultural
    roots behind many social problems in the United States.'
- desc: Last Class, we discuss claim rights and liberty rights, which both are important
    rights in society. These two kinds of powers are inherent rights of people. A
    person has the right to claim his surplus-labour income freely. It is inviolable.
- desc: At the beginning of this meeting, we discussed how to register ourselves for
    the event which will be with NASA scientists. After that in the breakout room,
    we discussed how our privacy and security or our moment on the internet is tracked
    by some organization or is not safe. we concluded that it should not be easy for
    everyone to track the web activity of others, it should only be in the hands of
    the government.
- desc: The most interesting thing for me was how customers data is tracked in and
    linked, i already had the basic idea before but after attending the lecture i
    have now greater vision of how things work and how data is manipulated
- desc: In response to the question asked in class regarding what are my rights and
    responsibilities online and upon what do they depend, I think that my right and
    responsibilities online should be no different than the right I have online. However,
    I don't think that is the case. At this point, I do not have confidence to say
    that I do have rights online. Usually, the developers decide on the extent of
    a users rights and responsibility. There are applications that do let you know
    what will be done like for example some apps will ask for permission on whether
    they can access your photos, camera or mic. It's when users agree to these that
    rights usually given up to the developer. I do want to learn more about how we
    can better the online environments into allowing people to still have rights whether
    it be in regards to privacy, speech etc.
- desc: 'In the last meeting, I learnt that the differences between claim right and
    liberty right.


    A Claim Right is a right which entails responsibilities, duties, or obligations
    on other parties regarding the right-holder.


    In contrast, a liberty right is a right which does not entail obligations on other
    parties, but rather only freedom or permission for the right-holder.


    Liberty rights and claim rights are the inverse of one another: a person has a
    liberty right permitting him to do something only if there is no other person
    who has a claim right forbidding him from doing so; and likewise, if a person
    has a claim right against someone else, that other person''s liberty is thus limited.
    older.


    Based in these knowledge, my question now is that to what extents can one claim
    a right whether it be a claim right or liberty right?'
- desc: 'As I investigate more into surveillance capitalism and how technology is
    weaving its way into every one of our moves, the more I wonder how many people
    actually know what is going on. I assume that the average person is not reading
    the fine print of the technologies they are using everyday and fail to understand
    how they work. Yet when made aware that their devices are "listening" to them
    and tracking their data, the general population is absolutely appalled and made
    incredibly uncomfortable.

    '
- desc: I appreciate the concept of "weaving" from The Social Fabric Project. However,
    it is quite sad that the listed qualities of "weaving" need to be discussed and
    promoted, opposed to being natural to everybody. For example, it states "A weaver
    treats neighbors as family regardless of outward differences". I wish this was
    a universal trait that didn't need to be discussed. It really shouldn't be hard
    to treat others with proper respect and care or be an advocate for positivity.
    Hopefully one day we can get closer to the perfect world where people are inherently
    good.
- desc: "Most people seem indifferent, but I have found the topic of rights and responsibilities\
    \ online to sometimes escalate quickly. In the end, it is always the lack of transparency\
    \ or education that causes confusion, and even anger. Times have changed dramatically\
    \ but some mindsets have not. In this information age, it should be obvious by\
    \ now that there has to be some level of responsibility online. If all we care\
    \ about is streaming Netflix and shopping online, or worse, we believe in the\
    \ \u201Cnothing to hide argument\u201D, then perhaps our data collected is warranted."
- desc: In the previous meeting an interesting discussion was held on the topic "Claim
    rights and liberty rights". I would like to get more knowledge about it and we
    also discussed it in the breakout rooms.
- desc: In meeting 15 we discussed about the critical examination of computing. In
    the breakout room we discussed abut the challenges faced by computing. We also
    had a scope of the assumptions.
- desc: 'In todays class we discussed about liberty rights and claims rights . A claim
    right is a right that requires other parties'' responsibilities, duties, or obligations
    in relation to the right-holder. A liberty right, on the other hand, is a right
    that confers no responsibilities on third parties but only rights or permission
    on the right-holder.

    A negative right is a right for me to be protected from harm if I try to get something
    for myself. A positive right would be my right to have something provided for
    me.'
- desc: The class was about claim right and liberty right and discussed about peoples
    right on group discussion. Moreover, I learnt something new which is social weave,
    they are taking really good step to help people. I am excited to attend the seminar
    of the scientist from NASA.
- desc: 'In the last meeting we discussed about rights: Claim rights and Liberty rights.
    At the end of the meeting we also had some discussion on Weave project that I
    want to discuss more.'
- desc: I am really very excited and eager for the meeting regarding the NASA mars
    rover. I learnt about the liberty right and claim rights and discussed in group
    discussion in what aspects they are different from one another and wanted to learn
    about liberty right especially.
- desc: The topic of last meeting was claim rights and liberty. From meeting i have
    learnt that liberty means freedom and everyone has freedom to do whatever they
    want . On the other hand claim rights say that other parties or authorities have
    the responsibility that claim rights of right holder should not be violated by
    anone.the breakout room topic dissolved was on some basic privacy rights
- desc: I got to learn about the Claim rights and Liberty rights which was interesting.
    It was also pretty exciting to know about public even happing on Robotics Mars
    Exploration.
- desc: "Professor gave us insights about liberty rights and claim rights in the context\
    \ of technological world. He also enlighten us with a term \u201Cweaver\u201D\
    \ which implies weavers make the effort to build those connections and make others\
    \ feel valued. This term should really mark a great influence on ourselves and\
    \ the programmers who develop a platform."
- desc: In last lecture we had a discussion on Claim rights and Liberty rights. Moreover,
    at the end of class we had a breakout room to discuss some relevant points to
    that.
- desc: "In the last class we talked about our rights and responsibilities as online\
    \ users and its a topic I look forward to us discussing more. Also, the most interesting\
    \ thing I learned was knowing about the social fabric project called Weave that\
    \ aims to build social trust to address the root cultural cause behind many of\
    \ America\u2019s social problems."
- desc: In past meeting it was a great discussion on liberty rights and claim rights.
    also in breakout room we discussed some points of project with few classmates.
    I am very excited for meeting regarding NASA.
- desc: In the class, I learned that the mission of perseverance about life's possibilities
    on another planet and Dr. Larry Matthies was awarded for his work. Moreover, Weave
    is a project to build social trust in a society. In other words, Weave is a connection
    of happiness and be weaver is to care for others. Next, claim right is the right
    holder's duties on other parties, and liberty rights are the freedom for the holder.
- desc: 'I learnt that about the differences between liberty right and claim right

    liberty right means people''s right, freedom to do or have whatever, while claim
    right means obligation on people to allow or enable him to do or have whatever'
- desc: I found it quite interesting how weaving can be something to be considered
    when creating social media platforms or what already created social platforms
    should plan to move towards as through this a safer community for everyone is
    created as everyone cares for one another
- desc: One thing I found interesting and amazing from this meeting was WEAVE. It's
    true that we have less trust on people around us and it will grow even bigger
    because of how our life changes from social gathering and interaction between
    people to social media where we communicate and show how we feel. No matter what
    social media and online interaction can never replace or give feeling that a physical
    interaction do and as result many people have started to feel lonely and less
    important to society. I think WEAVE is a nice way to bring people together although
    it can't replace physical interaction.
- desc: In last lecture we discussed about arguments and liberal rights.
- desc: Weave sounds like a cool project, a lot of people have social problems and
    being able to address that is very important. I wonder what else the future has
    in stock, I doubt we would've known about weave if we didn't have the technology
    but if people really do care i bet there would still be similar things without
    technology
- desc: "Freedom is a social right\u2014namely, the individual's right to choose the\
    \ affairs involving himself. The choice right includes acceptance and rejection,\
    \ or we can choose to be both \"yes\" and \"no.\" For example, \"belief\" is a\
    \ matter of personal freedom. The right of claim is the right to be realized by\
    \ oneself, which requires the obligor to fulfill the obligation. That is to say,\
    \ fighting for rights is the obligation of the obligee to himself.Therefore\uFF0C\
    Claim rights and liberty rights complement each other."
- desc: in the last meeting, we discussed about an interesting fact how internet data
    get tracked and how its insecure. Even though i am bit familiar about this thing
    before but we get in detail in the lecture and come to know how data is manipulated.
- desc: I learned about claim rights and liberty rights. A claim right involves other
    persons' responsibilities or obligations towards the right-holder, while a liberty
    right involves the right-holder's own freedoms or permissions. This means that
    a person can only have a liberty right as long as another person does not have
    a claim right which forbids them from exercising that right. In other words, a
    person has a right to do what they want so long as it does not infringe on the
    rights of another.
- desc: In my opinion, the so-called rights and obligations are difficult to be defined
    as a formula. So, in our life, how claim rights and liberty rights are realized
    and what are the constraints on these rights? At the same time, how do claim rights
    and liberty rights play their role in the cyber world? And will there be more
    limitations or overuse?
- desc: Everyone has a right to protect themselves while they are using the Internet.
    The difficulty with this is that claim rights and liberty rights interact with
    each other in really unclear ways and it is difficult to regulate them. Since
    the internet gives us an access to information it should be our right to make
    clear informed decisions based on information gathered. Moreover, rights and responsibilities
    of an individual online depends on how the developers implements the system. Rights
    and responsibilities online should depend and mirror the offline life. Overall,
    user's privacy on Internet is a right and it is their responsibility to protect
    their own right.
- desc: Most of the current websites or network "facilities" are not disabled-friendly
    especially for people who can not see the screen. The current network is not barrier-free,
    for the disabled people, and I think that's what we still need working for.
- desc: In previous lecture the most important topic that I learnt about was of civil
    and liberty rights. I was also able to learn about social weave and moreover I
    am looking forward for NASA seminar.
- desc: Claim rights and liberty rights which we learn today is an instructing concept.
    We got to know about who this right is very important to make balance.
- desc: In last lecture we saw a couple of things which included the Robotic Mars
    Exploration, aspen institute's weave which is the social fabric project and the
    wikipedia article on claim rights and liberty rights. Aspen's institute's weave
    project showed as the weaving theory which is basically method of lifestyle and
    emotional state and doesn't include a group of feelings or actions. also, it is
    nothing but basically regarding how you show your feelings or bring out emotions
    while interacting or communicating with the other person and not expecting any
    kind of thing in return. The main aim of this whole project was to help in creating
    and maintaining connections and bonds at the same time valuing the other person.
    The wikipedia article of Claim rights and liberty rights described in detail how
    philosophers and political scientists differentiate these two. Claim right is
    nothing but a right that requires duties, responsibilites, or commitment on opposing
    parties about the ones which holds rights whereas Liberty rights are the one which
    doesnot necessarily require commitments or needs, on other parties and only previlege
    or authorization for the right-holder is needed.
- desc: I learned about weaving in this meeting. I think we should all support weaving
    as it rebuilds and helps to strengthen the environment.
