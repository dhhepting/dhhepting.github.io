- desc: "I think we didn\u2019t get a clear question for the breakout group meeting\
    \ so we had no idea what the topic is, just something that is related to Facebook.\
    \ Then again, these giant tech entities have the power to do whatever they want,\
    \ bend the laws. They do employ a big team of lawyers that help defend their case.\n\
    Following the discussion about the hardest CS subject. In my opinion, it is 310.\
    \ It\u2019s basically a math class with a final that worth way too much.\nI think\
    \ the project proposal is fine, a variety of topics that you can pick, a bit lengthy\
    \ though."
- desc: In our 11th meeting we discussed Facebook deleting almost everything on their
    website in Australia and what to do with our group project. Facebook in protest
    for having to pay to upload news articles deleted almost all their content. I
    personally approve of Facebook finally deleting itself off Australia due to how
    much fake news and violent opinions were spread across their platform. For our
    group project I was thinking or redesigning the user interface of a website to
    have all their links and pages on a condensed circle or pie chart.
- desc: I feel like Facebook has been in hot water for years now and nothing is going
    to change their objective of making the most money possible. If they have to remove
    news or sell data to reach their objective then they will not even think about
    the morale and ethical problems their actions may cause. It is the only reason
    why Facebook and other companies like it continue to find themselves in hot water
    amid continued backlash.
- desc: 'Todays discussion was on facebook banning news in Australia. In my opinion
    facebook was quick to ban news as only 4% of people look for

    news in thier feeds. The publishers seem greedy as facebook is giving them a platform
    and billions of referrals worth 100''s of millions.

    And also some discussion on the final project.'
- desc: The Australia-Facebook situation (which recently concluded with Facebook reaching
    an agreement with Australia) reminded me of the very similar Australia-Google
    situation (Google required to pay Australian news sites I believe) and the whole
    debacle got me wondering what happens if the company does not back down to the
    country's government demands. It is unknown really how both parties will react
    in a drawn out situation, however, I'm fearful that if both sides are unable to
    reach an agreement then the end result will greatly inconvenience or even harm
    a large portion of the user base. What would be the best course of action if a
    company and country cannot come to an agreement?
- desc: Meeting started with the discussion of an event related to NASA. We had couple
    of poles in order to decide when is it happening. Professor then also talked about
    upcoming assignment about project proposal which gave me an idea of what needs
    to be done. Overall this meeting was pretty helpful in terms of future assignments.
- desc: In meeting 11 we talked about the issue with Facebook and the Australian government
    surrounding Media. The Australian government believes that Facebook should pay
    the media for having the news on there site. This issue skyrocketed when Facebook
    banned all Australian news, this caused problems since it cut access to certain
    information on the pandemic. I believe that if the media industry is in fact losing
    money because of the internet then something needs to be done about it.
- desc: When people use social software, they should learn to analyze and judge. In
    the Internet age, everything we're exposed to isn't necessarily positive or right.
    There's so much bad information on the web that it's usually easy to spot, but
    for something else, for example, like Twitter trends. I think people should learn
    to look at these dialectically, the topics being discussed on the Internet may
    not be correct, it might cause a bad influence. To deal with anything, I think
    we need to learn to analyze and judge. Before, the professor shared a lot of Ted
    Talk videos with us, and I benefited a lot from the speaker's analysis, judgment
    and criticism of many things.
- desc: 'I haven''t been paying attention to the Facebook/Australia thing and I don''t
    know much about the news media industry so I''m probably out of my depth here.
    I''m having trouble understanding the following things: why is money involved
    in news? Is it not the right of the general population to get the news? Is Facebook
    scraping the news, or are media companies wanting Facebook to pay for them to
    host their news? Is Facebook taking the news off their platform unethical, since
    many people need access to the news, or simply business, since people can get
    that news elsewhere?

    '
- desc: 'In this meeting we learned about many things such as the discussion of Mars
    Perseverance Rover which makes me know some hidden facts of it. As well we talk
    about many things in chat window about the power and climate issues in Texas.
    Then we learned about the proposal of the project.


    '
- desc: I am interested in learning more about why Australia decided it was time to
    start forcing Facebook to pay for news. This greater good issue of facebook being
    able to bully entire countries to get there way is a very pressing issue.
- desc: We talked about, how Facebook is relevant in this society currently! Facebook
    is a social site which let people indulge in engagements so that they could sell
    their Ads. I assume, they could do anything to grow their revenue, it they fail
    to do so, investors would find the company lame. I guess, Facebook will sustain
    in future as they might establish a new business model. Who knows!
- desc: In the last meeting we discussed about the blog entry 2 and project proposal.
- desc: "Today\u2019s world is so attached with the services of these tech giants\
    \ that even the developed countries like Australia had to obey the demands of\
    \ them and amend their laws.As we saw Facebook discontinued the news pages service\
    \ in Australia even without thinking for once about the population and its welfare.\
    \ By these act I think people will start generating hatred for these private companies\
    \ and their services. According to me this is simply misusing people\u2019s trust\
    \ for your own benefits."
- desc: When I was writing blog post 1, I found one of the articles I used through
    MSN. When linking the article, I found that I was not actually on the website
    that published the article (CNN in this case) but instead MSN's website which
    basically copied the article without a link to the actual source website. I had
    to search for the article on CNN so that I could link it. I would not have found
    the article without MSN's promotion of it, but my click would not have went to
    the actual publisher's of the article.
- desc: Last class we discussed if news sources should be offered for free, with no
    money involved. Personally, I don't think this is a sustainable model. With no
    money involved, there is no incentive to make quality news stories. As a result,
    the quality of news sources drops. I would like to know more about what other
    people's opinions are about this.
- desc: In the last meeting, we discussed about the blog 2 instructions and also about
    project . Some of facebook updates were discussed in BRooms.
- desc: 'The highlight of the lecture was the, Facebook vs Australian Government face
    off regarding a proper remuneration for all the profits earned by the tech-platform
    by using content from other content providers, especially the news industry. I
    believe that Facebook was in the wrong when they took down all kinds of news from
    their website in retaliation to this. They took down the news pages for hospitals,
    emergency care, COVID-19 protocols and lock-down restrictions, which could cause
    havoc in these trying times. Instead, they should have tried to come to a decision
    with the government before taking such a drastic step.

    '
- desc: We discussed about project, Facebook vs Australia news
- desc: Well today what i was learn was basically on how the big tech companies dont
    really have mush of a countability in which they should have. They can do some
    awful things and all they get is a slap on the hand. That we need to make some
    accountablity as a more of a better way to hold these companies to the evil or
    damage that they do.
- desc: I think that the level of politics that is played within a company determines
    if they are bad guys or good guys. When we speak of Facebook, it constantly keeps
    changing policies of itself and its corresponding apps to gain the maximum user
    data, and so I think they definitely come under the category of bad guys.
- desc: "\"Four Core Influences\" has used by the\_author Steve McConnell from his\
    \ forthcoming documentary, Software Engineering Essentials, to analyse various\
    \ reports mostly on outcomes of the software development project. It illustrates\
    \ that audio systems engineering assessment could be used to vastly enhance understanding\
    \ of the mechanisms of software development projects, that also, \_leads to the\
    \ a treatment plan of inability, more effectual corrective measures for tasks\
    \ already nearing completion, and a dramatically improved likelihood of succeeding\
    \ in each task."
- desc: "Attention in\
    \ the Information Age\n\nThis is a follow-up to that really well thought-out TED\
    \ Talk presented by Tristan Harris. He summarized how our attention as individuals\
    \ of different backgrounds, as consumers in the information age and as people\
    \ above all is extremely valuable by these large tech organizations. So much so\
    \ because attention is directly related to profits. If one simply analysis the\
    \ MAU or Monthly Active Users on websites often tell advertisement agencies a\
    \ platforms commercial value, this would correlate directly with the amount of\
    \ business expenditure on such a platform. All the giants like YouTube, Twitter,\
    \ Facebook and now TikTok compete for this extremely significant metric. Especially\
    \ so due to people staying at home and by relation, on their phones far more often.\
    \ In fact, Washington Post had an article during the large March 2020 worldwide\
    \ lockdowns how screen-time usage flew through the roof (Andrews, 2020). Incentivizing\
    \ the free market even more to focus on the individuals. Sensor Tower, a large\
    \ data metrics platform for all things mobile, reported a 30% increase in mobile\
    \ app spending from 2019\u2019s data (Sensor Tower, 2021). With all this increase\
    \ in screen time, the general public is often the product on many of these platforms\
    \ for ad agencies. Therefore, I believe the public should take into accountability,\
    \ at just how much these platforms are bending the rules of ethics to increase\
    \ MAU\u2019s. Bending the rules by making apps more invasive, more prominent and\
    \ that all too often chirp from Twitter, ding from Facebook or chime from YouTube.\
    \ Otherwise, we all might develop a serious addiction to our phones, supercharged\
    \ by COVID.\n\nReferences:\n\nAndrews, T. M. (2020, March 4). Our iPhone weekly\

- desc: the main point from this meeting that I was confused about is why everyone
    is angry about facebook removing news stories from its platform. in my eyes facebook
    is a media company that I would only look at for celebrity gossip not real news
    stories. in my eyes the banning of news sites should be a good thing to keep down
    the number of unreputable "news" sources.
- desc: "It was interesting to learn about how other classmates think about the new\
    \ legislation in Australia requiring tech companies to pay for news contents.\
    \ Canada should also create a similar legislation because of the filter bubble\
    \ problem. It would be detrimental for society to be only surrounded by news that\
    \ they find agreeable. Providing the public with unfiltered news is very valuable\
    \ in our fight against the negative effects of the filter bubble. I\u2019d like\
    \ to know more about how social media platforms changed in Australia and the opinions\
    \ of the Australian users on this change."
- desc: In class today we talked about the use of banning certain speech on social
    platforms. I believe that this is a horrible thing because we are supposed to
    have a freedom of speech but i also see where this is necessary for things like
    hate speech. The one question I have to ask is where does one draw the line on
    necessary vs unnecessary speech.
- desc: In meeting 11 I liked our healthy discussion about facebook's want of domination
    and means to exploit everyone else using its monopoly advantage. Also, the professor
    taking our opinions was really a good gesture.
- desc: 'In the past meeting, we talked about Facebook in Australia issue on how Facebook
    banned the news content to show on Facebook. We also talked about blog entry 2
    and project proposal and it''s requirements.


    I would also like to know more about the project proposal and project. Like, what
    are the requirements regarding proposal word length and if there are more than
    2 people in group are they all need to submit same thing individually? or only
    one person needs to submit it?'
- desc: Projects always need to be organized and coordinated for the sake of the safety
    of people because safety has priority in the success of any project. The conclusion
    of this meeting was watching a video explaining the issued reports on the consequences
    of the software project. It determines how to use sound judgment in software engineering
    to significantly progress the understanding of software project dynamics, which
    in turn leads to correct failure judgement, more effective corrective actions
    for projects already underway, and greatly improved chances of success in each
    project.
- desc: 'In the past meeting we talked about an upcoming science public lecture about
    mars rover mission. It will be very interesting to know about the whole experiment
    and the experience. Recently from social media I watched the 360 view of mars
    and it was amazing. We also talked about the recent Facebook incident with Australia.
    We also had a breakout session to talk about if Facebook is a good or bad guy.
    personally I don''t use it that much. Mostly I search through the news feed and
    that''s how few interesting news catch my attention. If I was in Australia, probably
    because of this blocking news content I would stop using Facebook.

    Beside all these, professor also provided us information about project proposal,
    which was very helpful.'
- desc: In the lecture, we discuss what Facebook banned and what is updated, and what
    is the new policy of Whatsapp and also discuss about project proposal that on
    which topic we can write and all.
- desc: In last meeting, we have discussed the analysis and judgement, I would like
    to talk about he analysis of a website is safe and security to use, and the judgement
    of to use it or not, a clean website should and the content closely relate to
    the authors thought, and there's no ads and virus warnings. before you make decision
    to view a website, you should always think carefully by click each links.
- desc: "Analysis and judgement are fundamentally different. Bloom\u2019s taxonomy\
    \ is an evaluation method about the level of knowledge. Among them, analysis and\
    \ creation are the most important. In computer learning, students must at least\
    \ reach the level of analysis, can connect the knowledge they have learned, and\
    \ draw an analogy. In the future enterprise, judgement is a very important link,\
    \ the strength of this ability can even directly affect the destiny of the enterprise."
- desc: Found the first segment of the videos by David Plummer to be very inspiring
    because he talked about how task manager came to be. How he did not give up and
    he kept on trying his best to do more things. Also, it made me realize the importance
    of having connections.
- desc: Great lecture, I Think it Facebook should not be charged or have to pay because
    of fake new because individual who come into social media should be held responsible
    for not going to more reliable sources to confirm or check for information necessary,
    hence, why Facebook shouldn't be charged. And can you give a brief summary of
    the software Engineering video in your words because the quality of sound of the
    video wasn't the best.
- desc: In the last meeting, we talked about blog post-2.
- desc: In group discussion we talked about the future of whatsapp seeing its ongoing
    privacy debate like professor told what Australian government took measures against
    the facebook due to data concerns of people so like the same way what government
    can do against the whatsapp and afterwards what policies can whatsapp change to
    remain in the market and if they did not change the policies of their user data
    which apps would take its position and what ethics would they keep in mind to
    built the new app which cares for the data policy of the user and I would like
    to know more about it how could or in which way the company could change its user
    data policy
- desc: "The previous class was really interesting because of the subjects that were\
    \ explored. The video links from the past\_lecture\_helped me a lot\_to understand\
    \ and then examine new stuff from a different angle. Also, we had great conversation,\
    \ so it\_was wonderful. \_Infact, discussion in the breakout\_room was also exciting\
    \ as I was able to know everyone's perspective as well."
- desc: "Facebook, given the website as a whole has very poor moderation, feels like\
    \ if anything it is a net positive that they are banning news articles from their\
    \ website. It would be like getting your news from Instagram or Snapchat, a social\
    \ media site should not be your primary source of news on current events. Also,\
    \ at least personally, the bombardment of misleading news headlines is a large\
    \ part of the reason why I stopped using it to begin with.\n\nAdditionally, it\
    \ is a little concerning to see that a company like Facebook has the \u201CPower\u201D\
    \ to bully around the government of Australia in order to avoid having to pay\
    \ fees."
- desc: 'Thank you! It was helpful.

    '
- desc: Talking about facebook, I stopped using it because id see too many posts that
    were very uncensored, things would slip in a lot, but it's kinda crazy that facebook
    been under fire for the past few years but yet because they have such a big base
    of people it just won't affect them that much at all. We might see the facebook
    trend die eventually but in my eyes its gonna be a long time from now. They also
    buy off other things like Instagram which i still use
- desc: In the last meeting, The professors asked the students about a workshop then
    finalized that the seminar will be on Wednesday, March 24 at 1900. Moreover, we
    also discussed Blog 2 and the project proposal. The professor also asked the students
    which CS most challenging subject and then some glance on Facebook.
- desc: In last lecture we discussed about how Facebook is socially important and
    on going talks about Facebook business in Australia, I would like to learn more
    about that issue. we also discussed about project proposal
- desc: in this forum, I had learned about the three-way which makes the people happy
    with the design like he said about the juicer. they just design it for the fun
    and also the pinball table designed with the fish and table. they are just designed
    for fun.
- desc: In last meeting we discussed about the mars rover missions it will be great
    experience and experiment to know more about it. We also discussed about the recent
    incident of facebook in Australia. We also had a group discussion in which we
    had discuss about the future of whatsapp which is also own by Facebook as well.
    So, what will government do to take care about the privacy leak. and over all
    the whole lecture was so helpful.
- desc: 'We spoke about our upcoming assignments in the previous lecture: blog entry
    2 and project proposal. We also discussed the Facebook vs. Australia problem.
    But in our following lecture, I would like to know more about this conflict, if
    possible.'
- desc: We discussed today in class about if it is good or bad for the society. I
    think if we use it carefully it can be very helpful but if we just spend most
    of our time on it is a waste of that time and if can affect you in so many ways
    so I think Facebook is good for the society but only if you are aware of the bad
    side and try to ignore that side.
- desc: One of the main concept to keep in mind while designing stuff is that we have
    to keep in mind how "fun" it is to use. Even if its not the best design, a pleasant
    experience can lead us far. As he said, when brain is happy, we get work done
    quicker and easier. Maybe that is true. But he also said that we won't get any
    work done this way. It feels to me that to make something something better, we
    need a mix between "pressure" and pleasant. Both have its good side and bad sides.
    All we have to do is to find the perfect harmony between these two. Also, familiriaty
    with fear can help us to make better design too
- desc: "From this past class it was quite informative to learn a bit more about the\
    \ Facebook news ban in Australia. I had heard about it before, but never really\
    \ understood the purpose of the legislation. While looking into it more, it appears\
    \ however that Facebook has won some compromises with the Australian government\
    \ and news content will return to Australian Facebook users in the coming days.\_\
    \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/23/facebook-reverses-australia-news-ban-after-government-makes-media-code-amendments\n\
    \nIt is rather concerning just how much power big tech has over our governments\
    \ -- and I could very well see if such piece of legislation were to arise here\
    \ in Canada the government would capitulate quite quickly.\_"
- desc: In the past meeting, the main topic of discussion was the importance or our
    privacy. Today, we are not able to know where our personal data has been used
    for some other purpose and profit of companies. It is very important for us to
    ask questions and as a future computer professional try to build alogrithms which
    will eliminate this thing.
- desc: According to me, the past meeting was all about how we are trapped by the
    big technology firms and the way in which they are using our personal data for
    profit. The way it is affecting us cannot be measured. We should try to make alogrithms
    which keeps everything transparent and our privacy is not used for someone's personal
    profit.
- desc: Last meeting was we were put into the breakout rooms to discuss about the
    Facebook news. Australia asked for money in order to give their content on Facebook
    because of this Australian context is banned in Facebook. Facebook restricted
    publishers and petiole in Australia on Facebook . Some people are using Facebook
    to get the daily news and updates Facebook is not doing justice with the user
    as well as with Australia
- desc: The most important thing I learned from the last meeting is that Social Medias
    have become what people rely on for news. Whether or not they want it, I believe
    Social Medias take on some responsibility for the news they host if that is a
    main draw/feature. It was hard for me to totally understand the ethical implications
    of Facebook removing important health related news for Australians. In my breakout
    room discussion we talked about how that removing all news from Australians on
    Facebook might have been the smartest move business-wise as the governmental regulations
    were still getting figured out, but may have been ethically wrong concerning there
    responsibility as a news source for many.
- desc: class today was about the discuss about the group project topic
- desc: We talked about blog 2. E.g whatsapp facebook
- desc: In the previous lecture we had discussed about upcoming assignments and also
    about the expectations.
- desc: I think the coordination of accessibility and usability is very important
    for computer programming, the accessibility of a computer program is the Precondition
    for its usability. The design of computer programs should be human-centered designed
    which the users can use the program appropriate.
- desc: In the last meeting we had a great discussion about upcoming blogs. Also we
    had a discussion about the Project and it's proposals. I am excited about my new
    group for Project and its Topic. Moreover, Breakout Rooms in last meeting were
    helpful too. As we are going to do project in Group so that communication will
    be easy too among our classmates!!
- desc: Facebook's prime business model was to bring people together. That's what
    Mark Zuckerberg promised when he created Facebook. He wanted to create something
    to bring everyone close to his University at Harvard. He initially provided the
    service for free and got a bunch of funding, but with time to survive, he started
    posting ads. As he moved forward all the ads became more and more personalized.
    For ads to be personalized he stole our data. This created a filter bubble and
    all the other features to get people addicted to the platform. This is very harmful
    for humanity.
- desc: 'In this meeting, we discussed the importance of user privacy and also discussed
    about the rover on Mars.

    We also discussed about the upcoming assignments that are to be done. We also
    discussed the latest news on Facebook how the company is not affected even if
    the users are leaving it.

    Discussed about the upcoming blogs also.

    I am really very excited about the projects that are to be done in the group which
    will lead us to different idea on the same topic.'
- desc: In the last zoom meeting, we discussed about the problem with Facebook and
    the Australian government surrounding Media. Also, it was really helpful as we
    discussed about the future assignments and about project as well.
- desc: In last class we talked about Analysis and Judgement. We also discussed bout
    Facebook and it's policy. There are multiple ways in which facebook makes money
    from user's own data. One way is by advertisements and it is mostly used by business
    people and entrepreneurs for spreading their reach and getting maximum usage from
    it
- desc: 'In the last meeting discussion, we had a discussion on Facebook updates that
    how we all are trapped by the big technology and they used personal data for profit
    which is not fair at all which we discussed in class and as well with classmates
    in BRooms apart from that we all also discussed the instructions of blog # 2.'
- desc: Facebook was designed to connect people from all around the world but lately
    we came to know that they are using our data, moreover they are now using Facebook
    as a business platform, people can sell and buy thing just like eBay, how all
    the videos have ads just like YouTube and they are all personalized by out data
    on what we search and what things we like. I think Facebook is relevant to society
    but the new features they have added are not relevant.
- desc: In this meeting class focus was on social media.We talk about the ban of facebook
    news in Australia.We learnt how nowadays people are mostly rely on social media
    for news.Some student criticised the facebook for this step because of the source
    of information or news for some people.In some countries even social media is
    the only trustworthy news source.However,Australian banned also show us that how
    powerful these tech giants are against our government.
- desc: I think in my personal opinion Facebook is in some percentage it is beneficial
    to the society as it is used to spread the news or people are making a career
    out of it, so it is obviously good for their life but also it has a downside as
    the facebook has been in lot of controversy about the privacy about the user and
    everything I guess if there is certain restriction towards it, it can turn down
    the risk by great percentage.
- desc: The most important and the surprising thing that I learned in the class was
    about the lawsuit between the country of australia and facebook. Well I think
    that Australia was correct in this case as the only reason the facebook is able
    to give users the news is through the publications and moreover facebook is earning
    a huge amount of money through these publications only and I think publications
    should get the money they deserve.
- desc: There was a discussion on Facebook. Personally, I think Facebook is really
    helpful for spreading news or sharing some of the experiences that we had. But
    it is also bad because people will then rely on social media for everyday news
    on the media not on the actual news.
- desc: 'I think the most important thing I''ve learned/realized from last meeting
    was that not alot of people are priveleged enough to analayze how social medias
    like facebook is actually invading privacy in a level.


    Being a bio minor, I found it interesting how there is biological explaination
    for design of what attracts us and stuff. I enjoy the psychological explanation
    to design as well. I think it''s important to understand the psychology and biology
    of people to implement an effective design.


    Bendura''s guided mastery is important with helping people to discover their creative
    confidence. I like this thought. I would like to know more information on the
    steps for discovering that. It seems that learning about empathy is one of the
    baby steps but I wonder what else.'
- desc: It was a Interesting Class. We analyzed on the TED talk video and discussed
    the thought process behind it. There was a breakroom in which we discussed how
    Facebook has managed to make a filter bubble around us. We also discussed on the
    ethical side of programming. I really enjoyed the learnings.
- desc: 'In this meeting speaker talks about the "hidden goal" that is a competition
