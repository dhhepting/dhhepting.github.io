- desc: 'Response?

    '
- desc: My response on your ques about videos is that the programming is a fun and
    we have to take inspiration from little coding that we can learn it and make it
    more interesting and from other video also is that we have to influence from it
- desc: I am sorry i post the wrong discussion actually it was about the meeting 2
    i post later for meeting 3
- desc: 'It was nice discussing in depth about each video in points. A suggestion
    from next class if you can use any text editor instead of writing with a pen in
    notes it''s just easier to read and understand. Overall everything was good and
    also Dr. Hepting if you can upload course material so we can understand the course
    in a depth and know what we are going to do in the overall semester.


    Thank you very much!


    See you in the next meeting.'
- desc: Today we discussed about the conclusions we had about last meeting's two videos.
    We discussed how everyone should start learning to code and once we do we must
    find a proper moral framework on using personal user data.
- desc: Our discussion about choices to permit or deny the collection of user data
    from a computer system made me think about how these choices are influenced by
    the nature of the entities that provide the software/hardware/services in question.
    It seems to be widely understood in the tech sector that data is now a valuable
    commodity. Since publicly traded, for-profit companies are accountable to shareholders
    who expect to see the value of the company (and therefore their shares) increase
    over time, there is a powerful incentive for such companies to collect and monetize
    data. Open-source software projects supported and managed by volunteers don't
    have as powerful a motivation to monetize data, so I would expect these projects
    to approach data collection more from the perspective of the user's interests.
    Between these two opposites exist privately owned businesses, in which there is
    still a powerful profit incentive to collect and monetize data, but the organization's
    ownership/leadership also has freedom to make decisions about data collection
    on moral grounds if they so wish.
- desc: From this meeting I clearly know the syllabus of this course.
- desc: "Hey everyone, here is my response to today\u2019s discussion:\n\nChange in\
    \ view\nBefore today's class I thought the two videos 'Code Stars' and 'Moral\
    \ Operating System' were relatively unrelated. After today's class however, I\
    \ find the contrast between them really interesting. Code stars can almost be\
    \ seen as a recruitment drive to try and motivate people to go into development.\
    \ It highlights many of the more positive aspects of coding, but ignores ethical\
    \ issues surrounding technology and development - there is 'no moral imperative'.\
    \ On the other hand, 'moral operating system' brings to light some of the issues\
    \ with technology, and how people in technological fields need to make their decisions\
    \ with moral intent.\n\nPurpose of Coding\nRegarding the purpose of coding, I\
    \ think the purpose of coding is to improve and make other people's lives easier\
    \ and better. If you look at, for example, automation technologies, developers\
    \ create technologies that automate tasks humans used to do. If applied in a responsible\
    \ way, these technologies could make a positive difference in society.\n\nThanks\
    \ for reading!\n\nDavid Galgan"
- desc: 'My understanding of computing is that it is the process of using computers
    to perform unique functions for us because our time is too valuable and computers
    are much more efficient (when they work). We use them to assist us with achieving
    more than we could on our own.

    There are also some creative merits to computing, too, as you could get a computer
    to create any application that you want.'
- desc: Today was my first class in this course and simply by it alone I can already
    tell that it is going to be one I find very interesting. From this class I had
    one topic that stuck with me and that is what are the limits of computing? I know
    this wasn't discussed directly within the class but when we talked about the programming
    of the mouse and the creation of things such as Microsoft and twitter, I thought
    of how far programming could go and what innovations will be the next step for
    our current generation of programming. Another thing that really stuck with me
    was the life that programmers live. Not having to be a genius to do this is very
    reassuring to me as sometimes I feel overwhelmed with the overall idea of programming.
- desc: 'Q: WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PURPOSE OF COMPUTING?

    For me, the purpose of computing is to create tools, software, applications, etc.
    that will help people (either professional or public) - whether that''s to automate
    a task, offer support or accessibility, meet some kind of need or solve some kind
    of problem.


    Q: Talk about something related to today''s discussion.

    I was grateful to the student (sorry, I can''t remember who) for mentioning that
    "Code Stars" felt like a recruitment short. There was some sort of uncomfortable
    undercurrent that I felt when watching it and I couldn''t put my finger on it
    until that student brought it up. Although I do think there is some validity to
    what the people in the short were saying, I do think that it was promoting the
    good, successful and exciting sides of programming without mentioning any of the
    nuances or difficulties in the industry (and like, why isn''t ethics in technology
    an interesting feature of it anyway?). I mean, they even had a celebrity spokesperson:
    will.i.am (does he even code anymore? I couldn''t find anything from after 2013).
    It was very interesting to see the stark contrast between the two videos with
    the lighthearted and hopeful attitude toward coding in "Code Stars" and the seriousness
    of the discussion in "Moral Operating System" (although imo he was still able
    to bring some playfulness to the lecture). In my opinion I feel like we should
    always consider computing as a field that should be working hand in hand with
    ethics, especially as technology grows in capacity and ubiquity.

    The discussion today reminded me that rose-tinted promotions touting the awesomeness
    of the tech industry (or really, any industry at all) should be watched with a
    more careful and critical eye.


    '
- desc: While our discussion had a lot of different topics I think I would like to
    learn more about digital data collection. I, like many people (I would like to
    think), don't really read the user agreement/private policy/etc. of goods and
    services I use. In fact, I don't really understanding them, even if I read them.
    This is potentially very dangerous, as if don't really understand how a particular
    good and service has used/collected my data (and invaded my privacy), I have not
    prepared myself on the potential repercussions of my personal data collected (say
    if that data was hacked). Thus, I'm sort of in a contradiction. I try to value
    my privacy and don't often consent to data collection if I'm able to opt out,
    however, I don't realistically take the time to read all of the user agreement/private
    policy/etc. even if it relates and is important to my own privacy. So, if I'm
    able to learn more about digital data collection, maybe I will be able to decipher
    the long private policy and understand how my data will be collected and used.
    Additionally, learning more about digital data collection will do more than just
    help me understand things like how to read the private policy, but help me make
    more informed decisions in the future. Understanding digital data collection hopefully
    will help me develop my own personal view on what data collection (and usage)
    I find is OK and what I find is unacceptable (and a breach of privacy). This in
    turn could help me find companies/goods and services that support my personal
    view of data collection instead of blindly and unknowingly supporting companies
    that go against my very own beliefs.
- desc: When we are talking about a moral operating system, I do not think this is
    necessary. A moral person will do moral things and someone who is just after money
    will ignore morals for money. As we see with twitter bans, twitter knows what
    is wrong however they chose not to ban everyone. https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/trump-twitter-account-copy-tweets-glorifying-violence-suspended-a9545831.html
    The article shows that twitter knew a long time ago that most of what trump was
    tweeting however did not ban him. So the question then being do we really need
    a moral operating system? Twitter banned an account that did everything Trump
    did so therefore they knew it was bad, however Trump was not bad. So In my opinion
    we know what is wrong its privilege's we have to look at.
- desc: "In todays class we talked about the 2 videos that we have watched in last\
    \ meeting. Professor was asking about our opinion and observation based on the\
    \ \u201CCode stars\u201D and \u201CMoral operating system\u201D that, what computing\
    \ is useful for. Many people had many opinions about it. Many of us discussed\
    \ about their thought on this questions. Some people said: its an expanding industry\
    \ that\u2019s cross multiple fields, recurring drive, way of creating job opportunities\
    \ etc. In my opinion computing is a way to express our technological thoughts.\
    \ There are no limits into it, you can build anything you want by using different\
    \ method of coding. Computing help us to expressing our programming talent and\
    \ help us to have so many job opportunities."
- desc: "My opinion of the purpose of computing is a skill. It is a skill that you\
    \ learned and acquired knowledge over time. Just like in any other field of science\
    \ or any other profession. It can be used with good intentions such as the first\
    \ video of the past lecture \u201CCode Stars\u201D, where they overly make it\
    \ look like coding is just for good purpose only, which is not realistic. It can\
    \ be used with bad intentions as well, such as hackers. For example, last year,\
    \ Sask eHealth was under a ransomware attack, and a lot of data about the Saskatchewan\
    \ residents was stolen. Computing is multi-purpose; it helps increase the productivity\
    \ of people\u2019s lives and it can also reduce the productivity of people\u2019\
    s life.\nThe most important thing you learned from this past meeting is the power\
    \ of communication in the current world. Trump had been spreading misinformation\
    \ since basically forever, however when an actual incident occurs, then real action\
    \ got taken. Twitter and other social media platforms had banned Trump for inciting\
    \ the riot at the Capitol. They just told the person at the highest level of government\
    \ in the world \u201CNo, you can\u2019t do that anymore, but you did enough over\
    \ all the past years\u201D.\nThe most difficult for me to understand is how does\
    \ the banning algorithm work for these social media platforms. As one of the students'\
    \ mentions, people retweet getting banned, however, the original person doesn\u2019\
    t get ban for saying it in the first place.\nAlso, the last part of the meeting\
    \ mentioned the Signal messaging app. Which is related to the \u201CMoral Operating\
    \ System\u201D video from the previous lecture. The rise in popularity of Signal\
    \ is due to Facebook\u2019s WhatsApp changing its privacy term. User's data of\
    \ WhatsApp will be shared with Facebook. And that doesn\u2019t go well with basically\
    \ everybody\u2026.\n"
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from this past meeting is the purpose
    of computing and software. The purpose of computing and software is to increase
    productivity and to make our society more efficient. Compared to the past, we
    can finish many tasks more easily and quickly. With the advancement in computing
    and technology, there is more opportunity to create innovations and to improve
    the quality of life. We are able to find and access information instantly and
    becoming more productive everyday. One interesting question that arose from the
    meeting was whether a software is about helping people or not. I agree that a
    company that creates a useful software was motivated by money but ultimately,
    the society benefits from the software. In other words, software is about helping
    people even if they have to pay for it. For example, it would be very difficult
    to go through a day without using web browsers or word processors. We use many
    software everyday without realizing how important they are to our daily lives.
- desc: 'Hii everyone the response about the last discussion topics is here,

    firstly in the last class we were discuss about the last 2 videos that we supposed
    to watched and doing the discussion about the that topics such as the code stars
    and the moral operating system. Then after that we get the description about that
    two topics that are really interesting and have a contrast with each other as
    that the Code stars can almost be seen as a recruitment to try and it motivate
    people to go into the development. and as well it highlights many of the more
    positive aspects of coding that motivates and inspired the students towards the
    code but it ignores ethical issues surrounding technology and development and
    then the moral operating system its about the light sources of the issues with
    development.'
- desc: I found that we didn't cover much in Monday's class beyond what was included
    in last week's video, but I found the instructor view of UR Courses to be very
    interesting! :)
- desc: "The purpose of computing is essentially to make our lives easier. Computing\
    \ has made a lot of aspects of our lives easier such as communicating with people\
    \ who are far away, and completing complex math problems that take humans quite\
    \ a while to figure out in a matter of seconds. It has also made storing and retrieving\
    \ data a lot easier with the sorting and search algorithms. Industries like manufacturing\
    \ have become almost fully automated due to computing requiring for humans to\
    \ work less on strenuous tasks.\_\n"
- desc: 'From my point of view,

    Computer is a big need of present era. We can''t imagine our life without computer.
    Everything around us is working by computer. Computers are general-purpose information
    machines that can perform a variety of tasks on data.'
- desc: 'During the session itself, I found it very interesting seeing the different
    things that people got from the videos, and was refreshing to see a semi-wide
    variety of conclusions drawn from it instead of all sharing the exact same thoughts.


    In terms of what the "Purpose of Coding" is, I think it is a way to solve problems.
    Whether those be creative or logical problems, it is an outlet for us to find
    solutions to problems. Whether we are designing compression algorithms to make
    accessing content online easier to those with poor or limited internet access,
    utilizing as a creative outlet to create applications or games, doing work on
    game engines to enable others to produce more advanced and realistic content.
    It can also be utilized in the data field, managing large swaths of data for companies
    to do any multitude of things, finding out which locations are selling more of
    a certain product for stock delegation, tracking reported shrink to identify areas
    of issue. It can even be used as purely a "I wonder if I can...", for the sake
    of entertainment creating small programs to check if a number is prime, convert
    measurements.


    Coding has such a wide variety of uses and applications, it''s a "I have a problem,
    let''s make a solution".'
- desc: "From last meeting, we've gone through some brilliant ideas of the video \u201C\
    code stars\u201D. Here\u2019s my thoughts from the last meeting about what is\
    \ the purpose of computing?\n\nFrom \u201Ccode stars\u201D:\n\nThe reasons are\
    \ the development of industry and the job needed from society. We can see many\
    \ traditional jobs have been taken by programs, which do more efficiently than\
    \ human work. It's a trend, there will be more needed jobs requiring computing\
    \ skills. And not all about jobs, learning computing is not hard as calculus,\
    \ it\u2019s fun, and easy to get resources online. Software can help people in\
    \ different ways, to make money, get closer relationships by social media, and\
    \ share knowledge."
- desc: 'Watching the two videos posted has put things in a different perspective
    for me. I never thought of online spaces being compared to real life spaces. The
    speaker makes some excellent points, these platforms are very lax on structure
    and don''t offer the necessary structure for long term survival. Different applications
    are different spaces and therefore constitute a different response from users.
    We need online spaces that reflect real world spaces.


    The filter bubble video was also very informative. It''s true you can''t see the
    big picture if there are gatekeeping algorithms hiding information from you because
    they don''t think it will interest you. To be informed is to have access to a
    wealth of knowledge, things that challenge your way of thinking. I think there
    should be more control placed in the users hands and easier ways to find information
    that isn''t necessarily "trending".'
- desc: for me the overall purpose of programing is to make some contribution to another
    field. a good use of computing is to make something that would otherwise be impossible
    or too dangerous and make it possible. For example the use of computers to render
    a visual image of a black hole based solely on the math. the reason that I got
    into computer science was in partly due to my curiosity of how this device that
    we spend most of our time interacting with works. but the major reason was to
    create the program that I perceived to be missing in modern computers
- desc: 'The lecture started with a discussion about the two videos that we had to
    watch and a lot of points were put forth by the students about what the main theme
    of the video was. There was a consensus between majority of the students, that
    the 1st video was a recruitment drive, inviting people to learn to code and highlighting
    how it is as simple as picking up a brush and starting to paint. It showed a picture
    of how there will be shortage of computer science graduates in the upcoming years
    compared to the number of jobs that will open up, and hence they asked more people
    to look at coding as a way to bring out their creative side and do some good in
    the world.


    The 2nd video, a TED talk about the importance of a moral operating system highlighted
    the grime aspects of data storage in order to improve user experience. The speaker
    talked about user privacy and how there has to be a certain control of the individual
    over their own data which a certain system has access to. This brought forth the
    discussion about the recent political events relating to social media and the
    effect the spread of misinformation has on an individual''s ideologies, general
    or political in nature. The lack of a filter brings about unchecked spread of
    false information which not only endangers the privacy, but also the security
    of an individual. '
- desc: 'We discussed the purpose of computing. I believe multiple reasons affect
    me in why I want to do computing. First, it is a growing industry, it can be applied
    in nearly every field, and can find a job with well paid. Secondly, it offers
    a lot of things that what we can be computing on. It also has the power to change
    the world such as AI. Computing has the power to create things from our imagination.

    For the moral operating system, I believe it is a really hard thing to do. Because
    people''s perception of what is moral and what is not moral is constantly changing.
    There is no guideline that we can follow forever. 300 years ago it is moral to
    enslave another human being, and we no longer believe it is moral. For the topic
    of abortion, the option is so to divide it is hard to make a simple judgement
    on which side is moral and which side is not. So I believe programmer should avoid
    making code that can be used to support terrorism, and most people believe is
    not moral to code that can be used to break the law. For the more difficult question
    regarding moral, it is hard to up a programmer to make a judgement.'
- desc: Well from what I learn from the lecture on is on how there are so many different
    responsibility and on how theres so much going on.
- desc: "In my opinion the purpose of computing as I understand and see it \u2014\
    \ is ultimately to solve problems. When we code and make programs and the like,\
    \ we typically have an end goal in mind. Be it mathematical, scientific, or something\
    \ creative. Computers can do what we as humans would rather not do, which is repetitive\
    \ tasks, be it dozens, hundreds, thousands or even millions of times. To use a\
    \ topical example, suppose you wanted to model COVID-19 and its spread - sure\
    \ you could sit down, crunch some numbers, and plot a little graph yourself -\
    \ but why do that when a computer can do that, do it better, and faster? Additionally\
    \ with a computer you could run multiple simulations, suppose you had x amount\
    \ of people sick, y amount of people contagious, z amount of people carriers,\
    \ etc. You could tweak those values until you got a clear picture. Sure you could\
    \ do that yourself by hand and a calculator, but why bother when we have the technology?\
    \ Computing at its core is abstract, yet simplistic in the sense that it is only\
    \ 0s and 1s, yet has the power to do everything from simple math, to telling the\
    \ time, to simulating the known universe. Computers and computing is multifunctional,\
    \ it is the end result of human ingenuity - and I'd argue our best accomplishment."
- desc: 'When first deciding which field of study to pursue in university, I was unsure
    about Computer Science. I was under the assumption that the evolution of computers
    would dominate the future and was weary about what this would look like. However,
    upon taking a web-design course in high school and thinking critically about my
    goals, I realized that, if computers are to shape the future, why not be part
    of creating the future that I wish to see? I decided to take what seemed like
    an unknown path at the time, and I see the immense benefit in that decision today.


    I am most interested in exploring the intersection between art and technology.
    As an artist, I create two-dimensional and digital artwork and animations that
    aim to tell heroic, empowering stories of marginalized groups, such as women and
    people of colour, instead of those told that, to this day, centre victimhood.
    Furthermore, my work serves as social commentary on consumerism, capitalism, and
    systemic oppression. My purpose in Computer Science is to combine my knowledge
    of programming with my skill in Visual Arts. My goal is to use programming concepts
    to develop digital media solutions to problems in my community, such as developing
    assistive Augmented Reality technology to aid people who are differently abled.


    Ultimately, I believe the purpose of computing, as mentioned in ''Code Stars,''
    is to enhance the tools we use in everyday life to support people who are often
    left behind in today''s society.'
- desc: "As for \"beware online filter bubbles\", Web companies will adjust services\
    \ according to people\u2019s personal preferences, like different people search\
    \ same item at website, the output of results are total different. We hope that\
    \ the web company can let everyone set their own personal preferences.\nAnd for\
    \ \"what obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good\", social\
    \ media is already indispensable for everyone. We can learn about the latest news\
    \ or news happening around us from the Internet. Anyone can post a message on\
    \ social media to let others know you more fully."
- desc: "Computing is any objective-arranged action requiring computers to manage,\
    \ and process communication/information handled by a person. Computing creates\
    \ an environment to design and build software and application programs for a wide\
    \ range of its own purposes which could be processing, and also managing various\
    \ types of information. Moreover, there are different contexts in which the term\
    \ \u201CComputing\u201D have been used based on specifics. Computing itself deals\
    \ with mathematical concepts, it follows an endless systematic algorithm concept.\
    \ In reference to the Babylonians in 2400BC, the earliest tool used for computation\
    \ was known as the abacus. The main purpose of \u201CComputing\u201D is the endless\
    \ process of development of both software and hardware."
- desc: In meeting 3 , we talked about the two videos(code star), as what is computer
    programming and its answered as that programming is something like instructing
    the computer, what to do and the morals of computing like maintaining privacy.
    The discussion was about the purpose of computing. My understanding of the purpose
    of computing is basically, performing all the logical calculations in seconds,
    storing large amounts of data and developing new software to help out the whole
    world . And the main purpose for studying computing is to being updated with the
    new technical techniques as nowadays its all about computer stuff and also to
    shape the problem solving skills, logically.
- desc: From the last lecture I got to know about the course outline. I got to understand
    the purpose of computing also about the moral adapting system.
- desc: It was really help ful
- desc: From the last discussion I found coding to be a very powerful tool. You can
    be from any profession but still you can become a programmer. Computer technology
    is growing to a vast extent. I learnt about the growing opportunities in the field
    of computers. Computer technology deals with benefits and risks both.
- desc: Hi, in my opinion the purpose of computing is the not difficult and not all
    about the math too and, computing is that it is the process of using computers
    to perform unique functions because time is too valuable and computers are more
    efficient.
- desc: "January 20th, 2021\nShrey Shah\n200377176\nCS 280 | Meeting 3\n\nThoughts\
    \ on Filter Bubbles and Obligations\n\nThe first video is a snippet of a TED Talk\
    \ presented by Eli Pariser, and the inventor of the term \u201Cfilter bubble\u201D\
    . Eli is a political activist presenting interesting thought points on the internet\
    \ and its role in our society today. His points go further and reach out to how\
    \ certain companies have changed the internet by monetization or recording data\
    \ from its users to feed into internal machine learning models, and how that affects\
    \ the end user\u2019s mental, and political state of thought. Parsier easily communicates\
    \ the concept of how these online companies have personalized large gateways of\
    \ the internet akin to a maze. The user sees that of which he/she is only intended\
    \ to notice. Now technically this could be a result of how their models process\
    \ sensory information from users, and creates a never-ending feedback loop of\
    \ continuous content that only adheres to the specific user. This is a little\
    \ dangerous in the sense that one could be trapped in an artificial reality where\
    \ they and others likeminded are habituated and have the microphone. Creating\
    \ these cyberspace echo chambers is potentially harmful to the foundation of critical\
    \ analysis and development of humans. We love to learn, and even if it\u2019s\
    \ a little different than what we\u2019ve seen before it\u2019s still interesting\
    \ to look at, process and think about. If one takes that away, then all that is\
    \ left is that of which we\u2019ve known before.\n\nThe second video is another\
    \ snippet of Parsier on a different TED Talk, this one about the morality of tech\
    \ platforms hold. It presents a very critical piece of thought on how these companies\
    \ rose to great heights on concepts of monetization. However, now that they have\
    \ become the \u201Cpublic squares\u201D of our age, he presents that concept that\
    \ they should be held accountable to an extent that users obtain a well-rounded\
    \ piece of thought. Another staggering point made by Parsier is the platforms\
    \ themselves are accountable on the structure of their space. Human beings generally\
    \ prefer order to chaos, and this internal feeling leaves us with a void in our\
    \ minds when we encroach on web spaces. Places like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit\
    \ have no real structure, one can be anonymous to the point where multiple accounts\
    \ on twitter have been created for an article of clothing on a celebrity (i.e\
    \ Tom Hank\u2019s Cap). Parsier advises that this creates an adverse affect on\
    \ certain minds and pushes them towards feeling of control. This is equally dangerous\
    \ as the filter bubble concept, if not more so when one realizes that these are\
    \ not two different occurrences, but parallel sequences. The added amplification\
    \ caused by filter bubbles and the already altered feelings from chaos can cause\
    \ one to pushed over the edge completely. It should be in the interest of these\
    \ moderating corporations who hold the keys to these interconnected cities and\
    \ highways of thought, to operate them with accountability and structure. Presenting\
    \ critical thought, engaging users meaningfully not just hunting for that next\
    \ click."
- desc: My understanding of the purpose of computing would be that of the development
    of either hardware or software that helps in making certain tasks easier for us.
    In all our daily lives we all have things we really don't feel like doing or wish
    someone else could do for us and this is where I believe computing comes in. The
    development of things like washing machines, dryers, cars etc. all came as a result
    of this so as to make things like washing clothes and travelling easier.
- desc: "In our meeting 3, We discussed about the 2 videos that we watched in meeting\
    \ 2. We went through the videos in details and professor took the opinions from\
    \ all the students. After that, we briefly went through the syllabus. Professor\
    \ also asked us to answer this question \u201CWhat is your understanding of the\
    \ purpose of computing\u201D. My understanding of computing is that computing\
    \ is an necessary to our day to day life. Now a days computers are everywhere\
    \ such as; school, collages, hospitals, work places, supermarkets and more. Computer\
    \ made our life easier. We can\u2019t imagine having our life without computer.\

- desc: I think one major importance of computers and the internet is that they allow
    people from all over the world to communicate with each other. This provides many
    benefits to most people but it also has some downsides. Criminals can communicate
    with each other and conduct illegal activities over the internet. Finding out
    about and stopping these activities can involve invading the privacy of innocent
    people which is a huge ethical dilemma. I believe privacy is very important and
    I am interested to know some of the leading opinions on dealing with this issue.
- desc: 'The most important thing you learned from this past meeting

    Computing is the essential part of the last meeting. I learned that every sector
    globally is growing and handling the complex systems we need to make things more
    effortless and secure. Learners can also benefit from it like mastery, and it
    has no limit anytime and anywhere. According to Pastori, "Do what makes a lot
    of money, do what a lot of people use" means a person should play over the public''s
    interest. Softwares in the market -Softwares are about happening people and solving
    real-life puzzles.


    The concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand

    Computing secure systems, cybercrime still happens.


    What you would like to know more about

    Humans achieved success over many sectors, still mysterious universe and other
    hidden aspects. Can we reach there in the future with computing?


    Something you encountered that is related to the past meeting.

    Computing is an art and science because one can do experiments, but with the necessary
    knowledge.

    Computing needs logical thinking.'
- desc: 'My take on purpose of computing is basically to solve issues. There are lots
    of places where we can apply computing, from industry to day to day lives. In
    each situation new set of problems appear and by computing we can fix those issues.
    Now, in general sense, computing is basically working and playing with information,
    to calculate, to understand and apply data. But these information is not something
    completely isolated. Each of these data, calculation and understanding helps us
    to solve a problem, create something new or improve existing technology. So I
    think in the end of the day, the purpose of computing is to improve ourselves.


    My purpose in studying computing is to understand the process of it and to properly
    utilize it. Personally I am interested in digital arts and design and I want to
    what I can do to make a better platform for it and for that I am studying computing'
- desc: According to my understanding, the purpose of computing is to make human life
    easier and better. It also includes various kinds of purpose regarding information
    processing, structuring and managing. We can gather the information on anything
    of our need, and this can be possible through programmed data. In the field of
    technology, computer science is the department which helps us to know the way
    in which technology works and the way in which software engineering is changing
    the world for everyone.
- desc: Computing is a tool of creativity. The purpose of computing is to expand the
    variety of things can be done in the industry. It is really helpful to people
    and everyone can use it too. Computing is limitless, you can create whatever you
    want to create with it. The interesting thing is that its not that difficult if
    you really understand the basics like as said in lecture not all math, you can
    simply use logic in it too. The softwares are really about making things easy
    to people. Computing is designing and building hardwares, softwares for various
    purpose. It's the process that can store numerous information. Computing is even
    use in communication and entertainment purpose. There are probably hundreds of
    more purposes of computing as the list is never ending.
- desc: 'One of the question raised in the class was: What is your understanding of
    the purpose of computing? I think the purpose of computing is to make our life
    as simple/smarter as possible which includes helping people in the process.'
- desc: "We learned and had a good conversation about the two videos which was helpful\
    \ and motivational. That is we can use computer in many every field and is very\
    \ helpful. But we also have to take in note that we don\u2019t breach the privacy\
    \ of any person by using technology we have. Indeed computer programming is the\
    \ best field for me and this video helps us feel motivated."
- desc: The purpose of computing is to have solution of every problem.In this world
    of technology, the advanced computing system has gives us many opportunities to
    fulfill our dreams.Human can make mistake, but computer don't. The algorithm helps
    us to know how machine works and solve problems.The computer science is not longer
    just a vocational for getting job instead it is completely foundational for getting
    any job. The tech industry is fast growing and there is no greater opportunity
    to change the world through technology as it is effecting every field. It's not
    only about computing device but also medicine, space research, entertainment,
    and even the contact lens has a computer in them.
- desc: 'starting with the ted talk on beware of bubble filters, this is something
    that is well known to a lot of individuals in recent time. Most social Media pages
    are tailor made to suite what an individual would is most likely to want to see
    on his timeline and they avoid things we don''t want to see. Instagram, Facebook,
    YouTube, and Twitter are all the top media app that use the bubble filter. Honestly,
    I don''t mind the bubble filter cause it narrows it down to what I want to see
    and the one major trouble individuals have with the filter is that when you click
    on something the first time, it assumes that you are into to that then you might
    not be, but you also have the chance to tell the software that you don''t want
    to see such a content again. that would make sure that the specific content and
    other similar contents don''t come up on you''re time line.

    The second video about obligation do social media platforms have to the greater
    good?, this was a really good video but i believe that some content of this videos
    is old and a certain things have changed in regards to the obligations social
    platforms, as certain social media are trying to do better for the grater good.

    My understanding of the purpose of computing is, assuming we are taking about
    computers. A computer is designed to be able to carry out many different tasks.
    Desktop computers and laptops are examples of general purpose computers. and some
    of the task they achieve include: access the internet, browsing the world wide
    web (WWW), using word processing software, playing games, communicate via email
    and social media, and so on. if I decided to going in-depth into my understanding
    of the computing, this would be too long, but a computer is the steam of everything
    electronic that exist, it not only helps us in our day to day activities, but
    it also helps in the production of goods and Services which including helping
    doctors in the hospital.

    My purpose for studying computing is easy, it''s because computing and computer
    programs are the next big thing, and I want to be part of the group that are in
    demand for job opportunities. like in the first ted talk we watched in this class
    the demand for individuals who know their way about computing and computer programming
    are in demand. And I have always had a things for computers starting for playing
    games to trying to make my owe game to learning programming code, it''s all been
    a step in the right direction.

    My question for you Daryl is why did you choose computing as a major ?'
- desc: "The purpose of computing is to evolve world. Computing gives opportunity\
    \ to humans what they can\u2019t do just by man labour. Computing makes innovation\
    \ limitless. Though its our responsibility to decide what we do with this opportunity.\
    \ Its very similar to a man possessing a rifle, he can either use that to save\
    \ people or he can do evil by killing innocents. For me, I\u2019ve been into gaming\
    \ from my childhood and it just fascinates me to see how computers can make those\
    \ virtual worlds. Learning computing will help me answer those questions and open\
    \ new doors for me."
- desc: the last meeting was focused on the various aspects of risk and reward and
    for a major share of the lecture i got the knowledge about the cyber crime.
- desc: 'Question from meeting 3: "What is your understanding on the purpose of computing?"

    The purpose of computing is to perform calculations, process various information,
    and store/retrieve data on a scalable level. The ability to compute created businesses,
    some of which are now the most profitible and powerful in the world (google, for
    example), as well as brough forth an unprecedented level of scientific research
    and discovery. For instance, we never would have seen the first image of a black
    hole without immense computing power. We would have not seen many amazing discoveries
    without the power of modern computing. Lastly and perhaps most noteworthy, computing
    makes peoples lives easier and more enjoyable. Is it not much more preferable
    to simply search an archive for a file by simple keyword, or dig through a filing
    cabinet? What if you had to send that file to another person? What if we didn''t
    have E-mail? The only reason we can stream video from netflix or youtube is the
    powerful computing hardware(Software too) behind it all. The future of computing
    is promising as well, with immense research and development into AI, modern computing
    could be even easier, automated, and vastly more powerful than it is today.'
- desc: 'Hello


    "Beware online filter bubbles" by Eli Pariser talks about this online filters
    that are created by complex algorithms to create a tailored experience for user.
    He explains it as a filter bubble and tells everyone to beware of it because it
    is filtering the content based upon what algorithm thinks we like rather that
    what we really like, in fact controlling the internet for us. Many companies like
    Facebook and google are doing it without even user knowing about it. To explain
    this he took the example of his Facebook account which shows him filtered content.
    In addition to that he shows how his friends got two different result for a google
    search. This illustrates the concept of this invisible filter or filter bubble
    in our day to day use which is leading our way towards junk information that we
    don''t want to see. Not only this, it is isolating user in a way by not showing
    them plenty of information that user might be interested in.


    "What obligation do social media platforms have to the greater good?" explains
    that how there are minimal obligations on these social media platforms which is
    not helping to create a good public space. He says that better structure needs
    to be implemented on social media in order to make them a better place online.
    Right now all of it is user friendly but in order to make it a positive place
    it needs to be public friendly. Speaker also points out that social media platforms
    can learn from actual public gathering and maybe implement an option for user
    to choose some actual reaction that people would give in a real gathering. In
    addition to that he suggest that these online social environment should respect
    the human diversity in order to make its way towards becoming a better public
    space.


    Concepts in this meeting were easy to understand because of the fact that it is
    something that we encounter everyday. In particular I would really like to learn
    how a user personalized experience is created by companies.


    Thanks'
- desc: I think the biggest thing I took from the discussion was the contrast between
    the two videos. Computer science is often portrayed as a very innovative and even
    sort of hip thing, with all these cool offices and startups and such. The problems
    of privacy are another very big thing and are talked about frequently as they're
    a huge concern, but I've never really seen them put together and the topic of
    privacy really isn't brought up much when learning about computer sciences and
    such which I had really never noticed. These issues have everything to do with
    computer programming and software development, and it really feels like it should
    be shown more and talked about more while learning about computer science rather
    than just making it all out like some perfect amazing thing.
- desc: "I think that computing is very important in the present time and that each\
    \ one of us should learn about computing because our day starts with it and also\
    \ ends with it. It helps us to better connect with people, help them by making\
    \ software beneficial for them and create a benchmark in the technological world.\n\
    I want to learn more about computing because computing is an endless world. Every\
    \ day we can learn more about it, discover more about it but still, there would\

- desc: In meeting 3 we discussed as a group the videos we watched in meeting 2, like
    how in video one it talks about how great a job in computer science can be with
    its good pay work environment and how there is a lot of opportunity. One person
    noted that it leaves out the bad of computer science.then in video 2 they discuss
    data collection and how far we should go in collecting that data is it morally
    right to do so.
- desc: 'The third meeting is all related to our real life activities. The first video,
    beware online filter bubbles is very much true and the same things happen with
    me all the time not only on google but also on other social platforms like Instagram.
    it is true that internet shows us the things that it thinks that want to see not
    the things that we should see or know. the thing i learnt from this video is that
    web is not standard anymore. it will show us the results basis on our previous
    searches.

    the second video is quiet similar it is all about the the effect of shapes and
    spaces on the people''s behavior: like if a person is sitting in library it will
    behave totally different from if he will be in a bar. the conclusion of that video
    is that if their will be more parks near the homes then people will socialize
    more, same should be there in internet''s case.'
- desc: "For me, computing has many purposes. Some of these are listed below:\n1.\
    \ To drastically reduce the time it takes to do complex calculations\n2. To reduce\

- desc: My understanding of the purpose of computing is process, store and data. Process
    and store are common "couple" in most people's understanding that are never accept
    formal CS introduction. And I like to visualize things when I first time meet
    them, In all of my CS class, I can say none of them are not trying to describe
    computer/ computing is base on a human brain to me. Same as I, when we thinking-is
    same as process, when we memorize things is consider as store, and the event or
    knowledge that we memorize are data. But human brain is limited, people will forget
    things if they have not talk about it for a while. In this situation, The purpose
    of computing is emerge, computer have fast speed to process, huge space to store
    and data. It reduced time for human thinking and speeded up the work efficiency.
- desc: "In the last meeting I get to know more about what Computing is and why is\

    \ we can get complete information about something we search for from google but\
    \ in the reality we are not getting any information in a proper way because our\
    \ search results are being controlled. We are not actually able to see what gets\

- desc: Studying computing solves different aspects of problem related to business,
    science and social context. Computing helps open up great opportunities for innovative
    ideas.
- desc: 'In my opinion, the purpose of computing, is like collecting data, storing
    the data, doing the calculations and so on. For the word of computing, it is already
    existing in world for thousands of years. Computing benefits people in many things
    whether count how many money earned today or population census. In the world right
    now, since we can easily find a calculator or computer, computing is more like
    a computer things. It can be used on analysis data or even predicted data. With
    the help of machines, computing is becoming more complex. So there are different
    computing right now like cloud computing. These helps people to deal with data
    and I think it is one of the purpose of computing.

    '
- desc: 'The purpose of computing is to make life easier. Computers can make our life''s
    easier by doing many things such as completing repetitive tasks, dangerous tasks,
    calculating long complex calculations, storing data, sorting data, forecasting
    etc. I find that even though computers have made our lives easier, the use of
    this technology by greedy corporations has also made us mental slaves. For Example:
    Many people are addicted to the use of social media platforms. These platforms
    have a huge impact on our lives, they can influence people into doing crazy things.


    I am studying computing because computers are used in every field around the world.
    I can work in any field such as health, automobile, security, insurance etc.,
    because they all use computers in one way or another. I would also like to use
    this computing technology to solve issues that are faced by the human kind. Computing
    technology is very powerful and I strongly believe that studying this technology
    will help me do my part to make our world a better place.'
- desc: 'What is the purpose of computing?

    Computing involves designing and building hardware and software systems for a
    wide range of functionality. The purpose of computing includes but not limited
    to equipping scholars with problem solving and critical analysis skills, software
    design and management, information management, study of algorithmic processes,
    programming computers to work for a specific purpose.

    Computing has become very important in the world as it benefits various sectors
    that contributes to a society growth. Computing capability is an essential skills
    in the modern world as it allows individual involvement and development .'
- desc: 'It is really crucial of one to know how to code in this era, the technology
    is evolving. The only way we stay with pace of the world is by coping with it.
    Coding is one of the most important way to cope up. It helps to increase the productivity,
    helps to connect to the internet and also help to make a program which might represent
    your surroundings. Therefore, it is easy to learn.

    The aim of the exercise was to show that while most people can embrace their favorite
    smartphone instantly, far less can understand the moral values that underlie their
    everyday choices. With so many critical questions facing us, Horowitz argues that
    hasty, unprincipled decisions are bound to yield bad or unpredictable outcomes,
    and that we need to think about and make them instead. He inclines more towards
    making decision by taking both operating system and human behaviour in consideration.'
- desc: The most interesting aspects of last meeting were the fact that coding is
    a tool for many different ways to impact the lives of others. Not only that, but
    the first video could be seen as hyper-positive. The up-side to coding, and jobs
    in coding, was the only side brought up. What's more is they used the trendiness
    of the workspace to try and encourage people to become coders as well. Again,
    like the first meeting, the ethics of data collection was talked about, and is
    something I would like to learn more about.
- desc: My understanding of the purpose of computing is that it is instrumental. Like
    a music instrument, computing takes time to learn and requires lots of practice.
    However, with comuputing you can get creative in terms of design and purpose similar
    to how with an instrument can be used to make different music and portray different
    purposes.
- desc: For this lesson, we have discussed What is your understanding of the purpose
    of computing?What is your purpose in studying computing? In my understanding,
    the essence of Computing is to help human to better complete data analysis and
    processing, which can make our study and work further improve efficiency.I learned
    Computing because I was interested in logic and processing. The program is just
    like mathematical formula, which can clearly deal with different types of computing
    problems.Then we think of privacy issues, according to the articles and video
    data, more and more people are concerned about the privacy of the Internet, it
    is because the computer network is essentially needed for data acquisition and
    processing, which makes the user's privacy and the convenience of the Internet
    computer technology to produce the contradiction of natural point.
- desc: 'After looking at the first video, I encounter the term filter bubble. This
    is a state of intellectual isolation created by popular social media and personalized
    search sites. As a consequence, consumers become separated from knowledge that
    conflicts with their perspectives. The database algorithm maintains a record of
    information, such as past click actions, search history, etc., and then, according
    to the primary priority of the user, it selectively determines which content will
    be presented to the user. In this way, people are being effectively isolated in
    their own cultural or ideological bubbles according to what they would like to
    see more. The choices made by these algorithms are not transparent. For instance,
    Google and Facebook take into consideration how individuals have interacted with
    related posts in the past, and as a result of these customized searches, they
    decide what should be displayed in a user''s search home page and news feed. But,
    surprisingly, before placing this filter in the content, they neither warn the
    user nor take approval to do so, and so many viewers are ignorant that filter
    bubbles even exist. It wouldn''t be that bad, in my viewpoint, if the user had
    given the freedom to decide what they want to see and what they don''t want to
    see.


    The key focus of the second video is to enhance our online channels. We do ought
    to encourage meaningful democratic discussion in order to assist people with current
    serious problems. We all know that these flourishing social media platforms were
    originally designed to bring people closer by providing space for meaningful conversations
    and, therefore, solutions to a wide range of challenges. However, they turned
    out to be quite a lawless environment in which people fight on stupid reasons,
    criticize each other and thereby widening the gap between themselves. Therefore,
    if social networking site developers take inspiration from the real world and
    implement it digitally, the platform would be very useful to all. Moreover, I
    just loved the thought of making digital online spaces a more convenient, more
    reliable and more wonderful place to live in as that is going to be our ultimate
    destination.'
- desc: The purpose of computing according to my opinion is for the advancement of
    humankind. It is to make humankind independent and self-reliable. Computing is
    now eases our day-to-day life routines and makes space travel possible. Artificial
    intelligence progressed due to high-end technology and computing. Thus the purpose
    of computing is for the betterment of the society.
- desc: Computing to me is to program or code various machines and software to invent
    new things and refine existing ones to make the earth a better place. it is a
    superpower available to everyone with which we can make lives better and sustainable.
    One thing that could be improved in future meetings is if only our professor could
    type his notes instead of writing because I am not able to understand any written
    notes. Thank you.
- desc: 'What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?

    To solve problems or create convenience through information searching and retrieval,
    entertain or distract with games or social networking, and above all make money.


    What is your purpose in studying computing?

    I have a need to create and a desire to solve problems. With an ever-growing interest
    in the world of tech, I feel compelled to learn how to code and be my own boss.
    Our world continues to be shaped by technology and I no longer want to be just
    another user.'
- desc: The purpose of computing goes way back to the time of World War 2. Alan turning
    created the turning machine in order to encrypt the enigma code. He is said to
    be the father of computer science for creating algorithms to solve complicated
    problems. We are programmers who use coding as a tool to solve real-world problems
    and to make life easier. We as a computer scientist create machines which help
    us do a lot of repetitive work as well as high-level thinking as supercomputers.
    Supercomputers can calculate billions of arithmetic in a matter of seconds. Computing
    helps to achieve the unachievable able. With the help of algorithms, scientists
    were able to picture the black hole. It helps us reach places where humans reach
    an endpoint. Computing helps in the research field with the help of computational
    programming to predict the next action with the help of statics and math and algorithms.
    The power of computing is when humans find its limitation to do repetitive tasks.
- desc: 'Q: What is your understanding of the purpose of computing?

    A: To me the purpose of computing is like the purpose of being a Doctor or a Lawyer
    or really any sort of profession. Some people might be in it for the money or
    the social esteem but at the same time there is a great opportunity to help people.
    At the end of the day Computer Scientists are really creating tools for people
    to use, but that doesn''t mean that those tools are always going to be helpful
    or cause more good than harm. Computing is just like anything in life, you can
    use it responsibly and morally, or you can abuse it.


    Q: What is your purpose in studying computing?

    A: As technology gets more advanced there become an ever greater need for those
    who can understand it, utilize it, and innovate it. I know that a lot of people
    who take up those roles take them up to abuse their power and reap benefits at
    the expense of others. I don''t want to be one of those people. I want to be the
    best I can be and help others.'
- desc: computing has a very vast use from simple machine like microwave to the international
    space station. computing makes thee life easy, by just clicking few buttons. learning
    computing is not very hard, it is very easy if you understand how it is works.
    It has reduced reputation of human work to low percent. It helps to solve complication
    problem with the help of creating algorithms and managing data.
- desc: Meeting 3 we discussed the two videos from meeting 2 and we learned that based
    on a teacher's claim his students improved by 30% after they used code. The first
    video was mostly about bringing famous and successful people from Facebook, Twitter
    and other platforms to talk about coding. WE learned that people who know how
    to code are more creative and successful and there is a lot of jobs will be available
    but less people are interested in the field. Second video talked about ethics
    and how we should make decision as a developer on things such as handling our
    user private data. The TED talk host talks about how everyone has different opinion
    on how to handle different situation and how to make that decision, some may use
    math to calculate the pros and cons, while one may use reasons and consequences
    but regardless we should consider ethics while making these decision and be responsible
    for them.
- desc: 'The class was highly emphasized on the purpose of computing such as to build
    software. The initial discussion was on the code stars and moral operating system.
    This semester I am also taking CS 330 which is introduction to operating system
    and I so that the reason why the dissucsion about operating system was more realistic
    for me. The professor had given us important knowledge about the moral operating
    system and the thing which I liked most was that he was so excited and interested
    in knowing the views about the code stars from the stand which was a motivation
    for me to take part in the zoom meeting.

    This class is very useful for me to learn more about cyber space and also about
    cyber crime.

    I would like to learn more about computing and software. For me the main motive
    of computing is to bring more advancement in the society to increase productivity
    in the work areas.'
- desc: Computing is an action that requires, takes benefit of, or creates computing
    machines. It contains studying and testing mathematical operations and developing
    both hardware and software. It has scientific, engineering, mathematical, technological
    and social aspects. Major computing majors include computer engineering, computer
    science, cybersecurity, data science, information systems, information technology,
    and software engineering. The drive of the Computing is executing calculations,
    store information, retrieve data and process information. A computer has programmed
    data or computer language that tells the computer how to fulfil its purpose. The
    computer will only do what it is programmed to do.
- desc: Social media is/has become such a massive impact on our lives and each year
    it gets stronger. To developed such a world changing platform is amazing, at the
    same time scary. These people who can do things as amazing have the most powerful
    deck of cards. Each day we grow and grow. I hope to making something world changing
    myself but hopefully not the path of a social media since it brings harm to some
    and censorship is a problem that a code cant pick up on/ my understanding of the
    purpose of computing is to make my life, and others life simpler and easier!
- desc: 'The first video shows how we are being controlled by internet and how the
    personalized life which is provided to us by default is dangerous for us. Our
    future is at a risk of not being more explored and internet ends up controlling
    our future personality instead of letting us to evolve, shrinking our brain evolution
    to zero.


    The second video shows the behavioural differences in human beings and how social
    media research results shows us the content that they want us to see following
    the social norm and classes. They follow according to the classifications and
    shows us the contents.

    '
- desc: From the last meeting, we discussed the purpose of computing. We were asked
    about what that means to us and from my perspective, the purpose of computing
    is to share information with others. A network of networks to distribute and gain
    access to information all around the world. The idea was to further mankind in
    ways we never could before because before we had the internet, people had to use
    phones or books which caused a lengthy amount of time to further their knowledge
    to tackle new issues. Today everyone has access to the internet and the moment
    we need to figure something out, we have the ability to search for an answer right
    away and this is all thanks to the power of computing.
- desc: I found the ted talk about social media platforms especially interesting.
    I know that social media is a very central part of many people's lives, especially
    with limited physical interaction during a pandemic. It is important to realize
    the power that the corporations behind these social media platforms have over
    their users, so that we can use them better. I especially liked the idea of thinking
    of a social media platform as a "space" for sharing, like a city of people working
    together to build their community in the way they want it. I do not use social
    media very often, but when I think about social media platforms, I will be more
    aware about how I am contributing to building my community.
- desc: In our class discussion, the concept of "what programming means to you" was
    brought up and over the last few days. I have really been thinking about what
    it means to be a programmer and why I decided to pursue programming as a career.
    For me it is really about how open the computer science field is. As technology
    continues to advance, the need for programmers and those who understand the various
    subjects of development is continuing to grow. The options are unlimited for programmers
    and that versatility is something I have always desired. Not only that, but the
    ability to reach the entire world and make an impact from anywhere I have a wifi
    connection and my laptop is just incredible. So I guess as a whole, programming
    means that I can truly make a difference in someones life anytime and anywhere
    as long as the work ethic is there.
- desc: 'In my opinion, computing has various of purposes in the modern world nowadays.
    It could connect people around the world together. It could be a useful tool for
    many fields in the world today. For instance, it could help people calculate many
    things. It could be a software that people can utilize it, for example in the
    factory, in hospital, in restaurant, in studio and so on. Currently, computing
    is essential for everyone. It creates more works for many people. It also a source
    of entertainment for people to relax after working.

    For me, my purpose of studying computing, firstly, is my favorite. When I was
    young, I liked to play with computer as well as use it. It made me excited when
    using it so that was why I choose to study in the computing field when I grow
    up. Later on, when I was in high school, I started to learn about coding and one
    more time, it made me excited too. Moreover, in the modern world nowadays, there
    are many jobs related to computing so it would be easier for me when I am seeking
    for jobs when I graduates.'
- desc: In meeting three, we discussed the videos about the code stars and moral operating
    system. Also, we talked about the purpose of computing and how everything worked.
    Professor also discussed the morals of computing and privacy. My take on the purpose
    of computing that it is an essential skill to learn in this modern world of technology.
    It gives us access to the worldwide net, where we can connect with people and
    learn about their ideas and experiences throughout the world. The purpose of learning
    to compute is to developed new software and hardware which can further help in
    solving the problems in various fields of work.
- desc: In todays class I found how these two videos code stars and moral operating
    system are related to each other.I also find difference between both of them.Code
    Stars showing the benefit of become a developer.It show only positive side of
    this technology and ignoring the ethical issues behind the industry.However,other
    video shows us the information regarding some ethical issues with this technology.
- desc: computers are able to perform logical calculations even the calculation which
    takes years to compute takes very less time in computer which helps to calculate
    those things which are impossible if done without computer computing this shows
    us how computers will help us in future to discover new things which are otherwise
    impossible
- desc: 'In meeting 3 we basically discussed about cyber crime, we learn that the
    fight against cyber crime has always been important as it assures the integrity
    and credibility of the systems. We also discussed about the purpose of computing
    system. I mean its basically creating something that is user friendly and serves
    the purpose of making things easier for the intended person. Interesting point
    where you question yourself as to not only how but why? Why are we doing what
    we are doing, everything serves a purpose and so does computing. Coming back to
    cyber crime, privacy and security are two things of utmost importance on data
    collection is one but data retention seems to be overwhelming. Here''s a

    glance from the MSBA (Minnesota State Bar Association) This past June, few of
    many U.S law enforcement agencies were victims of data breach for up to 256GB.

- desc: 'My view on the purpose of studying computing:

    I believe people study computing for various reasons, most especially to be able
    to solve challenging and complex problems. There are also people who study computing
    because they would like to make a positive difference in the world by being creative.


    I decided to study computing because I would love to learn new skills. I believe
    the use of technology is part of our future and by studying a course like computer
    science it can help me make a great impact in the world.'
- desc: 'Computing for me is a system built to make our everyday tasks a little bit
    easier. Every day, we find ways to make our daily tasks easier and more comfortable
    to do; computing is just one of the most efficient methods we have created. From
    our workplaces to our transportation and back at our different homes, there are
    computers there making things easier for us and it keeps getting better as time
    goes on.


    My primary purpose in studying computer science is to solve problems. There are
    always problems around, in scientific, business, and social contexts. it is our
    responsibility as computer scientists to help solve these problems'
- desc: I think the purpose of computing is using computer programs to help people
    to solve problems, and bring convenience to life.
- desc: For me, coding is a tool used for creating art. Much like an artist using
    paint and brushes on a canvas. At this point in my experience with computer science
    and coding, I wouldn't say that I've encountered a situation where I found myself
    creating something that would require a moral framework. Of course I will encounter
    this in the future when my work is able to reach and affect more people. I'm looking
    forward to learning more about what I can do as a programmer to think about the
    influence my creation has on other people. While thinking about this it made me
    remember the situation with the creator of Flappy Bird several years ago. He received
    a lot of backlash and negative responses which led to the removal of the game
    on the App Store. I can imagine how shocked the creator was when he encountered
    this response and realized how much a game could affect other peoples lives.
- desc: 'I liked the "Code Stars" video a lot. I think it delivered an important message
    and I agree with the idea that coding should be a basic skill for people & not
    something restricted for people in that particular field. As technology advances
    everything is being automated through the use of computers & obviously when there
    is a piece of hardware there has to be a software which is operating on that hardware
    - coding becomes more and more important as we advance IMO. Ergo, knowing how
    to code would prove to be useful for everyone this way or that.


    As for the video regarding the "Moral Operating System" I agree with the fact
    that it is a complex task to apply rules of ethics in computing. Sometimes using
    data can result in providing benefits for the entire society but that begs the
    question whether using that data without the user''s consent is ethical or not.
    I can only say that as long as things are kept transparent between users and the
    organizations which are collecting data, there is no harm in collecting data as
    long as it benefits the society and not just the organizations.'
- desc: 'Nowadays, people cannot live without computers in every aspect of their lives,
    so computers'' future is auspicious. There are five Purposes of computing.

    (1) people need computing for recreational activities, such as watching movies,
    listening to music, playing various games, communicating and making friends, etc.
    And, There is no doubt that computing brings people a high experience in entertainment.
    For example, more and more realistic games bring real experience to people.

    (2) People often use computing for numerical calculation, so computers are widely
    used in scientific research, engineering technology, and other aspects. In general,
    most people have used computers to do accounts.

    (3) Information processing is an important purpose of computing; for example,
    people often use computing for data processing, registration, statistics, calculation,
    arrangement, etc. It is a beneficial ability to use computing for information
    processing at work.

    (4) people use computing to realize automatic operation. In our modern, the use
    of computer automation can improve production efficiency, reduce labor waste,
    effectively improve the quantity and quality of products, change people''s working
    environment, save raw materials to a certain extent, and greatly reduce production
    costs.

    (5) people have used computers to do some auxiliary work in teaching. At present,
    computing is widely used in education. For example, teachers can use computers
    to directly correct papers or check to cheat.'
- desc: 'My understanding of the purpose of computing is slim when overlooking the
    vast utilization of modern technology. Generally speaking, my understanding is
    that the purpose of computing is either to simplify manual processes or to create
    something new. For example, it simplifies things such as building and maintaining
    a database, communicating with others locally and globally, and running through
    a great number of processes in a short amount of time.


    I''d say that if I needed to solve one hundred math equations, it would be easier
    for me to build a program to solve them for me. I believe that concept is the
    primary purpose of computing.'
- desc: 'In my opinion computing, it is a goal-oriented activity which helps us to
    think in a different way, it led to the advancement of humanity.

    Computing is used in each and every fields nowadays.


    In the class, we discussed the two videos which were ''Code Star'' and ''A Model
    Operating System''.

    The first videos motivated about learning the code and the second suggests that
    we need a model operating system which knows the difference between right and
    wrong.'
- desc: Meeting 3 was all about filter bubbles and their affect on common people.
    The internet is providing us the information that it thinks we want to see. It
    has started working same as Facebook or other social sites like when we search
    for any thing it keeps us showing the same kind of results for the next time.
    it has created a sense of isolation for the searchers or internet surfers. the
    difficult thing for me to understand was the reason behind the concept of filter
    bubbles.
- desc: The video 1 gives you an idea about programming. Its basically you teaching
    the computer to do things for you. Its a process of breaking down the problems.
    Its a way to express your creativity. One thing specifically draw my attention
    was "You don't have to be genius to learn how to code, you just have to be determined."
    Whereas video 2 highlights how to utilize this power ethically once we have it.
    How to use the data we collect constructively and by maintaining the privacy.
- desc: Computing for me can be said to be an introduction to a brand new dimension.
    We have been using the latest technology for years now without even knowing what
    reasons are they created for and how are they created. Keeping the learning portion
    on the side, the engagement to the computing lets us deal with the creator side
    of the tech we have been using. Of course the factor of security, privacy, improved
    experience, money, and many other things matter. But the greatest factor for today's
    generation is socializing.
- desc: 'the most important thing you learned from this past meeting

    -> Purpose of Computing and Moral ethics to follow


    the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand

    -> What should be the ethics of code in Computing Business


    what you would like to know more about

    -> Security against the purpose of computing


    something you encountered that is related to the past meeting

    -> What Purpose of Computing really stands for'
- desc: We discussed the purpose of computing and discussed how computing can be used
    almost everywhere and it has endless possibilities. Also, we discussed how we
    should use computing for good causes and to benefit people in the society. Then
    we lead to talk about a moral operating system which will not be selfish like
    some of the applications and operating systems which collect way more than the
    data that is needed without the user being fully aware of it.
- desc: In this lecture we just discussed about the two videos from prior meeting.
    In the first video 'Code stars' , we get to know that coding is not all difficult,
    its a fun and we can make a lot of money in this field. From the second video
    we learned privacy is important although with this superpower of computing we
    can get access to everything but there should be limit. And my answer for the
    understanding of computing is that computing can make our work more easy and we
    can introduce many new technologies with its help.
