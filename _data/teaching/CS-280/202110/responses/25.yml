- desc: this meeting was very interesting, i get to know more things from Rick Lee
    from Sasktel. I got so much to learn from the presentation that Rick lee gave
    today in this lecture. The most important and interesting part about today's meeting
    is to customize the resume as per the job requirements.<br>
- desc: <p><br></p><p>&nbsp;we had two special guests from the SaskTel.&nbsp; In tonight
    meeting i got answer to one of the curious question which is how long should be
    the resume. Because most of the time people believe that resume is supposed to
    be of only single sheet and the another point which was made in the class which
    is a tip for all the student that don't be so choosy for your first job take it
    as a opportunity to establish your self because It sector is so vast.&nbsp; Mr.
    lee discussed about&nbsp; Sunburst breach discovery by FireEye. My favorite tale
    was that how attackers used compromise office to access Starwind Network.</p><p><br></p>
- desc: <p>Thank you very much for organising today's discussion session. It was great
    to hear and learn what are the things going on in terms of cyber crimes. Also
    wanted to add one more thing from my previous response. Please, if possible add
    a page on ur courses saying the pattern of the final exam. Thank you.</p>
- desc: <p>I found Rick Lee's presentation on the solarwinds attack interesting and
    further highlights the importance of cybersecurity in today's information age.
    I think there was a nod to the E-Health attack in the presentation (indirectly,
    that is, I think anyways). Trevor McDonald also had some interesting pointers
    on resume building and getting into the job market following graduation, which
    I found helpful, I am sure many other students did as well.</p>
- desc: <p>I would like to know more about different types of hacks that have happened
    the Solar Winds one was very interesting how it was accomplished. Black Berry
    had discovered one the lynx server OS that had been exploited by, they believe,
    the Chinese government. I recently read about how the RTX 3090 is supposed to
    be very powerful in brute force password cracks. AMD also released a statement
    saying their ryzen gen 5 processors were able to be exploited by a specter like
    attack. Hearing more about different kinds of hacks that have happen would be
    a very interesting area to hear about.</p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting we were joined by executives of CIPS who gave us some nice
    tips on how to apply for jobs and what to expect when looking for jobs in the
    industry after graduation. The idea was that resume is the first piece of work
    that we as a potential employee submit to the organization. They then moved on
    to discuss the very large and impactful cyber incident from last year related
    to SolarWinds. They discussed the potential threat actors, impact and enormity
    of the attack.</p>
- desc: <p>This presentation was very eye-opening to how I could be exposed to malware
    on the internet. I see how high-profile companies that rely on online systems
    to operate would need serious security, because a malware attack like the ones
    presented about could ruin their entire organization.</p>
- desc: The most interesting thing about today's lecture was how even big companies
    try to clone their work from other companies and it can lead to legal action.
    Also it can take long to determine while the plagiarism was happened or was its
    just by chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    dir="ltr">In the last class, we had 2 guest speakers from SaskTel. Rick Lee and&nbsp;
    Trevor Mcdonald were IT professionals in the field for more than 25 years. They
    presented a lecture on the SUNSPOT which was a supply chain attack on the malware.
    The attacker tries to get in touch with the source code and add malware to it,
    and the company who is launching an app will just see this as an update because
    it is unaware of the infections malware and hence it can affect a lot more people
    as it is used by so many people depending on the popularity of the app. </p></b><br><br></p>

- desc: <p>5G is being used more and more widely, but Saskatchewan has been slow to
    build 5G. I think maybe in the future we will be able to use 5G in Saskatchewan.
    This technology has gotten a lot of attention, and even caused political disputes
    in some sense, but the spread of new technology is often for the benefit of people,
    and I look forward to the day when 5G is used in Saskatchewan<br></p>
- desc: <p>In the last meeting, we talked with two guest speakers who were from SaskTel.
    Trevor Mcdonald and Rick Lee the ones working in the field of Information &amp;
    Technology for over 25 years. They gave us a presentation on the topic of SUNSPOT
    which was basically a chain/branch of supply for fighting against malware attacks.
    Basically, the one trying to attack the software would try adding malware to the
    source code. Hence, when starting the app, it would ask to update and spread the
    virus and eventually would cause trouble to many individuals.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>Reflecting back on the SaskTel guest speakers that we had there was one
    big thing that stood out to me was the fact that the one guest said that they
    specifically looked for special accreditation, such as CIPS. Specifically it was
    sought after due to the fact that CIPS accredited computer professionals have
    to honour the CIPS code of ethics. Which is very interesting, as it ensures that
    us as computer professionals are programming and applying our computer knowledge
    professionally and ethically, while for the business we work for (if one isn't
    self-employed) has the peace of mind that its employees are upholding the interest
    of the business and public good.</p>

- desc: <p>In the last meeting, we had two new hosts. They delivered their knowledge
    about CIPS and also about their own experiences that how they started their job
    after studying computer science and how gets promoted to higher positions.</p>
- desc: <p>In last lecture we have guest name Rick Lee who came to give information
    about windows management instrumentation and cyberattack and more. We all learn
    and understand about it in whole lecture and in last 10 to 15 minutes some students
    ask questions regarding their doubts or trying to know something more on it. At
    last we thank him for&nbsp; gave some information and knowledge about it and we
    learn some new things also.so, thanks to our professor for inviting him and providing
    us some new information.</p>
- desc: I found the presentation to be quite alarming, especially given how long it
    took for such a major security breach to be detected (the process took ~9 months!)
    The hackers were able to get into some very important systems. What gets me is
    that there is no one who is really at fault for letting this slip by. The hackers
    were just really good. It makes me wonder if other such cloud platforms are compromised
    , but we just don't know it yet.
- desc: <p>The last meeting was one of the most interesting meetings of the semester.
    The whole session was so engaging, interesting, and knowledgeable. I liked how
    they had visuals in their presentation which was eye-catching. I wish we had more
    meetings like that but nevertheless cheers to Dr. Hepting for arranging such a
    session, thank you very much!</p>
- desc: <p>I loved the presentation by Rick Lee. It was very detailed and I learned
    a great deal about the solarwinds cyber attack. I learned that cyber attacks can
    be very sophisticated and can have huge impacts. The techniques used by the attackers
    in Solarwinds attack was interesting. I learned about the Attack Life Cycle and
    many more things. Very fascinating presentation.</p>
- desc: In the last meeting, the discussion was really worth to attend , as I got
    to know a lot of knew things. we had two guest speakers, discussed about the the
    opportunities for job seekers as how to build a strong resume and the expectations
    of the HR team from a individual.<br>and the second discussion discussion was
    on the topic of SolarWinds. A proper Agenda was shown to find out how we used
    SolarWinds. overall, it is always pleasant to have a guest personality to share
    their experience and knowledge with learners.<br>
- desc: '<p>In the last gathering, the conversation was quit different and interesting,
    as I became acquainted with a great deal of knew things. we had two visitor speakers,
    examined about the chances for work searchers as how to assemble a solid resume
    and the assumptions for the recruiters&nbsp; from a person applied for the opportunity.&nbsp;<span
    style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">furthermore, the second conversation was on the
    subject of SolarWinds. An appropriate Agenda was appeared to discover how we utilized
    SolarWinds , who are the suspects, victims of the attack and many more. it was
    a totally new topic for me to know , hence worth to meet those speakers.</span></p>'
- desc: "<p></p><p>In the past meeting, we\r\nhad two guests\u2019 speakers from SaskTel\
    \ 'Trevor McDonald' and 'Rick Lee'. They\r\ntalked about their job current job\
    \ roles and what their study background and\r\nhow long they have been in the\
    \ position they are currently in. Trevor also talked\r\nabout the resumes and\
    \ how resume needs to clean and organized. After that, Rick\r\ntook over and talked\
    \ about the solar winds in which he disused about the whole\r\nscenario how the\
    \ solar wind attack happens and what type of malware was used\r\nand who was the\
    \ victims and suspects, its life cycle, and post breach activities. After that,\
    \ we had a quick questions and answers sessions in which we asked questions to\
    \ Rick and he was able to provide us great answers.</p><p></p>"
- desc: <p>Talking about resumes,&nbsp; I have worked few part time jobs, and most
    consideration I have gotten , have been from my short detailed&nbsp; resume rather
    than the long one. The resume should&nbsp; have&nbsp; neccessary&nbsp; details
    but not long enough to whoever wants to goes through them.</p>
- desc: The class was about the solar winds IT Software Management explained by the
    two SaskTel employees. They also explained the hacks that happened, the advantages
    of the software, and also how it works. There was also discussion about how things
    work when the software is used and what happens exactly. They also discussed how
    the student's resumes can be perfect.<br>
- desc: "<p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">We all learned many new things in this\r\nmeeting,\
    \ it was a great interview with Sasktel officers. They make us know\r\nabout things\
    \ like real cyberattack by suspected Russian organization. They talk\r\nabout\
    \ how the privacy and security were compromised during the breach. The U.S\r\n\
    federal departments and many other international companies like Microsoft, SolarWind\r\
    \nand other were under attack. So, we learned that it disrupted whole system of\r\
    \nIT industries.</span></p><br></p>"
- desc: <p>it was very interesting lecture. there was two guests from the SaskTel.
    Lots of things I learned from the meeting. also, we discussed little bit about
    project proposal.</p>
- desc: <p>Today meeting 25, there is a sasktel guest came and talk. I have no question
    to ask for this meeting. It was great</p>
- desc: <p>The most important thing I learned at last meeting was to always be critical
    of products. It is important to know where they are coming from, why they were
    created, what they do, and potential problems and worries. It was hard for me
    to understand exactly some of the aspects of the 2 cyber security cameras and
    how the public good. I want to learn more about objects that I take for granted
    like security cameras, understand the need or or issues with them, and be more
    critical.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: '<p>The last class was about cyber attacks and their effects both politically
    and economically.&nbsp;</p><p>case study</p><p>company: SolarWinds</p><p>software:

- desc: <p>Having the presenters from SaskTel in class was very interesting. Getting
    to learn about the cyber attack was very cool and it peaked my interest about
    possibly choosing a career in cyber security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>We got the opportunity to listen to guest from sasktel who also are a management
    team of CIPS. They let us know what an employer look into new developer when they
    want to hire and how we need to improve ourselves everyday and learn. Then there
    was a presentation on solar storms which was inturn internet hacking and it was
    extremely interesting. It should how less secure we are in virtual world.</p>
- desc: "<p>Last class, we invite two guests from Sasktel.&nbsp;In this class, they\
    \ discussed cybercrime.&nbsp;The economic losses caused by cybercrime are countless.\
    \ How to effectively avoid cybercrime is also one of the most important issues\
    \ in the computer field.&nbsp;The new encryption system and security system are\
    \ very important.&nbsp;These are the areas that the computer science community\
    \ needs to focus on in the future.&nbsp;There is no completely secure system,\
    \ but frequent updates of security software can greatly reduce the probability\
    \ of being hacked\u3002</p>"
- desc: <p>In last Meeting we had a guest lecturer from Sasktel. One lectures gave
    us tips upon improving the resume and another lecturer Rick lee gave us a presentation
    on Cyber security, in which he discussed about Solar Winds Orion system whose
    system was attacked by hackers and data of the clients were compromised, this
    company had a clients like Department of homeland security and Treasury department
    and this attacked came into light much later.</p>
- desc: <p>&nbsp;Speaking about resumes as well as tasks is disappointing, I didn't
    expect this from IT industry. This is something we have to look for after graduating.
    I did find the subject regarding Data science to be intriguing. I would love to
    attend&nbsp;courses that teaches more about it<br></p>
- desc: One of our guest speakers mentioned that CIPS membership signified ethical
    conduct to them, as an employer. I was somewhat surprised by the extent of his
    trust in that designation - from what we've been told, members aren't tested on
    ethics, they just have to affirm that they will follow the code. This may work
    legally, but logically, does this really hold up? In an age when every computer
    user has learned to click "yes" on various user agreements without even reading
    what they're agreeing to, taking a user affirmation as proof of ethics knowledge
    and ethical conduct seems risky.<br>
- desc: <p>It was really good and I would like to appreciate your effort for bringing
    the guests from Sasktel who explained us what employer think before hiring what
    they need from us and how to apply. Moreover we learnt how unsecure it is that
    even someone can hack us while we are upgrading our software</p>
- desc: <p>In last meeting,&nbsp; We learned about the solar Wind Orion Breach. We
    learned that Russia was a suspect. Solar Winds contains all admin passwords. All
    Us business and government institution rely on this. We learned of the different
    types of attacks. It surprised me that Solar Winds server password was solarwind123.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting, we had guest speakers from SaskTel. They gave a presentation
    about the SolarWinds Supply Chain Cyber-Attack. Even though the presentation was
    good, I felt that we should have done this earlier in the semester. The last few
    lectures should've been used to clarify the doubts students had about the course
    contents and the final exam. However, having said that, the presentation did cover
    a number of topics relevant to the course. The guest also invited us to a tour
    of the SaskTel data-center in the city, and if this was done earlier in the lecture,
    we could have possibly had a chance to 'virtually' visit the data center.<br></p>
- desc: In this meeting, we had guests from SaskTel talk to us about the solar wind
    breach that happened last year. We were provided with the details on how this
    breach took place who was behind it and what loss did it do to the companies affected
    by it. It was a great talk. Thank you professor for bringing such guests to the
    class.
- desc: <p>I feel like you've really listened to me this semester. once again those
    guys were grate guest speakers and I learnt a lot from them for example proper
    way to build resumes, more about the CIPS program and so on. I was wondering how
    long we would have to do and submit the final exam ?.</p>
- desc: '<p>In the last lecture, we had the opportunity to meet with two guest speakers
    from SaskTel, Rick Lee and Trevor McDonald who are IT professionals in the field
    for&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">more than 25 years. They presented
    a lecture on the SUNSPOT which was attacked by implementing the malware in the
    system. The attacker tried to get in touch with the source code&nbsp;</span><span
    style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">and add malware to it, and the company who was going
    to launch an app will just see it as an update because they were not aware of
    the malware attack.</span></p>'
- desc: <p>We had an excellent meeting on the Solarwinds hack; today, we have digital
    forensic experts, we still have espionage and other cyber threat. Recently, we
    have espionage that is on Solarwinds company which is responsible for many things.
    It believed the Russian did it because of the similar tools they have to perform
    the espionage. So, Fireeye on Russia. Sunburst is the file name, and through it,
    it is the central part of this malware.<br></p>
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was about cyber
    attacks and cyber security. It was interesting to learn about the Russian cyber
    attacks on the Solar Winds data base. This presentation gave me some perspective
    on how valuable data bases are. I'd like to learn more about the advancement in
    cyber security and what the current threats are.<br>
- desc: <p>It was really an interesting and educative session with the IT Professionals
    from Sasktel&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you prof for creating this awesome opportunity
    for us to have these professionals in our midst.</p><p>I really learn a lot because
    my main interest in the field of information technology is in the aspect of Privacy
    and security.</p><p>It was a great session for me in the sense that I was able
    to understand some of the fundamentals of how security can be bridged and ways
    to prevent thefts from invading into our network.</p><p>I wished I could have
    more of this session&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully if we can have the recording for this
    meeting, it will be helpful.</p>
- desc: <p>It was good to learn about real world examples of where keeping security
    in mind while developing is of key importance, as well as some of the methods
    we have to be aware of. Often we are taught to "keep security in mind" but short
    of learning how to check for SQL injection at this point we haven't really learned
    how these things are executed. It also goes to show that even these massive companies
    can have the same issues, so no one is safe from attack.</p>
- desc: The talk about data security reminded me about a website called https://haveibeenpwned.com/
    which checks if your email has been compromised by a data breach. It is important
    to always keep an eye out for possible suspicious behavior from your account and
    always be acting securely online (such as changing passwords on the regular).
    This website is another tool that we can use to stay secure and hopefully minimize
    the damages that data breaches can cause (as data breaches are sometimes not relayed
    back to the people affected which of course is dangerous and careless). <br>
- desc: <p>In last class we talked about Sunspots with two guest lecturers Rick Lee
    and Trevor McDonald form SaskTel.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>In the last class we had two guest speakers, one was from sasktel and he
    talked about resume and jobs. The other was from CIPS and he mostly talked about
    hackers. The most important thing I learned from the class is when applying to
    jobs, we should try to not make our resumes longer than 3 pages.</p>
- desc: <p>I think we had one of-the most interesting lecture of the semester where
    we had two guest-speakers from SaskTel and one talked about SolarWinds-case where
    an Espionage which believed was from Russia against US that took last year and
    affected big tech-companies like Microsoft, Intel and many government-branches
    such as military and homeland security. It was interesting because it was first
    time I hard such a deep discussion about Espionage and how it takes place and
    I was surprised by how much planning and effort was put into it. On the other
    hand it was kind of scary because usually you believe updating your software will
    keep you out of harm but it was opposite in this case as these update resulted
    in breach in their system.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>Trevor MacDonald and Rick Lee, two highly qualified IT experts, hosted
    my last lecture. They disclosed information about a malware supply chain attack.
    Seeing two IT students succeed instills trust in our CS students.<br></p>
- desc: <p>In my last lecture, two well IT professionals, named Trevor MacDonald and
    Rick Lee were the host of the meeting.&nbsp;They gave information about supply
    chain attack on malware.&nbsp;Following their presentation, they became an inspiration
    to me.<br></p>
- desc: <p>The guest speaker was very informative. The topic about cyber warfare is
    definitely an interesting one. It is quite interesting that people can infiltrate
    large networks and stay undetected gathering information for long periods of time.
    The fact that every country does this kind of act, and it is done by governments
    is disturbing. It would be great if the world could share resources and information,
    then there wouldn't be a necessity for these kinds of attacks.</p>
- desc: <p>Meeting 25 was great and I got a lot of information about the work environment
    and also about hacking which was very good. Thank you, Dr. Hepting, for the insight
    and for inviting such great persons.</p>
- desc: <p>In meeting 25, we have a guest from&nbsp;SaskTel, who talks about the benefits
    and needs that SaskTel can bring to students.</p><p>SaskTel provides wired and
    wireless communication services, which can better bring convenience to people's
    lives.<br></p>
- desc: <p>In the last lecture our guest speaker Mr. Trevor McDonald from Sasktel
    told us about how to write a resume and what are the qualities that should be
    mentioned in the our resume. It was really nice informative talk about the job
    applications. Another guest speaker Mr. Lee who i guess was in technical department
    talked about cyber security and gave us a detail presentation on SolarWinds Orion.
    Overall I really enjoyed the presentation and lecture<br></p>

- desc: Last meeting was so interesting and amazing. Mr Trevor McDonald &nbsp;from
    SaskTel told us and guide us about how to make the resume and resume should not
    be more than 3 pages and, he also mentioned that what qualities we have to put
    in out resume. We also talked to Mr. Lee who is I guess from technical department
    he gave presentation on the Solar winds and also talked about cyber security as
    well and over all I really enjoyed the presentation.
- desc: 'Many data breaches are often the work of hackers. However, in my opinion,as
    a hacker, morality is fundamental, which often decides a hacker''s future and
    fate. If people start learning for fame or illegal profit, they can''t call it
    a hacker. However, the virtual network world can not be managed by the real norms,
    and hackers are the most eager for freedom and sharing in this virtual world. '
- desc: "<p><p>\r\nI enjoyed the presentation given by the guests from Sasktel. I\
    \ had\r\nheard about the major data breaches that occurred but didn\u2019t really\r\
    \nknow any of the specific details so it was interesting to learn a\r\nlittle\
    \ more about things like the Solarwinds exploit. It was also\r\ninteresting to\
    \ learn about the online security certification programs\r\nthat exist on sans.org\
    \ and comptia.org so kudos to whoever asked that\r\nquestion.</p><br></p>"
- desc: <p>in the last class meeting, we had a discussion on the topic as it is something
    quite different and interesting one class in that class we had two visitors, speakers,
    as they examined the work searchers as that how to assemble a solid resume apart
    from that the next topic is related to the solar winds as about the discovery
    about the SolarWinds and also about the victims of the attack so these are the
    important topic for me.</p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting, we had to guests from SaskTel this topic was very interesting
    because we were exploring very important topics like computer science students
    it was the global threatenings as serious issues nowadays. the problems of the
    security global the researcher showed us that there are so many different types
    of threats at the Web and historical threatening examples When the hacker knows
    your email address, he will have half of your confidential information, and all
    he needs now is the password. Hackers use several different methods to achieve
    this, and the most common is a phishing email.&nbsp;<br></p>
- desc: <p>I found the previous guest speaker talk very engaging and interesting.
    It was cool to hear about and see some of the things employees in the industry
    do and what they're concerned about. In my opinion both guest speaker lectures
    we had were very informative. It was nice to hear from a different perspective,
    especially someone currently working in the industry.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p></p><p>In the last meeting, we had two guest to have a discussion in our
    class. The way in which the recruiters pick a person for a job and the importance
    of a good resume was introduced in the class. We learned a good number of things
    from the guests and had a great time with them.</p><br>
- desc: <p><p>The past meeting was an interesting one. We had teo guest who took our
    class and explained different things. We learned how to build a perfect resume
    and the way the recruiters select them. The importance of presentation and knowledge
    matters the most. Overall, we got to know many things and enjoyed the class.</p><br></p>
- desc: <p>The guests from SaskTel in this lecture talked about the&nbsp;resume and
    the code of&nbsp;ethics from there own professional experience was really helpful
    for my future employment planning, thank you for holding this meeting!<br></p>
- desc: <p>I thought the presentation was extremely interesting. I was a bit confused
    at first as I wasn't at all sure what it actually was or what happened when they
    were going over who was involved and such, but it turned out to be a really awesome
    presentation. I did enjoy this presentation a great deal, it was probably my favourite
    of the semester and I'd like to look more into it all in my own time.&nbsp;They
    made a&nbsp; point that espionage was mostly normal and accepted which seemed
    odd to me considering the potential damage that could be caused. I also thought
    it was odd that the government seemed to be so public with the situation, but
    I guess that's just how it all is.</p>
- desc: "<p>In the last meeting we had a great time with Rick Lee and unfortunately\
    \ I can\u2019t recollect second personality\u2019s name cuz the way they explained\
    \ about the CIPS and what good achievement he got from working at SaskTel and\
    \ how we as future IT professionals would need various certificates or other requirements\
    \ to grab a good and deserving positions<span style=\"font-size: 0.9375rem; -webkit-text-size-adjust:\
    \ 100%;\">&nbsp;in IT industries.&nbsp;</span></p>"
- desc: <p>In the last class we had a discussion with two new guests. They provided
    information on CIPS and also provided their experience about their job. It was
    really fascinating to learn about hackers attack and the way they explained it,
    was really interesting.</p>
- desc: <p>In the last zoom meeting, we met two new guest in our class. I remember
    the name of one of them that is Rick Lee from Sasktel. I really found that interesting
    for me. Most important thing that i learn is that he taught us the right way to
    write our resume. What are the main requirements of a good resume.</p>
- desc: <p>Last class was the visit of Sasktel Official who gave us helpful information
    about the hiring of the people what all points are taken into consideration for
    the hiring process and we came to know that further in their hiring process having
    CIPS certification will be an asset .&nbsp;</p>
- desc: In last lecture, we have had an opportunity to dive into how cyber security
    is crucial to protect important files. Rick lee and mcdoland were representatives
    from sasktel. Rick lee illustrated the whole incident about solarwinds cyberattack
    and how the government was vulnerable from the attack. He also gave some insight
    about a website called sans.org, it is a website where one could learn about comptia
    security and many other courses. Overall, it was an amazing experience.&nbsp;
- desc: "<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-0d572be5-7fff-75d9-6624-e453eb193dc5\">I\
    \ have been eager to learn about cybersecurity for several years, so today\u2019\
    s class was especially engaging for me. I enjoyed learning about Rick Lee\u2019\
    s work as a Forensic Technology Investigator. I found his insight into getting\
    \ involved in the cybersecurity sector very valuable and will consider learning\
    \ from the online resources he mentioned. His presentation on SolarWinds was eye-opening,\
    \ showing me how essential security and multi-factor authentication is online.\
    \ This is something that I often do not regard with much importance on my own\
    \ online accounts. It also left me wondering how the tech companies detected the\
    \ mentioned cyberattacks.</span><br></p>"
- desc: Today meeting was conducted by the guest from Sasktel whose speech was very
    knowledgeable and informative. The speaker talked about the todays technologies
    and its risk as well as their rewards. Relating to our past meetings he also gave
    information about the ongoing circumstances and our study related information.
    He also talked about the Code of ethics when it comes to information technology.
    The code of ethics is most important in our software and information technology.
- desc: In last class, there were two visitors in our class and we discussed about
    work searches, expectations or assumptions for the appliers or recruiters and
    also creating effective resume. How things work in big organizations related to
    work. We also discussed about the SolarWinds, like how we can access this.<br>Even,
    SolarWinds is also software developer business in America.<br>overall, the class
    was totally awesome, it was great to meet the guests and to learn something new.<br>
- desc: <p>In the last meeting, meeting 255, a guest from Sasktel gave us a speech
    about how Sasktel chooses their employees, we need to have our skills very well
    and study hard. Also, the speech is showing how the network running for Sasktel,
    which is a great speech for us to learn more about Sasktel.</p>
- desc: <p>Excellent presentation by the guests. Not only did they shed light on a
    recent isssue regarding privacy and ethics, the employment tips were really useful.</p>
