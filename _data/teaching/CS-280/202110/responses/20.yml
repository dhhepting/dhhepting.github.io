- desc: What is professional certification? It is usually used to certify a person's
    professional quality in a certain field, and to obtain a certificate or license
    by passing an exam. In fact, many people immigrate to Canada every year. If they
    choose skilled immigrants, they often need a professional certification in this
    field to prove that they have professional standards. Professional certification
    is a very effective means to guarantee the professionalism of employees in all
    walks of life.
- desc: 'The most important thing I learned in this class was that a degree has more
    to it than just a degree. Before this class, I didn''t even know what CIPS was,
    let alone accreditation/certification/membership. Who knew that a UofR CS degree
    could provide us more qualifications automatically and help improve our credentials.
    I wonder if there is any other thing like CIPS we should be aware of. It would
    be helpful to have these titles when trying to enter the workforce and when writing
    an updated resume.

    '
- desc: In last lecture we talk to Thomas richard who came to explain us and give
    some information about CIPS accredited programs it is an educational program for
    universities and colleges so he explains us about it and give all answer about
    the questions we have so it was nice session and we get chance to learn about
    some new programs as well.
- desc: In this meeting, we had a presentation by CIPS Saskatchewan Vice President,
    Thomas Boxall. He introduced us to the certifications that CIPS offers and how
    it can be a good add on on our resume and CV. The AITP is a first-level certificate
    which will help students who want to continue their studies in the IT industry.
    It was a good, insightful presentation and helped me figure out the steps needed
    to put a foot in the IT industry.
- desc: I thought this presentation was interesting, as while many of us may know
    about different certifications you can get to add onto your resume, it was good
    to see what they can actually mean. It adds meaning to the string of letters you
    can see after names on job titles, as well as shows the benefits to being a part
    of these organizations or getting certifications, both connection wise and pay
    wise. It was also good to see that we can qualify for some of these with minimal
    extra effort on our end, just by having our program through the U of R automatically
    qualifies us for some.
- desc: in this meeting, we had a guest from CIPS. CIPs is Canada's association of
    IT Professionals. the guest was Mr Thomas Boxall. he explained to us the meaning
    of this organization, one of the interesting things I have learned that this association
    provides licencing/certification from CIPS (Canada's association of IT Professionals)
    for certain IT NOC for SINP (Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program). It is amazing
    to have this certificate in future and it only takes 2 years of experiences to
    get it plus it is recognized all over the world
- desc: During the presentation last class from the CIPS Vice-President, the main
    takeaway was that it is important to get a leg up on other competitors and applicants
    when applying for a job. With the additional accreditation that CIPS offers for
    our program, we're able to have access to a title that looks good on our resume
    and is appealing to future employers.
- desc: "Great to know about CIPS as I am about to graduate next year. Right now,\
    \ I am struggling with my job search. As long as there is something that can help\
    \ me to the next step, I am forever grateful.\nVery nice of Thomas for going through\
    \ the application process and answering all the questions. Free membership for\
    \ students is great. Lots of good questions that I didn\u2019t even think about."
- desc: In the last meeting we had a presentation on CIPS.
- desc: 'On last meeting, There is a speech by the CIPS manager, he introduce the
    CIPS program to us, The speech is talking about mainly the three program designations.
    CIPS stands for Canadian Information Processing Society, which is a national IT
    association of 10 Provincial regulators that license IT professionals in Canada
    and abroad. For AITP which is Associate Information Technology Professional (AITP)
    can be easily get by apply for it through the CIPS official website, another two
    required knowledge test. The benefits of getting the designation is: when apply
    for a job, the employer will see the title beside your name, it show you have
    more preference in computer science area and willing to deep study on that, with
    the designation you will have advantages on competition in IT jobs.'
- desc: 'Well there was no lecture that day so nothing so discuss but it was a great
    presentation and was knowledgeable!


    Thank you very much for organising!'
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was about the value
    of the CIPS certification. It was helpful to learn about the better job prospects
    and better pay that comes with the CIPS certification. I will definitely apply
    in my third year of studies. I would like to learn more about other certifications
    that could help my career.
- desc: We had a very interesting discussion at the last meeting. I liked to hear
    Richard. In all honesty, I was totally unaware of this professional designation
    before the previous lecture. However, I am now interested in it, and so I have
    surfed some websites to learn more. I believe this is a very positive step in
    making students knowledgeable of the opportunities. If you know that you want
    to be and how you achieve your destination, you will work accordingly and will
    succeed in accomplishing your dreams.
- desc: I learned quite a bit from the presentation and do plan on becoming a CIPS
    member and getting that designation. I wonder if all CS students get this presentation,
    because I had never before heard that the U of R's CS program was accredited.
    It is certainly a nice bonus to hear of.
- desc: 'In this meeting, we discussed many things and learned many of them with vice
    president of CIPS organization about the professional conduct and procedure for
    becoming a member. He discussed many things about how CIPS helps for getting good
    job and maintain you to be an important part of organization. We also learnt how
    CIPS suspends the members if they commit any internal or external IT crime.


    '
- desc: I would be interested in hearing more about cips from the employer side. The
    people with cips would obviously like to brag about how good it is. How do people
    employing across boards and within boards find cips on a resume if it makes a
    big difference or not.
- desc: In this meeting, we had a presentation explaining CIPS and its AITP designation.
    Something I worry about is not having the prerequisite experience to get hired
    after graduating. That's why I think it's nice that this class offers this information
    to get a potential leg-up on other applicants. Another example of the University
    doing this is changing the Comp-sci bachelors program to have two mandatory classes
    dedicated to software engineering (now that 476 is mandatory). So I'll give this
    AITP certificate a serious consideration if it will actually help me in the future.
- desc: We got to know about AITP. designation and how we become a member of CIPS.
- desc: I wasn't really interested in the job opportunity that was presented last
    class, especially since I'm only in my second year and it applies to after graduation
- desc: "meeting response\nin the last meeting, the professor introduce CIPS. So what\
    \ is CIPS? CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society) is the professional\
    \ association of IT professionals in Canada. Since 1958 CIPS has helped strengthen\
    \ the Canadian IT industry by establishing standards and sharing best practices\
    \ for the benefit of individual IT professionals and the sector as a whole. CIPS\
    \ represents thousands of members across the country as Canada\u2019s Association\
    \ of Information Technology Professionals. CIPS offers Networking opportunities,\
    \ Certification of IT professionals (I.S.P. and ITCP certifications), Accreditation\
    \ of IT Post-Secondary programs, a niche IT Job Board, a voice to government,\
    \ and represents Canadian IT professionals in international forums, encouraging\
    \ and facilitating on-going professional development and safeguarding the public\
    \ interest. And each province has a provincial body like our province CIPS, Saskatchewan."
- desc: In this lecture, Thomas Box, vice president of the CIPS Saskatchewan had a
    presentation about CIPS and the different designations offered by CIPS. He really
    had a good presentation and we got to know a lot about CIPS, designations offered
    (AIT, ISP, ICP), and what is the eligibility and how to apply for these designations.
    It was a great session and hope that professor arranges more sessions like this.
- desc: In last lecture, we talked about a couple of things out of which our major
    focus was on "Professional Designations". The term "Professional Designation"
    basically stands for "a stamp of approval". It means that you're professionally
    skilled for working in corporate world or your particular field of work.
- desc: The CIPS presentation by Thomas RM Boxall was very education. I learned about
    the three different designations AITP , I.S.P. and ITCP. I will definitely be
    applying for AITP before my graduation. I strongly believe having a designation
    such as AITP will help me land a job quicker.
- desc: Today was my first introduction to CIPS. Although I am not interested in IT,
    I find CIPS provision of job postings, mentoring programs, and networking opportunities
    to be very valuable as a student that will be entering the tech industry in a
    few years time; these resources are beneficial for helping students like myself
    develop the necessary skills to navigate the industry. Moreover, I find hope in
    computer professionals working towards CIPS membership and designation, which
    requires years of experience in the field and to uphold the CIPS Code of Ethics
    and Standards. It is important for us to honour a set of ethical standards in
    computing, as so heavily emphasized in this course.
- desc: The most important thing was to know how each device is connected to each
    other thru internet, although we have setup security for each links but there
    are still loop holes that needs to be resolved not only on devices but in networking
    as well
- desc: The most important thing I learned from the last meeting was the benefits
    of professional designations and the designations I can apply for. Although it
    wasn't too difficulty to understand, I am still unclear of the differences between
    the ISP, ATP, ISP, and ITCP regulations. I would enjoy learning more about the
    professional benefits that these designations provide. It seems a very simple
    task to apply and receive these designations, so I would love to learn more about
    what these designations signify. I have seen presentations or representatives
    of KIPS at job fairs and heard mention of mention them in high school. It was
    a very interesting presentation, and I will be strongly considering applying and
    acquiring a designation.
- desc: In our 20th meeting we discussed an optional computer science opportunity
    that will help us with finding jobs in our Computer science careers.
- desc: 'We discovered the 3 different classifications in CIPS presentation: AITP,
    I.S.P. and also ITCP. I am going to undoubtedly be making an application for AITP
    just before my graduation. I firmly feel having a classification like AITP will
    certainly assist me land a project quicker.'
- desc: In the last class, we discussed Cips (Canadian Information Processing Society).
    The definition of Cips is also explained and described in detail. The goals and
    significance set by Cips are very significant. We also focused on how to apply
    for Cips qualification and what is needed. Many questions have been answered
- desc: Having a professional designation for computing professionals would be a great
    idea! By using this designation you could control what a computing professional
    is capable. You can limit what is allowed by only letting people with the designation
    to be able to do things. This could forward ethical programming. This like a computing
    governing body that looks into the ethics of progamming and audits companies for
    their ethics would be a very good idea.
- desc: In previous meeting we had presentation about CIPS. The vice present from
    CIPS Saskatchewan explained how this CIPS course can be a good addition for student
    who want to build a career in IT profession. I never heard of this course before
    but now after the presentation I would really love to research more and have this
    addition to my resume for future benefit.
- desc: "On professional\
    \ designations\n\nWe had the chance to learn about CIPS, that provided a professional\
    \ designation of information technology to students and recent grades from the\
    \ computer science background. Much like an engineering degree carries the professional\
    \ designation as a professional engineer, this provides a similar mark of recognition\
    \ for IT professionals. It\u2019s also important in addition to taking this designation\
    \ to know the in\u2019s and out\u2019s of various information technology related\
    \ procedures. Managing databases, planning for network architecture, supplying\
    \ key organizational documents from the ground up all are valid requirements within\
    \ the field of IT. It\u2019s also interesting to note the relatively large network\
    \ of professionals operating in the same jurisdiction, making it yet another network\
    \ recent graduates and students can reach out to for future guidance or throwing\
    \ ideas."
- desc: 'Our guest speaker was highly interesting and provided a great connection
    between the classroom and our future work. In the days since I''ve been doing
    some reading on CIPS, and was struck by the difference in the organization''s
    status from one province to the next. While CIPS is legally recognized here in
    Saskatchewan as a self-regulating body, there are other provinces where this isn''t
    the case. This had me wondering: with remote work becoming increasingly popular
    with tech workers and companies, are there jurisdictional issues surrounding ethics
    enforcement where a member''s work crosses provincial boundaries? If a CIPS member
    does something unethical while working remotely for a company in a province where
    CIPS is not legally recognized as a regulatory body, do different rules apply?'
- desc: In this meeting we just listened the lecture delivered by the guest and asked
    him questions. It was interesting
- desc: The last lecture about AITP is really helpful for me, thank you for holding
    the lecture.
- desc: In the last meeting we had a Guest lecturer, who is currently Vice president
    of CIPS Saskatchewan. He told us about the certificates CIPS provides and the
    opportunity we will get by getting to enroll in this program. He also told us
    about the CIPS membership, which has jobs exclusively available to CIPS members.
    Overall, it was a great experience, and I came to know about lots of new things.
- desc: In meeting 20, we have a presentatiion about CIPS, which proviides us an oppotunitity
    to have a job after we graguate from universiity.
- desc: Meeting 20 was very informative about professional designations. I want to
    thank Dr. Daryl Hepting for giving us the early opportunity to learn about CIPS.
    I hope to get my certification soon.
- desc: In the past meeting, we had a presentation from guest "Thomas Box" VP of CIPs
    (Canadian Information Processing Society). Before this class I didn't had any
    idea about CIPs certification as I am almost about to graduate this certificate
    will help to get a job in IT profession.
- desc: "I appreciate that Thomas took the time to outline the AITP designation, but\
    \ the IT world is the last thing that I am concerned about or even remotely interested\
    \ in. I fail to see how maintaining a designation is worth the commitment of renewals\
    \ every 3 years, and the potential of a marginal pay raise after investing so\
    \ much in a Computer Science Degree. I can\u2019t help but think about the ethics\
    \ of obtaining and maintaining certifications. I was reminded of the conversions\
    \ in earlier lectures pertaining to Blog Entry 2, of how some companies may claim\
    \ to serve the public interest only to serve themselves or the system."
- desc: In this meeting. We listened to a guest lecturer and asked him some question.
    It was good. However, i got lost in middle of a the lecture. I guess i get the
    most of it. Overall it was good for a change.
- desc: about the cips, I want to join it. But I concern about am I able to pass the
    program. Because my grade is not high at all, and the talker said it can use in
    any country. It like an international pass, I'm afraid the program is hard. So
    I decide to not join the program
- desc: In today's meeting the lacturer thomas was a good impression and I acknowledge
    the tcp connection, it was nice to know about the membership of kips and how it
    can help in the near future for the opportunities
- desc: I think CIPS certification has certain benefits for computer science majors.
    After the CIPS certification, This certification will be of great help in our
    future work and more in-depth study of computers. Second, CIPS certification helps
    show students CIPS members' views on IT industry opportunities and the importance
    of professionalism, ethics, and continuous career development. Although I want
    to apply for this certification, I may not be able to participate for some personal
    reasons.
- desc: The most important thing I learned was that Kips is not equivalent to a degree,
    it is a designation. What a designation tells employers is that you are on the
    path to becoming an IT professional. Meaning that one has gone through the training
    of an accredited program and you have gained the knowledge necessary to to be
    considered an IT professional within their eyes.
- desc: I think the guest speaker was grate and I have already registered to become
    a member of the organization. it would be nice if we could have another guess
    speaker before the end of the semester.
- desc: In this meeting we a had Thomas Boxall from Sask CIPS as our guest who give
    us useful information about AITP, ISP and ITCP. I think it was very helpful to
    have him because he give us useful information such as that we have to personally
    apply for AITP designation before graduation as it's not done automatically. I
    think we shouldn't have to apply for AITP designation ourselves and it should
    be done automatically by the institution that we graduate from as these will help
    us find jobs easier in the future.
- desc: In last lecture we had a great discussion with gentlemen from CIPS. That session
    was having lots of information regarding student's career and Their future planning.
    Will excited to attend some session like this.
- desc: The most important thing I learned in the class was about CIPS organization.
- desc: Really informative about job searching and certification and i really liked
    it but it was just for bachelor student so would be more nice if something was
    for diploma students as well.But really nice session
- desc: 'In the last lecture, there was a guy named Thomas who was there in the class
    meeting discussed all about the CIPS he also taught that how to receive the CIPS
    certificate and what important role does it plays.

    It was a very informative secession and if possible it would be great if there
    are secessions like this.'
- desc: The class was about CIPS seminar and it was an informative session. I learnt
    about how to get an extra credential as a computer science graduate.
- desc: the last class I learnt about cips, I also learnt about different types of
    certifications available
- desc: The CIPS representative enhanced the information about the designation of
    DIPS and how important is it to enroll in CIPS as a member and accomplish the
    certificates that he mentioned. He also inclined more how it would help you to
    be one step closer to get a job.
- desc: The last meeting was pretty simple. We discussed and learned about ISP, CIPS
    and their application process long with other stuff that will be helpful for us
    to get professional standards.
- desc: In the last discussion , we attended a virtual presentation by mips sask.
    I gotta know about the eligibility of their certification to diploma and degree
    students.
- desc: Last meeting we talked about AITP designation. I learned that this is important
    and advantageous when applying to jobs. Certification is based on the completion
    of a cs degree. With this the holder is able to have access to CIPS. I also the
    process of acquiring the free certification.
- desc: In the last class meeting, we had a meeting with Thomas Richard (co-host)
    he gave us information about the computer-related fields about the CIPS as the
    description of the courses like the accredited programs and membership registration,
    and personal certifications for work like how to apply for that and more information
    about these all in detail. as it is the kind of virtual presentation by MIPS sask.
    it was nice meeting with him. we got a lot of knowledge.
- desc: I was unable to attend thursday, i sent you an email telling you why. I do
    have some questions though, did anyone hear anything amazing during Thursday,
    or was it informational? i hope i can check out the log file when i get time,
    it was defiantly something amazing to look forward to.
- desc: In class we were visited by a guest speaker who brought up a company in which
    students like us could seek employment for once we are out of the computer science
    field. I don't have much to say on this topic as if you attended the lecture it
    was pretty self explanatory but one question i do have is how hard it is to get
    into this company. What is the percentage of people who get accepted?
- desc: Cips is a good introduction to the computer professional society... it helps
    build good professional relation of a computer graduate and improve the job society
    at large
- desc: In this class, we mainly completed the introduction of CIPS and the explanation
    of how to apply for the membership. We listened to whether the membership of CIPS
    would provide extra points for students majoring in CS in their future resumes.This
    is a constraint on the ethics of the computer industry.
- desc: "In the last class we had a guest speaker talking about cips explaining what\
    \ its all about as well as how the certification program takes only 2 years and\
    \ is very recognized worldwide\_\n"
- desc: 'CIPS (Canadian Information Processing Society) is a federation which provides
    many services to IT professionals in Canada. They provide certifications to IT
    professionals: the AITP, ISP, and ITCP designations. These certifications tell
    employers that the certified member follows a code of ethics and has a high level
    of knowledge and ability. They also provide accreditation of university programs
    which allows students from accredited universities to have a fast track to ISP
    and ITCP designations. Lastly, they provide a job board for IT professionals to
    find work.'
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we got to know more about CIPS an national IT association.\
    \ Other professor talk about it in details and guided us through how can we apply\
    \ and what all are the requirements and qualifications you need to apply. It was\
    \ a knowledgeable meeting."
- desc: In the past lecture, we had a guest in our class. He made us introduce to
    different topics such as professional designations and CIPS and I learned a good
    number of things related to computing. Hope to know about more new things in next
    lectures.
- desc: In the last class, we had a guest speaker discussing about AITP designation.
    The pre-professional Associate Information Technology Professional designation
    and Candidate Membership is the first step to obtaining Professional I.S.P. status.
    AITP holders have recently completed a relevant IT University or College education
    program, but do not yet have the required experience for the Professional I.S.P.
    designation. It is the primary qualification for the I.S.P. and ITCP Designations,
    which gets you access to CIPS and their resources.
- desc: 'In the last meeting, we had the professor introduce us to CIPS the Canadian
    Information Processing Society. It acts as a society of people who establish a
    standard for best practice for IT professionals.

    It can be a great skill to acquire and to add it to our skill set.'
- desc: In the past meeting, the idea of professional designations was introduced
    in the class by the guest. It was a good experience as I got to learn different
    things from him. The idea of CIPS was also a good thing to know about. Overall,
    it was a great experience.
- desc: I thought it was really valuable to learn about the CIPS membership and the
    benefits involved. I'm curious to do a bit more research to see what the value
    is for members and whether or not it's worth the yearly membership but I appreciate
    that my schooling is enough for the certification process and I very much appreciate
    an accountability process for members. I'd love to know more about the many types
    of certifications available out there to expand my options as a future computer
    professional and how CIPS stands up compared to those other certifications.
- desc: In last lecture we discussed about CIPS organization, we had an interesting
    session with Richard
- desc: Richard was the host of the previous meeting. CIPS was something different
    and fascinating that I heard about.
- desc: the last zoom meeting was delivered by the guest named Thomas Richard i really
    found it interesting for myself. As he taught us the information about the computer
    related fields especially about the CIPS as the description of course like accredited
    programs.
