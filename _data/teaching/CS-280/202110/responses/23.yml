- desc: "<p>The main thing we\r\ndiscussed today was a court case between Google and\
    \ Oracle. What I\r\nlearned from this is how difficult the ethics of computer\
    \ science can\r\nbe: If you don't have enough technical knowledge in a specific\
    \ area,\r\nit can be very difficult to make an ethical decision about who was\
    \ in\r\nthe right or wrong in a related situation.&nbsp; This could be\r\npartially\
    \ why the ethics of computer science are lagging behind in\r\nterms of laws and\
    \ regulations.\r\n</p>"
- desc: In this meeting we discussed about the the google vs oracle matter and we
    their were many different opinion on those. I personally think that sometimes
    companies use code of developers without the developers knowing which arises such
    kind of matters. In addition, we also discussed about the format of final exam.<br><br>
- desc: <p>This meeting was quite interesting. We discussed about the exams and its
    format.&nbsp; We also discussed how usage of codes from other developers arise
    the matter of conflict between companies. Great example is goggle which used code
    from oracle without their consent but google said that they asked and paid sun
    to get that algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>We continued our discussion on AMC code of ethics in this class, specifically
    the discussion about the principle 1.5 relating to intellectual property rights.
    We discussed in the context of recent court ruling in Google V. Oracle case in
    favour of Google. A lot of people were of the opinion that Google's use of Java
    API was more or less fair use as Java API has traditionally been open source and
    there are millions of lines of Java code available online. Moreover, Google created
    a open source OS (Android) using Linux (with GNU license) and used Java in that
    process, thus popularizing Java even more and increasing it's reach.</p>
- desc: <p>In a MIT article concerning the expanding ethics of computer science there
    was an interesting perspective posed - as the possibilities and implications of
    technology continues to grow, the ethical responsibilities, morals, and laws surrounding
    the possible challenges new to grow with it. I noted on the ACM Code of Ethics
    site that the most recent update was made in 2018 following the last update in
    1992. It seems that the possibilities for new technology in the recent years is
    growing exponentially, so would it be necessary for the Code of Ethics to be reviewed
    more frequently than once every 26 years?</p>
- desc: <p>One thing I would like to learn more about is who is making the rulings
    (like Oracle vs Google ruling). One thing I fear with computer science legal rulings
    is that those who are making decisions may not be qualified to do so. The rulings
    made today may forever impact the landscape of the future of computer science.
    We should not let those who are uninformed/uneducated in computer science make
    decisions upon things they don't understand. If we do, we risk the future of computer
    science in layman's hands, and that is very risky/dangerous.<br></p>
- desc: We discussed the final exam today which was nice, good to know ahead of time
    what to expect and so far I've enjoyed researching and writing the blog posts
    so I hope it goes well.&nbsp;<br><br>The discussion today was good as well but
    I think cases between major corporations are always extra messy. I believe Dayne
    Blair had mentioned she wondered what would happen between two smaller developers
    which I definitely agree with. I think code does need credit, but I also know
    the importance of sharing tools to benefit everyone. It can be a hard line, just
    have to not get too greedy.<br>
- desc: <p>Hello just wanted to ask if you can update a section which states information
    of the final exam in brief that would be great. I know you explained a bit in
    lecture but still if you can do that will be very helpful. Thank you so much!</p>
- desc: "<p><p>\r\nThe Google vs Oracle case makes me realize how much you need to\r\
    \nunderstand about technology to even understand the basics of the\r\ncase. The\
    \ case is quite complicated and neither side is entirely in\r\nthe right or wrong.\
    \ On one hand the developers who created the APIs\r\nused by Google should receive\
    \ credit and compensation but on the\r\nother hand, Oracle as an entity isn\u2019\
    t really responsible for\r\ncreating these APIs considering they were developed\
    \ by Sun prior to\r\nbeing purchased by Oracle.</p><br></p>"
- desc: <p>I&nbsp; think people should be paid in some form or the other when their
    code gets used in another code. A lot of work is done while creating a code so
    it should not be used without some reference or payment to the original creeator.</p>
- desc: "<p><p>Well for the topic that we thought of is quite an interesting one we\
    \ mostly focused on google vs Oracle. The thing about this thing is that honestly\
    \ we do need to be careful with it yes google did use fair use code but they should\
    \ still credit where the code came from. Like if that\u2019s not happening then\
    \ oracle should win the court case they are not being credited with that system.\
    \ Honestly if it is free that gives no excuses for not citing the source like\

- desc: <p><b id="docs-internal-guid-efa60f8d-7fff-dff7-5be8-32fdbdb22b36"><br><p
    dir="ltr">In the class, we talked about scandals committed by the tech companies
    in one of which was the lawsuit between Google and Oracle. Oracle was the company
    that owns the programming language Java, and it accused Google of using their
    code to build the earlier stage of the android operating system. This lawsuit
    has been going on for decades. Google said that the code is the part of the API
    that constituted fair use and on the other hand the company oracle claims that
    it was under copyright to use the bits of code in their API. The decision can
    shape how future technology can be made.&nbsp;</p></b><br><br></p>
- desc: <p>Computer ethics are very important. This code is intended to encourage
    and guide the ethical conduct of all computer professionals, whether current practitioners,
    students or anyone concerned. This regulation covers a wide range of content,
    in a word, the hope is to promote a healthy computer environment, for the user
    to use escort.<br></p>
- desc: <p>The argument of being able to use other peoples code for creativity is
    pretty tough line. We seemed to all agree on compensation if you used someone
    else's stuff is needed. The problem I find is who decides whats fair? If I make
    something and someone else uses it and I think I deserve more compensation then
    they are giving me and they think that they have paid enough who gets to decide
    who is right?</p>
- desc: <p>The way I see it, an appropriate acknowledgment of authorship of part of
    a program is acknowledgement and credit to the author in the documentation of
    the program. If a license was purchased to produce the code in question, then
    financial compensation was already provided to create/use the code.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting, we discussed about the multibillion-dollar case between
    Google and Oracle. The supreme court gave its decision in favor of Google and
    I think that was right because Google had used the code that was not under any
    Copywrite. Later we were also asked to get opinions from each other about the
    same in the breakout rooms.</p>
- desc: <p>Overall for this meeting I had a lot of trouble wrapping my head around
    the context involved in our discussion of Google vs. Oracle. I'm not sure what
    API code is and in order to really understand how severe the theft was I feel
    like I need to know that, especially the use of the code that was lifted from
    Oracle. <br></p><p>In general, copyright disputes make my head spin and so it's
    difficult for me to even understand the line between fair use and copyright infringement.
    <br></p>
- desc: The last meeting discussion was about&nbsp; the older topic that is code of
    ethics. we looked at some major points like respect privacy and&nbsp; respect
    the work required to produce new ideas, computing artifacts and so on. in addition,&nbsp;
    the breakout room topic was also on above discussion; ACM code of&nbsp; ethics
    1.5 and google v. oracle. Though, this class's breakout room was quite interesting
    to participate as we discussed about privacy breach in different ways, now a days
    and how to value those who expend the effort to create new ideas and inventions.
    i think govt. should participate actively in these matters in order to maintain
    the give and take for inventors and users.
- desc: <p>The last class conversation was about&nbsp; code of ethics . we saw some
    significant focuses like the point 1.5 respect&nbsp; the work needed to produce
    new ideas, inventions, creative works and computing artifacts.&nbsp; The breakout
    room point was&nbsp; on above conversation; ACM code of morals 1.5 and google
    v. oracle. However, this present class' breakout room was very fascinating to
    take an interest as we examined about breach of codes in an unexpected way, and
    how to esteem the individuals who consume the push to make groundbreaking thoughts
    and innovations.&nbsp; what i think is that inventors should pay for their work
    by initializing some royalty program or else and authorities can be the best mode
    to encourage these creators by providing some benefits.<br></p>
- desc: "<p><p>While\r\nit is very important for people to be credited for their work\
    \ and paid for the\r\ntime and effort they had put into something, so much of\
    \ the internet and\r\neveryday software we uses relies on API\u2019s from other\
    \ companies, that if this\r\ncase was to go the other way, would set a very dangerous\
    \ president for future\r\nlawsuits. This case was especially interesting, as at\
    \ least to my knowledge,\r\ngoogle had re-implemented the code of said API\u2019\
    s, but kept the package names\r\nthe same so developers don\u2019t have to re-implement\
    \ their java code. While some\r\ncode was kept the same to ensure functionality\
    \ remains. This is especially\r\ninteresting since Oracle didn\u2019t even initially\
    \ develop Java, Sun did, and\r\nOracle acquired them in 2009.</p><br></p>"
- desc: <p>In the last meeting we discussed about final exam format. Also discussed
    little bit about the code of ethics. We discussed about code of ethic rules and
    also talked about google vs oracle in the breakout room.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
- desc: '<p>The dispute revolves around the use of portions of the APIs for the Java
    programming language, owned by Oracle, in early versions of the Android operating
    system by Google. "Google has acknowledged the use of APIs ..." It sounds like
    a win for Oracle. Oracle owns Java, Google admits it used 11,500 lines of Java
    code - Google was supposed to get a license from Java to do so. But don''t take
    our word for it too seriously - take Google''s words. Email where Google admits
    to stealing intellectual property to create Android: The lawyers defending Google
    against the patent and copyright lawsuit filed by Oracle are desperately trying
    to keep the email of a particular engineer out of the public eye, but it appears
    unlikely that they will succeed.<br></p>'
- desc: <p>Ethics in every environment can be a very difficult matter to define sometimes.
    Different people might interpret certain statements that could be listed in some
    organization's code of ethics. Certain members might also have different views
    in terms of priorities when it comes to their profession, which could also affect
    the definition of ethics to some degree.</p>
- desc: "<p></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In past\r\nmeeting we talk about the code\
    \ of ethics. It was about positive term on\r\ndefining behavior norm in computer\
    \ professions. We also spoke a bit about the\r\nfinal exam. Professor will provide\
    \ more information in next class about it.\r\nThen we had a breakout room about\
    \ google vs oracle and ACM code of ethics 1.5 (</span>Respect\r\nthe work required\
    \ to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and\r\ncomputing artifacts).\
    \ So, it was basically related to google controversy.&nbsp; If you use someone\
    \ work then you should give\r\nthe credits to them or take their permission before\
    \ use their work. Especially\r\nif you are using someone\u2019s\u2019 work to\
    \ earn fame or money then definitely should\r\ngive the credit to that person,\
    \ otherwise that can consider a serious crime. </p><br><p></p>"
- desc: '&nbsp;In the last lecture, we discuss the pattern for the final exam. and
    also discuss the code of ethics. so, the purpose of the ACM code of ethics is
    known that ACM reinforces the processing calling''s aggregate voice through solid
    initiative, advancement of the best expectations, and acknowledgment of specialized
    greatness. ACM upholds the expert development of its individuals by giving freedoms
    to long-lasting learning, vocation advancement, and expert systems administration.'
- desc: "<p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">We learned\r\nmany things in this meeting, I was\
    \ self-taught about the word copyright. This\r\nword seems to be simple to see\
    \ but difficult to understand. The Copyright is\r\nsomething that reveals that\
    \ one cannot break any privilege and copy or do\r\nsomething congruent that matches\
    \ with other product or any application or device.\r\nSo, in short one cannot\
    \ copy others\u2019 work and claim that to be theirs. Since, I learned\r\nmany\
    \ disputes, likely between Samsung and Apple Inc. The Apple Inc, claimed about\
    \ how Samsung\r\ncopied their iPhone prototype. Since, in the end Samsung were\
    \ proved guilty. </span></p><br></p>"
- desc: <p>At the last meeting, we've talked about our final exam questions and topics,
    Also, some extended information on computing ethics, Dr. Hepting has shown us
    the website of the ACM code of ethics, and he emphasizes some really important
    codes such as 2.8&nbsp;Access computing and communication resources when we access
    the computing and communications, we should it only meets the public goods, I
    think that's very correct since the computing professionals always serve the public.
    and we have a separate group to discuss this topic. each of the members offered
    good ideas about the public goods service methodologies. Overall, this is a meaningful
    meeting.</p>
- desc: <p>In the last meeting we discused about how final exam is going to happen.In
    the break out room we discussed about the ACM code of ethics on google vs Oracle
    case. In this case I think that Google was ethically right for using this API's
    as they were publically available. In my opinion Google had not harmed any ACM
    code of ethics.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>Reflecting on the Google v. Oracle ruling it is rather hard to digest.
    While it is good that Google ultimately had the ruling in their favor, I do not
    feel that this is a definitive win for computer professionals as ultimately this
    was a squabble between two large corporations. While copyright and protections
    on work is important in the long term it seems to be more of a hinderance than
    beneficial, especially to computer science. In my opinion computer science should
    be collaborative and open-source. If someone has already devised some algorithm
    to do <i>x</i>, why waste the time trying to re-invent the wheel?</p>
- desc: <p>The topic focused on google vs Oracle. Google need to credit their code
    sources.&nbsp;if that's not occurring after that oracle must win the lawsuit they
    are not being attributed with that said system. Truthfully if it is cost-free
    that provides no excuses for not citing the resource like if you don't then you
    should<br></p>
- desc: "<p><p>In the past meeting, we discussed about the code of ethics\r\nin which\
    \ we had a discussion about google getting a law suite from oracle for\r\nusing\
    \ their code and not giving them a credit. We also had a breakout room in\r\n\
    which we further discussed about google vs oracle. We also discussed a bit\r\n\
    about the final exam but professor will provide more details in next class. &nbsp;</p><br></p>"
- desc: In last class we discussed &nbsp;the previous class topic about code ethics.
    Breakout room discussions on respect privacy and respecting the work, ACM code
    of ethics 1.5 and google v.Different ways of privacy breach and to respect the
    one's who put forward new ideas and do hardwork. Also, this should be the priority
    of government to balance the give and take between the inventors and tech users
- desc: <p>The concept about code of ethics ACM was the topic that was more interested
    to me, it states the responsibility that a person need to consider while working
    on the computers or any services provided it has contributed to the internet society
    and their well beings</p>
- desc: <p>In the last class, we deeply discussed the issue of the ethics and professional
    code of conduct of the Computer Association. I deeply realized the importance
    of this criterion.&nbsp;If my future work is computer-related, I will strictly
    abide by these rules<br></p>
- desc: <p>In the last class meeting we had a discussion about the code of ethics
    which we discussed already before that In this we talked about the respect of
    privacy, respect of hardworking. Apart from that we also discussed this topic
    in BRooms. Though this class BRooms was interesting one. As we participated in
    BRooms and then discussed the same issue in group as about the privacy and all.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>We discussed in meeting that can we use other person software or not, according
    to me that, their should not any restriction to use any other software, everyone
    should be able to use, but credit should be given to creator.</p>
- desc: <p>The US Supreme Court ruled that Google has won the decade-long copyright
    dispute. Google's use of the code from Oracle to develop the Android operating
    system is legal and does not infringe copyright. As Google indicated earlier,&nbsp;there
    is no copyright protection for the basic, non-creative programming code such that
    the code cannot be rewritten in any other way. The Supreme Court's decision is
    a boost for tech companies and software developers. While the decision will not
    change the way of copying code and protecting copyright, it recognizes how it
    is currently operating, which will be good for innovation in the tech industry.<br></p>
- desc: <p>I am interested to learn more about why codes of ethics are not followed
    as seriously as they probably should be in the tech industry, and what we can
    do to make them more like rules rather than guidelines. In some cases is it a
    good thing that they&nbsp; are followed more like guidelines than rules?</p>
- desc: <p>The last lecture, in my view, was crucial because we discussed the format
    of the final test. I suppose it was something that made us feel more comfortable
    and relaxed during our tests. Also, I liked the idea of taking the exam at home
    because it allows us to think and respond rather than only answering questions
    in a rush. I am pretty confident that it would lead to significant improvements
    and positive results.<br></p>

- desc: <p>From our previous discussion regarding the ACM code of ethics 1.5 and google
    v. oracle, I think that the reason why oracle did that was because they saw Google
    making money with what they have made using snippets of code from oracle. If oracle's
    purpose for having the code to be open to everyone they should not expect any
    credit. I think giving credit to others is really based on how ethical those individual
    are. But we should not expect everyone to give credit to work that has been made
    available for everyone. Otherwise, people who care so much about getting the credit
    should keep their stuff not open to the public.</p>
- desc: <p>I don't the break out rooms are helping because no one wants to ever communicate
    even when I try initiate conversation. And can you tell us if we will be using
    prototrack for the final exam and discuss it's content!.</p>
- desc: <p>In the last class we talked a bit about our final exam and we were put
    into breakout rooms to talk about ACM code of ethics 1.5 and google v.oracle.
    I would like to learn more about copyrighting and intellectual property when it
    comes to the use of softwares by different companies.</p>
- desc: <p>This meeting was very interesting as we talked about the software ethics
    code in google versus oracle scandal. Software engineers should take care of public
    interests( for both employers and client).&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was about copyright
    in the tech industry. With the advancement in technology, plagiarism is a major
    issue in all fields. Google v. Oracle was an interesting case for discussion.
    I agree with other students that even if you waive all of your rights to your
    work, you should be paid if someone is making money off of your work. I'd like
    to learn more about the legal side of copyright in the tech industry.</p>
- desc: In meeting 23, we talk about the law addresses the aspirations and practices
    of computer professionals and expresses their professional conscience.
- desc: <p>Ethical programming is a must in a society that is ever changing. Companies
    need to be held accountable for their products and code towards the greater good.
    If any ethical issues come up there should be investigations and consequences.
    We can't allow companies to get away with things, or else it sets a precedent
    for other companies.</p>
- desc: <p>In the meeting, we learned about the code of ethics that positive nature
    for defining behavioural norms for professionals and usability designs different
    systems that are not secured. Sometimes, in computing professions, things need
    principles to handle understandable errors. If the creator launches new something,
    then the credit goes to the creator in the form of copyright, but the software
    is free and open-source in the public domain, then computing professionals should
    not claim it.</p><p>In the discussion room, we talked about the ACM code of ethics
    and Google Vs Oracle?Oracle sued Google, and software patents are more important
    for some people.</p><p>:)</p>

    \ of the code of ethics could you break if things fall into the right place.</p>"
- desc: I believe google should pay programmer of oracle if the programmer has sold
    its copyrights. Because if programmer java didnt pay for what he built nor google
    and use it i believe its not fair
- desc: <p>In the meeting we discussed about the scandal between oracle and google
    and the code of ethics in the issue. According to our group in breakout room,
    we discussed that the hard work of the programmer of oracle and they have the
    right to get what they deserve. So the decision on favour of google might discourage
    programmers to work hard.<br></p>
- desc: <p>Today in class professors gave a brief explanation &nbsp;about the final
    exam and then we talked in detail about the code of ethics. All students were
    very much involved in this discussion.</p>
- desc: <p>In our last class we discussed code of ethics again a bit. Specially ACM
    code of ethics and its updates. We also talked about the final exam, the monopoly
    of google, the strain between google and their unothorized use of software. In
    the breakout room we talked about ACM ethics 1.5, that mostly deals with plagiarism</p>
- desc: <p><p>Google used oracles database and made money. Google got the idea of
    making money through that but initially it was of no use but when google made
    money then oracle claimed . Supreme Court favoured google and I think that correct
    as there were not any copyrights . Google should have given some credits in this
    case though .</p><br></p>

    ethics discussion we had in our breakout rooms. Thanks, Dr for the opportunity
    to share my ideas with my classmates.</p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting we learned more about the Oracle and Google case and I
    was mostly surprised to learned how difficult and time consuming it is to solve
    a dispute if it is not solved quickly and off the court room. This&nbsp; case
    tell us that as a programmer we should try to be professional and avoid from copying
    others work but in the same time I think it is important that if an issue arise
    we should try our best to solve it between ourselves because once it hit the court
    room it could take decades before we get a result and most importantly it will
    cost us lots of resources and capital which we could have used to invest on new
    projects.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: "<p><p>I am not well versed in writing code yet, but after reading\r\nthe\
    \ article of the case between Google and Oracle, I feel I lean more towards the\
    \ idea of not being able to copyright code. We all draw inspiration from each\
    \ other and should\r\nadapt a more open-source concept to inspire and fuel innovation.</p></p>"
- desc: In this meeting we discussed about principle 1.5 of the ACM Code of Ethics
    which states that the creators of ideas and innovations need to be credited properly
    in order to protect the intellectual property and protecting the author's original
    work. I agree with the point the credit should be given where credit is due, however
    there should be no limitations to the use of an author's work to bring about improvements
    and better implementations. This requires a better and stricter law regarding
    intellectual proprietorship and what constitutes as an ethical use of another
    author's work.<br>
- desc: In the last class i enjoyed the discussions had in the breakout rooms and
    one thing that stood out to me was talking about how the code used in another
    software and then mixed with some other code and changed a bit could maybe be
    claimed as something different. Personally I think that it can be claimed as something
    different however, credit should be given to the code referenced.
- desc: "<p>In the last class, we continued the discussion on same topics \u2018Code\
    \ of Ethics\u2019. We further discussed about the case between Google vs Oracle.\
    \ We discussed how they pursued the case in court and the outcome of case. In\
    \ the breakout rooms, we further discussed about the privacy and how some of the\
    \ companies breach their customer\u2019s privacy which goes against the code of\
    \ privacy .</p>"
- desc: "<p>In the class, we talked about scandals by tech companies. We have seen\
    \ a lot about privacy in our past classes, but there are many scandals where people\
    \ have trusted the company to make revolutionary technology but didn\u2019t promise\
    \ to fulfill it. One of those was Theranos. It was a 9 million dollar scam by\
    \ Elizabeth Holmes. She wanted to make something that would detect the blood sample\
    \ and make antibiotics, but she didn\u2019t fulfill her promise. It is our duty\
    \ as engineers to make people trust in technology that they cant understand and\
    \ not scam them or else people will lose trust in engineers and we would never\
    \ get funding to make great technologies.<br></p>"
- desc: '<p>In the last class, we discussed the scandals and scams by tech companies.
    We learned about many things on privacy in our regular class&nbsp;</p><p>but there
    are many scandals done by many companies in the IT world where people have trusted
    the companies with everything but the companies failed to</p><p>keep that trust.</p><p>One
    of the scandals is by John Carreyrous bad blood in Silicon Valley, he builds up
    the whole company and also partnerships with other companies&nbsp;<span style="font-size:
    0.9375rem;">on the promises of the technology which does not exist. He not only
    fooled the companies but also their employees and the people as the users who&nbsp;</span><span
    style="font-size: 0.9375rem;">were waiting for the final products.</span></p><p>There
    are many such scandals going around in the world that we don''t know about.</p>'
- desc: <p>We faced a issue logging in UR courses and then we discussed about code
    ethics on CIPS, even discussed on the format for our final exam and how long it
    has to be and date should be as per syllabus or a day prior.</p>
- desc: "<p><b id=\"docs-internal-guid-50674b64-7fff-35c5-c3bc-5102c27ca424\"><p dir=\"\
    ltr\">In the class, we talked about some scandals that are committed by the tech\
    \ giants. Sometimes the CEO of these tech giants promises great technology with\
    \ the people\u2019s money and they fail to deliver it. The same was for CEO&nbsp;\
    \ Adam Neumann. He hyped up the company WeWork with the ideas to make revolutionary\
    \ space and even wegrow as a school to change the schooling system and the company\
    \ was valued at 9 billion dollars. It was the second most valued startup after\
    \ uber on paper. They couldn\u2019t live up to peoples\u2019s promises and they\
    \ wasted people\u2019s money.&nbsp;</p></b><br><br></p>"
- desc: <p>The most important things we disscussed in the class was about oracle vs
    google that is the lawsuit about the nature of the computer code and its copyright.</p>
- desc: <p>In my opinion, the last lecture was crucial because we explored the structure
    of the final exam. It was probably something that made us feel more relaxed. In
    addition, taking the exam at home appealed to me because it helps to think and
    worry less.&nbsp;Personally, I believe the take-home exam would yield positive
    results.<br></p>
- desc: The case of google being a monopoly is a wild thing, this also relates to
    facebook whose been buying their competition off at every turn, like Instagram.
    The one very noticeable change that i saw when facebook got hold of Instagram
    was the amount of ads exponentially increased thus the information they got from
    their users also increased. I personally enjoy using google and I don't think
    its case is similar to facebook because you can still use bing and yahoo search
    but google just seems so much more user friendly.
- desc: '<p>Last class, we continued to discuss Code of Ethics. Regarding this topic,
    the</p><p>professor showed us the knowledge points that we need to understand,
    which</p><p>we need to master as a student of CS major. I also discussed the time
    and form</p><p>of the final exam, and spent about one day to complete the corresponding</p><p>questions
    and publish an essay. I think we''ll talk more about that in the next</p><p>lecture.</p><p>Name:

- desc: <p>In the last zoom meeting discussed the last topic of last to last zoom
    meeting which was the code of ethics. Also, professor make the breakout rooms
    for us. the topic of the breakout room was about the ACM code of ethics. it was
    really interesting discussion in the breakout room about it. Basically, we discussed
    about the privacy breaches in the sperate ways. in this field.</p>
- desc: <p><p>In the past lecture, the importance of code of ethics and the way it
    is implement and used to protect the user was discussed. It was a great thing
    to learn about as the user must know their rights and their data must not be misused
    by any company for their personal benefit. To ensure this, ACM and IEEE looks
    for any kind to unethical work to avoid such condition. User's privacy matters
    and should be protected at any cost.</p><br></p>
- desc: <p>In last we talked about code of ethics, specifically to the inclination
    towards 1.5. It dictates about the copyright infringement. To thoroughly understand
    the topic, professor gave us the reference of google VS oracle case. The case
    was about google stealing the code from the JAVA APIs of oracle. Eventually, after
    10 years the case, Google won the case with the historical win.</p>
- desc: <p></p><p>The past meeting was about the ethics and respecting the privacy
    of the user. The way in which ACM and IEEE governs the computing industry makes
    sure that the user are safe and protected from the frauds that are currently present
    in the internet. The ideas of the coders while writing the codes matters to a
    great extend and this can help us to build a secure place for the user.</p><br
    />
- desc: <p>In the meeting we discussed about the ehtics that a computer professional
    should follow. The code of ethics and how to protect the privacy of the user.
    In addition we talked about the ACM code of ethics. It was good to have a more
    elaborative&nbsp; discussion on this topic again as we have alredy talked about
    it in the earlier blogs and classes.<br></p>
- desc: <p>The last meet as concentrated with the Code of Ethics. the "ACM" approach
    od dealing with the computer professionals and their responsibility towards the
    society. There was also feedback on the the empathy maps and different view points
    towards approaching the problem.</p>
- desc: "\t\r\nI believe the Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct\
    \ of all computing professionals. The Code serves as a basis for remediation when\
    \ violations occur. A code of ethics is important because it clearly lays out\
    \ the rules for behavior and provides the groundwork for a preemptive warning."
- desc: <p>Last time, we discussed the code of ethics, specifically the proclivity
    for 1.5. It specifies what constitutes a copyright infringement. Professor provided
    us with a case study of Google vs. Oracle to help us better understand the subject.
    The case involved Google stealing code from Oracle's JAVA APIs and we also discussed
    about pattern of our final-exam.<br></p>
- desc: "<p>I was actually not sure on how the final exam will be like if it going\
    \ to be a real time time exam or a take home. So I was clarified in this meeting\
    \ that it going to be a take home exam.</p><p>Thank you prof for the clarification.</p><p>I\
    \ was having challenges with my network so I couldn\u2019t follow up with the\
    \ class before my network got interrupted.</p>"
- desc: " ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct is beneficial for our society,\
    \ but I think some people may not fully adhere to these guidelines. For example,\
    \ In 1.6 Respect privacy, some computer-related personnel may be under the company's\
    \ pressure to collect their privacy, such as Facebook has such a thing. Or, some\
    \ computer-related personnel sell the original company's program code because\
    \ of huge profits. But I think even if not everyone can live up to these principles,\
    \ everyone should learn and understand them\uFF0Cso some things that violate the\
    \ ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct will reduce the situation's occurrence."
