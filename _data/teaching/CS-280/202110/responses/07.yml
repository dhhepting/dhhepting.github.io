- desc: "Filter bubbles: Positive or Negative?\n\nI think filter bubbles have their\
    \ uses, but they also have some glaring issues. Filter bubbles can offer improved\
    \ user experience, as information is \u2018filtered\u2019 so that users get to\
    \ see only the content on a website that they enjoy. At the same time, however,\
    \ filter bubbles cause censorship via omission, where people are not exposed to\
    \ views alternative to their own. In my opinion, there should be a balance: Users\
    \ can enable filter bubbles if they like, or disable them if they want a more\
    \ well-rounded view.\n\nURCourses and Zoom and How They Benefit Society During\
    \ the Pandemic:\n\nOnline resources, like URCourses and Zoom, allow many workplaces\
    \ and educational programs to be available remotely. During a pandemic, like our\
    \ current COVID-19 situation, this is crucial. Allowing people to continue going\
    \ to school and work by just accessing their home internet connection reduces\
    \ the spread of viruses due to lack of contact with others and also offers some\
    \ fringe benefits, like no commuting.\nI think this trend of remote work and education\
    \ will continue even after the pandemic is over, as now the structures and policies\
    \ allowing for remote work and education are well-built and already settled and\
    \ in place. This will allow many people to live more flexible lives in the future,\
    \ without needing a 2 hour commute to work (which I have done for multiple years\
    \ in the past). I think this remote work option will be one of the \u2018few\u2019\
    \ benefits that COVID-19 will have on society in the years to come.\n\nOf course,\
    \ this is just my opinion."
- desc: 'The most reliable way to decide public interest is through the market. I
    think if we decide public interest before releasing a software or other products
    to the market, we will hinder innovation and diversity. It is better to release
    an innovation to the market and let it decide if it is a good product or not unless
    the product is obviously detrimental to the public. If we allow the entrepreneurs
    and researchers to decide what is good or not, the public is losing the 3 steps
    towards empowerment as discussed in the article.


    I believe computer technologists are no longer a profession that lacks tradition
    and responsibility of ethical standard. As we learned in previous lectures, more
    software companies are considering the opinions of professionals in other fields
    to get feedback on their innovations to improve their ethical standard. Also,
    as more graduates with ethics training join the tech industry, I believe IT is
    moving towards the right direction with upholding public interest as one of its
    main goals.'
- desc: "I would say Moodle is not the best to work with. URCourses is just a skin\
    \ on top of Moodle. And Moodle is not pretty beginner user friendly to set up.\
    \ Especially for a content-rich course like CS280. Organizing this class is tough.\
    \ Most people are too lazy to check for a different website they would rather\
    \ have one website to look at the course content instead of two. It\u2019s kind\
    \ of like a modern website design interface, they don\u2019t want to get overwhelmed\
    \ by too many things at once.\nWhile I do appreciate the effort of making accommodations\
    \ for the students. I think considering that we\u2019re in our 7th lecture. Some\
    \ accommodations might be a bit unnecessary as the students need to learn and\
    \ adapt to the teaching style. I would rather stick to a definite plan than change\
    \ as we go, something could be messy if some student decided to do their work\
    \ ahead of time.\nAs for the public interest paper, not likely that people will\
    \ do the thing that will help the public interest directly. There could be some\
    \ positive spillover effects such as a vaccine. The problem with public interest\
    \ is they don\u2019t pay directly to the engineers that are doing the work. What\
    \ I am saying is no motivation, as people need money to live and pay rent. Usually,\
    \ you have to put the employer\u2019s interest first before anything else."
- desc: For this class we did not get into any of the content but more so voted on
    how the class course could be structured better. this got me thinking that when
    creating a program for it to be user friendly you can only go so far, there are
    to many people that could use a system that think differently to please everyone.
    eventually it gets to a point where it is up to the user to learn and adjust.
- desc: It is important to build self-confidence in life. People are often afraid
    to do certain things, and we need to overcome that. As a computer student, I think
    many of us will be a programmer in the future. We may be afraid of our future
    life now, but we also need to overcome this idea. Confidence is important, and
    we should also try to help others and build up our confidence. Creativity is very
    important, but more important than this is our confidence to overcome difficulties
- desc: 'Zoom and its responsibilities for the "greater good"

    With the ongoing pandemic the need for virtual communication has become a necessity
    for the vast majority of us. This is probably the main reason why Zoom has become
    to ubiquitous and as wide spread as of today. However, while Zoom is a very useful
    tool for hosting and attending virtual interactions

    of any sort, it is also not without its controversy. A quick browse of Zoom''s
    Wikipedia page (while not a perfect source, Wikipedia can provide us a quick outline
    of the issues) you will find a myriad of issues mostly related to privacy and
    security. Another quick google search of "zoom security

    issues" has pages and pages of recent articles articulating the security and privacy
    flaws of the software. Thus, a simple responsibility for zoom is

    to have zoom improve and iterate its privacy/security to ensure the protection
    of its users. Very sensitive information (like business discussions)

    is shared on zoom and making a software designed for communication without the
    means to protect that communication is irresponsible (as it creates scenarios
    where Zoom puts users at risk). If Zoom is going to charge for hosting business
    meetings (as it offers a subscription pay model), it should have the privacy/security
    like a real business meeting for professionals.'
- desc: In meeting 7, we are discussing about URcourse and zoom, and we voted for
    the material and other meeting activities should be posted into URcourse or show
    us at zoom or both.
- desc: During the last meeting we discussed about the issues faced by students while
    accessing UR course.
- desc: "vyomesh\n\nI learned many things from the meeting, one of them is people\
    \ should see the beauty of the objects, the neat and clean design that makes the\
    \ things more precious which makes you to enjoy. The chapter of fun with little\
    \ emotion that makes the things much simpler and subtle even if it does not make\
    \ any sense but still it will make us happy. Happiness makes one to do breadth\
    \ for search which then helps to do out the box search. I learned that the lack\
    \ of confidence has done many negative impacts to the people. \_People can be\
    \ cured as step-by-step involvement to the activities of the phobia so seemly\
    \ they can gain confidence. Since series of the steps can covert the fear to familiarity.\
    \ To redesign the things that can naturally makes people fly and so can reach\
    \ the stage of creative confidence.\n\n"
- desc: In the class we discuss about how students want to learn and understand the
    Subject and which way is better, through UR course or zoom platform because students
    find some difficulties to understand the things what to do or not to so by giving
    answers of such questions asked by professor and by majority of students opinion
    some changes are done by professor to help students to understand and learn the
    subject properly without any difficulty. Our professor understand our problem
    and help us in every way he can.
- desc: We all acknowledge that the management of teaching and grading methods plays
    a vital role in online education, which has been rearranged in today's class,
    taking into account student views. From it, I noticed that how considering everyone's
    perspectives leads to the strongest alternative. Discussing those topics in class
    gives me a deeper idea of the direction that this course is heading in. However,
    I am quite uncertain about the outline of our course with respect to the specifics
    of our assignments and projects. But finally, I find this subject very fascinating,
    so I'm looking forward to learning new stuff in the future.
- desc: There is some productive discussion regarding the organization of the course
    content, and I appreciate that Dr. Hepting is willing to listen to our feedback.
- desc: 'well in the last meeting we didn''t read any topic that is related to our
    syllabus because the professor gave us some questions in the zoom poll that is
    related to our course outline means to say he did some updates in the course according
    to our choices that we given in the form of answers to his questions regarding
    to course changes as which thing is better for us so that we will not get confused
    and get the all things done in a right and good way.

    This is one of the good thing for all of us now as we get the whole things very
    clear.'
- desc: "From the last meeting, we have discussed how to improve students' experience\
    \ of study Asynchronously. And we vote for many ways of scheduling our course,\
    \ from using urcourse to zoom by using explicit links, how we are going to use\
    \ the urcourse, and the form of our response for the meeting. It\u2019s really\
    \ grateful for Dr.Hepting helping put lots of effort on matching students needs\
    \ with teaching style.\n\nFrom the meeting before the last meeting, we\u2019ve\
    \ also discussed the sociology term \u2018Anomie\u2019. It describes an uprooting\
    \ or breakdown of any moral values, standards or guidance for individuals to follow.\
    \ To be simple, When a traditional value has been broken or weakened by the authority,\
    \ individuals will lose their faith to the current value, however there is no\
    \ specific moral value for them to follow, so the individuals will feel sad, lost\
    \ of goals and guidance. and in consequence, it will cause chaos in society, and\
    \ crime occurs. Sometimes, it not just represents individuals also a group. The\
    \ anomie shows a process of how chaos happens in society, we need to be rational\
    \ about moral values changing, and always follow your heart, be a kind and brave\
    \ person."
- desc: In last class, we didn't had a discussion on some specific topic but students
    got a clear view of the operation of the class. Doubts were cleared and I think
    every student apprecitated the hardwork done by professor to make things clear
    to the students.
- desc: 'First of all, thank you very much for putting the links of each meeting on
    UR courses it helps us to find everything quickly.


    Talking about the content of meeting 7, I really like the video about bad doors
    got some more idea about the design in the everyday life.


    But if I talk about veil of ignorance after watching and looking the video I am
    still struggling what exactly it means if you can discuss on that in next class
    that would be great!


    Thank you'
- desc: Well unless i am not confused did not learn a lot but it was mostly a trobleshooting
    class trying to figure things out
- desc: Much of the discussion in the last class revolved around our feelings about
    how information is presented in this course, and what interfaces should be used
    to share that information. While our current condition of attending school remotely
    is a unique and unusual set of circumstances, the challenges of managing information
    flow seem to me to have grown in general in the last 15 years. At one of my previous
    jobs we grappled with issues of how to best communicate by e-mail - management
    wanted employees to have access to as much information as possible, which was
    an admirable goal, but we found that critical information was sometimes being
    overlooked by employees because it was contained in a larger communication that
    contained too many items for extremely busy people to fully process. At a more
    recent co-op posting with a crown corporation, I sometimes struggled to maintain
    productivity with a steady flow of e-mails and instant messages arriving throughout
    the day and requiring a response. Cal Newport has written much on his blog Study
    Hacks about the challenges of keeping up productivity in a data- and communication-driven
    world, and it's a subject that's increasingly on my mind as the events of the
    past year have forced more of our lives online than ever before. I feel as though
    as a society, we don't have enough conversations about what we could or should
    be doing to limit the flow of information to improve our productivity and well-being.
- desc: "The Veil of Ignorance presented by Rawls is a very unique concept in that it\
    \ exposes the true plight of the bias of social construct. That is, how can multiple\
    \ different individuals coming from almost cosmically different backgrounds propose\
    \ and unify under a social order or construct to govern how everything from trade\
    \ to transparency should occur. Therefore, Rawls presents us with the idea that\
    \ the social construct can be defined under two main principals, equal opportunity\
    \ and maximizing the liberty enjoyed by the people. I believe that is level of\
    \ fairness is well at play in today\u2019s world, however certain social institutions\
    \ can easily dampen the effectiveness of the equality felt by others. For example,\
    \ on twitter and Facebook, certain selected individuals always feel compelled\
    \ to attract others to their following more than the rest. Why is it that society\
    \ is limited by whom you communicate with? Should one not be able to pick an amount\
    \ of people based in their area beforehand instead of individually adding them\
    \ to their feed/timeline. After all, we could definitely use more platforms that\
    \ decrease the divide between individuals and lessen the creation of potential\
    \ filter bubbles by simply adding all of those around us into our online conversations."
- desc: '"Norman Doors"

    I found the idea behind so called "norman doors" interesting enough, but like
    with most things I think there are two sides to this concept. From what I gathered
    in the clip (may or may not be the full story) Norman seems to emphasize simplicity
    as the key to great design. He claims one should not need a sign, directions or
    instructions to operate whatever it is you could operate, be it techology or something
    as simple as doors. The opposite of simplicity of course is complexity, but with
    complexity also comes options and flexibility. Mac vs. Linux is a good example
    of this concept. I don''t think good design has to be simple, it definitely can
    be and depending on the consumer that could be what they prefer, but I think there
    should be a wide range of options for the consumer to pick and choose; and thankfully
    we have that option.'
- desc: We discussed what improvements could be made to our course description during
    the last lecture. Therefore, during class time, several polls were generated so
    that everyone can give their personal opinion according to our choice. In consideration
    of these points of view, the professor has updated our homepage of CS 280 urcourses,
    which was intended to benefit students.
- desc: "In this meeting, we discussed about the way of using and accessing ur corses\
    \ links and all material. The class discussion and polls were really helpful in\
    \ solving the inconvenience that almost everyone faced while using cs 280 material\
    \ and videos\u2019 links. I found the new setting quit easy than the last one.\
    \ That is really appreciated , thanks to professor."
- desc: Last meeting discussions and votes really solved the issue of accessing the
    cs 280 course material. Firstly, it was confusing to find one specific material
    link or video on the website. A big thanks to professor, for helping all students
    by discussing with them and changing the access pattern. It is far better and
    easy to use cs 280 course platform, now.
- desc: "After watching the video \u201CIt's not you. Bad doors are everywhere\u201D\
    \ I learned how good designs are important. I also learned about Norman door.\
    \ A Norman door is a design where it tells you to the opposite of what you actually\
    \ supposed to do, or it gives wrong options and needs a sign to correct it. There\
    \ is also basic principle of good design such as discoverability and feedback.\
    \ For making a good design we need to go through some steps such as observations,\
    \ idea, prototype, and testing."
- desc: For the last meeting I learned about design, what makes a good design, and
    what might make bad design. For example, discoverability is important in design.
    It should be clear the operations one can do by looking at the object in question.
    Discoverability is interesting to think about and is one of the main reasons,
    I believe younger generations are often times better with new technology. I feel
    as though many of the older generations do not want to try and discover what they
    can do on technology in fear of "messing something up". Meanwhile, it feels like
    newer generations are much quicker to start pushing buttons or mess around with
    technology until it works or they start learning how to do things. This could
    obviously just be from my experience, but I believe it to be an interesting start
    to a discussion. Although discoverability was a little tougher to understand,
    I would like to learn more about feedback and more examples of it in modern day
    design.
- desc: This meeting was a kind of problem solving session of sorts for the UR courses
    website and the course content. The students had issues with the accessibility
    of the content on the professors website. The professor heard all the issues patiently
    and tried his best to accommodate all the requests. There wasn't much discussion
    about anything related to the course, however retrospectively, this was a good
    example for the role that designing of a product plays into its use and eventual
    acceptance by the consumer.
- desc: 'What you would like to know more about?

    I guess with the popular social medias these day, how we can apply what we''ve
    learned regarding filter bubbles in these platforms?


    what you would like to know more about

    How to better apply discoverability & feedback -> human centered design on softwares.'
- desc: "The things I learned from the video \u2018It's not you. Bad doors are everywhere\u2019\
    \ by Joe Posner and Roman Mars is about designs, how one can make good design\
    \ and how important it is. Bad and good designs are everywhere but by following\
    \ the simple process such as observations, idea, prototype, testing and going\
    \ over them again and again can make the design better. I also learned about Norman\
    \ door; A Norman door is a design where it shows you the opposite of what you\
    \ suppose to do. It was a good video."
- desc: 'I really liked the veil of ignorance video, especially in light of the ongoing
    farmer''s protest in India.


    I found these statements from the video extremely insightful:

    "According to the liberty principle, the social contract should try to ensure
    that everyone enjoys the maximum liberty possible without intruding upon the freedom
    of others.


    According to the difference principle, the social contract should guarantee that
    everyone has an equal opportunity to prosper. In other words, if there are any
    social or economic differences in the social contract, they should help those
    who are the worst off. And, any advantages in the contract should be available
    to everyone."'
- desc: in the lactures we did few polls regarding the meeting responses, and the
    content on your personal website rather than on ur courses, in this case i personally
    wanted to say that it is not that hard to navigate and it is just more work to
    post the same thing on the urcourses, then we discuss about the group prject upto
    5 people and the deadline, and a good news for me that there will be no midterm.
- desc: 'In this meeting, we mostly discussed about the look of the UR courses. I
    think the professor has done really well changing what he can. so, I think we
    should focus more on the content of this course rather than telling him what to
    change.


    I had missed writing about meeting 6 so I will write about that in this one -
    I agree with the video that bad doors exist everywhere and so we should come up
    with a general idea of designing basic things. A bit confused about how the concepts
    that we go through in every class are connected with one another. Hope that clears
    up in the upcoming meetings.'
- desc: In this past class we we mostly just discussed the format of the class. So
    instead I am just going to pontificate about the accessibility and usability of
    everyday things. In the video about bad design there are many things that I had
    not really considered, although have surely been tripped up by at some point.
    Besides the obvious like what the video talked about with the doors one of my
    favorite things that is very commonplace is automatic doors, which have that little
    sticker warning that it is an automatic door, and to be cautious, however if you
    read it from top to bottom it reads "automatic caution door" which will always
    amuse me. Which is bad visual design. Setting that aside, many things in our day-to-day
    life are not really that intuitive. Many devices for example when you tell them
    to "shut off" do not actually shut off, they instead go into a "low power" mode,
    or going way back to the classic "press any key to continue" with some programs,
    which could be confusing to some users. But with that said, many things are not
    all that bad, particularly with computers (assuming you know what you are doing).
    Many things have a satisfying click sound when you plug them in, such as USBs,
    cartridges and memory cards or even HDMI cords. They are easy to understand and
    I think quite intuitive, you find the right slot and you plug it in. Last year
    I got a new GPU, and uninstalling my old one and putting the new one in was quite
    easy -- it just pops in with a little latch. Although there is always room for
    improvement I suppose.
- desc: In last lecture, Dr. Hepting created lots of polls on Zoom. The whole lecture
    was discussion about Engagement forums, Study material and so on. Like what material
    should be needed to post on Urcourses!! Let's see what we study in next lecture.
- desc: the last meeting was all about modifications to be done in ur courses in order
    to make it more beneficial and resourceful for students. In the last, we discussed
    the details regarding the assignments.
- desc: We Discussed about how we should going futher in the course use UR courses
    for studing material related to the subject and we also discussed about the assignment
    1 about the marking scheme and how to present the assignment.
- desc: "In the video, It's not you, bad doors are everywhere discusses that Don Norman\
    \ actually complained about door more than 25 years ago. Gates shouldn't even\
    \ need instructions \u2013 the structure of a door can direct users through it\
    \ just great. Then why do so many doors require instruction manuals on the side\
    \ of them? When most people were complaining about something, none of it is going\
    \ to occur. Don Norman is not the majority of people, he's a psychologist and\
    \ cognitive scientist. Don Norman realized about it, and published so extraordinarily\
    \ thoroughly regarding his concerns that he transformed the country. 99 percent\
    \ of Invisible's Roman Mars is assisting to tell a story."
- desc: In the last meeting we just discussed about where to post the content of the
    lecture. By answering the polls we find the ur courses more useful to share the
    lecture material.
- desc: I think the confusion when the UR course is related to the topic of design.
    We are used to the design of the normal class which hold in-person meetings. We
    are used to getting most of the information in person, and the structure of put
    everything in UR crouse can be hard to track. The hundreds of emails that we get
    after someone make a post is also a sign of bad design.
- desc: "Veil of ignorance is important because no one knows who they are because\
    \ of their hidden characters and it\u2019s important for impartial ideals. Moreover,\
    \ helps are survey more ideal like equality , justice etc in a better form"
- desc: In the 7th meeting we discussed about posting the material on UR Courses or
    on your website. The polling done by people showed that they are facing so many
    issues while accessing the material and posting their responses to something like
    "filter bubble feedback".
- desc: 'The last meeting discussed about the modifications or changes to be made
    on UR courses to make it more user friendly. For that reason we did quit some
    polls on zoom. The discussion was about the changes to be made on the website
    regarding the forums and study material.


    I missed meeting 6 so here goes.

    The video, Its not you, Bad doors are everywhere discusses about the weird and
    not at all talked about experiences we have in our day to day life with some doors.
    The video says its not your fault but the design isn''t right. The design should
    be such that people don''t have to think but just get it by looking if a door
    is push or pull. Don Norman wrote a book about this thing and its not just the
    doors its everywhere.'
- desc: In the video, accessibility is called discoverability. When people see the
    product, they should find out what they can do. Usability refers to whether the
    product is easy to use, whether the user can complete the task, how efficient
    it is, and the user's subjective feeling during the process, which is the product's
    quality from the user's point of view. In the video, Usability is called feedback.
    These two elements constitute the principle of human-centered design. Moreover,
    we look at the world, and we come up with ideas. Then, people are thinking of
    solutions and testing them. This process has spread all over the world, and it
    is useful.
- desc: Just glad that professor is putting so many efforts so that we could find
    things easily. Watched videos of bad door and veil of ignorance. I really liked
    the concept that if it do a particular thing without realizing that you did it
    than that is what called a perfect or convenient design. So would like to see
    these concepts through more practical examples. And the second video is the reality
    or the balanced rules how to improve without harming or degrading others. I would
    love to explore or relate this concept in terms of computer field
- desc: 'accessibility and usability

    -> Accessibility is making a design that is convenient to all the audience and
    usability is how one feels about the task after it is done.

    when is a "why" sufficient to implement the "how"?

    From the TED video by Dr. Norman, one can learn that making a design such a way
    that user feels obvious of the instinct it has on the mind, will resolve the problem
    of "why" and "how". In the TED video it is well explained by the reference of
    badly designed door.'
- desc: The responsibility of me as a computer programmer for greater good is to keep
    a person's privacy in consideration at all means and provide the user an option
    or right to choose between what they want and what not. The data used or method
    used to provide service to the user should be partially shown to them. This will
    make the Internet a little bit more ethical.
- desc: Accessibility means that information should be allowed to each platform, and
    it should not be limited to anyone because, with it, the world can solve complex
    problems. Usability means that if people have any information, then how to use
    it. The communication should not be limited to one platform because things get
    easy when someone properly put them for many people , and you put it in a way
    so that who needs it can use it.
- desc: Meeting 7 summary helps to understand how a good design promotes accessibility
    and usability. A good design would be usable by as many users as possible, it
    would not be too complex to understand . Good design also helps to provide equal
    access to people with disabiliities. Also, a good design would help its users
    to complete their tasks efficiently and efficiently.
- desc: 'A portion of this class was focused on making the course content easier to
    navigate. I appreciate the effort that has gone into the website and understand
    that it was due to issues with an older version of the site.

    I wanted to voice some thoughts about what could potentially make navigation of
    the course easier. From personal experience, the most organized and navigatable
    system is to divide URCourses into a header for each week. The header for each
    week would include required and additional readings, assignment submission portals
    with due-dates, and forum boards. These listings would be sorted in chronological
    order for the week. I have found this enjoyable because it allows the user to
    simply look at what is expected during the current week or look ahead at upcoming
    work.


    Perhaps there is a balance to be struck between the website and URCourses, via
    hyperlinking or other means. I greatly appreciate that this is taken into consideration
    as it can make a huge difference in the efforts and performances of students.'
- desc: 'I already knew about Rawl''s Veil of Ignorance and felt that it was already
    a good philosophical rule to live by when thinking about how to treat others.
    I also think it''s a good general rule for creating a better world and even helps
    with creating government policy. I haven''t really connected it to designing and
    innovation though until now.


    In the video, the man describes how when travelling to the UK, he struggled to
    use their basic appliances. This is connected to Rawl, as when we design things,
    it''s important not just to solve whatever task that thing accomplishes, but to
    make sure the way it solves things is accessible to everyone. I think it''s easy
    to be biased in design and create something that already matches with your prior
    knowledge, but not others''. Not everyone has the same experiences as you, so
    it''s important to put yourself in their shoes, so the solution to a problem works
    for them as well.'
- desc: 'From the previous class, I still wish to know more about filter bubbles


    At a point I became confused on if filter bubbles is idea or not


    Please I seek for more information'
- desc: What I learned from this meeting are the differences in terms of education
    and delivery of lectures, and I, on my personal side, believe that the method
    of delivering the lecture must be as it was in the way the professor was planning
    for it by the professor. I understand the differences between the delivery of
    information through the personal website and the urcourses, and I do not see any
    many differences in this way.
- desc: At the last meeting, we discussed the application of URcourse. For the application
    of URcourse, I don't have much opinion on it. The video for this lesson is about
    the Norman Gate. The video explains how to use computer science to solve detailed
    problems in life. Sliding doors are a good example. Computer science can better
    improve the details of society.
- desc: In the last meeting we came to know about the features of UR courses and also
    about accessing the course material of this subject which is CS 280. We also did
    attempted some polls and that polls help our professor to improve the homepage
    for CS 280
- desc: In the past meeting, the professor had tried his best to make us understand
    about how to use website.
- desc: 'This week, I was most intrigued by David Kelley''s talk titled "How to Build
    Your Creative Confidence." Kelley explains how we can use a step-by-step approach
    to ease people into activities or learning skills that they are unfamiliar with.
    By slowly exposing people to new experiences, thus building up their comfort level,
    people can develop confidence in overcoming former anxiety-inducing tasks. This
    process is important, because it reveals that people are not born creative or
    not creative, skilled or unskilled. Rather, mastery of a skill is the direct outcome
    of practice and perseverance.


    I can relate this to my own experience with visual arts. I have studied and practiced
    art for a number of years in order to get to the level of skill and creativity
    I have now. When my friends and family members who are not confident in their
    art-making abilities approach me, they often state that they are simply ''not
    creative.'' I disagree with this notion. In order to overcome this barrier and
    become a creative thinker, it is necessary to first actively participate in the
    process of learning and refining a skill. It is only when a person reaches a level
    of confidence in their artistic abilities and in using a given medium that they
    will be able to form innovative ways of creating with that medium.'
- desc: Id like to say just how irritating it is when the instruction aren't clear,
    the world should be simple or made simple and yet there are always things like
    the doors. My goal is too keep things simple, easy, and make peoples life easier,
    but looking at some things i just question why is it like that and why cant they
    just make it simple. I hope to learn the best and simplest as well as the cleanest
    way to write my code in CS and being able to pass that code on is a life long
    goal that i will work towards
- desc: 'Zoom and UR courses are two programs that assist in advancing the greater
    good by enabling students to have easy access to educational material, and with
    zoom in particular, helping to enable a large portion of the workforce to stay
    at home during a global pandemic, helping to delay the spread of this virus. While
    Zoom''s privacy policies can be dubious at best, and with the data breach that
    occurred back in 2020, the software does still provide the greater good.


    Regarding UR courses specifically, online resources for learning is great in lowering
    the barrier to entry for higher education, enabling students to take online classes,
    which, during regular times could be used for students to take classes entirely
    online, enabling them to still work or take care of family while pursuing an education.
    And while I may be greatly against courses only being operated in this manner,
    having the option for "pure video" online courses further expands on this as well.
    Easy access to education is certainly a strong case for arguing that it helps
    advance towards the greater good.

- desc: 'The video "bad doors are everywhere" metaphorize closely with the computer
    world. It gives an important context about how designs are important for a particular
    platform.

    For example: I assume, in last lecture, we were insisting the professor to redesign
    the UR course tab to see a particular feed easily. This might make our complications
    a bit easier.'
- desc: well in the last zoom meeting, it is mostly about the ur courses and it was
    the discussion about some problems faced by the students to access it. I really
    appreciating the hard work and time given by the professor to those things. Also,
    we voted for some things. Basically, it was not related to our syllabus but its
    helpful.
- desc: It is very interesting to know that there is a terminology called Norman door
    which indicates the door design such that it goes against the norm. For example,
    A door with a vertical handle that needs to be pushed open is defined as a Norman
    door. In my opinion, this concept can be widely applied to computer science and
    engineering to describe unusual designs. However, a common known principle human-center
    design that consists of observation, idea generation, prototyping, and testing
    is used to improve bad designs and solve more difficult problems. From my experience
    in programming, the Norman door is hard to avoid, and in some cases, it is considered
    by the brain to be a logical design. When designing and implementing a mathematic
    formula in programs, it is easy for me to fall into the abyss of logic and get
    stuck in it, so that the logic of programs is incredibly complex and defy conventional
    wisdom, even though they do not have any problems in running. Maybe my experience
    explains the reason why Norman door are everywhere in our life and some designers
    still use the designs that have been proven to be incompatible with the way of
    people's thinking and acting.
- desc: I learned about how bad doors can affect you. The norman door where the design
    tells us you to do opposite of what you are actually supposed to do. I think the
    doors should be simple and easy to use instead of seeing the signs or thinking
    about which side should i open the door. If we have a handel we should pull the
    door and if not we have to push it. It should be this simple rather then being
    complex. We should not make it complex because doors should not be in our problem
    list at all.
- desc: In the last class I enjoyed that you took time to listen to our different
    suggestions concerning aspects of the class and allowed us to decide a way forward
    through the poll results
- desc: In the last I enjoyed how we were able to come to certain conclusions from
    the suggestions and through the results from the results. Hopefully this will
    better the learning experience for some students as well.
- desc: In the last meeting we all discussed about the platform which is best for
    the reply than i would like to stick with the ur course because it helps student
    in improving engagement with the professor and the stuff. One more important point
    was made in yesterday class which was that student left meeting after attendance
    or they only come in meeting for attendance than you can also make it mandatory
    for the student to turn on the camera and it will also be nice in the virtual
    room to give it the vibe of real classroom. From the lecture point of view i would
    like to learn more about the phenomenon pf algorithm in depth and creating discussion
    groups are also a nice idea and the groups can be more productive for the grades
    if the time given will be actually consumed for asking questions from each other
    or by communicating more about the class environment and most important by exchanging
    more fact about the study topic. Its the hard time of covid -19 and when the whole
    world is going through pandemic than i appreciate the efforts Dr.Hepting is providing
    for the betterment of class. Because , i am in the diploma of computer science
    and as requirement of diploma we have to do one major of 200 level and after winter
    2020 i have wait for one complete year to do cs 280 and if he is using ur courses
    from a long time than i would like to respect his decision.
- desc: From Don Norman I learned about concepts of human-centered design such as
    discoverability and feedback. These concepts are very important for designing
    things in computer science so that software and hardware is intuitive to use for
    most users without needing tons of documentation, and so that users get direct
    feedback for their actions showing them what has happened. Utilizing these concepts
    can help make using computers much easier and less frustrating, especially for
    less technologically-knowledgeable people.
- desc: 'Each time we click, watch, offer, or remark, web crawlers and social stages
    reap data. Specifically, this data serves to produce focused on notices. The vast
    majority of us have encountered the odd impression of history repeating itself
    as an item we investigated online out of nowhere shows up wherever we go on the
    web, just as in our email inboxes. Frequently this publicizing proceeds until
    we capitulate and buy the item.


    Directed commercials can assist us with finding what we need easily, however costs
    exist.

    The web has changed an extraordinary arrangement from the good ''ol days, when
    individuals stressed over outsiders discovering what their identity was. Obscurity
    was once lord. Presently, our security has been forfeited for promoting income'
- desc: I think we the most important thing we learned in this meeting was that how
    to design/implement something.
- desc: In meeting 7, I have learned about "improve". Human is inventing and improving
    since the earth have human culture. From stone Axe to mental Axe, from copper
    sword to alloy sword. Things are changing their material to upgrade their power
    with keeping their original design. And everything are being human center; Hilt
    for protect users hand.
- desc: First of all I really appreciate Dr. Hepting accommodating all the problems
    brought forth to him for this course. I think UR courses is a great learning environment
    for students. Although, it can be a bit confusing to navigate within folders and
    following links in it. As a computer professional I think the simplicity of the
    UI is critical - the iOS is a great example of an incredible OS with a minimalistic/simple
    feel and solid functionality. Sometimes it can be cumbersome to navigate through
    several links to get to the area desired.
- desc: For the past meeting, you have talked all about URCourse and the CS280's website.
    Some students found that they were in trouble when finding stuffs for engaging
    meetings on your website and they asked you to redesign whole things. I was very
    appreciated how you were trying to how to meet their demands. However, in my opinion,
    I am fine with all of this. I just need to spend little time to figure out all
    things, and all things are understandable. Moreover, students need to change their
    style of study in order to match their professor. Basically, most of professors
    will not be bother to change their teaching style just because few students do
    not like it.
- desc: I find it hard to believe that people poorly design things on purpose. Even
    encountering these things semi daily basis. Something so simple as a door with
    the wrong sign or wrong handle. If my office building had anything like that I
    would want it changed so that it makes sense. Are people just complacent and allow
    them to stay? Which would beg the question why aren't these obvious flaws being
    changed and fixed.
- desc: Thanks for all the changes you made to better the changes you made for the
    class. Can you explain the assignment further?
- desc: Even networks plays and important role in security Network security combines
    multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network security
    layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network
    resources, but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats
- desc: during the breakout section, we discussed about the core responsibilities
    of the future generation programmers. The main topic of discussion was the privacy
    concerns and the creation of websites as per the needs of elderly people, who
    have no or minor knowledge about technology.
- desc: The class was about improving the ways to interact in class and betterment
    of using UR courses and website. The usage of polls and zoom sessions
