    \ but to not let it completely dictate whether or not we do it. Absolutely anything\
    \ can be used to the downside of humanity, developing a messaging app can be used\

    \ are too afraid to start because of the possible bad outcomes, you\u2019ll never\
    \ give yourself the chance to succeed or improve."
- desc: "In the last class, we talked about computer science or technology is used\
    \ in an evil way even if it is not intended to. Well, I think that with some power\
    \ will come some destruction its laws of natures with positive there will come\
    \ negative. People who invented nuclear fusion or fission never thought it would\
    \ be used to create an atomic bomb. When a programmer creates any technology it\

- desc: "On accountability\
    \ for organizations\nThe previous lecture we had a group discussion/breakout activity\
    \ on sustainability for organizations. An important topic that my group brought\
    \ up was the question if corporations should be held accountable for sustainability\
    \ going forwards. This is quite a vague statement so let\u2019s try to break it\
    \ down into the core aspect. Data is currently used by each and every organizations\
    \ to gain more fans, grow the userbase, and network with industry pros. However,\
    \ data collection is not always sustainable. For how long are we to expect the\
    \ gathering of data by modern organizations as ethical? Another interesting point\
    \ brought up as a shard from this conversation was how exactly would we enforce\
    \ these methods. Corporations have shown many a time that profit is by far the\
    \ most driving motive for any action taken, and are even willing to pay the price\
    \ of fees if it means continuing the growth of profits. Is this a kind of world\
    \ we\u2019re ready to accept."
- desc: The past meeting was about related to CIPS that is Canada's association of
    information and technology. It is an association of 10 provincial regulators that
    license IT professionals in Canada and all over world. We also talked about the
    CIPS presentation on march 25 in class. In between we also talked about the blog
    entry 1 grades.
- desc: It was a great discussion on Everything is connected. Looking forward to learn
    on march25th in CIPS presentation in class. Also wanted to talk more about the
    topic we discussed in meeting 18 on a specific topics with examples for better
    understanding.
- desc: I would like to know more about the CIPS. I know that they are the accreditation
    body for Computer Science in Canada and that they establish the standards/practices
    of IT professionals; as well as provide some networking and certifications, but
    that is basically it. So I suppose I look forward to the CIPS presentation on
    the 25th.
- desc: Nowadays, the Internet world is changing so much that people's lives are also
    changing. The progress of science and technology deeply affects each and every
    one of us. At the same time, there is also a dark side. For example, there are
    cameras everywhere nowadays. Will they invade our privacy? Do these cameras, while
    providing security, cause harm to us ordinary people? These are topics worth exploring.
    This is just a metaphor, but I think we need to think more about these kinds of
    issues, to look beyond the surface, to think for ourselves and to question them.
- desc: 'I think that abstraction plays a big role in computer science. Data abstraction,
    permission level, features. Data abstraction is to protect user data from being
    exposed to other sections of the code. One person must work part of the code while
    another person works on another. So, they must protect their section of data and
    only pass what is needed. Deeply related to the privacy issue.

    If you publish your code online for free use. There could be a case of people
    modify your code and use them for their gains. If that is the case, are you still
    part of the fault?'
- desc: I think accountability is way to an abstract concept to define when making
    things. If we look at any kind of technology it can be used for good and evil.
    So how are we supposed to hold a computer scientist accountable for something
    someone else does with their technology? I would say intent is a much more concrete
    thing to have ethics around. If it is there intent to harm then it is not ethical,
    if they are making a technology to help people and someone else uses it to harm
    how is that the original persons fault.
- desc: "In our 17th meeting we discussed abstraction coding, ethics with research\
    \ and the marks that came back for our blog 1 and project proposal. We were asked\
    \ a difficult question of how coding should relate to abstraction. I was put into\
    \ a group and I discussed how abstraction could mean the code\u2019s relation\
    \ to reality or how versatile the code should be with the different levels of\
    \ abstraction. When it came to computer science research, should every coder question\
    \ the ethics of every program they help build. I suggested for every step of the\
    \ continued research we should actively update the laws and rules of ethics that\
    \ can arise and not try to stop research."
- desc: When it comes to generating software that is built for serving a diverse population,
    how can we as developers expand our understanding of different peoples walks of
    life and how that affects interaction with software? It is a given that someone
    will solve a problem/generate a program in a way that makes most sense to them.
    Is it problematic that the majority of the employees in computing are dominated
    by white males?
- desc: In the last lecture we discussed about CIPS.
- desc: In this meeting we discussed how learning computer is a long process because
    we have to learn a lot of things and taking the time to learn it is the key. We
    also discussed about cips at the beginning of the lecture thanks
- desc: 'The major problem of the Internet of things (IOT) is the security concern,
    as everything is connected in this process from larger to larger to smaller to
    smaller thing.

    As in today''s world data is the most powerful tool it can help a business to
    grow but can also proved to be worst if comes in the wrong hands. The thing that
    we can do to protect is education and awareness among passes so they can have
    unique and different passwords which helps the data to secure and becomes difficult
    for hackers to hack the system'
- desc: 'The meeting was about how everything is connected and about the sustainability
    and about the computer sciences professionals contributing to sustainability.
    the topic related to last class is about the discussion of due dates for the blogs
    and about he grading of blog one. the topic difficult to understand was about
    how sustainability contributes to computers.


    '
- desc: "We learned many new things through this meeting, I learned about the importance\
    \ of sustainability in the modern world of technologies. It is important for the\
    \ improvement in medical sector and standards of lifestyle. To maintain ecological\
    \ balances. We also learned about the quote, \u201Ceverything is connected\u201D\
    . So, this quote states that the connection is like roots, that would go deeper\
    \ as it grows and becomes more stable. Everything is connected and so it will\
    \ improve and evolve as time passes. For example, google personalizes and improves\
    \ it services.\n\n"
- desc: Our discussion about the ethics of what we code got me interested in wanting
    to learn more about the laws (assuming they exist) that govern computer science
    (for example any laws that restrict what we can code). This is because as a student
    I haven't really learned about the laws governing CS but as an individual that
    can code shouldn't I be knowledgeable about the dos and don'ts of what I can code?
    It just seems logical that there should be restrictions in place as what we can
    code can cause great harm to those around us (such as malware).
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about the CIPS presentation that is going to
    be held on Thursday, 25th March. Then we discussed the topic "Everything is connected"
    and were sent into breakout rooms to have some discussion about it.
- desc: 'The question imposed in last class was how do we deal with everything being
    connected and still write code that relies on abstraction?

    Though this question is a little difficult to answer, I believe that we have to
    make sure we think of the consequences of the implementation. Besides that I think
    also, in coding terms, I think that a database is a way to implement code that
    keeps everything connected as well as abstract. Also, I think by applying design
    patterns like MVC design. It a pattern that separates an application into three
    interconnected components.'
- desc: 'The link to watch the video "Everything is connected" under the plan for
    Thu-18-March-2021 is not working but the discussion during class was very engaging
    and informative.


    The discussion about using Abstraction and writing effective code was interesting.
    I would like to know more about what options do programmers have if their managers
    are forcing them to do something is not ethical.'
- desc: in this class we discussed about how sustainability is playing role in programmers
    world. Why sustainability is important and shared our views in breakout room.
    Moreover, we discussed about the upcoming meeting that is on 24th, all of us were
    very excited.
- desc: First you extended the deadline of blog 2 then we discussed about connecting.
- desc: In the previous class, we talked about computer science and technology are
    being used in an evil way even whether it is intended or. Well, as the renowned
    law of Inertia states "Every action has it's an equal and opposite reaction" as
    in the same manner, the law of nature states powers always lads to boon and at
    the same time destruction so with positive there will come the negative impact
    of everything happening to mankind. At the point when a software engineer makes
    any innovation, it isn't planned to use for abhorrent purposes. It's the obligation
    of the individual who utilizes it for the improvement of society or obliteration.
    After all the great and the awful will be a piece of innovation or item it's upon
    us how we use it.
- desc: In the lecture, we discuss how we deal with code abstraction while everything
    is connected? so, the use of data abstraction permits us to change an unpredictable
    information structure into one that is basic and simple to utilize. The impact
    of this is that a program with an undeniable degree of code intricacy can be changed
    into one that looks near English. The public ones are the best way to utilize
    the information
- desc: In class we talked about the abstraction of ones work when it came to coding.
    In my opinion I don't believe one can have true abstraction now when developing
    code as so much has already been developed but rather that one can have abstraction
    towards already created codes. Think about it in a way where you're changing another
    person's code. I believe in this context is the only true way you can put your
    own spin on it as all other times there's only one true answer to how a code is
    ran.
- desc: 'according to me here are few points that motivate one to add abstraction
    in code :

    -to keep things less complicated and easy for the client to understand.

    -protects one''s ideas from fraudsters and competitors.

    -job security. ;p'
- desc: I found it difficult to conceptualize writing code that relies on abstraction
    when we have to still consider that everything is connected. Decoupling things
    to reduce complexity is a normal practice in programming, especially in terms
    of dividing and delegating labour on larger projects. Programmers working on disembodied
    functions could be missing context that contributes to the greater whole. So what's
    the solution? Does that mean involving everyone every step of the way, guaranteeing
    education and transparency? Do we have to always consider everything or do we
    need to accept that abstractions will result in uncertainties? Does this mean
    we need to take our models with a grain of salt?
- desc: In our last class, we talked about how everything is connected and how it
    impacts our ability to write codes. Quite a while ago I read about the butterfly
    effect, how the smallest change in the past can radically change the future. As
    I went through the speech of Tom Chi(I think it's related, cause the link in the
    website is keep showing error, and he talks about the same stuff), I think that
    the basic fundamental of both philosophies is same. Everything that happened in
    the past, accident or planned has led us to where we are now and probably will
    impact our future too. During the breakout room, we also discussed the topic.
    I think that it is just a huge, extremely complicated math equation that is hard
    to solve. Even though everything is connected, it is not possible for us to know
    everything and connect each dots. Instead, we learn a certain part and create
    something new based on that. Maybe when we write codes or design something new
    it is supposed to be created by the decisions we took before.
- desc: Everything being connected in our world of technology makes our lives simpler
    but makes things more complicated for programmers having to incorporate the ability
    for their program to communicate with everything else
- desc: "Understanding motivation also allows for a greater understanding of social\
    \ networks. It notes on Facebook that people act as nodes and that their \"friendships\"\
    \ act as edges or links. Usually, descriptions of Facebook networks are based\
    \ on friendships between two people. \"But adding one person, creating a triangle\
    \ of friends instead of an edge clenched by two nodes, results in a more powerful\
    \ analytical tool,\" he said. \"It allows you to get a closer look at the\" small-format\
    \ \"relationships and, ultimately, a much better understanding of the larger network\
    \ and a clearer idea of \u200B\u200Bwhat is happening with the participants. Simple\
    \ logic dictates that such \"shapes\" should provide faster analyzes of complex\
    \ networks and better results than previous methods, but translating the obvious\
    \ into functional algorithms can be extremely burdensome. This incentive methodology\
    \ can find wide applications in many scientific fields because technical information\
    \ is increasingly expressed in network terminology. We are really connected to\
    \ each other."
- desc: IN THIS CLASS WE HAVE DISCUSSED ABOUT OUR ASSIGNMENT
- desc: The topic of discussion for the past Thursday meeting in the breakout room
    was how do we deal with everything being connected And still manage to write a
    code which relies on abstraction . This was the main topic which we discussed
    for a long time
- desc: In Last lecture we had a great discussion about CIPS presentation also we
    had a discussion on how everything is connected.
- desc: I learned that Code powers our digital world. Every website, smartphone app,
    computer programme and even microwave relies on code in order to operate. This
    makes coders the architects and builders of the digital world.
- desc: This meeting's topic, everything is connected, was very interesting. I watched
    the ted talk video by Tom Chi where he talks about how everything is connected
    and it was fascinating. The way he explained it made me wonder how far deep have
    we come and how far we still have to go to discover many more great things.
- desc: 'In this meeting, i learnt about the concept of CIPS (Canadian Information
    Processing Society) which is a professional association in Canada that helps to
    strengthen the Canadian IT industry by establishing standards and sharing best
    practices for the benefit of individual IT professionals and the sector as a whole


    In this meeting, i was really struggling to understand the actual concept of "Everything
    is Connected"


    I will appreciate if i can get a better knowledge and understanding of it'
- desc: In the last meeting, we discussed CIPS, which is the body that establishes
    standards for computer science professions. we also discussed the grades on blog
    entry 2. in the latter part of the class, we discussed abstraction, which is to
    protect the user's data from another section of the code. In the breakout room,
    we discussed how everything is connected and we still write code that is based
    on abstraction.
- desc: The most interesting discussion in this meeting was during our breakout room
    where we had a discussion about abstract and weather we as the developers were
    responsible for the programs that we make, but many student believed that it is
    not the responsibility of the developer because once a program is created it could
    be used for good and bad intention depending who's the person using the program.
    Many students believed that it is mostly the responsibility of the company or
    the user of the of the program how and what they use if for and I agree with that
    because as a developer we want our code to be reusable and as soon as we create
    something and release it into public there is no way back for us and we can not
    undo it however on the other hand we are responsible for creating malicious programs.
    I think when we code we have to be aware of good things that our code could be
    used for but on the other hand we should weight out the bad and negative things
    about our code and not create a programs that we know will be used for malicious
    purposes.
- desc: In the group discussion we were discussing about sustainability. And earlier
    in the class we discussed regarding checking the assignment feedback. I wanted
    to learn more about how sustainability and privacy are inter related because in
    group discussion we discussed how data protection and privacy can affect sustainability
- desc: As technology continues to advance, the spiderweb the connects everything
    on the world-wide web grows. As it grows, it continues to hold on to more and
    more data about each one of us. Google knows nearly every step i've taken since
    2015 and now with a screen on my fridge. Google knows what I eat, how much and
    when. How long is it before our algorithms stop asking us what we want and start
    telling us what we want?
- desc: 'As discussed in our class we know how everything is connected to something
    and everywhere. The concept of everything is connected is shown by speaker about
    the heart, breathe and mind. Starting from heart which speaker says is a little
    iron atom which is created only by the supernovas and supermassive stars. Than
    it leads to the collision of a galaxies, the immeasurable heaven this all process
    of galaxies joining together, the collision of galaxies colliding, massive star
    formation process and this all drives creating process of iron which is related
    to our single heartbeat.

    Moving to breathe, going back it was not easy to take breathe deeply many years
    ago, the cyanobacteria that had potential of photosynthesis process that transfers
    carbon dioxide into oxygen. The plants were developed that transferred the energy
    and this was how the breathe was united like our out breathe was mirrored to in
    breathe of plants and than their out breathe was mirrored to us by inner breather
    of their and this is how we were able to breathe deeply many years ago and survived.'
- desc: Marxism holds that all things in the world are interconnected and developing,
    and this connection is objective, diverse and universal. We can think of this
    as a correlation of an event's occurrence, which can be translated into a specific
    probability. And when everything can be digitized, programming can create a virtual
    world.
- desc: In the last class, we discussed writing code that relies on abstraction with
    everything connected. One reason for implementing code at the abstraction level
    stems from security concerns. If a data type contains an abstract member, such
    as animals, then this member can be a variety of types like dogs or cats, but
    if a data type contains a relatively concrete member, such as dogs, then the member
    is relatively fixed not to change. Obviously, abstractions are easier to change,
    and writing code at the abstraction level helps hide information, thus improving
    security.
- desc: 'In the last class, we discussed about the technology in general which is
    being missed used. According to me, as a coin has two sides everything comes with
    a positive and a negative side but it depends on us that how we want to use that
    thing. When a company creates any technology they don''t intend to use it in the
    wrong way. It is the duty of the person using that piece of technology that how
    it''s being used. We also discussed about CIPS.

    It was an interesting lecture.'
- desc: I found the idea of being mindful of the technology we create an interesting
    debate. As someone who worked the last few years for an unethical company, and
    has continued to witness everyone around me deteriorate from unethical practices,
    I have found that most ARE mindful, but in the end powerless.
- desc: I am looking forward to the presentation of cips and id like to talk about
    the aspect of privacy coming up again because if we enter any information online
    it'll get spread. This is usually how scammers get our numbers and emails and
    so on, and its mainly due to shady sites selling our information. We are living
    in a very big world where people will go to any length in order to make money
    and you have to be aware of that and protect yourself. It would be cool to see
    some ways we can protect ourselves online in class
- desc: To be completely honest, I found the last meeting's question hard to understand.
    I went into the group discussion but nobody responded which was unfortunate because
    I would've liked to have some discussion on the topic as I really wasn't sure
    on it. It did get me thinking though, and returning after the discussion time
    I got to hear a lot of thoughts that were very different from mine which was nice
    because there were a lot of things I just hadn't considered. I had kind of thought
    of it as using a bad metaphor in a way, and especially trying to hold on to that.
    Complex ideas sometimes need to be demonstrated in a more easy to understand way
    (such as with a metaphor), but if we force ourselves to only stay within the bounds
    of that metaphor the idea can lose tons of depth and might even evolve into something
    that more closely resembles the metaphor than it does the original idea.
- desc: "Professor gave us some insights about CIPS presentation. He also talked about\
    \ the article \u201Ceverything is connected\u201D and also gave a reference of\
    \ a tree, how it has deeper roots and they are connected to stem and branches.\
    \ It also incorporates how the \u201Cinternet of things\u201D tech has made itself\
    \ a culture where all the ordinary objects are connected to internet with the\
    \ help of sensors, controller and many others. The article also emphasizes on\
    \ how the future will be for the internet users and how crucial is it to conserve\
    \ the energy from using this products."
- desc: 'The topic of discussion for this meeting was how everything is interconnected
    and what that means for computing professionals? Should we aim for more connectivity
    between different things (with the advent of internet of things, we can see where
    this is heading) or should we aim to bring about abstraction in our approach and
    render things disconnected for the sake of privacy and abstraction? The breakout
    room I was in, ended up discussing how the latter is almost impossible with the
    amount of interconnected applications we already have which care less about our
    privacy and more about their control on us. It is also a little ironic that the
    hyperlink titled "Everything is Connected"on the meeting 18 webpage, does not
    actually connect to anything.......

    '
- desc: "On meeting 18, we\u2019ve discussed an abstraction topic, A popular ted talk\
    \ video \u201CEverything is connected\u201D shows the connection between everything,\
    \ the suggestion of this connection may solve the question that troubles humans\
    \ for thousands of years: \u201Cwhy do we exist?\u201D and the CIPS presentation\
    \ showed us the influences of the electronic media to the public."
- desc: I believe that abstraction of information in terms of coding doesn't have
    to be a problem if everything were to be connected. I mean this in technical terms
    if we were talking about coding and software itself. Connectivity doesnt mean
    access should be granted everywhere for a system to function properly.
- desc: The Internet has undoubtedly changed people's lifestyles and living conditions.
    In the past, the Internet only stayed at the electronic level. But now the Internet
    has undoubtedly penetrated into all aspects of people's lives. The Internet of
    Things is one of the most promising areas in the future. When everything in the
    world is connected, its efficiency is quite amazing.
- desc: we talked about CIPS presentation and about article "everything is connected".
- desc: "\u201CHow do we deal with everything being connected and still write code\
    \ that relies on abstraction?\u201D\nI found the topic somewhat unclear. I\u2019\
    m not entirely sure what is meant with the idea of everything being connected\
    \ and relating that to abstraction. Abstraction can be used in a program to only\
    \ present the user with the information they need without overwhelming them. However\
    \ it is possible for this to be manipulated in negative ways so the programmer\
    \ has to keep these things in mind."
- desc: According to me a programmers job is to create program with good intentions
    but in the end the usage depends all on the user itself and hence he may use to
    wisely or in a wrong way.
- desc: In class we had a discussion on blog post 2 and the marks of blog post 1.
    Then we discussed on privacy and sustainability and what is the duty of a computer
    professional towards making a software sustainable. We had a group discussion
    where we discussed various aspects of sustainability and how as an individual
    we can work on it.
- desc: We discussed about the connections of all the data we have been talking about
    and how each and everything connects briefly in the lecture.
- desc: In the last class we were talking about who to hold responsible when coding
    in abstraction as far as privacy is concerned. I personally think it depends on
    the situation for instance if it were a program for a company stored on the companies
    servers I feel like the company should be held responsible.
- desc: In meeting 18, the important thing is we talking about the presentation on
    Thursday.
- desc: In the last lecture we discussed about the article "everything is connected"
    and how it relates to Computer Science in general. Professor also gave us general
    overview on the CIPS presentation. In the breakout room we discussed how letters
    play important role and how it is interconnected to the other applications we
    use.
- desc: "\_in the last class I enjoyed the discussion about who is to be responsible\
    \ for coding in abstraction with the concern of privacy and then also say something\
    \ like you think it really shouldn\u2019t be something that the programmer should\
    \ be concern with but rather those who the programmer is programming for like\
    \ if they are working for a company or something"
- desc: Prof in class today talk about the CIPS presentation and talked about the
    article EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED.
- desc: In the last class we learned about the computer the major problem of the internet
    of things which is the security concern apart from that we also discussed in BRooms
    about that how we deal about each and everything that is related to internet as
    we also discussed about CIPS presentation.
- desc: 'We discussed about how we can write abstract code about the world in which
    everything is connected. I had some problem understanding this question and how
    to go about answering it.


    Meeting 17 response:

    In meeting 17, we discussed how to write sustainable code and do sustainable business.
    In my view, sustainability means the way of doing things that can continue without
    affecting the surroundings negatively'
- desc: Nowadays, with the development of technology, everything is being connected.
    The connecting things together using technology is also known as Internet of Thing
    (IoT). With technology, we could create many more machines which is used in many
    fields, many purposes. Take mobile phone and tax machine as an example. With mobile
    phone, people could keep in touch with each other. That is one of a tool for connecting
    people around the world. Moreover, tax machine helps people send document, paper
    within a minute to the distant place. It could help everything connect more easier.
    In conclusion, Internet and technology are a great transportation for keeping
    everything be connected.
- desc: 'Designation for information systems professionals; we need to account for
    social costs and externalities. Our routine is on a monitor and making codes,
    and no worries where our code will work because we should be proud of our codes.
    Moreover, we need to care about data abstraction, and the work should not be under
    discrepancies(beyond our models): a user and a system cohesion. A coder can solve
    a real problem, and we have an anti-problem model/s for a problem/s. We have the
    accountability to do the right job at the right time by using the best coding.
    If more portable codes, try to use them in other problems if any possibilities.
    Sometimes we have to abide by the code of ethics, and sometimes we do coding abstraction.

    Thanks:)'
- desc: in the last meeting, basically we talked about the data abstraction care.
    also, about the coder who care about the code and solve any type of problems even
    real to real problems and make the anti model for those problems. it was really
    an interesting topic for me. Even though we also discussed about the blog entry
