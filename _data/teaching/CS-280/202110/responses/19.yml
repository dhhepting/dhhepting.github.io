- desc: "Yes we can reconcile freedom 0 with public interest just by obeying the pledge\
    \ of computer professional, as dependency has been changed drastically since last\
    \ decade and I think it\u2019s going to increase more on daily basis so it\u2019\
    s very important for me and rest of computer aspirants and professional to do\
    \ our jobs in an ethical way as a the future and present of the human civilization\
    \ rests in our hands ."
- desc: "In meeting 19, we discussed Professional Responsibilities especially for\
    \ computing professionals, and after study of two websites: \u201C4 Essential\
    \ Freedoms of Free Software\u201D and \u201CComputing Professional Oath\u201D\
    . I have more thoughts about the benefits of free software and what oath that\
    \ computing professionals need to remember. By \u201C4 Essential Freedoms of Free\
    \ Software\u201D, we have learned 4 freedom of open source software:\nThe freedom\
    \ to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).\nThe freedom to\
    \ study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you\
    \ wish (freedom 1).\nThe freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others\
    \ (freedom 2).\nThe freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to\
    \ others (freedom 3).\nAnd for \u201CComputing Professional Oath\u201D, we should\
    \ always use the skills for public goods, know the limitations, and take our responsibilities."
- desc: In our 19th meeting we discussed software having four types of freedoms and
    what is a computer scientist professional oath. The first freedom was the freedom
    to run a program as an individual wishes to and for any purpose. We were put in
    discussion groups and a few of my group members agreed that there will always
    regulations, limitations and liabilities with any tool let alone an open-source
    software. A possible computer science oath discussed in class talked about coding
    for the great good and not doing unethical activities just like doctors with their
    Hippocratic oath.
- desc: I think designers should encourage free software design. Free software makes
    the user feel in charge and if consumers can feel in charge of the services offered
    by a computer professional, they will continue to use the service.
- desc: I think there are good things about open source. First, it makes code available
    to the general public in a positive and open way, helping some people understand
    and learn programming. The downside is that opening up the source code online
    can lead to plagiarism, or it can lock people in, for example, by allowing beginners
    to follow the open-source route.
- desc: "As I mentioned in my previous comment, the breakout room with five people\
    \ doesn\u2019t seem to attract people to participate in the conversation. Or maybe\
    \ they could have turned on the zoom meeting and go somewhere. Having a larger\
    \ group would help with more people talking.\nThe idea of free software is tempting\
    \ from my cheap perspective. However, there are different ways to motivate people.\
    \ Some are motivated by money or they need money to live. As much as I hate to\
    \ sound like a capitalist, innovation comes from a drive to make things better,\
    \ usually to be more time-efficient. As we know, time is money."
- desc: 'The question was posed in the lecture, and I thought it was interesting:
    Is GNU''s philosophy about free software too ambitious or extreme? My impression
    is that they are against anyone taking ownership of the software they create.
    I think that the decision of a developer to make their software open-source or
    not should be entirely up to them and not GNU. They come off like they are entitled
    to free software.'
- desc: The most important thing I learned in class yesterday was how GNU.org defines
    free software. Not only does it mean the software doesn't cost money to get, it
    also means it also must follow four essential freedoms. These four freedoms include
    things like offering access to source code so you can study and modify the code
    for your own purposes. Given I use free software, like LibreOffice, in my everyday
    life, knowing this changes my viewpoint of the computing world a little.
- desc: What I took away from this is that we should not be held to the responsibility
    of how our software is used, unless its intended purpose is what is causing the
    harm. You can make a messaging app, and if someone uses it for Cyberbullying,
    possibly to the point of causing another user to commit suicide, that is not the
    fault of the developer unless the app was intentionally designed in a way to encourage
    that use case. We should put in safety nets, like the ability to block or report
    users, but unless we are actively encouraging the harm that should not fall back
    on us.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was the four essential
    freedoms regarding software. The breakout room discussion was about whether or
    not we can reconcile freedom 0 with the public interest. We cannot reconcile freedom
    0 with the public interest because if you have the freedom to run the program
    as you wish for any purpose, you have the freedom to cause harm to society using
    that program. Freedom 0 is not realistic because allowing people to do anything
    they want is not in the public's interest. There are rules and laws that prevent
    us from doing certain things in every aspect of life.
- desc: In the last meeting, we discussed about the topic of freedom of a user to
    use a software tools as they wish. well, that was quite interesting topic for
    me . my ideology about the concept was that developers should be paid for their
    work as they do hard work in making the stuff available to learners, so there
    should be some credit for them. Also, if it will be on users to utilize any software
    as they wish then a sense of responsibility will be created for all users to organize
    that platform and it can be mess ; hence some restrictions are necessary instead
    of making it a public good. along with this there was a short discussion about
    ban on killer robots. apart from this, we had voting/ discussion on zoom or web
    ex. and as i know, most of students were in support of zoom including me.
- desc: On last tuesday we saw two articles in which one was a GNU project on free
    software operated by Free Software Foundation and the other article was "The pledge
    of the Computational Professional". In the first article we learned about what
    is Free Software? SO Free Software is basically a software that is manufactured
    in a way that it provides all users freedom and community. It actually is meant
    to be made as a user friendly tool so all users are able to perform functions
    such as copying, running the software, analyzing it and recreate it. Bascially
    means its open source.
- desc: Honestly the most important thing I learned from last meeting was about GNU's
    campaign to make software free. I had no idea that this was the driving ideology
    behind GNU and it was interesting to learn about. I'd be a bit interested to learn
    more about their philosophy, especially since it seems from an ethical point of
    view they promote their 4 freedoms. I'm curious how they expect accountabililty/responsibility
    to be taken for misuse of a free product.
- desc: "In last meeting professor was asking a question into the poll about if we\
    \ like Zoom or WebEx for meeting. Then he was discussing about 4 essential freedoms\
    \ of free software. He explained what is means by free software. Then we had to\
    \ go for a breakout season to discuss about \u201Ccan we reconcile freedom 0 with\
    \ the public interest. The main concept of this topic is; how we have the freedom\
    \ to run any program for different purpose without any hesitation. Then he posted\
    \ another poll about how was the breakout room experience for us. Then we had\
    \ a bit discussion about why our experience was different."
- desc: firstly in class, we discuss that we have to stick with zoom or Webex application
    and then we discuss the topic in a breakout room and the topic is can we reconcile
    freedom with the public interest? so software is a tool or a source that people
    can use and it depends on them that use in a good way or in a bad way after a
    topic discussion everyone had some talk about breakout room participation.
- desc: "In this meeting we learned many important facts about the freedom. The class\
    \ taught me many things especially the freedom 0, \u201CThe freedom to run the\
    \ program as you wish, for any purpose\u201D. If the above statement satisfies\
    \ then it is a free source. As this freedom 0 concept out of 4, hampers a lot\
    \ because the developer or company can produce any material which could harm the\
    \ society badly. So, there has to be a strict rule for free sources, those that\
    \ harms individual in anyway.\n\n"
- desc: 'Open-source software can use knowledge more efficiently. Because it is open-source
    software, the user can use it for free: they are free to use and learn the software''s
    internal architecture, and they can modify and redistribute it. Moreover, programmers
    are more likely to write better code based on their interests because open-source
    software is free. On the one hand, over time and with the collaboration of different
    people on the web, they will become more relevant to more people''s needs. On
    the other hand, people with different needs can open another project to make a
    derivative version based on the source code.'
- desc: As we discussed in class in zoom poll, which platform should we used i think
    personally the best for now would be zoom because majority of the stuff for university
    is going on with that! Also i have one more suggestion about the breakout rooms
    i feel the duration should be around 5 to 10 minutes not more than that because
    majority of the things would be easily discussed in that period of time.
- desc: 'In the past meeting, we had a pool about using WebEx or Zoom. I prefer using
    Zoom because Zoom is more user-friendly and easier to use as compared to WebEx.
    Zoom also allows users to instantly join a meetings, with common features across
    all the devices. So basically, no matter what device you are using, you will be
    able to join the meeting from anywhere. On the other hand, WebEx has very lengthy
    registration and checking process compared to Zoom. Moreover, as we are already
    using Zoom for class and the semester is almost about to end, there is no point
    of view moving from one application to other.


    I also think we should have bigger breakout room with more people in it. Having
    more people in a group will bring more discussion points to talk about.'
- desc: 'Freedom in the software world is a different depending on the industry. If you
    look at video games, movies or other formed of entertainment, most of it is not
    free. This is due to the nature of people taking time and energy to make a viable
    product. I think this is the correct way of approaching freedom, however in terms
    of software some exceptions should be made. For example, in the case of students,
    Microsoft offers free Office 365 (cloud based) and if we look at a step further
    at Jet-Brains, they offer their entire development studio apps free for students.
    This is a huge step to take for most organizations and should be lauded at providing
    opportunities for students to excel within our world.'
- desc: I don't think that when looking at the first of the four essential freedoms
    of free software you can ever blame the creator for anything that happens with
    their software. Since you could modify the software under those rules how can
    someone be held responsible for what someone else did. I would say the intent
    of the person making the free software is the most important ethical thing. Whatever
    they make the program to help people if someone uses it to hurt people not their
    fault they attempted to help.
- desc: Free software for an idea and studying it for any purpose without restrictions,
    as well as copying and circulating it against restrictions. Or you believe that
    you are registered with your same rights. Free, comprehensive, easy-to-use software.
    Free Software License Licensing it to the recipient, or creating it in the public
    domain, issuing the source software.
- desc: 'Meeting response

    In the last meeting, the professor talked about free software. So what is free
    software? Free software means software that respects users'' freedom and community.
    And there are four essential freedoms rules to help us identify whether the software
    is free. First, The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose. Secondly,
    The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing
    as you wish Access to the source code is a precondition for this. Third, the freedom
    to redistribute copies so you can help others . Last, The freedom to distribute
    copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole
    community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is
    a precondition for this.

    In conclusion, only software satisfy the whole essential freedoms rules can called
    free-software. Otherwise, it''s non-free software.'
- desc: From meeting 19, one thing I found interesting in this class was the pledge
    of the computing professional. I really love this part because it helps and provides
    most computing professionals with a blueprint on how to do their job effectively
    while bearing moral and ethical responsibilities to society. If the oath is followed
    I believe most computing professionals would conform to the ACM code of ethics
    and thereby have projects and products that are provided based on the idea that
    the public interest is the primary consideration.
- desc: 'We had discussion on free software and then a breakout room discussion on
    reconciliation of freedom 0 with public interest. In the group discussion we decided
    that the users who are taking advantage of the free version of any software are
    to be blamed more than the programmers who have built it. Since its free that
    means the programmers don''t have the authority to control it. Moreover, we discussed
    about the banning of killing robots, which I completely agree to because we never
    know when it can become harmful.


    I am looking forward to the public lecture on mars exploration tomorrow.'
- desc: I feel the user should be hold responsible for misusing a particular website
    because developer just creates a software so it will have positive and negative
    effects but in what way to use is completely on user so I feel developer should
    not be responsible as he has not created something and is always for betterment
    but its on user how he receives it in negative way or positive way
- desc: "I found the article \u201CFree Software Is Even More Important Now\u201D\
    \ a fun read. I honestly didn\u2019t realize there was this kind of passion over\
    \ proprietary software and I will be looking into it more. I couldn\u2019t help\
    \ but find similarities outside software. For example, I would say University\
    \ offers a proprietary education. I have never felt in control, and often find\
    \ the system archaic in favour of practices that do not benefit every user."
- desc: 'I learn from the 4 Essential Freedoms of Free Software,

    - to run the program for the purpose

    - to study how the program works

    - to redistribute copies that can help others

    - to distribute the modified version'
- desc: something different and interesting in this meeting we did is the talk about
    engagement meetings either it should be of more students or for more time.
- desc: In the last meeting we discussed about the topic free software. Free software
    means that the users have the freedom to run, copy and improve the software. But
    according to me free software are not ethically good. because a computer professional
    puts a lot of efforts to make a good software but if it is accessible to public
    then anyone could cheat or do any step in the code which would be a great mess.
    So there should be no free software We also had a short discussion about ban of
    killer robots. We also did a poll on the zoom and WebEx that which platform should
    be used for meetings and personally I preferred zoom.
- desc: The oath brings up the need for a governing body for ethics in the programming
    field. Like engineering we need some organization that gives out licenses and
    investigates ethical problems within the profession. It is important for ethical
    thinking with all this new technology being developed.
- desc: "In the last lecture, we pondered upon the fact that whether we can reconcile\
    \ freedom with zero public interest. In my opinion, there should be some amount\
    \ of restriction when there is a certain freedom. Too much power is dangerous.\
    \ Anything in excess is a drug is a very well-known saying which works perfectly.\
    \ The law of nature is to keep everything balanced. Too much freedom can cause\
    \ damage to the public itself. That\u2019s why we need justification in the IT\
    \ world as well."
- desc: The last class was quite interesting to me, especailly as the concept of AI
    deciding our fate and the topic of killer robot came up. It kind of sounds like
    terminator plot but can be implemented soon enough. However, even though a lot
    of people are very anxious about it, I do not think that it would be a significant
    issue soon enough. We won't see robot soldiers for at least a hundred years by
    now. As for drones, AI controlled ones could end up better, could end up worse.
    As for other philosophical factor, like for a self driving car who it will save
    is more complicated and creates an ethical dillema. For which unfortunately I
    have no answer for
- desc: 'The Pledge of the Computing Professional promote the belief of computing
    as a recognized career at the time of graduation for college students in Computing
    Science and related packages. ... The reason of the symbol is to remind the inductee
    to usually honor their profession via their moves.


    Futher about the free software is that we are allowed to run , upgrade and distribute
    freely.

    We can access the source code of the software for free.'
- desc: 'The most important thing I learned from the last class was learning about
    the four essential freedoms, which were:

    1.) The freedom to run the program whenever.

    2.) The freedom to study how the program works.

    3.) The freedom to share copies so you can help others.

    4.) The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others ..'
- desc: "A system is free software if its users have the four fundamental liberties\
    \ discussed below.\n\nThe freedom\_to run the programme as you see fit for any\
    \ intent.\nThe freedom\_to analyse how the programme works and modify it so that\
    \ it performs your computing as you desire. Access to the code is required for\
    \ this.\nThe ability to reallocate copies in order to assist others.\nThe freedom\_\
    to share duplicates of your various versions with others. By doing so, you can\
    \ ensure that your improvements benefit the entire society. Access to the source\
    \ code is required for this."
- desc: The important thing is that you have a right to privacy as long as that right
    is used within the bounds of the law. Seeking privacy should not make you feel
    guilty. Privacy should be expected, and demanded.
- desc: We discussed the freedom 0 from FSF (free software foundation) in this class
    and how we can reconcile freedom 0 with doing public good. I believe the wording
    in freedom 0 i.e., "The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose"
    makes it hard to reconcile it with public good. As people can use the free program
    for any purpose and some of those purposes may lead to public harm instead of
    public good. For example, some freely available hacking tools such as for penetration
    testing can be used to cause harm to others.
- desc: In meeting 19, we talked about the free software. For me, free software provided
    convenience to users. But the free software in the market recent most of them
    are bundled with other software, force users to download them with the software
    they want together. this violate the "The four essential freedoms". It increased
    the burden on the computer.
- desc: In last class, we had a poll about using zoom or Webex and another poll about
    are break out using useful or not, in which I feel that sometimes I have good
    discussion in the rooms, but sometimes discussions are one-sided. Later in the
    class, we discussed about how program is free software and the four freedom essential
    to make them free software.
- desc: '"4 Essential Freedoms of Free Software" is an interesting read. Our discussion
    during class was engaging. I learned about different types of freedoms.

    "Computing Professional Oath" is a must for every computer professional.'
- desc: The one thing I would like to learn more about is how the "ban on killer robots"
    can be enforced. We have bans on similar weaponry such as chemical weapons however
    they are still used sometimes today. Even if we enact a global ban how can we
    ensure that the ban is obeyed by all nations of the world? Afterall, when it comes
    to war there is no limitation to destruction, and killer robots will not be an
    exception.
- desc: The cap on the delivery fees for the restaurant can be a good move, but of
    course the restaurant is not entirely dependent on that so, the time will tell
    if you asked me that how it is going to work for the local restaurants, but until
    the pandemic is at our doorstep, the struggling will continue.
- desc: Thinking more on the concept of 'free software' as we discussed in class I
    find the idea quite interesting. Looking at the four "essential freedoms" of free
    software, I believe that the ideas expressed could lead to a more inclusive and
    diverse computing environment. By allowing people access to the source code and
    allowing users to modify and redistribute their edited version of the program
    we can guarantee that people all across the world can access a global repository
    of code that we all can use and adapt to the needs of our programs, or contribute
    to ourselves.
- desc: Free software! It's a great concept that gives the user a lot of freedom.
    Switching from one free software to another is faster and less expensive than
    switching from one proprietary software to another. You are not bound by any company
    if you use free software. Free software isn't just for the benefit of the individual
    user. Through sharing and collaboration, it facilitates social solidarity and
    represents society as a whole. Free software is becoming an even more important
    part of our society and daily life as our activities become more computerized.
- desc: In this meeting we had a discussion discussion about whether or not breakout
    rooms are good for discussion or not. I personally think that they ae quite beneficial
    because this way students can express their thought freely. we also discussed
    freedom (0) in the breakout room which states that any one can run any program
    according to their wish and for what ever purpose they like. there are 3 more
    types of freedom in open source program.
- desc: In the last meeting we discussed about four essential freedoms and that was
    quite interesting to learn about. We discussed about freedom(0) in the breakout
    rooms but unfortunately no one discussed anything. As, we discussed using breakout
    rooms for discussion is a good idea but when most of the people do not participate
    then how a single person can discuss. That was a bad experience for me.
- desc: Well it was interesting talking in the group with what we discussed, about
    really how we could have public interests and honestly I frogeet the other one.
    But I do know that it was an interesting topic that wich I had more time to discussed
    with the other person since the talk was getting good
- desc: "In this meeting that \u201CFree software\u201D means software that respects\
    \ users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom\
    \ to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, \u201C\
    free software\u201D is a matter of liberty, not price.\nA program is a free software\
    \ if it gives users adequately all of these freedoms. Otherwise, it is nonfree.\
    \ While we can distinguish various nonfree distribution schemes in terms of how\
    \ far they fall short of being free, we consider them all equally unethical.\n\
    \nSo my question i that to what extent can a developer make software free?\nAnother\
    \ question is will users not misuse the software because is regarded as free?"
- desc: The interesting topic that we discussed in last meeting was freedom 0, which
    was about the concept that developers are free to use any software according to
    their wish. But I personally think that if this is the case than there should
    be a sense of responsibility to maintain the platform. So idea of making it a
    public good did not seem appropriate to me.By putting some restrictions we can
    better organize the software.Moreover developers should be paid good wages for
    their work as they made content available for us.In the meeting there was some
    discussion on breakout rooms , for which i have a view that participants length
    should be 10 to 15 people in a breakout room to ensure a good discussion on any
    topic.
- desc: I have an excellent topic to write that software and its free use for the
    user; users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study and change, and improve
    the software as their wish that is freedom 0.
- desc: 'Question from last meeting: Can we reconcile freedom 0 with the public interest?


    I don''t think freedom 0 can be reconciled with the public interest. The dangers
    of this is when it gets used for harming the public rather than being beneficial.
    Having lack of laws or rules for running programs can result of misuse and greater
    damage to people. Although, some freedom can result to creative applications and
    efficient systems. I believe having some rules to avoid harming the public should
    be kept in mind.'
- desc: The last class was all about the concept about free softwares and the way
    in which it differentiaites from open source software. There are four freedom
    in the free software which is the freedom to run the code, make changes to the
    code, save the work done by modification and freedom to distribute the copies
    of it. As a computing professional, the skills of the coder must not be used for
    unethical work so an oath is take by the professionals that they will work for
    the benefit of society.
- desc: The functioning of free software and the way in which it differentiates from
    the non free software was the topic of discussion in the class. The freedom to
    use the code, make changes to it, have a copy of the work done and redistribute
    the modified version of it is the advantages we get in the free softwares. To
    prevent computing professional to use their talent for the work that affects the
    society in a bad way, an oath is designed which every professional takes to be
    true to the society.
- desc: In the last meeting we had a discussion on a topic that is related to ideology
    its a new one for me and quite interesting that the thing that is made by the
    developers by hardworking then they should be pay for that thing no doubt there
    should be some restrictions but but still they get their credit. Apart from that
    we had a little discussion on a topic that is related to ban on killer robots.
    And also we voted in zoom meeting.
- desc: In the last week, we talked about freedom in the information society. In my
    opinion balance in society is very important. Too much freedom to anything can
    cause vandalism and inhumane activities. To protect human rights there should
    be a number of regulations and hence there cannot be any freedom without certain
    restrictions for the safety of people.
- desc: We discussed the upcoming zoom meeting for the Robotic Mars Exploration which
    is gonna held on 25th March' 21. Discussed on what are the 4 essential freedom
    of free software
- desc: It's cool to know there's an oath to a lot of things. I certainly can't wait
    for the day in which I can take "The Pledge of The Computing Professional" as
    it seems like a big deal to me who wants to work in these computing fields. I
    took an oath when i became a Canadian citizen it was a big day I was 14, I had
    to take the citizenship test and I passed on my first try with a score of 18/20
    and it was a big deal because i had earned my Citizenship test on my own which
    my siblings just got because my mom passed it. It made me feel independent and
    taking the Computing oath will certainly be another big day and a big event in
    my life.
- desc: The way in which free software and nonfree software have a difference in reality
    was made clear in the last class. The free software is always for the benefit
    of the user. Free software is those in which anyone can make use of the code,
    go through the code, edit it and have a copy of their work without any problem.
    Also, the oath which a computing professional takes after graduating was introduced
    in the class.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in this meeting which was also interesting
    for me was the actual definition of free software. I have heard the term before
    a lot but I did not know the actual meaning of it; I thought it means a software
    that is free to use however in this lecture I learned that meaning behind free
    is not a matter of price but liberty like freedom or free speech. Therefore free
    software does not mean that the software is free of cost but instead it means
    that we as a user have the freedom to do what we want with the software; make
    changes, copy it and distribute it , etc.
- desc: In past meeting, we discussed the concept of softwar and softwares as public
    good. Though everyone had different views about this plan, but i think that it
    would not be a good idea to make such important thing a public good, because there
    will be more cons to it than pros. Second thing was user friendliness of zoom
    or web ex . I voted for Zoom because in this year i used it regularly and got
    comfortable to use it. There was also a little discussion about robots and AI
    and how they can be dangerous.
- desc: "Today\u2019s topic is about responsibility in technology and which is very\
    \ interesting topic. Information Technology has the responsibility to offer service\
    \ in the most efficient, reliable, and secure manner while considering the needs\
    \ of the total user community. At certain times, the process of carrying out these\
    \ responsibilities may require special actions or intervention by Information\
    \ Technology staff. In such circumstances, Information Technology staff is bound\
    \ by specific policies governing their actions. At all other times, a staff member\
    \ has no special rights above and beyond those of other users; they are required\
    \ to follow the same policies and conditions of use that other users must follow.\
    \ Every effort shall be made to ensure that people in positions of trust do not\
    \ misuse Information Technology resources or data or take advantage of their positions\
    \ to access information not required in the performance of their duties."
- desc: I was interested to learn about the four essential freedoms of free software.
    I think freedom 1, "The freedom to study how the program works, and change it
    so it does your computing as you wish" is very important because it allows others
    to learn from open source code and contribute to it. This leads to many people
    working and learning together. I also think freedom 0, "The freedom to run the
    program as you wish, for any purpose" is important but also a bit troublesome
    because of people who may use programs for harm.
- desc: 'Strictly speaking, open source software and free software are different concepts,
    and any software that matches the definition of open source software can be called
    open source software. Free software is a more restrictive concept than open source
    software, so all free software is open source, but not all open source software
    can be called "free." But in reality, the vast majority of open source software
    also matches the definition of free software. For example, software licensed under
    the GPL and BSD is open and free.

    More intuitively, open source is a method; freedom is a spirit.'
- desc: In last lecture we discussed about the special lecture which is going to held
    on Thursday and overall lecture was really helpful.
- desc: 'I learnt about free software: study how the program works, and change and
    also the ability to share copies so you can help others'
- desc: 'basically we discussed about four essential freedoms of free software in
    this zoom meeting. especially how to run the program for the purpose. how to study
    about the working of program. Also, how to redistribute the copies that help others
    and how to distribute the modified version.

    it seems to be very interesting for me because its my first time to get knowledge
    about this topic.'
- desc: Last lecture was really good and helpful and we also talked about the meeting
    of NASA which is going to held on this thursday.
- desc: From the article on free software I understood what it actually meant for
    a software to be free with the 4 conditions listed. Previously I would have concluded
    that a free software was a software you could download and use for free
- desc: From the last lecture i can give my opinion that it should have some restriction
    with some freedom. Also we had some discussion regarding zoom is better or webex.
    We had created some polls to discuss those things. Moreover, had a breakout room
    to discuss those points.
- desc: "In the last meeting there was a good discussion about the free or open source\
    \ software. We discussed how Open source Software can be considered as the perfect\
    \ example for today\u2019s public goods. The government for the development and\
    \ maintenance gives upmost priority to this public good. It is every individual\u2019\
    s responsibility to use the public goods in the ethical way and contribute to\
    \ its development in every possible way. We also had\_ a brief discussion about\
    \ the responsibilities of a computer professional."
- desc: 'The meeting was about the freedoms of software and its essential elements.
    It is also discussed about the mars exploration meeting and also about the computing
    professional oath. The topic related to last class was about the computing professionals


    '
- desc: "We talked about freedom in information society with society\u2018s safety\
    \ in mind. Freedom should be there with some restrictions or else it can be dangerous\
    \ to the human race."
- desc: In class we talked about maintaining public interest and freedom simultaneously.
    My thought after this class is what would contradict freedom with interest. What
    I mean by this is what level of freedom would have to be violated in order to
    reduce the public interest.
