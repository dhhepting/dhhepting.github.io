- desc: In our 14th meeting we discussed a diagram showing a user what they are thinking,
    sayings, doing and feeling. There was an example of a user and each of the quadrants
    had different sticky notes. The notes described what the person was currently
    or possibly saying, feeling, thinking and doing with the program. The example
    person had notes saying she was cynical, anxious, researching pros and cons of
    a product and/or service, and so on.
- desc: I'm currently reading Clive Thompson's, Coders in preparation for the project
    and I find it interesting how Thompson represents coders and those in programming
    throughout his novel. So far I'm finding that he describes those in the industry
    almost as cold, unapproachable work-a-holics that have no care for anyone's feelings.
    Not only do I find it hard to believe this, I can't imagine those people having
    any regard for ethics or empathy in their work. If this is in fact true, where
    do the ethics come into play?
- desc: It seems to me that an empathy map could be weighted differently between the
    4 quadrants. For example, during the proctortrack experience, people are not likely
    to say much because they don't want it to be recorded and there is not much of
    a reason to say anything during a test.
- desc: In terms of empathy, something I would like to learn more about is real-world
    examples of empathic design vs sympathetic design in computing. The reading that
    compares sympathy and empathy suggests that empathy is more valuable than sympathy
    as it achieves a greater understanding of parties in distress. However, we are
    not really given too many concrete examples of sympathetic design vs empathetic
    design that we can see right now. I think to compare and contrast sympathy and
    empathy it would be valuable to analyze and critique sympathetic design and how
    it could be improved with more empathic design. Then I think I will understand
    the values of empathic design and why it is an improvement over sympathetic design.
- desc: "The use of proctor track for examination is nowadays a hot subject for discussion\
    \ among students as well as teachers. I assume, therefore, that our next project,\
    \ an empathy map of this topic, is the best way to know the thoughts and opinions\
    \ of students. I just liked the format too! It\u2019s like a chart containing\
    \ nice, and tiny notes, so I am pretty excited to do that."
- desc: "I like the empathy map assignment. I never had one before so this is brand\
    \ new for me. Although I am not really enjoying Protortrack too much. It\u2019\
    s put the designer into a user experience. It helps identify any flaws that were\
    \ being shadowed by the confirmation bias of the designer.\nThank you for going\
    \ over the project proposal again. I know this is a huge portion of the grade.\
    \ So I am appreciated that you went over it just to make sure everybody is on\
    \ task."
- desc: In the previous lecture, the discussion on empathy was quite interesting.
    I like to more about it because I did not get it completely. We also discussed
    how the objectives of empathy map has changed from past years. There was also
    some discussion on submitting project proposal.
- desc: The most important concept I learned from last class was the concept of an
    empathy map. The idea of an empathy map is to help develop empathy for the user
    by categorizing what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. In this way, a software
    designer can better understand the issues that users may have with their software,
    and be better informed on how to improve them. As well, I think empathy in general
    is a very important skill to have, both in and out of work. It allows us to understand
    and get along with others.
- desc: We discussed about project proposal in meeting 14.
- desc: It is important to keep in mind how others encounter what we develop, and
    understand what may be required to use our software as painlessly as possible.
    It is also ideal to have a wide variety of considerations, especially when designing,
    as what may be appealing to someone younger, such as a more minimalistic or icon-based
    design, could be incredibly confusing for those who are older. This is similar
    to our conversation previously about discord, as while it is a very simple and
    minimal interface, it can be overwhelming to many who are not familiar with its
    predecessors.
- desc: The most important thing that I learnt after reading the article on sympathy
    vs empathy is that these two words have different perspectives. Sympathy means
    that I feel for you and empathy means I feel with you. In user experience empathy
    is an essential. As, empathy is the way so we could see into the user's thought,
    so that we could have more clarity of ideas to design something.
- desc: Well for this session we mostly talk about what we have to do with the assigmnt
    which is very helpful and it made things so much clearful on what is need to be
    done for the project posperal
- desc: User experience is very important in today's society. Sympathy is not the
    same as empathy. Most social software offers sympathy, such as helping users read
    content. This is better than nothing. However, not all software is capable of
    empathy, which is a complex ability. A deeper level of design needs to be explored.
    I think this is especially important in product design, and it's a skill that
    people in this industry need to learn.
- desc: I think the most important thing I learned from the Sympathy vs. Empathy idea
    in UX design was the need for a diverse userbase. In particular, what works for
    some users may not work for others (obvious point, but anyways), and the design
    goals should be to satisfy the userbase as a whole to the highest degree possible
    (a wide array of diverse users all cannot be 100% satisfied as people are simply
    too different, but a design should try to satisfy the needs of the collective
    to the highest degree possible and there are design decisions that are generally
    well recieved by all. Again, rather obvious, but this would be something like
    reliability, ease of access, intuitive layout, etc.). This would perhaps not be
    the case only if the design is being tailored to a very specific purpose and its
    users would only be there for that purpose (Arch Linux for example was designed
    for the most experienced user in mind, and in that sense was not created to "hand-hold"
    its users).
- desc: We have our classes and exam online due to COVID-19. Professors use the proctor
    track in most subjects to prevent cheating. This is why it has become a common
    topic of discussion among professors and students. I believe that using an empathy
    map to share our perspectives on the subject will be the most effective way to
    do so.
- desc: In the last lecture, we discuss something about the topics and group work
    for the project how we can submit it in a group or individual and learn about
    the empathy maps.
- desc: "I was first introduced to the concept of empathic computing in this course.\
    \ I have realized how necessary empathy is, especially when designing systems\
    \ that other people will use. It is crucial to consider needs, abilities and disabilities,\
    \ and cultural backgrounds and experiences of one\u2019s audience with an open\
    \ mind in order to better construct technology to serve them. In order to do this,\
    \ we need to first practice empathy. This is why I am eager to work on my own\
    \ empathy map. I hope this will enable me to reflect on my own experiences with\
    \ software and then use this insight when approaching designing for others."
- desc: "I fully agree that sympathy and empathy are important for good UX design.\
    \ This relates back to one of the earlier meetings with the video about the doors\
    \ that are unclear in which way they open. I think it is pretty easy to get caught\
    \ in the trap of making a system that conforms to your own experience. This makes\
    \ the system seem accessible to you, but it may not be for others. It's difficult\
    \ for me to conceptualize how to fix this in practice, but I guess we will see\
    \ with the later \u201Cempathy map\u201D assignment."
- desc: "\u201CSympathy vs. Empathy in UX\u201D article and video by Sarah Gibbons\
    \ taught be the difference between Sympathy and Empathy. I have used these two\
    \ words interchangeably many times. I found this article very useful. In a few\
    \ of my university group project experiences, I have come across decisions where\
    \ team members don\u2019t agree on a user experience design and usually just have\
    \ an argument over what is the right way to do things. I feel this article will\
    \ be very helpful in these situations and I will definitely use this in my future\
    \ projects. I would also like to see more guidelines/articles that can help student\
    \ teams work together without arguments."
- desc: I would like to look more at executing Sympathy and empathy in code. While
    I do not think anyone would disagree with these principles it is also very difficult
    to implement. When under budget constraints it is extremely difficult to implement
    extra code to make it accessible to a few. So I would like to see some examples
    of how people made these changes while looking at budget constraints.
- desc: "How do you approach an engineering project is a very important task. Most\
    \ of the time we would make products or applications for the benefit of other\
    \ people and not us in general. Having an empathic approach to the product and\
    \ application is very important. When you feel pity or sympathy you just feel\
    \ sorry for them you don\u2019t feel what they feel and hence when we are designing\
    \ an app we should put it in the user\u2019s shoes to be more empathic and compassionate.\
    \ It can be done by having diverse user testing and research or making an empathy\
    \ map. Empathy and compassion are very important for UX."
- desc: The link you asked us to read really resonated with me and made me think of
    the ted talk we watched a few meetings ago where we were introduced to how much
    manipulation our minds are put through. It made me wonder if this (showing empathy
    or compassion for the user) was one of the ways in which we are manipulated in
    our day-to-day life.
- desc: I believe that technology can be helpful if use wisely even in democratic
    society, yes there might be some cons but that can be eliminated through proper
    education and aware about consequences if used badly "Technology can improve or
    undermine democracy depending on how it is used and who controls it. Right now,
    it is controlled by too few."
- desc: "We discussed many things in this meeting, first we talked about the ACM code\
    \ of ethics and then the important thing we discussed was the empathy mapping.\
    \ How this empathy mapping contributes to understand the topic thoroughly. We\
    \ learned this small mapping can make complicated things to short and makes simple\
    \ to formulate. As well as it narrates all facts through that group of blocks.\n\
    \n\_\n\n"
- desc: "In last meeting professor started the class by providing the details about\
    \ project proposal and how it should be submitted if it\u2019s a group project\
    \ proposal. Then talked a bit about the Empathize and the final exam choices.\
    \ He also explained what is empathy map and how we can use it. At the end he asked\
    \ everyone to read the article about Sympathy vs Empathy in UX.\nIn UX, sympathy\
    \ is trying to understand the complication of the users. Such as; when designing\
    \ a website if the font is too small then it will be harder for an user with optical\
    \ issue or older people to view. By keeping those in mind we should design the\
    \ page or put the facility to adjust it according to their comfortness. On the\
    \ other hand, empathy is; understanding the users fears, ability and limitation\
    \ and try to remove the un necessary features that will make the site difficult\
    \ to use for any user."
- desc: In UX, sympathy is constrained to just the recognition that people should
    be having a tough situation, mission, as well as voyage. If we were really compassionate
    with clients, it doesn't indicate that we brought ourselves in their boots and
    understand their feelings. In UX, empathy helps us to identify not just the instant
    dissatisfaction of our users, but also ones wish, talents, constraints, logic
    and objectives. It enables everyone to deepen one's intuitive user experience
    and generate ideas which will not only fix necessity and will enhance the welfare
    of our users effectively by eliminating needless suffering.
- desc: 'The most important thing in the meeting is:

    Democracy of the internet technology and Sympathy vs Empathy video discussion
    are the most important things discussed in the class


    the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:

    The dangers of fallacies is most difficult to understand and also about the algorithm
    works


    what you would like to know more about

    I would like to know more about how democracy of internet is related to the development
    of software fields


    something you encountered that is related to the past meeting

    The dangers of fallacies is related to the last meeting'
- desc: In last class we mostly talked about the empathy map and other assignments
    in detail. As for the class topic itself, we discussed about algorithm design
    of software that attracts wide customer, the privacy issue and such. But mostly
    it was about the upcoming assignment.
- desc: "In the past meeting, we discussed about the project proposal and also talked\
    \ about the empathy assignment. I think empathy assignment is a really good way\
    \ to talk about the most popular topic for students during pandemic \u201Cproctortrack\u201D\
    \ as a lot of classes are using this application and almost 90% of kids are against\
    \ of using this application. This assignment will allow us to talk about the 4\
    \ major parts of the empathy maps. We will be able to SAY about our experience,\
    \ what we THINK about it, how we FEEL, and what this application DOES to get it\
    \ working properly. I am actually excited to work on this assignment."
- desc: On meeting 14, we discussed Sympathy vs Empathy in UX. sympathy is an action
    that affects the feelings of what happened on others. Empathy is feeling the same
    as others feel. As UX professionals, Empathy is an upper level of sympathy, and
    it leads us to design our product more clearly and intentionally to make users
    have a better experience with our product, and we need to make the empathy map
    when we actually prepare considering empathy for users.
- desc: In this we discussed about our next assignment empathy maps, how emapthy is
    different than sympathy, and how UX professionals practice sympathy over empathy.
    I think that the best way of practicing empathy is to think fron user's point
    of view and interact with users on what they feel about a software and what changes
    they think could help them to ease their difficulty in using so that they can
    enjoy the software.
- desc: Looking at the article that was linked (Sympathy vs. Empathy in UX) the importance
    of us as computer professionals having a good user experience is paramount and
    something we should strive to deliver. When we are designing our program, website,
    etc., it is important that we are able to emphasize, not just merely sympathize
    with our end users. As the article notes towards the end, I personally feel that
    the best way to ensure empathy in our UX is to have a diverse group of people
    working on our teams from a wide variety of backgrounds and lived experiences.
- desc: In the last meeting professor told us about the empahty map assignment, how
    we are supposed to do it, what points we should include. he also discussed about
    the group project propsal delivery. He also gave us the idea of final exam (about
    the design and topics ) and told us that the final exam will be a take home essay.
- desc: Proctor track, which is used by most professors to prevent cheating by students
    during these online classes that have been going on all over the world for the
    past six months, has become a hot topic among professors and students alike. Empathy
    maps will be the perfect forum and most powerful way to express our perspectives.
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about the project proposal and briefly talked
    about the empathy map. Empathy is important in tech because it allows us to better
    understand our users and think deeply about the problems that the users experience
    while using our technology such as website, software, etc. An empathy map presents
    a visualization of the user experience. I am interested in learning more about
    the design process in UX.
- desc: After reading the article on Sympathy vs. Empathy I learned that I too like
    many others had been using the term empathy incorrectly. This clarification gives
    me a new perspective on things and will definitely help me with the empathy map
    assignment. I also agree that as people who will eventually be designing things
    that will have many users we should be somewhat focused on having empathy for
    the users so they can have the best user experience possible.
- desc: 'Empathy means that at the beginning of product design, we should constantly
    examine our products from users'' perspectives and constantly adjust our products''
    direction and style through research and analysis of target user groups.

    Moreover, empathy doesn''t just mean we need to take the user''s perspective;
    we need to help users understand themselves deeper. Because sometimes, users know
    they want the feature without thinking about why they want it. Therefore, Empathy
    in UX is essential.'
- desc: "In today\u2019s class we learned that having an emphatic approach to the\
    \ product and application is very important. As we know that if someone is going\
    \ through some pain mentally or physically. We can only try to help them with\
    \ what we can but we cannot feel their pain. In the same we if we make an app\
    \ we should make it as user can feel it as his own to be more emphatic which can\
    \ be done by empathy map or by having diverse user testing or research."
- desc: The most interesting thing I learned about last lecture was while reading
    the article on Sympathy vs Empathy in UX. I found the part about the spectrum
    of empathy and the different ways of practicing empathy in user experience to
    be very informative. It made me realize that without practicing empathy in UX
    we will not be able to understand how people feel and how we can acknowledge them.
- desc: "The Post-Hoc Fallacy\n\
    \nIn the most recent lecture we had a lengthy discussion on logical fallacies.\
    \ These are essentially arguments and presentations that appear illogical and\
    \ dismantle one\u2019s own statement. It is an error in the reasoning and deduction\
    \ abilities of the evaluator. One specific type of fallacy is the Post-Hoc Fallacy,\
    \ officially labeled as the Post Hoc Ergo propter hoc fallacy. This is a logical\
    \ fallacy that occurs when one unknowingly attributes the causation of an event\
    \ based on a previous event simply due to the timing of both. For example, the\
    \ streetlight turned red after the car passed. Therefore, in the post hoc fallacy\
    \ it is assumed that the car caused the streetlight to go red. This is the incorrect\
    \ assumption that the previously occurring event affected and caused the following\
    \ event. It is also an error in the assumption that correlation suggests causality\
    \ when the two factors could not be more further detached. This thought processes\
    \ is also correlated with jumping to conclusions and often implemented by quick\
    \ thinking detectives on police drama shows. It does not however hold true in\
    \ reality, and that fact should be known."
- desc: In the 14th meeting, we discussed a diagram which was giving us a brief idea
    of what people think, say, do and feel. There was a basic example of a user and
    each of the quadrants has a different sticky note. The notes were describing how
    a person says, feels, thinks, and does with the program. Democracy of the internet
    technology and Sympathy v/s Empathy video discussion was the prominent topics.
- desc: 'In the recent class, we talked about different fallacies including logical
    fallacy, which implies when one sounds insensible to a factual argument. For example,
    if someone corrects you, but you give a vague reason assuming that you are right.
    This fallacies analysis incorporate in the technological world. For instance,
    technology business is not computer science.

    Lastly, professor discussed the project details and stated what he would expect
    in the proposal.'
- desc: In the last class, we talked about empathy in Ux and from this, I have realized
    how important having diverse users test out the user experience of your software
    so as to consider different users and allow for a better experience and with we
    show empathy to the users
- desc: I read the article and I learnt about showing empathy to the user so as to
    allow better experience for different users
- desc: "From my understanding here I learnt that Sympathy is the acknowledgement\
    \ of the suffering of others.\n\nSympathy is often the reaction (in the form of\
    \ sorrow or pity) to the hardship or plight of another person.\n\nI also learnt\
    \ that sympathy is limited to acknowledging that users are going through a difficult\
    \ scenario, task, or journey.\n\nEmpathy is a step beyond sympathy, and more complex\
    \ in nature.\n\nEmpathy is the ability to fully understand, mirror, then share\
    \ another person\u2019s expressions, needs, and motivations."
- desc: "We discuss about the Sympathy vs Empathy in UX.\nSympathy is the acknowledgement\
    \ of the suffering of others.\nEmpathy is the ability to fully understand, mirror,\
    \ then share another person\u2019s expressions, needs, and motivations."
- desc: Even though, we know what sympathy and empathy mean, we never think about
    what it actually means and how deep it can go. From this, we can say that everything
    can have a deep meaning in itself, it is only up to us on how we look at the phrase
    or a situation in real life.
- desc: "I found the article \u201CSympathy vs. Empathy in UX\u201D to be a bit exhausting.\
    \ As some someone who empathizes, I find it to be a burden. I would rather sympathize\
    \ some days, or even feel nothing at all. Does one really require empathy to gain\
    \ a good understanding of people\u2019s needs, conditions and challenges? It seems\
    \ most flaws or any necessary changes can be realized in the collection of good\
    \ data."
- desc: 'First of all, thank you very much for updating and explaining in brief project
    proposal page. In the class we discussed that and also few points on Sympathy
    vs Empathy in UX.

    '
- desc: The most vital and mandatory work is to take a note of the approach for an
    engineering project. One should have a systematic and sympathetic approach for
    manufacturing or inventing technologies and design for the applications and devices.
    These days the products are invented for the betterment and use of other human
    beings rather than the one who's creating. For the User experience or UX, the
    two mandatory aspects required are a proper understanding or a fellow feeling
    and empathy. The app or software should go under innumerous tests and should be
    well developed before releasing and constructing the empathy map too. that being
    said proper research and testing should be done by the developers.
- desc: Empathy within designing is complex. I would personally want to cater to the
    intended audience of my project while still trying to keep the product as accessible
    as possible. It is important to research what could be done to improve the final
    product for demographics that you may not have thought of initially. For example,
    people that are visually impaired may require exaggerated visuals or a form of
    voiceover service. People that are colorblind may struggle with navigating your
    app if prompts are colour-based, so emphasis could be put on the important UI.
    These could be added in as options that can be changed because the demographic
    of the majority should still be promoted. It is a tough balance between focusing
    on the majority and still enabling the widest range of people to use your product.
- desc: First of all thank you professor that you went through and explained how to
    write project proposal.I was having idea but was not sure about the format and
    stuff so really thank you for that and apart from that I read our plan for meeting
    the sympathy and empathy description.I would like to know more about empathy because
    I find it is a little bit more difficult to understand
- desc: The article about Sympathy vs Empathy was intriguing and shines a light on
    things to avoid as a professional where you mistake sympathy for empathy and design
    your products in such a way that it ends up not helping the targeted audience
    but mocking them. The slight difference between the two is that when you Empathize
    with someone, you don't just feel sad or pitiful for them, you also feel their
    pain and hardships. This helps us to design the products in such a way that if
    we were in those shoes, we would not face the same hardships.
- desc: we discussed about sympathy vs empathy in UX
- desc: "In this class we have discussed about empathy and sympathy and it\u2019s\
    \ usage in UC designing.We talked about the difference between both sympathy and\
    \ empathy as well.We learnt how we can implicate empathy while designing the UX\
    \ to empower the user.We talked about empathy map as well which consist four major\
    \ parts.UX designer use it to get the knowledge about potential user to make share\
    \ understanding need of users which aid in making a good interface."
- desc: 'I learned that Empathy empowers UX experts to comprehend the buyer''s prompt
    dissatisfactions.

    Empathy takes into account a more profound comprehension of the buyer and which
    in turn result in more better solutions.

    Being sympathetic for a customer will not help in giving them a better experience
    because the professional will not feel the difficulty of the other at the moment.'
- desc: In the last meeting we discussed a topic that was "empathy and sympathy".
    The diagram was quite interesting and doing it as an assignment will be so interesting
    for me to do. I am really excited for that assignment.
- desc: In the article Sympathy vs emapthy in ux design I guess it is important in
    every website as there are wide spectrum of people and need to think about all
    of them and there was a really good example of the blind people who might be accessing
    the website which the designers has to keep in mind and show the gratitude as
    well provide them service without make them feel dysfunctional and I think it
    is an important step for the UX designer to correct the mistakes carefully and
    needs surveys real life opinions, the ones we call the test app or website, and
    it requires in every design.
- desc: Sympathy maps and empathy maps are very important elements. These charts can
    let the software developer know clearly how the user's experience is. This clarifies
    the direction of future software updates and improvements.
- desc: In the last lecture we discussed Empathy and Sympathy and how to use them
    in UX design. It showed that we should avoid using sympathy in the place of Empathy
    as it would create wrong impression to the audience. Furthermore, we discussed
    Empathy map and the four main parts of UX design that it consists. Hence, it's
    important to test the software by diverse users to understand it properly.
- desc: Its cool to know more about sympathy and empathy as it becomes the driving
    force in many people, people developed motivation, sometimes go in the slumps
    and being able to share helps some rise up again.
- desc: In the past meeting, the way in which computer professionals practice sympathy
    over empathy was made clear. It is a topic of concern that the professional should
    be following empathy or sympathy and the best thing is proved to be sympathy.
    Sympathy can be a good thing as it is the way in which the website developers
    will understand the difficulties which can be faced by the user while using their
    product. It can be handled easily. But empathy will make things more complex and
    may or may not hurt the user's emotions.
- desc: The difference between empathy and sympathy is considered an inportant thing
    to be understood between the computer professionals. Sympathy means to feel for
    someone and empthapy is a thing beyond sympathy. Empathy is a more complex thing
    and which is like feeling for the other person and getting the same experience
    as they does get. Sympathy is used in majority to develop websites and computer
    programs which make things more clear and appropriat. This is the best rule to
    be followed for a good website development so that no one is hurt.
- desc: When we try to make any application or any website we need to design it thinking
    of user perspective not what we want. Designing website or application should
    be done what world need, I mean what user that will help us to make website more
    appealing.
- desc: I am going to address Sympathy and Empathy in UX. Sympathy is a reaction to
    another person in the form of sorrow or pity, but in UX, Sympathy is limited to
    users who are facing difficulties. However, empathy is to understand others' feelings
    and share them, but in UX, empathy means understanding the users' frustration
    and creating solutions for them. The empathy map includes four things that we
    say, think, feel, and do about the matter. Empathy in UX is useful to design with
    clarity and challenge to targets.
- desc: In the last thrusday class we talked about The difference between empathy
    and sympathy is considered an inportant thing to be understood between the computer
    professionals. Sympathy means here to feel for someone and empthapy is a thing
    beyond sympathy. Empathy is a more complex thing it means that and which is like
    feeling for the other person and getting the same experience as they does get.
- desc: 'The point of view for approaching an engineering project is a very important
    task. Most of the time the developer focuses on the overall look of the product
    and the benefit of the people. He does not focus on the benefits in the general.
    It is very important to have an empathic approach to the product. When a developer
    is developing any product he has to see the product from the user''s point of
    view. The product should be empathic and compassionate.

    It was a very interesting lecture.

    I would like to know more about things related to this.'
- desc: This class is more about thinking about information security. In fact, it
    is difficult to reach a consensus on information convenience and information processing.
    We hope that there will be more supervision on the Internet equivalent to the
    real society, including legal and privacy factors
- desc: "In the last meeting, we discussed about the difference between empathy and\
    \ sympathy in the profession of computer science. It is considered as an important\
    \ thing while designing websites. As empthy is something that is beyond sympathy,\
    \ while sympathy is widely considered in designing and developing websites and\
    \ computer languages, so that to not hurt anyone\u2019s thoughts and feelings."
- desc: So In last discussion we had a talk about empathy map. & also i learned from
    last lecture is if we are making a website we should take the view from User's
    side, like what are they expecting on that! How to make easy website to use for
    User! We shouldn't focus how website will easy to build and all. Will learn something
    more in next lecture.
- desc: "In this meeting , we mainly discuss about the difference between sympathy\
    \ and empathy as how these concepts are kept in consideration while designing\
    \ and developing different languages and sites. I think empathy is something as\
    \ deeply feeling others\u2019 situation, he or she going through, without experiences\
    \ it on your own, whereas sympathy is just to share these feelings with other.\
    \ Sympathy logic is also used by computer professionals during any technical development\
    \ like site or any language"
- desc: I learned the difference between sympathy and empathy in the context of UX
    design. Sympathy is simply acknowledging that some people may have difficulty
    using a program or website without actually putting yourself in their shoes and
    coming up with a solution. Empathy involves seeing a problem from the affected
    user's perspective and providing tools that will empower them to get through that
    problem. Researching how a diverse group of users feel while using a program or
    website can help to understand users at a deeper, more personal level which can
    make it easier to design in an empathetic way.
- desc: Social media may be a threat to democracy, the information that people get
    from social media like Facebook, twitter, can be release or edit by anyone, and
    those information are unproven, but it will mislead the people who have no side,
    and it will be affect the fairness of democracy
- desc: I think that every program should be created keeping user in mind. Diverse
    user testing and research should be done. Also empthy and compassion are very
    important aspect.
- desc: In the last lecture, basically we discussed about the sympathy vs empathy.
    It was quite interesting for me and i am also more interested to learn more about
    it. Also, we discuss about the submission of project proposal.
- desc: professor told us that the topic for today's class is sympathy and empathy
    UX and discussed about the group projects.
- desc: "The meeting 14 began with a small discussion on the meeting response and\
    \ the professor elaborated briefly about the project proposal and also gave instruction\
    \ about the upcoming individual assignments. I would like to say that this class\
    \ was very useful from the point of view of project because\_ we got the clear\
    \ idea about what to do in the assignment.\n\nDr. Hepting told us that the topic\
    \ for today meeting was Sympathy and Empathy in UX. Sympathy is a reaction to\
    \ another person in the form of sorrow or pity but on the other hand Empathy is\
    \ to understand about the feeling of other person. I would like to know about\
    \ this topic.\_\_\n"
- desc: We mainly talked about topics and different topics for the project as well
    as postponed the dates for assignment 2 and project proposal.
- desc: In class we discussed about the project proposal and empathy map. And professor
    has answered to our all concerns. I am really excited to work on project.
- desc: This meeting we have discussed about the topic of the privacy. The conclusion
    were in our breakout room that we can't manage controlling the smart artificial
    intelligence. They can hear us and analysis our data and show us results that
    serve their benefit. The one of ways to protect ourselves is by deleting our cookies
    from the history search in our browsers.
