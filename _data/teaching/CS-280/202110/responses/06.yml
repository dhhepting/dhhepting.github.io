- desc: Our conversation about digital design and moral responsibility had me considering
    our obligations as tech creators to the disability community. I know a number
    of people who have accessability needs when it comes to digital content - some
    just need the ability to enlarge text due to natural deterioration of eyesight
    with age, while others are unable to read text either because of ocular issues
    or neurological conditions/injuries. For those who rely on text-to-speech readers
    to browse the internet, the way a website is encoded directly impacts their ability
    to access the content on that website - for example, a URL is a painstaking thing
    to read out or listen to, while alternate text could be used for a link to specify
    to the user what the link's purpose is and where it is going. Unless web design
    takes into account the needs of such users, those users can't fully take advantage
    of the Internet, which is often described as a public space that should be accessible
    to all. Despite the importance of accessible design, it seems to be a topic that
    is seldom mentioned in programming books or courses - so far, I've only seen the
    use of HTML tags that promote accessibility in a single book, and accessibility
    issues were very briefly touched on in a single module in CS 215.
- desc: 'In our 6th meeting we discussed about what should future designs be like.
    One example is getting rid of push doors that have handles since they waste time,
    infuriate and increase the stress of people. We also talked about possibly dangerous
    future designs of cars having bigger and bigger touchscreen which can distract
    the driver.


    We were also put in groups to talk about the responsiblities of programmers. One
    idea we had was to take in more privacy concerns like not silently activating
    a feature that a user does not know of. Another idea was to stop programmers from
    becomeing car salesman like with consumer coercion and implenting useless features,
    spam programs and polices. An example is when Window updates always reinstalls
    Windows Edge, a internet browser I do not use.'
- desc: "3 good designs\nDesign that subconsciously doesn\u2019t overwhelm the user.\
    \ Make the user experience fun, couldn\u2019t function well but fun, less frustrating.\
    \ Could be a harmful experience and put yourself at your risk by doing so. Fear\
    \ and anxiety can help you focus on your work because you\u2019re already thinking\
    \ about the risk of not getting your work done. Fear and anxiety are like taking\
    \ risk prediction; however, it is making your brain tunnel vision focus on that\
    \ fear and anxiety alone and not looking at the bigger picture. Visual, behavior,\
    \ reflective - attention you get from other people.\nCreative Confidence\nChild\
    \ confidence is something special and vulnerable. If they\u2019re too shy then\
    \ they won\u2019t be able to do anything by themselves. It\u2019s a tough task\
    \ when raising or teaching a child to encourage them toward their passion. I would\
    \ say a child's mind is full of fun and creative idea because they have a different\
    \ thinking process and they also don\u2019t have to deal with a lot of daily mundane\
    \ nuisance that adults have. Fear of judgment and social anxiety are likely coming\
    \ from their childhood. Confidence can be lost and gain. When you design something,\
    \ you need to think of the user, and how it going to affect you physically and\
    \ mentally. Responsible programming and creativity will improve the society around\
    \ you.\nFilter bubble discussion\nWhile I do appreciate the inputs from everybody.\
    \ There needs to be some organization in the meeting. Everybody can\u2019t just\
    \ yell out throw opinions like that in a class of over 100 students. Use the raised\
    \ hand signal is good. Some say no to the filter bubble because they want to see\
    \ everything. While some like the filter bubble with the preference that they\
    \ can set to see what they want without requiring AI tuning. I am more on the\
    \ side of the filter bubble with preference. Because without filter bubble, there\
    \ will be a huge information overload to the user and ruined their experience."
- desc: "Design and the Greater Good\n\nToday we watched multiple videos on design,\
    \ with the intent of considering what 'designing technology for the greater good'\
    \ means. This is the topic I want to bring to the discussion today.\n\nIn my opinion,\
    \ designing technology for the greater good means improving ease-of-use and making\
    \ technologies more enjoyable to use. If something is easier to use, more people\
    \ are able to use it. An easy-to-use technology that improves people's lives is\
    \ a great thing. Regarding enjoyment, if things are more enjoyable to use, it\
    \ makes the entire experience for the person using the technology more positive.\
    \ In this way, user enjoyment could definitely be considered a part of 'creating\
    \ technology for the greater good.' On the flip side, if people create difficult\
    \ to use technology that is also not enjoyable to use, that isn\u2019t exactly\
    \ adding value to people\u2019s lives!\n\nThere also needs to be a balance, however.\
    \ For example, filter bubbles are a good example an of ease-of-use in technology.\
    \ On websites, they filter out information that people don\u2019t want to see,\
    \ so they only see what they like. On the surface, this can be a real boon to\
    \ the average user of a website: It will give them more enjoyment from the site\
    \ in less time. Conversely, however, it raises issues about things like censorship\
    \ in media and also about what should and should not be filtered out of a person\u2019\
    s individualized website feed."
- desc: I got the impression that everyone has different opinions on how to fix the
    filter bubble problem. I think that the ideal solution is allowing users the option
    to enable filter bubbles. If a person thinks that they are a good idea, they can
    enable it. If a person would rather not have their experience altered by the app,
    they can have it their way, too. Everyone would be able to get their own ideal
    experience.
- desc: "https://youtu.be/KwdYUIQzu-o <---- Just a link to a silly sketch for a bit\
    \ of levity concerning the conversation we had about door design today. ;)\n\n\
    I really enjoyed the class conversation surrounding filter bubbles and our responsibilities\
    \ and obligations as computing specialists. A lot of clashing opinions! I agree\
    \ very much with Daryl that a lot of the conversation comes back around to transparency.\
    \ For me, I feel that if we expect the onus to fall on consumers to make choices\
    \ and take responsibility for the technology they use, then transparency about\
    \ that technology in terms of how it operates, its security measures,\_ and what\
    \ services it offers are really important in order for users to make informed\
    \ decisions.\n\nI appreciated the conversation on how often times we ask a lot\
    \ of \"how\" questions but not enough \"why\" questions when we are developing\
    \ our technology. I would like to learn more about how those conversations often\
    \ happen in terms of software or technology design, and how businesses go about\
    \ determining that their \"why\" is sufficient to implement the \"how\". Is that\
    \ a thing? Are there principles and protocols to follow in businesses? Do most\
    \ businesses follow an ethic at all or is it moreso just determined from company\
    \ to company? Do most companies have ethics/accessibility/diversity boards? So\
    \ many questions!\n\nGreat class today, I had a lot of fun! :)\n\n"
- desc: Todays Class we have learnt about how search engines yield the result of every
    query which is different in different locations.
- desc: During class I find it hard to think that company's should be forced or not
    forced to use filter bubbles. Personally when using social media I want to see
    what my friends post rather than just what the site thinks I want to see. However
    I think that as a private business they are allowed to use whatever algorithm
    they want. If consumer's do not want the use of filter bubbles they should seek
    and use options that have features that they want. It is the ouns of the consumer
    to be more aware of what they are using then to make laws to stop companies from
    making their own products.
- desc: 'I believe that the role of programming should always be intertwined with
    the focus of the greater good. The main goal of programming should be building
    something that will make somebody''s life easier. A programmer should always think
    about who is able to utilize their program and optimize it to be useful to the
    most diverse crowd possible. For example, when building an app, there should be
    options to aid the visually impaired and hearing impaired. For example, building
    another UI with larger and more defined icons for those that have poor vision.

    I believe that part of the greater good is being transparent with your users.
    Don''t hide things in your terms and conditions, inform the user of what algorithms
    you are using, and don''t sell their personal data to any bidders. Overall, just
    think to yourself, "Would I want a program that I use to do x or y?". If the answer
    is no, don''t do it.'
- desc: 'When designing solutions to "help others," one can often become enwrapped
    in a saviour complex, believing it is their duty to jump in and solve another
    person or group''s problems. Doing so without being invited by a group of people
    can be harmful, creating a divide. This may result in the act of "othering" the
    group being "helped," as well as placing the developers of the solution on a higher
    pedestal of self-righteousness. From both an anthropological and problem-solving
    perspective, this approach to serving the larger society is flawed.


    I believe it is essential, especially as a future computer professional, to consider
    our responsibility in designing technology for the greater good with collaboration
    at the forefront of the process. This would involve an interdisciplinary design
    process where computer professionals work alongside all types of people, such
    as communities the technology is being designed for, psychologists, business professionals,
    religion and ethics experts, educators, engineers, medical professionals, children,
    the elderly, people who are differently abled, and so on. Not only would this
    approach promote communication with a wider group of people, but it would also
    invite diverse perspectives and concerns.


    Having a wider range of perspectives and ideas would allow for a more wholistic
    approach to the design and development process. Furthermore, it would increase
    the designers'' ability to create technology that would cater to the specific
    needs of the target community, ensuring that these people are part of the conversation
    instead of simply being presented with the end product. In my opinion, this is
    the ultimate goal of design: to engage, communicate, and collaborate with communities,
    enhancing our everyday lives in an effort to support one another and decrease
    division.'
- desc: In this meeting, during break out room we discussed about the responsibility
    of a programmer, we all had same idea that programmers should give the choice
    of applying filter bubbles to the users. it should not be automatic or mandatory,
    instead it should be optional. As people can choose whether they want the filter
    bubble on their search or not. Like it will make easy for the users like if they
    are going to search for hospital or schools, then they will turn on the filter
    bubble so that they can see nearest locations of the building they searched. but
    on general topics or on news they should have option to turn off the filter bubble
    so that they can see the news all around the globe.
- desc: 'In the video, 3 ways designs make you happy.

    He talks about visceral, behavioral, and reflective designs, and how they contribute
    to something being beautiful and making you happy. I thought this video way very
    confusing and convoluted, but I will say that I do agree with him on some points.
    Beauty is what draws you towards something, and so there is definitely a visceral
    aspect to that because things that are unique and uncommon draw our attention.
    But that is only half the story, for something to be considered beautiful it typically
    has to be received with a pleasant response. I wouldn''t consider any of the products
    he showed in his slides to be beautiful because although they were unique they
    weren''t well designed. They weren''t indicative of natural or familiar forms
    so they didn''t instill a feeling of safety. They weren''t intricate or ornate
    so they didn''t feel impressive. They weren''t powerful or shocking so you didn''t
    get even get cathartic relief. Mostly my response to the designs was boredom and
    disgust at the pompous materialism. The best response I had was to the behavioral
    designs, which instilled a sense of curiosity for a couple of seconds until he
    explained what they were used for and then they were mildly interesting at most.'
- desc: 'After watching the videos, here is what i learnt.

    Way that good design make you happy- Fear brings focus and less distraction. Happiness
    brings creativity and more ideas which makes things work better. Behavioral design
    is all about the feel of your control. Most are done unconsciously"


    How to build your creative confidence - Fear of judgement makes people avoid creativity.
    People with fear of not been creative can be taken through a series of small succeses
    and this fear becomes familiarity.'
- desc: 'In our most recent discussion in breakout rooms, my group had the most trouble
    understanding/discussing "responsibilities of computing for the greater good",
    as we found the question too open ended and abstract. For one, we could not find
    a clear understanding of what the "greater good" actually meant or is. What is
    the "greater good"? Obviously, sometimes computing can be used maliciously and
    to the detriment of others (such as malware), but other times it is not as black
    and white. Take for example a platform like Facebook. Facebook can be used for
    a lot of good things (such as reconnecting with others or as an easy way to stay
    connected) but also a lot of bad things (spreading misinformation). What are Facebook''s
    responsibilities for the "greater good"? Should they censor misinformation so
    that less people fall for it (for example, if less people are exposed to COVID
    misinformation, perhaps more people will take COVID more seriously, and we will
    have less COVID cases)? If so, should other platforms like Facebook also take
    responsibility for the "greater good" and censor misinformation and if all platforms
    censor this misinformation then how much more censorship can we do for the "greater
    good". On the flip side, is it even ethical to censor this misinformation (how
    much censorship is OK if at all)? And if so, then we lose some of the freedoms
    of Facebook . Here, there are pros and cons of censoring this misinformation and
    if there are pros and cons, is there a "greater good" in this scenario? Perhaps
    the "greater good" is just meant to be hard to grasp and I will understand its
    meaning eventually.

- desc: After reviewing Don Norman's "3 Ways Good Design Makes You Happy" Ted Talk,
    it really put into perspective why a moral framework for creators is so crucial.
    He used a few products as his examples but it really applies to anything someone
    is using in their daily lives (could be a household item, technology, software,
    etc.). When people are using and interacting with these products, it is physically
    altering the state of their body. Making them feel certain emotions that are triggered
    subconsciously without the user recognizing exactly why they're feeling that emotion.
    If creators have the power to do this to another person through their work, of
    course it makes sense that there would be a moral framework attached to it. Even
    if it isn't something implicitly harmful, it is still important that we are thinking
    about these things and are conscience about how our work is impacting other people,
    good or bad.
- desc: In the last meeting, we discussed in our break-out rooms morals in coding
    and how many different software and services have become something that is in
    some cases harmful to the greater good of society. I found this topic very interesting
    because I couldn't agree more. I think that the more software and anything that
    humanity is able to produce with programming will come at a cost. Anything can
    be taken and used in a negative manner with one major goal in mind, that being
    profit. I think no matter what anyone does to try to keep a good moral compass,
    there will always be a mass of other people who are interested in taking something
    and turning it into a way to bleed money from everyday people. Everything we do
    on the computer and our phone is tracked and were constantly being marketed through
    programming to under the radar, corporations are always on a mission to get as
    much money out of people as they can. For us as students, I think all we can do
    is try to keep a good moral compass ourselves and not let money ever become our
    primary motive, but I don't see the problem ever changing in fact I can only see
    it get worse and worse.
- desc: 'the most important thing you learned from this past meeting?

    The most important thing learned from the past meeting is why is creative design
    important and how to build creative confidence. Both the video which was outlined
    in past meeting depict the same purpose and vey well explained by Dr. Norman and
    David Kelly.


    something you encountered that is related to the past meeting

    In the past meeting we discussed how search algorithm changes for the search engine
    when we describe something. One gets an example by Dr. Norman''s website when
    he searches "Design and Emotion" and "Design Emotion" (he gets different suggestions).'
- desc: 'As I saw a Ted Talk by Don Norman about how good design makes us happy, I
    came to know about three different aspects in which good design has an optimistic
    effect on our mindset. I feel the first one: Visceral is very much connected to
    the subconscious, since when people see unique things, they just buy them without
    knowing about it. That''s what happens to me a lot of times. In addition, there
    are 2 more forms that are behavioral and reflective that are really demonstrated
    well. Though I came to hear about this for the first time, I still got it the
    explanations that have been very useful to enhance my understanding.


    David Kelley''s video was just something that influenced my way of looking at
    life. I learned how a little appreciation or depreciation will effectively create
    or break the confidence of an individual. I realized upon seeing this video how
    a little confidence grants us an entirely new perspective and motive for life.
    It made me recall the incidence of the younger brother of my friend who had a
    water phobia but grew up to be a swimming teacher after being healed by a psychiatrist.
    Really, a little support in building trust holds the strength of transforming
    the entire life of an individual in a positive way.'
- desc: "Don Norman\u2019s video \u201C3 Ways Good Design Makes you Happy\u201D ,\
    \ tells about people\u2019s subconscious mind. And according to him , design can\
    \ be recognized in three ways : Visceral , Behavioral and Reflective. First two\
    \ are connected to subconscious mind while the last one is connected to conscious\
    \ mind. Visceral : We humans are attracted towards bright colors, nice cars or\
    \ fancy bottles in subconscious state of mind. This happens with everyone and\
    \ once happened with me too. I didn\u2019t get the concept of Behavioral. In Reflective\
    \ , we usually buy things that we can show off , or which can consciously make\
    \ feel good.\n\nDavid Kelley in his video discussed about his emotional stories\
    \ but I was not able to find how to be build creative confidence. He also talked\
    \ about phobia. The treatment which was done by Albert Bandura . He use to tell\
    \ people that there is snake in next room , and when they are comfortable they\u2019\
    d taken to window where they could see snake, eventually they become so familiar\
    \ that they don\u2019t feel afraid from snakes anymore. This type of incident\
    \ happened with my roommate , he used to get scared whenever he sees dogs around\
    \ him. But later on he ended up getting puppy as his new friend."
- desc: 'The video about bad doors shows how we as in a society face some common psychological
    issues and how the our brain has been accustomed to believe how a thing should
    be used/treated based on its shape.


    In class, we discussed our responsibility as a computer programmer towards the
    society for greater good. In group discussion, we discussed how a person''s security
    should be a huge concern, and violating a person''s private boundary is unethical.
    We came to a conclusion that the contents that we see or are provided to us should
    be customized by us. That is we should be given an option to choose that what
    type of news we would like; filtered or unfiltered. The advantages and disadvantages
    of filter bubble has been also discussed.

    '
- desc: In the TED talk by Don Norman he talks about design and its importance, and
    this heavily applies to the area of computer science and programming. Programmers
    have to think about not just how their creation will work but also how good it
    looks to users and how appealing it is to bring in new users. If a programmer
    makes a really cool app that they want people to start using then they have to
    make it look interesting to people to attract new users. But there has to be a
    balance between how something looks and how well it functions, for example if
    an app looked absolutely amazing from the outside making everyone want to get
    it but when they start using it nothing works as advertised but it looks great
    then that is poor design. another example from the opposite side of that spectrum
    is if an app looks like garbage but its functionality is phenomenal and it works
    great it won't be able to attract any users since it looks like crap making it
    a bad design. Programmers need to balance appearance and functionality in their
    designs to make the creation enjoyable for everyone.
- desc: 'In the first video the host talks about the subconcious activity the mind
    does and lot of things it does without us knowing or basically the explanation
    at least i dont have, the three level of mind was very intresting topic i learned
    from the video and also the nature of feeling controlled.

    In the second video the new term "Guided mastery", i learned which was kind of
    a ignored term according to me, and i believe the theory of taking baby steps
    towards the fear such as the first scenario he talked about the creative blockage,
    which will reintroduce them with the work.'
- desc: "In the last meeting, we talked about two main topics: design, GameStop shares\
    \ sell off after Robinhood, TD and other brokerages move to limit trading.\n\n\
    First, I would like to speak of design after watching two Ted videos \u201C3 ways\
    \ good design makes you happy\u201D by Don Norman and \u201CHow to build your\
    \ creative confidence\u201D by David Kelley.\n\nFor \u201C3 ways good design makes\
    \ you happy\u201D by Don Norman, a good design is about neat and fun, like the\
    \ two example he shows us, the Philippe Starck juicer and fish interaction Ping-pong\
    \ table, juicer is neat and fun, the ping-pong table is not the good way of ping-pong\
    \ but it\u2019s fun! And for the clever design of google, they zipped thousands\
    \ of results numbers by many O\u2019s by page. Which is also a funny design. That\
    \ is in the subconscious area to pleasing you. And the subconscious will affect\
    \ your behavior. When you are anxious about something and happy about something\
    \ your action is different. And they are in levels of processing, the first level\
    \ is visceral-level design, using bright colors to attract people\u2019s attention\
    \ or to avoid the things that people don't like. The middle level is behavioral\
    \ level .A good design makes you feel that you are in control, to make you feel\
    \ the product can do the work very well. And the third level is reflective, people\
    \ will think oppositely about the product sometimes, use that as a way to catch\
    \ people's attention is also a good design.\n\nFor\u201CHow to build your creative\
    \ confidence\u201D by David Kelley, when someone doubts or denies your creativity,\
    \ do not let it affect you and ruin your confidence. By an example of how Dr.\
    \ Bandura\u2019s \u201Cguided mastery\u201D, there is a therapy to cure the fear\
    \ of failure, he leads those people who fear snakes to like the snake, and those\
    \ people become more confident in future, which is called \u201Cself-efficacy\u201D\
    . This therapy can be also used for the people\u2019 s creativity has been judged.\
    \ Like in Doug Dietz\u2019s example, he successfully beat the fear and created\
    \ another brilliant cute MRI machine for medical goods. So, do not let fear beat\
    \ you, you deserve to have great creativity.\n\nFor the article: \u201CGameStop\
    \ shares sell off after Robinhood, TD and other brokerages move to limit trading.\u201D\
    , this article shows how stockbrokers affect people\u2019s behavior and the economy\
    \ of the whole stock market by the limit of buying some stock of a company like\
    \ Gamestop\u2026 makes the stock\u2019s price rising up, and when the government\
    \ ask him to stop the limitation, the stock\u2019s price falling down very quickly.\
    \ That's why we should have our own judgment of economics not being led by these\
    \ stockbrokers."
- desc: I really found the news about Robinhood restricting trading in shares including
    GameStop amid dizzying run-up interesting. The brokerages decided to make a move
    to restrict trading after they see the immense profits being made by traders .
    I believe this is a political move because the hedge funds was trying to buy into
    it and right now the price is pumped back up. (rich just trying to keep getting
    rich)
- desc: People will be attracted by some specific things, such as good design. It
    is also worked in internet. Through the Ted talk 3 Ways Good Design Makes you
    Happy, we can know that are ways to attract people. These ways of design is really
    strategic and should be used for us in many ways like programming or designing.
    When designing things, we should also focus on people's psychology and think about
    what kind of things can attract others most.
- desc: 'meeting 6 started with GameStop news and made its way through the filter
    bubble.

    a question was asked for the breakout rooms, what as a computer professional one
    should do while providing its service to the public.

    -we discussed some moral value of a programmer like making the service public-friendly,
    letting them choose what content they want on their screen rather than imposing
    their search-related content and trapping them into a filter bubble, in this way
    people will get to know both sides of the paper and will help to eradicate the
    manipulating and mind driven tactics which are currently used by google ads and
    social networking sites.'

- desc: for me the most important topic of this class was the concept of what obligation
    the programmer has to producing programs that improve quality of life. in my opinion
    the programmer is first responsible to complete the task they are given assuming
    it does violate there own moral code. the secondary responsibility is to insure
    that there are no easy way to violate the users rights as best they can.
- desc: In the breakout room of meeting 6, we are taking about the impact of stocks
    and the volatility of the stock market.
- desc: 'From the bad door video, it was interesting to learn that even though we
    are technologically advancing every day, we still have issues with usability on
    products that were invented many years ago like doors. I learned that observation
    and feedback are very important in innovation and improvement. As engineers, we
    have the responsibility to take many things into consideration to create user-friendly
    software and products.


    The topic of discussion today was regarding our responsibilities with advancement
    in technology for the greater good. Similar to discussions in previous classes,
    filter bubble is one of the major issues in this topic. Collecting and using personal
    data should be done with caution to respect the privacy of others. I think automation
    is also a major issue. As companies move toward automation to save costs, many
    people are losing jobs. We have responsibility as a society to think of people
    who do not have the same opportunities and resources.'
- desc: "Door Designs\n\nThe video\
    \ posted by Vox Media on YouTube, titled \u201CIt\u2019s not you. Bad doors are\
    \ everywhere\u201D relates to the design of the push/pull handle on certain doors.\
    \ Serving as a gateway into a more enlightened discussion about design and design\
    \ centric ideas. It\u2019s easily proven that good UI/UX serves to enable the\
    \ user further. Giving them an option that\u2019s chosen based on instinct. It\
    \ relates quite easily to doors since they are the almost the one thing that everyone\
    \ in this world interacts with on a daily basis. Even within your own house, the\
    \ tirade of doors doesn\u2019t end. It only makes more sense to have them setup\
    \ in such a way that doesn\u2019t confuse the enterer or passerby. The second\
    \ critical take-away is the design centric nature of the world, how humans do\
    \ have an initial instinct that guides them to taking a certain decision over\
    \ the other. By subtly convincing our subconscious mind on which way to act, we\
    \ can make our lives quite a bit easier."
- desc: Both the videos uploaded under meeting 6 were helpful. I understand how much
    is the design important whether the projects is worth or not also after watching
    the second video developed understanding about creative confidence. I still wanted
    to learn more about the creative confidence if possible can get more links to
    read or some type of discussion related to that would be great to develop a brief
    idea about the term.
- desc: 'From first video I learned that being happy and positive helps you think
    out of box and come up with revolutionary ideas. Happiness helps us being creative
    and deadlines help us being focused. We need to have a balance of both being creative
    and being focused.


    Second video talked about creative confidence and how creativity is suppressed
    by negative feedback. I learned that creative confidence can be achieved by anyone
    who wants to be creative. There aren''t any non-creative people just people who
    believe they are non-creative. Anyone that is willing to put in effort and follow
    creative principals can become creative.


    Bad doors are everywhere video explained that bad designs are everywhere around
    us. We need more products with Human-Centered-Design that provide discoverability
    and feedback. I believe products made keeping Human-Centred-Design in mind are
    usually more popular.'
- desc: I agree with the idea that was brought up that we should have the option to
    choose on whether or not a filter bubble should be used.
- desc: When we talk about programming for the greater good it's hard to define. So
    many things are meant to be for the greater good but then people find exploits
    and ways to use it in ways that go against the good of humanity. For example people
    use Facebook to connect with people, which could be seen as something that is
    for the greater good. On the otherside people use facebook to scam others and
    spread misinformation, which can be seen as something that is against the greater
    good. It should be the responsibility of programmers to make things that have
    no evil uses but that is hard to do, people are smart and are able to twist things
    to work in different ways. It's a moral conundrum.
- desc: 'In the lecture, we discussed about anomie. Anomie is a cultural condition
    characterized by lack of any ethical values, guidelines to be followed by individuals.
    Anomie may arise from disagreement of belief systems and induce the problems of
    social relationships among people and groups. The video 3 ways good design makes
    you happy by Don Norman. In 2003 his talk, layout critic Don Norman transforms
    his thoughtful eye to beauty, pleasurable, happiness and emotion as he stares
    at the architecture which brings happiness among people. He identifies the three
    emotional states which must be hit by a well-designed item in order to be successful.
    According to dawn, Design could be seen in 3 stages: Visceral experience; it''s
    all about the texture, touch and feel of the application, the pattern of actions;
    the connection between both the reader and the item; (function, performance, usability)
    and Reflective experience; is all about the significance of the item, the signal
    the item sends to the others. The second video how to build creative confidence
    by David Kelly, is your school or workplace divided between "creatives" and practical
    people? Yet definitely, as David Kelley indicates, creative thinking may not be
    the domain of several chosen ones. Sharing tales from his legendary career in
    architecture as well as his own existence, he provides ways to build confidence
    and trust.'
- desc: "From the first video I learned how the visceral level, behavioral level and\
    \ reflective level design makes happy.Learned about what the visceral level is\
    \ all about like what we like or dislike .Usability and understanding of design\
    \ also includes feel.\nThe last thing which I learned is reflective level.it is\
    \ easy and important for a good design to get attention by it usage or beauty.\n\
    \nThe second video taught us how to gain creative confidence with the help of\
    \ self efficacy.everyone is creative in their own kind of way ,we can\u2019t divide\
    \ world into creative and non-creative.It\u2019s all about people ideas,every\
    \ idea is creative in many ways."
- desc: 'In the recent meeting, we talked about how to design a particular web design
    for greater good? I consider this as a really important issue now because the
    ethics in computing is decreasing gradually. The reason being is, there are several
    illegal activities done behind the curtains what we call is Dark Web.


    I think a developer should design a platform in such a way that doesn''t harm
    people''s sentiment and maintain the proper integrity.


    Mediocre people find it really hard to connect with the technology that is being
    developed now. With the pace, the technology is heading in such a way that AIs
    and blockchain would really be threating in the near future is some aspects. Although,
    It also has advantages such as clean tech will simplify the ways to sustain the
    climate change. I feel technology would play a severe role in climate change with
    clean tech that some companies are developing currently.'
- desc: 'In meeting 6, we talked about design and the control that a developer has
    on the way his product is marketed and consumed by the consumers, is majorly dependent
    on its design. The more user-friendly, attention-grasping the design is, the more
    the consumer is attracted to it, even if it is not of much use to them. The concept
    of aesthetically pleasing items, with little to no practical use has been the
    reason why people buy them to ''decorate'' their surroundings. How many times
    have you ordered some tech device from Amazon, which you had no ''need'' for and
    could possibly do without it, just because it looked attractive? Majority of you
    would answer in the positive.

    A healthy human eye has three cones which help us register about 100 different
    color shades. This evolutionary perk differs us from other mammals such as dogs
    who only have 2 cones and can only register about 20 different color nuances.
    As a result, we can use this perk to design things which appeal to people and
    hence they have a better chance of using our products.

    '
- desc: 'We discussed how important is the design and the structure of the platform
    especially for social networking site. In the breakup room we discussed about
    should tech companies use filter bubble on us, it was a great discussion that
    we donot required filter bubble for sccial networking sites, news sites but it
    is important for the social networking sites to disclose how they use filter bubble
    and the algorithm they use must be made public hence they cannot do any fishy
    business.

    The the concept that I want to learn more is about how can we design and structure
    this sites to make it better and safe for the user.'
- desc: 'In this meeting, it was worth to discuss about the shortage of new creative
    ideas in the class breakout rooms and it was also interesting to know that why
    filter bubbles are bad for us.

    other than that, i have viewed the two given videos in which the first one was
    about Design and emotion and i got to know about three steps; intense fear and
    anxiety, behavior /subconscious and reflection.

    second video was about design and happiness in which he talked about the visualization
    of happiness through designs. Apart from that, i really had difficulty in completely
    understanding the concept of that you tube video that we discussed in class.'
- desc: Can anyone tell me that what we have to do in this course??
- desc: "what I learned from the last meeting is that the internet has memory and\
    \ you don't have any privacy on the internet. Everyone is responsible for what\
    \ they post on the Internet. Things on the Internet not only affect yourself but\
    \ also affect others. The Internet is not a place of lawlessness. As far as the\
    \ current course is concerned, I have not encountered any difficulties. In future\
    \ courses, I want to learn more about the Internet and society\u3002"
- desc: 'In this meeting we discussed about the filter bubble in detail and also did
    the group activity by joining the breakout rooms.


    In breakout rooms we discussed pros and cons about the filter bubble, we discussed
    about what apple is doing in today''s market to gain the profit, like only showing
    the apps and games created by them and not showing or allowing 3rd party applications.


    Some of the benefits of filter bubble is that we will only see the things that
    we are interested in and not the other irrelevant things.


    Some of the drawbacks are that we will not even know what is going on in other
    sectors, and lack knowledge.'
- desc: To expand on the question we were given last day during the break-out rooms,
    we were to ponder if we as 'computer professionals' have an obligation or responsibility
    in designing technology for the greater good. The consensus that we came to was
    obviously yes -- because otherwise what exactly is the point? Seems a bit silly
    really to even question, unless someone is getting into computer science to do
    nefarious activities with their skills (such as phishing or something), it should
    be our responsivity to ensure that we are designing good, lawful, technology that
    is intuitive and accessible to everyone. Examples of this off the top of my mind
    could be providing closed captioning or image descriptions, perhaps even a colour
    blind mode. By providing these services we allow a greater amount of people to
    utilize our programs, websites, etc.
- desc: Well from meeting 6 and from my breakout room discussion in that meeting I
    learned that there are mixed responses about the filter bubble thing. From the
    TedX I discovered why designing is important and to what extend. What I did not
    like about this meeting is how unmanaged we were after the breakout rooms. I am
    looking forward to having more planned and productive meetings.
- desc: From the recent class on Thursday, I got to know about the google search engine.
    The most interesting fact was that the google search results are generates on
    the basis of location of the user and the seraph engine display them according
    to the rank of the webpage. The ranking of any webpage depends upon the number
    of traffic on the webpage or how much the page was further shared by the person
    who is consuming data from the page . In short and to encapsulate the class it
    was fun to learn about computer space by the videos and for me both lecture this
    week was interconnected and I highly appreciate the idea of creating discussion
    group of the students which open the door of sharing thoughts of each others.
    Some time its more interesting to know the views of other who are pursing the
    same course with you in order to progress better and avoid mistakes .
- desc: 'Meeting 6 Response:


    I think that this is a pretty general issue, and really depends on the individual
    user and their needs. I think generally people should care more about the information
    they see and the sources it comes from, but I also understand the desire to be
    able to step away and just let some intelligence pull up the first site for you.
    It''s similar to how when we google, we usually only look at the first few results.
    Really, there''s just too much information out there for us to dig through anyways,
    I don''t think letting go of the control of choosing your sites as much worse
    than this. It''s really just about the convenience of it all. I think it is definitely
    important to recognize that these are systems and services developed by humans
    though, and that this could mean a lot of things as to the sorts of content we
    might be seeing and who might be able to see or even manipulate how these systems
    respond to us. Techonology has always really just been about improving the human
    experience, with big pushes for automation and ease of use tools. I don''t see
    this ever changing, and like with many things, it just comes down to people knowing
    to use it responsibly and not put too much into letting machines do everything
    for us.


    Meeting 5 Response:


    I thought the example of the search for Egypt in the talk showed one of the ways
    these filtering systems could really be dangerous. While one person got very general
    information about Egypt, the other saw news of protests and unrest. Most people
    never look pass the first page of Google, and these two results at a glance both
    paint very different images of what might be going on/has gone on in Egypt. While
    we weren''t really able to reproduce these sorts of results in class, I think
    it''s easy to see how these could effect people differently when trying to access
    information on such subjects. Like in the quote from Mark Zuckerburg, the stuff
    that''s right in front of us is kind of the stuff that seems to matter the most
    to us; the stuff that''s put right in front of us on the internet is the stuff
    we''ll latch on to and base our thoughts and opinions off of. When others start
    manipulating what is put right in front of us, this could easily become very malicious,
    or even just very misleading for people by mistake.'
- desc: 'from this last meeting the thing that i learned is the one is about the filter
    bubbles that is they useful to us or not and then the breakout room discussion
    question that is also so interesting one that what should we do and want to do
    if we got the opportunity to do anything in the CS field for creating a new ideas,

    other than that i also get some information by viewing a new given videos in which
    the first video is explaining about the design and motion from which i got the
    knowledge about the new three steps are intense fear, behavior and anxiety.

    and then the second video is about the visualization of happiness through the
    design.

    well its all so new and interest full for me.'
- desc: Last meeting I learned a lot about the stock market. I learned about short
    selling, a little more about how shares work in general, and the power the Robinhood
    app had over the market. Last meeting also brought into question whether or not
    the decision to limit trading was a morally sound decision from the people at
    Robinhood. However, on the other hand, the people of reddit caused firms to lose
    billions because of short selling. There is no denying the change a group of people
    rallying on the internet can lead. Many people believed that the restrictions
    to trading from banks and Robinhood was an attack on the free market. On one side,
    there are groups of people trying to get rich quick, while on the other there
    are groups of people trying to hold on to their riches. Robinhood has clearly
    chosen it's side, and in my opinion, while I might not agree with the efforts
    of the people on reddit, I understand why Robinhood's decision might feel like
    one tailored to the corporate side of things. It is truly hard for me to say whether
    or not the people of reddit or Wall Street firms were cheated out of their money,
    but I might just be interested enough to do more research and find out.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt after watching ted by David Kelly is that
    we should not give up on things that are really important in our lives instead
    we should focus on that things and this could only be done if we all gain this
    confidence. We all should let our ideas fly and do what we are suppose to do so
    that we could reach a place called creative confidence.
- desc: 'The most important thing I learned was from the video on how to build your
    creative confidence.


    I found this to be interesting because it talks about how people who are scared
    of actually accomplishing certain tasks should not believe they aren''t good enough.
    The video made me realize how we are all naturally creative, and all one needs
    is to set their mind onto something and we will be abe to achieve good results.
    A good way to become confident about ideas, goals and tasks can be taking small
    steps to attain results.'
- desc: Norman is a psychologist and cognitive scientist. So his writing of his grievance
    was so incredibly comprehensive that he changed the way design works. His "human-centred
    design" revolution has changed not only how designers work, but also how people
    work in areas such as public health to make the world a better place. That's why
    Melinda Gates believes human-centred design is one of the changes that could save
    the world. To see how all this has to do with lousy doors. If one slows down to
    pay attention, there are Norman doors everywhere, and most of them aren't really
    doors at all.
- desc: In the first video, we learned about design and emotion, also learned other
    three steps. The break out room in which we discussed regarding filter bubble
    and related concepts. Moreover, the second video was regarding the good visualization
    and design which was quite good in understanding. More influencing the design
    will be, the more interactive it will be for the user.
- desc: In last class we discussed about about being in computer science field what
    technology we will bring.Further we also discussed about filter bubble and learnt
    how filter bubble will bring change in result.
- desc: For meeting 6, we discussed about designs and our responsibility as IT Professionals
    towards design and I just wanna say that according to me, we need to design things
    considering their effects 5 years from now. That being said, some things to look
    out for would be it's reflections of our thoughts! We need to design something
    that would not be deemed hostile after years. With social media having such a
    huge impact, our biggest challenge has to be to design something public friendly!
- desc: The GameStop stock situation showed an example of ethics when the Robinhood
    investing app blocked people from investing in the GameStop stock during the most
    important days. Robinhood was obviously being manipulated by hedge fund billionaires
    to stop people from participating in the free market, which I believe is very
    wrong.
- desc: 'Regarding the videos, it shows the importance of implementing creativity
    into our work and how it should be encouraged. What the second video mentioned
    about encouragement is certainly true, when I was in preschool my teacher told
    me that my drawing was terrible, and it certainly has been a psychological burden
    to come over to try to overcome the "I''m bad at this, why bother". Same thing
    we can apply to coding or design, it is hard to want to learn new coding methods
    and new solutions if we are down ourselves, or are told by others that we are
    terrible at it, when the first video goes to show how creating unique or "fun"
    ways of solving problems is both good for the mind as well as more enjoyable for
    the end user. It shows the importance of being happy and positive encouragement,
    to be confident in our own ability in order to make the end product better. Additionally,
    regarding being analytical vs creative, they do go hand in hand. You can be analytical
    to identify the problem at hand, and even if you think you aren''t very creative,
    you may come up with a solution to fix it that can vary drastically compared to
    how someone else would have approached it, which can be seen as its own form of
    creativity.

    '
- desc: Well from what i learn is that really i understand that we as progrmaers need
    to push the common good since in my mind its like asking the construction worker
    how do you push the common good. Seconed that i dont see how the search engine
    are discriminting against people really theres no benifit to it at all. I mean
    All it is the links are just a massive popularity contest
- desc: Anomie, additionally spelled as anomy.it implies that in social orders or
    people a state of shakiness coming about because of a breakdown of guidelines
    and values or from an absence of direction or standards. Durkheim considers anomie
    to be a condition of social breaking down. Subsequently, general social guidelines
    are not, at this point noticed the aggregate request breaks down, and a condition
    of anomie arises. The results of this are expanded self-destruction and crime
    percentages. Anomie is additionally interpreted as normlessness, when things occur
    in the public eye, change happens so quickly and we don't have the foggiest idea
    what the standards are. In a general public that is anomic, it is disappointing,
    befuddling, and in any event, upsetting, to travel through regular day to day
    existence, particularly in case we're focusing on what is happening. so it implies
    when individuals have no wellspring of carrying on with regular day to day existence
    impeccably so they discover another approach to endure like a few people transform
    into criminal or a few people do a road singing, moving to procure something on-premise
    of their ability to get by in regular daily existence. so thus anomie a condition
    of social disorder.
- desc: In our last class we checked bing, duckduck and some other website to check
    on filter bubble once again. The interesting part was the vox video on bad doors
    are everywhere. I watched the video way before randomly. The video talks about
    how design is suppose to be user friendly. It should not give us the hint to do
    the opposite of what is suppose to happen. When our design inherently tells us
    what we are suppose to do with it, we can make better use of it, hence making
    every stuff more user friendly. I will say its basically hints that we get in
    video games, like use fire charm to fight the dragon but use water magic for golums.
- desc: From the videos, I found it fascinating how our subconscious works towards
    the things we do regularly. Also, how we, humans look at objects in a totally
    different way than we think. For example, the luxurious watch we buy to show others
    how good it looks rather than buying a cheap and more functional watch just because
    it is not as good looking as the first one. In the second video, I learned what
    a cruel comment or discouragement can do to someone psychologically.
- desc: In the Thursday' s meeting we discussed about our responsibilities as a professional
    programmer for doing something good for the society. Also, we discussed in the
    breakout rooms that we should keep in mind about the privacy of the people and
    all that but after watching the video on gaining creative confidence. The example
    of Doug Dietz give me a clear view about how we can do better for society with
    our creativity. That was so interesting to know.
- desc: In the meeting, we were put into the breakout rooms where we discussed the
    term "Greater Good". In this modern world, all these tech companies claim to create
    new innovative ideas for the betterment of humans and for the greater good. Although
    we discussed that how at the end of the day it's all about profit. Sure all this
    new technology helps people to live a better life but still, companies will never
    sell a product if they don't get any kind of profit. Also, I've watched the two
    videos where Don Norman in the first video talks about three ways a good design
    will make you happy. He talks about fear and anxiety, subconscious behavior and
    reflection. In the second video, David Kelley talks about building your creative
    confidence and how to visualize happiness through design.
- desc: I can see how many people would call themselves "not the creative type", as
    David Kelly describes. Many people are quick to dismiss their abilities, or their
    potential, because they are slightly discouraged at an early stage in their progress.
    The example given in the talk is of a boy in third grade creating a sculpture,
    but this concept can apply to many things. This information will make me more
    conscious about encouraging other people in their own development, and seeing
    where I may have been discouraged in a similar way.
- desc: In meeting 6, I have learned about emotion is one of the factory that influence
    people. For me, I hate assignment in university having deadline; deadline make
    me feel uncomfortable on the day before it due. In the video of meeting 6, the
    talker said that deadline will produce anxiety to make people pay attention on
    finish the job. On contrary, positive emotion is help on get new ideas. I can
    not say anxiety is exactly bad or positive emotion is exactly good, it depend
    on what situation am I on. Such as deadline, I feel uncomfortable of it; but I
    have to say it push me to plan my daily schedule.
- desc: 'hey,

    In the last class I really enjoyed how we able to give our thoughts on the videos
    we watched with the other students in the breakout rooms as well as the different
    perspectives of other students on the videos.'
- desc: In the last meeting, discussing about our responsibilities as a programmer
    was quite interesting for me to discuss. I want to know more about that what else
    we can do for making our technology better so that it will serve for the good
    of the society.
- desc: I've encountered many instances of people who were afraid of things they didn't
    understand including myself. I used to be afraid of jumping in the deep end of
    the pool as a kid because of all I've heard about how dangerous water can be,
    but once you do it once in a safe environment like at a more shallow end, it's
    much easier to work your way up into comfort. I'll be conscious of this in the
    future when introducing new concepts to people by first giving a simple example,
    many times have I seen people become disinterested in a topic solely because of
    how daunting the most complex part of it may be. By being aware of this, I can
    retain people's interest in a subject even if it may be complex.
- desc: 'The first video talked about how one can buildup creative confidence.

    I learnt that the term self-efficacy is the sense that one can change the world
    with everything one can do.


    Fear and anxiety cause one to do what is called deaf processing to be a focus
    and not being distracted'
- desc: Don Norman wrote the Norman door that Norman door is a message that we need
    to do the opposite of what we are is the key to solving many problems. Things
    require principles called discoverability and repeat the process until we have
    a solution spread worldwide to solve the issues. Problems are doors and doors
    are confusing, and we need to discover what we can do.
- desc: "I can\u2019t help but wonder just how many of us are actually driven to design\
    \ technology for the greater good. It is more common that many people will be\
    \ hired on to slave away at a desk for a salary. The contribution an employee\
    \ gives will only help to further someone else\u2019s financial success. Perhaps\
    \ computer ethics should be merged with entrepreneurship, so that we not only\
    \ challenge the idea of why we design technology, but also set out to create leaders."
- desc: The importance of structure and design is very important in humans life. Though
    it may not be visible to an individual but it affects how they approach different
    tasks in their life. If the things are not managed or not in the according to
    what is expected, it may result in difficulties to complete the stuff. Moreover,
    if the person is made happy, they can achieve things they cannot think of.
- desc: "The video by Don Norman \u201C3 Ways Good Design Makes You Happy\u201D has\
    \ an impact on our subconscious mind. Based on what he said in the video Design\
    \ has 3 ways of consideration Behavioral, Reflective and Visceral. A good design\
    \ makes you to feel that you are in charge, to make you to feel the item can accomplish\
    \ the function admirably. The ideas that emerge with these designs need a lot\
    \ of time and hard work."
- desc: 'Well in the last meeting we got information about the different topics like
    about the filter bubbles that how they are harmful to us and then we discuss a
    topic in breakout room discussion on which is the new one and interesting one
    for us as what should we want to do in science field like the what inventory we
    have to do that is good for the my field by

    Apart form that i viewed two videos that is given by Prof. in which i got information
    about the new topic the first video is about design and emotion in which i learned
    about the three main steps that is intense fear , anxiety and behaviour And the
    second video is about the happiness through the design. These all are so interested
    for me. I am really enjoying this course.'
- desc: 'In the first video we learned about how good creation of design make individual
    feel good. Here we learned about three aspects in which good creation has very
    important effects on our minds. In addition, there are two more forms that are
    behavioral and reflective that are demonstrated well.


    In the second video, we learned about little appreciation or desppeciation will
    effectively or brake the confidence of people.lastly, a littsupport in building
    can hold the strength of changing the entire life of an individual in positive
    way'
- desc: I learned from the video "how to build a Creative confidence" if you stick
    with the process and work with things you can be super innovative at the end.
    It also like you have to take step by step in order to build your confidence.
    Once you start making your self comfortable you can sometime surprise yourself
    how innovative you can be.
- desc: Things have changed a lot from past and are gonna change further in future
    which gonna be benefits users in terms of time consumption. Filter bubbles are
    used in search engine, social media and many platforms provide best user experience
    than ever before
- desc: I enjoyed the discussions on the filter bubbles with the other students as
    it allowed me understand why some people may or may not want to have filter bubbles
- desc: Creative confidence is also very important for an individual to become a good
    human being who believes in supporting society and its growth. It changes the
    way in which we look at things and make them so that we can make others happy.
- desc: The fact that all these sources and search engines restrict us from viewing
    everything but specifically brings up what we want grows this ignorance in everyone.
    The people who were reading the false stories keeps on reading those false stories
    and aren't ever shown the things that are true and have been proved. The covid
    vaccine is a big thing, people think its bad, no one should think that, this is
    created by a team of very smart people in order to stop a pandemic and save our
    economy. People who don't take the vaccine and live past this event go on to tell
    their grandchildren that you wont need it and this creates more ignorance in the
    world as those people will have restricted knowledge as if they search "is covid
    vaccine bad?" they will get the results they want unintentionally not knowing
    if its right or wrong.
- desc: In last class we discussed in groups, being in the field of computers what
    kind of new technology could you bring. Accordingly, what first thing comes to
    my mind is security and safety about users data secondly it should be superior
    to what we already have, easily accessible to all. Further in last meeting I learned
    about filter bubbles that how filter bubbles bring so much change to an individuals
    search results.
- desc: According to me, the things which have the important place in our life to
    take decision requires us to be mentally and physically happy. Happiness comes
    from the things around us. We have structed house and planned cities because it
    makes us feel more organised and thus, happy. Structures and design plays an important
    role to govern an individual's decision making power. It is seen that if a person
    is treated well, they show an extraordinary results in completing a task when
    conpared with other individuals. Similarly, if a person is happy it will automatically
    enhance there creativity which is an essential thing to have. Everyone has there
    own creative power and they should develop there creative confidence and work
    with it for a better society.
- desc: "The two video I have watched are both very interesting an fun. The first\
    \ video \u201C3 ways good design makes you happy\u201D was about fun. people usually\
    \ buy anything just because how they are fun looking and interesting not because\
    \ how they work. The speaker gave an example about watch how people like to show\
    \ off their expensive watch because they are stylish, but no one is interested\
    \ for the cheap watch even though they have better functionality. It is because\
    \ the cheap watch looks ugly. This video gives a message that fund and interesting\
    \ deign make an item valuable.\nIn the other video \u201CHow to build you creative\
    \ confidence\u201D is about believe in self capability. People usually don\u2019\
    t want to do anything different or creative in a fear that some one will judge\
    \ them or thinking they might not creative. But if someone inspire them or force\
    \ them to work on something new at the end they get surprised by their own ability.\
    \ The message from this video we get is we always should take small steps to win\
    \ our fear and try something new to discover our hidden talents.\nI liked both\
    \ of the videos, as they were both taught us different things"
- desc: The essential thing to make things look good and pleasing is to have neatness.
    Neatness comes with design and structure. More the things are structured and have
    a good design, the more it has neatness in itself and look good to ourself. It
    is psychology and it is proven the neatness makes a person happy. If the surrounding
    is neat and structured, it enchances the ability of a person to complete there
    task. Also, with a happy mind creative confidence can be achieved. Creative confidence
    makes a person believe in becoming a good human being who helps the society to
    grow and this is a what people forget in there daily life.
- desc: 'So here in the first video of Don Norman he was explaining best ways for
    a good design. He also gave few examples on it. Moreover, in second video David
    Kelly gave knowledge of building a confidence with giving example of Doug Dietz.
    So now let''s see something new and discuss in next class.'
- desc: We discussed in the class about the importance of design. How big impact can
    the design have on the success of a product. Sometimes people buy stuff that they
    don't even need but it just looks good compared to a product which works great
    but doesn't look good. This shows that modern society people care a lot about
    the design and might even pay a bit extra just because the product looks good.
- desc: In group we discussed about filter bubble and experimented it by searching
    for clothes in google. We got different pages and result because one group mate
    got searches related to women clothes because he was looking to buy clothes for
    his mom while other simply got images of normal clothes. So we discussed about
    the factor on which google shows us a particular result. But later as discussed
    in video that something should be in control in our hand so we tried to find out
    solution and I came up with a idea of field filter when you search for let say
    cloth then google should also ask you for relativeness. Like if there is some
    related to research then it should go under science field pricing goes under commerce
    filed and so on. So in these way we can get to see what we want and required for
    us to see because usually we do not know what we have not seen and it might be
    really useful for us. So yes these the topic where I would like to know more about.
    And lastly the videos were amazing and concept is explained in really simple way
    so would love to see more videos like these in future and as well as try to find
    on youtube or on any other platform.
- desc: "Today we learned about emotions and design with few examples. And the main\
    \ point i learned is pleasant things work better. If you are not in a good mood\
    \ or not happy you won\u2019t work good but if you are in a good mood and happy\
    \ about what you are going to do, it will have much better outcomes. So that is\
    \ a really good thing we learned. Other thing was reflective which means if you\
    \ see something is looking good weather it is perfect or not you will get attracted\
    \ towards it. That is reflective emotion and i think it is true.\n\nI also learned\
    \ about fear of judgement. Where if someone judge you and have a bad comment on\
    \ what you are doing, it will demotivate you and you won\u2019t do it again even\
    \ though it would have turn out to be something very good. And learned about GUIDED\
    \ MASTERY. Converting failure into success by taking small steps of success"
- desc: The things I learned from the video is do not to be afraid of make changes
    of myself, like become more creative, or doing the right things, the things that
    I really want to do.
- desc: 'I think the most important thing we learned in this meeting was that not
    lose your creativity or idea you have, try it out and see how it turns out no
    matter what others says about it. Keep the good and positive response as an encouragement
    but negative ones ignore them or use it as an improvement. Also I learned that
    no matter how ugly or uncreative something is try took at the good and positive
    side and always try to encourage people on their idea they have and support them.

    The news of Robinhood to limit trading was kind of related to past meeting about
    censorship and bubble filter.'
- desc: 'This shows that how people are creative with making new and different types
    of creative things. Most of the people''s emotion depends upon the things, especially
    the design of the things.

    The things also help the people by building confidence in them, and on the other
    hand, the creative things can also make a person disappointed if the things do
    not work properly.'
- desc: 'The interesting thing that I learned during these meeting was that people
    have quite a diverse view on filter bubbles. Although, I do appreciate the usefulness
    of filter bubbles in certain situations, such as when looking for a pizza shop
    or a home depot close to where I stay, I can certainly say that I do not admire
    their algorithmic functionality when it comes to filtering news and opinions.
    This sort of filtering can alienate users from conflicting viewpoints and isolate
    users ideologically.

    However, I observed that many students in the class do not share the same enthusiasm
    about their dangers or are not as concerned about them as someone like me. This
    was certainly interesting.

    All in all, I opine that there should be considerable balance in how filter bubbles
    function when it comes to controversial topics, news and opinions on the internet.
    Users should be able to see viewpoints from all sides, and not just be outraged,
    but to learn.'
- desc: In the last class, we taught about how the design of the software has a huge
    impact on the user interface. Both the videos talked about it in detail. If the
    design is friendly and less complicated the user would have more trust towards
    the operating system and the application.
- desc: After watching two videos, I felt that your emotion and your creative is the
    main key for solving the problems. The way of how you solve the problem depends
    on your feelings. If you are anxious or under pressure, you cannot solve the problem
    in a great way, a creative way. Otherwise, if you are happy or excited, you will
    figure out many ways for solving that problem. The creativity could help you to
    do many things in a brilliant way. Every good design needs a creative designer.
    A good design could make the customer, user feel pleased. It would be a cycle
    of good design and creative designer. For that reason, when you are doing something,
    you have to make sure that you are feeling comfortable and you have a mood of
    doing that thing. Thus, it would boost your productivity.
- desc: 'I learned from the first video that good design makes people happy, and one
    of the reasons is that some designs subconsciously make us feel happy. If the
    design doesn''t have any of the qualities that make people happy, it kills the
    base design purpose.


    From the second video, I know the relationship between confidence and creativity.
    I think confidence can affect one''s creativity very much. If one is very confident,
    he will be very creative because he believes in creating something more perfect.
    Moreover, confident people will be very calm, so they are more likely to succeed
    to make a good design.'
- desc: The design of the software has a huge importance on the user experience. More
    complicated design is less trust people would have over the software. Design of
    car also has a huge importance for the accidents that are caused. Both the videos
    talks about it in detail. I would love to talk about it int deatil
- desc: what is a good design makes you happy when you use it ?
- desc: 'Speaking of software design, I think as a computer professional one should
    keep in mind the possible risks of designing a software & then take measures to
    mitigate or eliminate those risks. As far as the question regarding: "people might
    use it in the wrong way to cause harm" is concerned, that could possibly be controlled
    somewhat by the designer(s). I believe that ultimately it is he individual''s
    (user) responsibility to take care while using the software designed by professionals
    because pretty much anything around us can be used "to cause harm" if we think
    about it.'
- desc: the most important thing learnt in the class was what is the responsibility
    of being a programmer and developer and the anomie concept.
