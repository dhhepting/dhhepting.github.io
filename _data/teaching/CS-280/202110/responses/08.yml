- desc: what is important for programmers to design for their users? As an
    example, we considered the Discord app. Many -- not all -- think that it is intuitive
    after some use (how long? what is intuitive in this context?).
- desc: Discord is like cooking, it looks easy but it's not. As a designer,
    one seeks to balance new features with familiarity to currently existing apps.
- desc: Interesting to think about how sometimes we sacrifice a lot of ease of
    use, accessibility, or intuitiveness of design in the name of utility. Don
    Norman was talking about design that makes people happy, and it struck
    me that I use a lot of things that I don't really enjoy simply because they
    provide some utlity, some means to accompish something. They don't ''spark
    joy'' for me but I use them because they make my life easier.
- desc: What it is that keeps us from employing intuitive, joyful, accessible
    design? Does the design we practise serve the greater good?

- desc: How do we balance usability and utility? Do we design tricycles or
    bicycles? Could we transition to the design of unicycles if required? Why is
    empathy an important capability for designers (especially)?
- desc: Some apps can be classified as tools in the sense that they are designed
    to be multi-purpose for the user. Discord does not get to decide what it is
    to be used for, which is decided by the users.
- desc: Accessibility is something very difficult for me to understand
    because ultimately, who is responsible for accessibility? Is it the programmer's
    responsibility to make their program as accessible as possible?
    If it is, wouldn't that limit their creative decisions and limit their freedom
    to implement what they want? (What is the responsibility of users to learn and
    use difficult software?)
- desc: Is any technology intuitive? People will design things that are intuitive
    to themselves. One person's obvious isn't another person's obvious.
- desc: Very interesting that some people will fervently defend their
    preferred interface even when there are legitimate criticisms of it.
- desc: The most important thing is really to know your target audience and be
    completely willing to meet them where they are and be able (to hear them and
    empathize with them).
