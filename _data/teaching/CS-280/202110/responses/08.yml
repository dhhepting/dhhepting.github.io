- desc: what is important for programmers to design for their users? As an example,
    we considered the Discord app. Many -- not all -- think that it is intuitive after
    some use (how long? what is intuitive in this context?).
- desc: Discord is like cooking, it looks easy but it's not. As a designer, one seeks
    to balance new features with familiarity to currently existing apps.
- desc: Interesting to think about how sometimes we sacrifice a lot of ease of use,
    accessibility, or intuitiveness of design in the name of utility. Don Norman was
    talking about design that makes people happy, and it struck me that I use a lot
    of things that I don't really enjoy simply because they provide some utlity, some
    means to accompish something. They don't ''spark joy'' for me but I use them because
    they make my life easier.
- desc: What it is that keeps us from employing intuitive, joyful, accessible design?
    Does the design we practise serve the greater good?

- desc: How do we balance usability and utility? Do we design tricycles or bicycles?
    Could we transition to the design of unicycles if required? Why is empathy an
    important capability for designers (especially)?
- desc: Some apps can be classified as tools in the sense that they are designed to
    be multi-purpose for the user. Discord does not get to decide what it is to be
    used for, which is decided by the users.
- desc: Accessibility is something very difficult for me to understand because ultimately,
    who is responsible for accessibility? Is it the programmer's responsibility to
    make their program as accessible as possible? If it is, wouldn't that limit their
    creative decisions and limit their freedom to implement what they want? (What
    is the responsibility of users to learn and use difficult software?)
- desc: Is any technology intuitive? People will design things that are intuitive
    to themselves. One person's obvious isn't another person's obvious.
- desc: Very interesting that some people will fervently defend their preferred interface
    even when there are legitimate criticisms of it.
- desc: The most important thing is really to know your target audience and be completely
    willing to meet them where they are and be able (to hear them and empathize with
    them).

- desc: I found it interesting that there was a wide range of perception for the
    interface on Discord, which shows how different users
    can have a different experience using the same technology, and that the
    experience
    of all users must be valued while (designing and) developing an interface.
- desc: A Norman door gives you the wrong signal about how to operate it. There
    are many things in life with designs that give us wrong (or harmful) signals.

- desc: It's upon us software designers and developers
    to find a way to create something for the greater good of society by using
    technology as a tool and not enabling technology to use us.
- desc: it is important to ensure that the program or app is made responsibly
    and doesn't utilize too many "'hijacking techniques' that lure [users] in
    and create 'compulsion loops'"

- desc: I have
    always quite liked the U of R's UR Courses (LMS -- learning management system,
    based open source project called moodle),
    it is a very clean design and classes and assignments are very easy to
    navigate to and find. I never really liked the U of S's Blackboard (LMS,
    proprietary), I found
    myself clicking around trying to navigate to stuff, usually getting lost.
    (Is open source software "better" in any way?)
- desc: With getting over the fear of our low creativity, we can achieve a sense
    of self-efficacy, a term coined by Dr. Bandura
- desc: Software interfaces are not universally praised for their quality, but
    people are adaptible and they learn to work with inferior technology because
    they place blame on themselves
- desc: Discord is an interesting example for me, as its user interface is,
    in my mind, both incredibly simple to use (low barrier to entry),
    but also incredibly complex to get anything unique done. Getting people who
    aren't very tech-savvy to join a server is incredibly simple. However, that
    is more or less the extent of the user-friendliness with Discord.
- desc: Metaphors and Interface Design is about how psychology can cooperate with
    art. As David Kelley's example said 80% of children need to take tranquilizer
    before they get into a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) machine. But after
    working to redesign
    the interface of the machine with a story background, the rate of children
    needing to take a tranquilizer to 10%. Children realize that the machine is
    taking them into the story.
- desc: There is also a video that addresses the plane crash that
    took place without any technological complications. Until I saw this video, I
    wouldn't have believed it could happen in real life. I have come to know how a
    little thing can cause a great tragedy. However, the cause behind the accident
    was not exactly known to me, since it was not a technological issue. I would also
    like to hear more about the circumstances in which the accident occurred, and
    what actually happened to the aircraft. (Was it a technological issue? Does flight
    401 have any connection to Boeing's MCAS on their 737 Max aircraft?)
- desc: I really liked Don Norman's explanation about how good design makes you
    happy. I would like to have more discussion and more examples about David
    Kelly's video about building your creative confidence.
- desc: The state of anomie occurs when there is a blockage of goals for groups or
    individuals. The moral values or social standards vanish that were already
    known by the people.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from this meeting is how much
    thinking
    and research is required to design an intuitive interface.
    If more people are creative and children are encouraged
    to be more creative in schools, our society can benefit from more innovations
    and diversity.
- desc: If
    you want people to engage with your products then it is the design of the product
    that will lure the audience. I really enjoyed the discussion in this meeting.
    It was so far the most interactive class. Just one request, Dr. Hepting, please
    type your notes because at least I cannot understand a bit of them. That's the
    only thing that I don't like about our meetings. Thank you.
- desc: We should not divide
    the world into "creative" and "uncreative", because all people are creative by
    nature. We must be able to achieve self-efficacy and snake touch (in our own ways).
- desc: In last meeting we talked a bit about accessibility and usability. When designing
    any website or making any new software, the designer always have to make sure
    if the design will be understandable to everyone. If the accessibility is available
    into the website, that it will improve the usability experience. It should focus
    on if the website is fair to use for people with disability. If the website is
    navigable, understandable for people with disability then it meets the accessibility
    goals. When a design is effective and satisfying for the user then it successfully
    meets the usability as well.
- desc: From my own understanding of the terms, accessibility means access to all,
    regardless of technological or physical means and usability is a measure of
    how easy a system is to use. These two concepts are very vital in the world
    of technology.
- desc: I want to know more about interface designing and what aspects should be
    considered when (designing and) developing a website or software for the people
    to use.
- desc: The crash of Eastern Airlines 401 was undoubtedly a tragedy. On the
    surface, there is not much connection
    between computer science and society, but through this incident, I realized
    that
    computer science can also change society. In my opinion, in the future, computer
    systems, especially those related to automatic navigation and human health, like
    vaccines in the medical world, should undergo repeated "clinical trials" before
    being put into use until the system proves that there are no hidden dangers.
- desc: an article about the importance of intuition to good design

- desc: Philosopher John Rawls suggests that we imagine
    staying behind a veil of ignorance that helps to keep us from understanding
    who we really are and identifying with our own self-interest. This would
    allow us to more objectively consider the impacts of our choices.
    And this could make it easier to empathize with others.
- desc: I didn't realize that a plane crash could occur without any technical
    fault. (But there were technical faults, including the burnt-out bulb on the
    instrument panel.)
- desc: I learned how addictive phones can be and how user interfaces can attract
    the attention of people, those designs are not there to help us but to make
    us engage
    with our devices.
- desc: The thing that most important when you create something is how you create
    it and keeping in mind that it could have good and bad effect on people's life.
    A small mistake or miscalculation could cost people's life so we have to be very
    precise in designing them.
- desc: The first important thing for designers is empathy.
- desc: In the area of anomaly detection and security analytics,
    humans working with
    AI accomplish much more than without it. And while not risk-free,
    AI within security
    is more likely to create jobs rather than eliminate them, I believe.
- desc: The interesting part from this meeting was how well-designed things
    can make
    them easier to use and evoke a positive response.
