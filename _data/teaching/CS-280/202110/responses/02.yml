    "Code Stars" -- I actually thought this was a pretty cute and empowering video
    that really talked up the benefits of entering computer programming. I wonder
    if much has changed between 2013 and now with education on how widespread and
    important computer programming is as a career choice. It''s true, often times
    when you ask children what they want to be when they grow up, in my experience
    you get answers like "vet," or "teacher," or "firefighter," or "YouTuber," or
    "princess," hahaha. I''m curious to know whether or not children consider computer
    programming a "dream job." I know when I was a kid, I thought "hackers" looked
    pretty cool (hey, it was the 90s), but I never thought that was like, a career
    you could pursue.

    I got into coding at a very young age, and it''s neat to see that it really seems
    to benefit kids'' problem-solving skills. I know I really enjoyed it, especially
    looking at web source codes and trying to figure out how things worked. I wonder
    what would happen if we implemented more programming into the education curriculum
    (is there more programming in elementary and high school these days?), and if
    more kids would say that they wanted to be computer programmers when they grow
    up.


    "Moral Operating System" -- Okay, so like, this is actually my wheelhouse.

    When I decided I wanted to go into computer science, a lot of my concerns about
    my future prospects, what I want to do, and who I want to work for revolved around
    ethical considerations. So I actually decided to take my minor in Critical Thinking
    and Professional Ethics, because I felt that it''s an underrepresented combination
    in the tech field. I''m in my fourth philosophy class right now and it seems more
    obvious to me than ever that ethical considerations need to go hand-in-hand with
    technology, especially because technology is evolving at an accelerated rate,
    and it seems that not enough developers and the companies that hire them are considering
    the ramifications of their decisions when it comes to ethics violations, or how
    seemingly innocuous choices can be harmful. I do feel that if we do not start
    considering ethics as equally important as our technological advancement, our
    technologies can because tools for serious harm.

    I think the answer to this consideration would be to implement ethics consultants,
    boards or councils in technology companies, and to push for a widespread professional
    and ethical framework that can be followed by professionals in the computer sciences.
    I do know that in terms of technology, there is the ACM code of ethics, however
    I wonder how many technologists actually have familiarized themselves with it
    or how widespread it is in its use.

    Anyway I can go on and on about this subject as it''s something I''m very passionate
    about but I''ll keep it brief; I find it concerning that a lot of people in the
    sciences do not often consider ethics or look at things from the humanities point
    of view. I really do think that he makes a good point about diversifying the points
    of view in your life so that you can see things in a much more holistic way. I
    feel that everyone becomes a lot better at ethics when you think to yourself,
    "Huh, I''ve never thought of it that way before."


    Thanks for the videos and the discussion points! :)'

    Code Stars\u2019 is a video made in 2013 promoting computer programming as a profession\
    \ and suggests that programming should be taught within the general school system.\
    \ In the video it said that there would be 1,400,000 jobs requiring computer science\
    \ graduates within the next 10 years, and only 400,000 graduates to fill them.\
    \ Given we are at the tail end of those ten years, I am curious to know how accurate\
    \ those numbers ended up being.\n\nThe second video titled \u2018We need a moral\
    \ operating system\u2019 discusses the ethics of people in technological fields.\
    \ Firstly, it discusses data and privacy. More specifically, it discusses whether\
    \ technologists should take people\u2019s data to make more money and improve\
    \ user experience, or if we should respect their privacy. Given this video was\
    \ also made in 2013, it is very interesting to see how this moral question has\

    \ hold massive amounts of data about their users and use this data to make more\
    \ money by doing things like offering more relevant advertisements to their users.\
    \ However, as a company, Facebook\u2019s ethics have been heavily scrutinized\

    \ various philosophical moral frameworks and how to make more ethical decisions.\
    \ Lastly, the video suggests that we should introduce more concepts from the humanities\
    \ into the field of technology.\nI think this video highlights a very important\
    \ issue that anyone pursuing computer science should think about: What you create\
    \ could impact the lives of many people, so it is important to think ethically\
    \ as you develop new programs, websites, and technologies.\n\nI think it is surprising\
    \ how extremely relevant these 2013 videos are today. Thank you for the videos!\n\

- desc: 'Hello everyone, here is my reactions to the videos:


    "Code Stars" - After watching this video what I thought was that wow, such a positive
    message is being shared to the public. I believe much has changed since 2013 to
    today, underlying things the video mentions. In the video the kids were asked
    if they know about computer programming, and they are like no, and if we see today,
    there are tons of people pursuing this as a career; not quite the same amount
    as a teacher, doctor, chef, sport player, but it sure is changing. I felt from
    the video, that yes, people needs to be more aware about what computer programming
    is and how important it is in this decade. It sure is just like any other form
    of creativity (as mentioned in the video) , just similar to painting, writing
    a journal/poem. There are so much ways to be able to improve in this sector, and
    be creative, and do anything that we wish to.

    The kids shall be introduced the idea of coding and programming in elementary
    school, so they know about it, and get more involved in it. Coding/programming
    is just like learning a new sport; you get tired, you lose hope, but once you
    understand it and keep practicing, you will excel it, no need to be a genius.
    There is so much room to be in this field, and change the world with a positive
    note; just like how movies portray superpowers; programming is indeed a kind of
    superpower, that can control and do everything and everything.


    "Moral operating system" - There is so much we can do with coding. This video
    shares a powerful messages emphasizing the importance of coding/programming. There
    is an ample amount of things we can do with just coding, but it is necessary to
    understand "what we should do" ; we should know what is right before doing anything,
    and make sure to put that in action rather than invading in the wrong side. This
    video very well puts a pressure on the idea of ethics. Ethics is something that
    is not only to be followed within a medical sector, but to any kind of field.
    It is important to be aware about wrong and right; and how to put that in action.
    Another thing that the video told me, is that people need to be aware about respecting
    the privacy of others, rather than just using data to make money; it is vital
    to understand the factor of privacy and the need to be put that in action, unlike
    how Facebook puts it in action.'
- desc: The two videos made me believe that programming is fun. Programming is about
    creating or building something new from the scratch. Coding involves collecting
    managing organizing data and it is about thinking differently to come up with
    something new and challenging. An objective can be obtained by considering different
    perspectives and opinions. The videos further conveyed that a human has a power
    to create new perspectives and change them
- desc: From the past lecture, I have learned that coding is used literally everywhere,
    in any field. Like who have given the thought to the thing that the simplest mobile
    games we are playing is build by performing a lot of coding. Also, we can use
    the programming in both positive and negative ways as a person with a good knowledge
    of programming can get access to all the personal things of the other which is
    already happening. So it's upon us that how we are going to use this superpower.
- desc: I found David Horowitz's "Moral Operating System" Ted talk very interesting.
    I am interested to learn more about theories surrounding morals and ethics, specifically
    in the areas of computer science and modern technology. I am also interested to
    learn more about cybersecurity because I believe privacy is an important issue
    in the age of technology.
- desc: "Code Stars\nIn near future mostly everything will be computerized, from household\
    \ work to commercial work everything will somehow relate to computers. From smart\
    \ door which notified you if someone is at the door or you are getting any package\
    \ delivery and car which drives without any driver to agriculture industries and\
    \ commercial factories everything will have coding in it. So, it is very important\
    \ to learn coding for everyone. Coding is very vast it is not just in developing\
    \ websites or making any shopping application or for any social media. It is used\
    \ in every known industries, the robotic system used in shorting fruits and vegetables\
    \ in big farms to the assembly line which manufacture this robots (shorting system\
    \ mention earlier) has coding in it. If more and more people combine to develop\
    \ thing the chances of error will be very less. Due to this advancement their\
    \ will be more jobs and not much people who are qualified to do it.\n\nMoral operating\

    \ the bank details to what we browse can be accessed by the developer. In this\
    \ TED video the importance of that information is showed. As a developer we should\
    \ not use that information for our personal benefits. We should thing about humanity\
    \ and respect user privacy. Many of the online messengers can only access our\
    \ Name and other info but can\u2019t access our chat. We need more ideas like\
    \ this where we can gets more benefits by sharing our normal data like name etc.,\
    \ and protecting our personal information. To give the best service is our prime\
    \ goal but not at the cost of privacy. Technologist should collaborate with humanities\
    \ to get a different perspective."
- desc: 'In this meeting we learned about how easy it is to start learning computer
    science. And can be helpful in every field that is available rather then only
    computer science. This also makes people more aware of this field and sends a
    positive message to everyone that how important it is.


    There is so much we can do with coding. But it is important to know that what
    are the right things we should do and what not to do. Ethics is very important.
    We also learned that we should respect others privacy and need not take the data
    without their permission. The video gives us a very powerful message of importance
    of computer programming in our life.'
- desc: "In the first video, programming was been centralized. Programming entails\
    \ the explanation to a computer using functions on how you need it to help you.\
    \ In reference to \u201CMakinde\u201D, Coding is the process of breaking down\
    \ problems.\nCode creation and programming is a pattern of expressing creativity\
    \ or a mechanism to produce executable form of computer programs, Code creation\
    \ is not limited by our imagination and is totally based on our understanding\
    \ of the structure of the program. It is said that magic is bound to happen when\
    \ you team up and collaborate together while coding, this exercise helps us to\
    \ push through problems and develop critical-thinking efficiently and also develops\
    \ our problem-solving skill. Certain misconceptions have been made about programming,\
    \ basically about not being able to memorize a lot of information and how they\
    \ are put to use. But then, in order to learn how to code you just have to be\
    \ determined and focused in order to implement your ideas.\nIn the second video,\
    \ an idea concerning data collection and moral frameworks guiding our decisions\
    \ on privacy etc was pondered on. There was a clear contrast between mobile operating\
    \ systems and moral operating systems and the need for the moral operating system.\
    \ The term \u201CFramework\u201D was defined and it\u2019s types were made clear\
    \ along-side its concepts and how its use can be used effectively."
- desc: It was interesting that in a talk on morality he completely ignored the contributions
    of Hobbes and Locke. their social contract explains why those with the data should
    act morally in the first place. I've always understood the social contract to
    be similar to utilitarianism, which he mentioned in the talk, but slightly more
    aware of the individual.
- desc: 'We have this guys data. There are infinite things we can do. What should
    we do?

    It is really a moral dilemma, and comes down to the concerns of each individual''s
    privacy. How much is privacy worth? How much should it be sacrificed for "the
    greater good" or for the user experience? This has always really been a concern
    and there''s still never been a perfect solution, and I really don''t think there
    ever will be a perfect decision.

    Some other styles of data collection have come about, things like grouping and
    anonymizing user data so that it''s only the big picture, but there are still
    concerns about this data being traced back to individuals and still those who
    would just like not to be monitored at all.

    I''ve seen and understand both sides of this. There are incredible amounts of
    data out there and we now finally have the tools to collect and apply it in incredible
    ways, but this same technology watching over and logging everything we do is kind
    of a scary thought. I''m just one person, why would my data change anything? Why
    should I agree to let my data be collected?

    Right now, the biggest thing is the need to be transparent with what is collected
    and giving users the option to opt out at any time. It''s not uncommon now to
    see a prompt asking if you''d like to allow software to collect analytics, crash
    reports, and whatever other data on the first startup of the service. Websites
    are now being required to prompt about which cookies are being stored on the device
    and what trackers are being used per session. Now, I think the problem is that
    it''s becoming a lot of information for the end user to take in, and there just
    isn''t a good way to learn about what it all means and why it actually matters.
    A lot of people think "why should I care if they have my data?" but that''s been
    quickly changing over the last couple of years, I feel mostly due to media creating
    these images of governments or corporations spying on their communities.

    For all of these issues, I don''t think there is a real good solution. The best
    and most necessary thing in my opinion is transparency from those collecting data,
    and resources for the end users so they can learn why they might want to care.'
- desc: In the past meeting, the most influenced thing is to have the determination
    in our goals. In the world of coding, the little coding can make you genius, you
    just neend to have the right choices. The knowledge about any thing will eventually
    helps you to identified between right and wrong.
- desc: "First Video\nI learned from the first video that there are plenty of opportunities\
    \ for programmers. You don\u2019t have to be a genius to be a programmer. Programming\
    \ involves breaking a big problem into smaller parts and solving them. Computer\
    \ technology is very powerful and as programmers we can have a huge impact on\
    \ the world.\n\nSecond Video\nThe most important thing I learned from the second\
    \ video is that we should be spending time thinking:\nIs what we are building\
    \ as programmer right or wrong?\nWill it maximising pleasure and minimising pain?\n\
    Is it morally right?\nWe should be building a moral operating system. We should\
    \ spare some time to really think about the above questions to build technologies\
    \ that are good for humanity. We should talk to people that are not technologist\
    \ for their opinions and see what they think."
- desc: As I watched the first video, I thought that programming would be more and
    more important in the future because all the technologies of modern life might
    require programming, so programming is very promising. Secondly, programming has
    many advantages for people. First, learning programming can improve people's work
    efficiency to a large extent. Second, programming can also make people more focused,
    help clear people's thinking when they face problems, and improve their observation
    ability.
- desc: The most important point is that the rewards of learning to code are huge.
    The obvious ones, for example, are that people who do it earn a lot of money.
- desc: I would first start with what I would like to know more about . I would like
    to know more about this course such that around what concept does this course
    revolves around and what risk and reward in society actually means. Rest the meeting
    was absolutely great and there was nothing I found difficult.
- desc: "Code Stars\nIt is obvious that the video is attempting to glorify the world\
    \ of programming. I can\u2019t help but criticize the video since it feels more\
    \ like a recruitment commercial attempting to lure you in with free food, laundry,\
    \ snacks, video games, and scooters. Being talked to by a cartoon and then referring\
    \ to coding as a superpower does not help and tells me this is targeted for a\
    \ much younger audience. While working for companies like Value appear to be more\
    \ exciting than the average job, I don\u2019t feel this is something everyone\
    \ should expect. Most people I know in the industry are burnt out from stress\
    \ and long hours. The more interesting debate for me is the idea that everyone\
    \ should learn how to code in today\u2019s technology driven society. I often\
    \ hear that the demand for programmers outweighs the supply, perhaps that is the\
    \ real reason for videos like this.\n\nWe need a \"moral operating system\u201D\
    \nDamon Horowitz reminds us that power breeds responsibility. It is something\
    \ I feel we don\u2019t address very often with technology. I would assume that\
    \ most companies attempt to instill ethical guidelines, it would be irresponsible\
    \ not to, especially since more and more people are being held accountable for\
    \ their actions these days. It is a must for larger companies in order to protect\
    \ themselves. For the independent developer, or even just the user, I don\u2019\
    t think ethics is really ever a topic of discussion. I would have to agree when\
    \ Damon mentions in the video that \u201Cethics requires uncomfortable thinking.\u201D\
    \ When I sit down to create something, I honestly don\u2019t want to think about\
    \ it."
- desc: "From the two videos that I watched I gained a bit of insight and moral questions\
    \ about computer science.\_ From video one we are addressed by many successful\
    \ people in the field of computer science who tell us that computer science is\
    \ a growing industry that will continue to grow and that with this growth it would\
    \ be essential for everyone to learn how to code.\_ In the second video one man\
    \ presents into a crowd about the moral side to computer science what we should\
    \ and should not do. How that everyone sees right and wrong differently and that\
    \ instead of just building programs that could do something we should first stop\
    \ and think if this program should in a moral sense be created. These ideas are\
    \ what I took away from the last meeting.\n\nDerek Brandvold\n\n"

    computer program that most people are known. computer programmer also telling
    how they feel about coding. As these worker said, I can consider of computer science
    is a new world, new form of art; But at the end of the video, there is a guy said:
    "if you want to earn money or if you want to create something, learn computer
    science." ; this quote is the high light of the whole video for me.

    In the second video, the host asked audience should he keep information of a person
    , user in internet or not keep them because he respect others. I prefer to stand
    on minimally keep the information to protect the right for internet. As he said
    some people will use internet to do something that are illegal; In this case,

    of ethics in a situation of conflict of interest.
- desc: 'first video: States more about the need and importance of coding in the modern
    world, it isn''t about money and business it is about making the world a better
    place to live.


    Second video: it loops around collecting using one individual''s data in an ethical
    way, not to purposely invade somebody''s privacy but to give them a better experience
    of the platform from recording their inputs, and can be also used to protect others
    from threats by that data when needed.'
- desc: Something interesting that I learned more about in the last meeting is how
    people involved in the internet consider people's data. Data is a huge deal and
    I don't think that it is considered enough regarding its importance. The videos
    really enabled me to think about just how much information about yourself can
    be out in someone else's hands. I found it interesting how the audience was asked
    about their morals in using other peoples data to earn a profit and it really
    shows in today's society where technology is running most of our world.
- desc: 'The short movie "Code Start" is about encouraging young people to learn how
    to code and possibly pursuing them into finding a job in that field. I think this
    is a great way to encourage young people because they interviewed successful and
    famous people such as the founder of Microsoft and Facebook which many people
    know and have respect for.

    The second video is more about ethic especially how do we handle people''s data,
    do we collect it to make his experience better and make money from it or do we
    respect his privacy. What is wrong and what is right and how do we make our decision
    on what''s wrong or right. Do we use calculation to come to the decision, we use
    our legal system to decide, do we weight the good and bad of the consequences
    or do we reason it out. But we should make the decision and take responsibility
    for it. '

- desc: I am interested in how it can be difficult to decide between using people's
    data, and protecting their privacy. I would like to learn more about how corporations
    handle this, and what the laws are surrounding this topic. I can see how using
    people's data would be valuable and corporations could make a profit from this,
    but I also think it is important to protect people's privacy. While I am using
    technology I will likely be more aware of how my data is being used to enhance
    my experience, and where I might be concerned about my privacy being protected.
- desc: It was really helpful. Thanks.
- desc: 'though there was nothing much discussed in the cass, the videos posted say
    about the computer programming and its the experts or experienced people saying
    their experiences about the programming. Sir damon talking about the operating
    systems

    '
- desc: I would like to know more about whether or not there is a socially optimal
    moral decision that can be made about how companies can use collected data. Would
    it rather be more of a decision for a company to make based on the opinion of
    the consumers? Is there a plan that can best accommodate both companies and consumers
    or does one get the short end of the stick? Consumers obviously dont want everyone
    knowing their personal data and companies would much rather have data to work
    with, so how can each side be satisfied?
- desc: The videos provided for meeting 2 were fairly interesting. One of the most
    important things that I learned is that there is a large demand for programmers
    and a fairly low supply in comparison. What is more, is that the first video speaks
    on the importance of community, team work, creativity, and that programming is
    not all algorithms and math. Although it depends on the task at hand, the creative
    aspect of programming is really what has drawn me into computer science. The concept
    I found most difficult was what is rights and wrongs concerning data collection.
    It is an extremely broad topic and brings up many difficult and abstract ethical
    questions. However, it is interesting to compare the potential improved user experience
    that you may receive from personal data collection to abuse of such data. Also,
    I would love to learn more about moral frameworks. It is an interesting topic
    that I feel compelled to learn more about. In specific, the different kind of
    moral frameworks, the differences between them, which one I fall into now, and
    which one I most agree with. I look forward to referencing my psych major buddies
    and continue this discussion about how we make choices and what we decide to be
    just or moral.
- desc: One of the most intresting thing i learned is the number which will be required
    in the future of computer science (400,000 the garduates) and one of the most
    applicable and true thought was the forum of truth which has universal objective
    truth the example was applicable in the coding world as well and also to think
    every possible outcome before writing
- desc: I found it very interesting. The first video talked about coding and how to
    learn the whole thing from the pov of the masters of it and the second video discusses
    once we have achieved that level how to use the power in the right way. I was
    also astonished to know we have a 1 million shortage on programmers that can be
    utilized. Also, the decision factor which can't be coded or taught to the computers,
    its we humans that have to take responsibilities.
- desc: From the Meeting 2, it can be concluded that coding is nothing until you are
    unaware about it, but it will become an indispensable part when you will know
    about it. it feels amazing when millions of people use the app that you create
    by coding. nowadays everything has coding.it is true that programming is epic.
- desc: 'Hi there,

    I hope you all are i pink of your health.From this meeting, i got to know that
    people make a big fuss about coding ( that it is difficult and all ). However,
    once someone gets to know about it or put a little bit effort it starts to become
    interesting and eventually becomes an integral part of many people''s life. When
    a programmer realizes that his/her made app/website is being used by hundreds
    and thousands of people that''s where he/she falls in love with programming even
    more. In this modern era, everything runs by some kind of coding and i think that
    everyone should learn at least some coding because coding is fun.

    a vital role in todays world and how big the deal it will be in the future. I
    was always into technology but didn''t knew how creative and fun it could be and
    why we all should learn how to code. It''s sad to see that how young people think
    coding is boring and hard but Its one of the think which we all can do. You don''t
    have to be smart or intelligent, all you need is passion, creativity and determined
    towards programming.

    The "TED talk" by Damon Horowitz helped me to understand the right and wrong side
    of technology and how to know which side we are in. We have so much power today,
    and it is up to us to figure out what to do with the data we collect and have.
    The video was really informative and inspiring, I would like to learn more about
    the legal side of collecting data.'
- desc: "Meeting 2 we look at two different videos,\_\n\nin the first video we see\
    \ different individuals who have been favorably\_\n\nexposed to the idea of coding,\
    \ how youngsters have absolutely no idea about becoming a programmer.\n\nEvidently\
    \ everything requires technology these days and what's interesting is that\_\n\
    \nthe great creators of different social media platforms come together to explain\_\
    \n\nhow great it feels to have written a program themselves who are now at the\
    \ peak. This gives us the ideal\n\nconfidence we need to keep working in\_ order\
    \ to achieve what's beyond our potential.\_ \_\n\nCoding is something very simple\
    \ and easy to understand which makes it more an more interesting\n\nas we advance.\
    \ Coding is considered a superpower, everyone that doesn't understand coding think\
    \ its\n\nthe coolest knowledge to have.\n\nVideo 2 we see how \"Damon Horowitz\"\
    \ explains his ideas over how our morality plays a vital role in using\n\nthe\
    \ data that we collect daily with the use of technology, the right thing to do\
    \ with data is up to us.\n\nIts interesting how he speaks about the majority having\
    \ knowledge of \"mobile operating systems\"\n\nwhereas, we should have a \"moral\
    \ operating systems\" where we follow trueness and not the opinions we have.\n\
    \nFollow the right and not the wrong and lead in the way of responsible use of\
    \ the power that every individual posses.\n\n\_\n\n\_ \_ \_\_\n"
- desc: After watching the both vedio I came to conclusion that what is exactly programming
    language is ? how can we understand the language of coding ? There are so many
    programming languages such as JAVA, Python, Ajax etc. and each programming language
    has their own unique way to write and understand as well as how to execute the
    code So we can get better result and understanding. Nowadays, Peole who are releted
    to this field or already working in this field for them programming language is
    very crucial and necessary to make progress in their upcoming future.
- desc: "Form the fish video,I learned what is computer programming and what other\
    \ people see the computer programming .it can do anything like music,doing some\
    \ stuff but for that we need to assign some work to computer to do that things.another\
    \ thing is how to read and understand the program.To write,read and understand\
    \ we don\u2019t have to be genius.\n\nFrom the second I learned about what is\
    \ right and wrong according to computer systems.it led me to think of more moral\
    \ systems we need."
- desc: 'It is very important for everyone to learn how to read and write code ( even
    in some basic form) because in the coming years or decades everything around us
    will have some form of coded instruction.

    I didn''t really got how to choose whether to use the data or not and what morale
    structure should we go for.

    How to code easily and efficiently is what I would like to know about.'
- desc: We are living in a Big data age that our personal data is easily to be collected.
    For example if I took a look on the airplane ticket, the next second the advertisement
    of it will be shown on another app. Our data is been tracked and the system can
    easily track it. It does benefit something but in other hand, it doesn't protected
    our privacy and I feel it can be better if we can find a proper way between giving
    benefits and invasion of privacy.
- desc: 'The term computing is any activity that uses computers to manage, process,
    and communicate information.

    Computing includes the development of both hardware and software.

    Computing is a critical, integral component of modern industrial technology.

    It deals with mathematical concepts as it follows an endless systematic algorithm
    concept.

    Computing helps one to advance the way that they think and how one relates to
    the world in terms of coding languages and processes

    My purpose in studying computing is to broaden my knowledge of how processes are
    done in the real world as almost everything now is being done digitally.

    Computing is a critical, integral component of modern industrial technology.'
- desc: "After watching both videos, here are the things I learned.\nCode stars -\
    \ Programming is an essential part of our society.it is integrated into almost\
    \ every industry imaginable, from technology to agricultural industries.\nProgramming\
    \ thrives when it is done with a group of trusted people in a conducive environment.\
    \ Lastly, the world will continue to need good programmers as there is more than\
    \ enough demand for them.\n\n We need a \"moral operating system\" - Moral operating\
    \ system is a human method of making decisions between right and wrong. There\
    \ is no particular formula for making a difficult decision. Most people make tough\
    \ decisions based on their guts or morality. Different philosophers have different\
    \ ways of making moral decisions, but it's best we learn from people's experience\
    \ from both in and out of our career field, on how they make their tough decisions."
- desc: "The one thing I learned was that \"Being determined towards what you are\
    \ learning is\_ most important rather than just trying to be the odd one out or\
    \ be the most genius person.\" Coding is much more of a depth topic that can be\
    \ learned from the basics. Social life in 2021 will have much more power than\
    \ it ever had, so privacy is a factor that needs to be given priority. As the\
    \ Ted Talks speaker was giving a plethora of examples about the ethics great people\
    \ had set, similarly, Ethics is the way to learn by heart.\n"
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is that Coding, Computer Science is
    often misunderstood and is a very underrated career. Also, we need to use our
    skills for the right things and need to make sure that we follow good ethics as
    we can make a big difference as an individual. There were a couple of words in
    the Ted talk video which sounded complicated and I didn't know their meaning.
    I would like to know more about the current information that the operating system
    I am using collects. I have faced the underrating of Computer Science/Coding in
    my life as a lot of my friends think that it's very tough and they think that
    Computer Science is only about coding.
- desc: 'Code stars are the computer programmers; they code and decode the logical
    problems. Coding is unlike playing but needs learning and making algorithms. The
    future of programming is vast; people are getting in. Everyone starts coding from
    scratch like addition, subtraction and multiplication. Sometimes, more complex
    problems need team work to accomplish the objective. Damon Horowitz said, we have
    data and power like I am a programmer is a my power, but how many programmings
    can I do ? that is my data. We have technology like a phone how to use it that
    is in our hands. Today we need a framework to down pains and up pleasures-moral
    if we use things by ethics-by heart. People''s framework makes them ambitious;
    they have objectives. So, What I do with technology?

    I have the technology to write programs.'
- desc: Dr. Hepting had to leave early so nothing much to grab from this lecture.
