- desc: I would like to see another guest make a presentation in class, although I
    was not personally able to take much away from the cips presentation, I would
    be happy to see more presentations of that type, about opportunities in the computer
    science world.
- desc: "In the last class, we discussed whether a certification is important for\
    \ professional life. In my opinion, certification does not define anyone\u2019\
    s skill, especially in the IT world. Skills like programming are acquired with\
    \ practice and if a person no longer practices the skills it can also be wiped\
    \ out of their brain. Hence a certificate cannot and should not define if a person\
    \ has a certain skill set. A lot of IT professionals have no degree in computer\
    \ science or any programming certificate. It is a skill that can be learned by\
    \ anyone and from anywhere. Hence, certification is not important to be an IT\
    \ professional."
- desc: 'I was a bit confused by the discussion question today of practicing moral
    responsibility and ethics without being certified. In my opinion, it all has to
    do with how you carry yourself, it is up to you to determine how you act in the
    workplace. However, having that accreditation by recognized groups such as CIPS
    makes you liable to upholding those moral practices and shows your employer that
    you are qualified to do so. So in a way, you can practice ethics in your work
    without being certified but it may be unlikely that your employer will be quick
    to recognize that ability. Like one of the examples given in the chat: if you
    don''t have proper accreditation but still claim to know how to drive, you might
    have a hard time convincing a police officer that if you don''t have a valid license.'
- desc: In class today we discussed if it is possible to act professionally without
    CIPS certification. In my opinion, it is possible to act professionally without
    CIPS certification, but having the certification displays a commitment to ethical
    and professional practices. For example, someone could go through their entire
    career in tech without ever hearing of CIPS and still be considered as one who
    acts professionally. However, if someone had a CIPS certification, as an employer,
    this would make it very clear to me that they have a personal commitment to be
    ethical and professional in their work.
- desc: in last class we talked about whether the certification course is important
    or not. in my point of you some of them are good but not all. every course has
    serve its own purpose, however, by doing this kind of courses you improving your
    own skills in doing tasks. I mean if you already know let say html but you do
    any external course by doing so you are improving your own skills. well you get
    certificate for that but you are doing it for your betterment.
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting, we had a discussion about inviting another guest\
    \ and if yes then what profession of guest we should invite. We also talked about\
    \ the extensions for empathy map assignment and project deliverable. After that,\
    \ we had a breakout room where we discussed about \u201Cis it possible to act\
    \ professionally without certification? If so, why is it important\u201D. In my\
    \ opinion, you can act professionally without certificate if you have an experience\
    \ but having certificate allow you to have more opportunities as it\u2019s not\
    \ possible to get hire in any big companies without a certificate or degree."
- desc: "Todays meeting professor gave us extension for the empathy map and also for\
    \ the project. Beside that we were all taking about our experience with proctortrack\
    \ while trying to attempt the quiz for empathy map. After that we had a breakout\
    \ season about \u201Cis it possible to act professionally without certification,\
    \ if so why it is important\u201D. Everyone had mix opinions about this topic.\
    \ In my opinion certification is necessary as it proves that we have basic knowledge\
    \ and some skills on certain things. Certification helps people to get a job.\
    \ But certification doesn\u2019t define a person\u2019s qualifications. The qualifications\
    \ comes from trainings and experience."
- desc: I really liked the discussion today about certifications. To me personally,
    the only certificates I think are useful are the ones that teach me a skill. For
    example, CCNA. On the contrary, with CIPS, I am paying every year for a paper
    that says I'm ethical when I can have my references from previous jobs endorse
    me for my sincerity and ethics in workplace.
- desc: There was an interesting discussion about professional certification and whether
    there is a need for the certification? Can individuals behave in a professional
    way without a certificate to vouch for it? There was a consensus that individuals
    can, however the certification is more of a way to tell the prospective employer
    that the individual has those skills, rather than taking someone up for their
    word. Someone drew a good analogy between driving license and certifications.
    Having a license says that you are competent enough to drive safely and up to
    the standards required, but will you do it, or does the licensing oblige you to
    always drive safely? It is the same case with professional and ethical certifications.
- desc: 'We discussed many things in this meeting, I learned the foremost things that
    how to be ethically certified by any firm organization like CIPS. As well if someone
    wants to maintain its status of the professional conduct or still wants to remain
    certified then one needs to pay the fees annually as this certification gets expires.
    So, there is a mystery behind getting good jobs from this certification as it
    represents you on your behalf.


    '
- desc: I did really like today's discussion, it went much better than other days.
    We had about four people discussing and there were a lot of really good points
    brought up about the things necessary to make certification work. Stuff like employers
    recognizing if they do or don't need someone with these certifications so that
    people can still get entry level jobs while also allowing certifications to not
    just be given out to anybody. If anyone can get them relatively easy, it really
    defeats the purpose and I feel more has an impact on those without the money/resources
    to do so rather than actually acknowledging their skills as a developer and as
    a professional.
- desc: "Yes, I think it is possible to act professionally without certification.\
    \ While it can definitely show a \u201Cthis group recognizes me as being professional,\
    \ and they have a built history of being OK at this\u201D, I feel it is less impactful\
    \ then something like a certificate saying \u201CI know how to do X thing, perform\
    \ X task, work with X software\u201D. How one acts can be more defined with actions,\
    \ especially since people can change, and many may have a breaking point for when\
    \ they will do something unethical.\nPlus, it being required feels like a slippery\
    \ slope, as ethics can often depend on the situation with where you are working."
- desc: The discussion of the value of holding credentials from CIPS has been of great
    interest to me, because for several years I have been trying to identify credentials
    that would be useful to acquire in order to boost my career prospects. I'm often
    struck by just how much of a "Wild West" the credential industry is, and how little
    agreement there is in the professional world about the value of particular certifications.
    Should one aim for CIPS credentials? CompTIA? CISSP? All of the above? Without
    an objective standard, it's extremely hard to figure out which option will open
    the most doors, and many of these options can end up costing thousands of dollars
    (even an entry-level CompTIA certification takes two exams at $500 a pop). The
    landscape is made murkier by many of these organizations awarding credentials
    (for a fee) not on the basis of knowledge, but on the basis of the number of years
    you've worked in the profession - they'll certify that you have particular skills
    so you can get particular jobs, but only if you already had a job using those
    particular skills, which makes me wonder how much purpose the credential has.
    If you need it to prove that you can do work you have already proven you can do,
    the main beneficiary seems to be the certifying body, not the person receiving
    the certification.
- desc: in this meeting we discussed about whether certification is necessary to act
    professionally and interestingly, all of us in our breakout session agreed that
    it is not at all necessary, certification does not describes the behaviour or
    nature of a human being.
- desc: In the beginning of the lecture there was discussion through zoom polls and
    then later on talked about professional association.
- desc: 'Meeting 21 response:

    In this class we discussed whether it was important to have certifications to
    act professionally. I feel like having a certification in and of itself doesn''t
    guarantee that a person or employee will act professionally. Although, going through
    the curriculum of having to obtain a certification may teach an individual what
    behaviours the person should exhibit to act professionally but it does not guarantee
    the professional behaviour and definitely not a necessity


    Meeting 20 response:

    In this meeting, we had a guest speaker from CIPS who gave us a presentation about
    the CIPS certification and the various benefits of obtaining the certification
    as well as the procedure to obtain it.'
- desc: The Professionalism is showing the ability of worker who work in this area,
    It make people feel at ease when applying for help or work, instead of fearing
    that the commissioned work cannot be completed. This is how professional work.
- desc: "I assumed that people would have gotten the empathy map assignment done with\
    \ the date extension. But I was wrong for guessing that. Sometimes people are\
    \ getting used to Dr. Hepting\u2019s accommodation. Other professors wouldn\u2019\
    t give one WEEK extension, likely two days. I know that I sound like a jerk but\
    \ it is an easy assignment that won\u2019t take more than two hours to do. Find\
    \ two hours in the one-week extension to do it. I would lose my mind if somebody\
    \ asks more time on Thursday even after another extension.\nHonestly, people get\
    \ talking about random stuff from in the chat. It\u2019s almost impossible to\
    \ keep up with the random brain wave of people."
- desc: In the last meeting we discussed about the extension to the project deadline
    and empathy map the professor hepting performed Few poll to encourage class and
    the breakout meeting was better this time.
- desc: 'I read "Professional association" on Wikipedia. The link to "Professional
    association" was under the plan for March 30th.

    In the class we discussed about CIPS and had breakout room discussion on "Is it
    possible to act professionally without certification?". We had a really good discussion
    because the size of the breakout room was larger. We agreed that having a certificate
    does not improve your technical skills but it might help in getting a job. In
    my opinion, the CIPS certification is really important because in order to become
    an I.S.P or ITCP you have to have experience and pass an ethics test. You also
    need good references and have to meet or exceed the criteria of working a certain
    hours in a year. CIPS certification shows that you have taken an ethics training
    and have successfully passed the ethics test. CIPS certification also makes it
    easy for professionals to move with in Canada as well as other countries and still
    be recognized as a computer professional. I am definitely getting a CIPS certification.'

    Title: Professional Bodies

    Much like professional designations, professional bodies are the organizations
    who give the designation to an individual upon completion of some activity or
    demonstration of expertise. For example, project frameworks like Agile/Scrum and
    others give their stamp of approval of passing the benchmark allowing one to become
    a scrum master, agile leader in an organization. For computing professionals the
    ability to manage certain tech stacks, can be controlled and approved by these
    professional bodies. In a similar dimension, engineering bodes are responsible
    for the approval of professional engineers, like APEGA (AB), APEGS (SK) and similar
    for the other provinces, it establishes a very important benchmark for engineers,
    ultimately benefiting organizations by hiring individuals who have passed that
    ethical/technical or professional bar.'
- desc: 'First "engagement" completed since the first few weeks for me... Time to
    get back on track.


    I enjoyed yesterday''s class quite a lot, and enjoyed my discussion with (a student
    who will remain nameless) in our breakout room.


    He posited that there cannot be shared "ethics", as what one person thinks is
    "right" will differ in some edge cases from others. He believed that although
    there will be significant overlap between people conditioned in the same cultural
    circumstances, that the question "can you be ethical without CIPS" is meaningless
    as nobody could define what is ethical.


    I rejected his assertion about the impossibility of a shared ethic and said that
    developing a framework to evaluate the "right"-ness of decisions is not only possible
    but necessary in order for us to interact productively/cooperatively as humans.
    It was good to have a respectful debate in the breakout room.


    P.S. Australia, Antarctica, Greenland, Islands'
- desc: Professional associations usually employ professional personnel to establish
    an official evaluation agency. Such institutions protect the interests of professionals
    to a certain extent, but they also occasionally create monopolies. For example,
    if there is only one agency, they can implement it according to their own standards,
    but sometimes it is unfair to a few people because of this.
- desc: The world gives a lot of importance to certification for computer professional
    and the live examples are students studying in the university especially the internation
    students as we discussed these in group.Today everything is available on internet
    to learn for free but companies look forward to the one which has certificate
    over the self learner
- desc: We had a brief discussion on importance of certification on computer professionals
    in breakout room. We came to the conclusion that no matter how many certificates
    you have without practical experience. We are spending 22000 dollars a year as
    students but that doesn't mean we have experience or we are professionals. Professionalism
    can only be gained by experience of real work.
- desc: The central point of the yesterday meeeting was significance of professional
    certificate. According to my personal inclination experience is also a certificate
    so we can say that there are some fields in information technology where the professional
    certification can be neglected. However we cannot ignore the importance of certificate.
    The another activities which were done in yesterday class was providing extension
    to assignments and taking opinion from student through poles. The another important
    thing is it would be great for us having a professional guest from our field to
    provide knowledge about career opportunities.
- desc: I would say that certification is just a formal way to say that you are a
    professional, but I wondered how relevant certification is when the employer's
    code of ethics may be different from the code surrounding the certification.
- desc: in the last meeting, we did 2 polls , first one was regarding consent to having
    an another guest in the course lecture and second was about extending due date
    until 1 April. as a student, i voted for having an guest as an employer in class,
    as it can be useful for everyone to get some employment regarding information
    which can be beneficial for current and future professional job hunters. There
    was a interesting discussion in breakout rooms on the topic as what we think about
    the role of certificate for getting a job. I think in our technological field,
    practical experience and knowledge is far more important than any type of certification,
    because in todays' era that is what companies looking for, in their future employees.
    and in our room most of the students have same view that experience is biggest
    asset and certificate is just an paper to catch recruiter's attention.
- desc: Professional associations help maintain regulations in any system. it helps
    to have them in every profession including computer professionals. they help uphold
    public interest and promote the system
- desc: 'In this meeting, we discussed about the empathy map''s deadline which was
    pushed to a new date. Then we discussed if certification is necessary or not,
    and were sent into breakout rooms to discuss the same. I think that certification
    is not necessary to look professional as our knowledge and what we know is more
    important.

    '
- desc: We discussed different topics in previous lectures which were necessary, I
    believe. I like that's not just students merely knowing about decisions or modifications,
    but they really are part of that decision-making process. They have an opportunity
    to express their opinions and decisions are taken by a majority.
- desc: WOW! Last meeting was really engaging and I really liked the discussion about
    our topic regarding certification. Also bigger focus group mean more discussion
    so I would say lets keep it like that. And kudos to professor Hepting for extending
    the deadlines. Thank you, sir!
- desc: On last meeting, we discussed about the professional association, many of
    us are wondering Is the CIPS really works when they looking for a job? So, what
    we should know is what is professional association? a professional association
    is a group of people or a organization that have a authority to give the certificate
    for the people who are qualified with the knowledge of the area. this is a prove
    that the member of association has the enough knowledge in the specific area,
    some association is very well-known like QA.
- desc: Thinking more on the the question that was posed for the breakout rooms, about
    whether it is possible to act professionally without certification. I am of the
    opinion that yes, one can act professionally even without a special certificate.
    To suggest otherwise would be disadvantageous to those who may not have had the
    opportunity for such certification or do not have the time/funds to complete special
    certification on top of acquiring a diploma or degree. That is not to say that
    certification is not important, but rather to be mindful of those who do not --
    and not to think of them as 'lesser' within your field.
- desc: "Since we've been talking about certification as well as governing bodies\
    \ for computing similar to the College of Physicians or the Canadian Bar Association,\
    \ I've been thinking a lot about how computing doesn't have its own consistent\
    \ version of this in Canada that is required upon entering the field. I think\
    \ this is in part due to the fact that you don't necessarily need the education\
    \ to enter the field, which can be a benefit as this allows many people to potentially\
    \ enter the field that wouldn't be able to do other things due to prohibitive\
    \ costs.\nI'd be curious, however, to learn if that is actually true and whether\
    \ or not we SHOULD be implementing something of the sort. Would that increase\
    \ accountability and responsibility in an industry that lacks a consistent ethical\
    \ framework? Would it further bar underprivileged and marginalized people from\
    \ entering the field due to prohibitive costs of education?\nSide note: I noticed\
    \ that CIPS claims that it is \"Canada\u2019s only legally recognized designation\
    \ for IT professionals,\" how does this compare to the ACM in Canada and why wouldn't\
    \ the ACM be \"legally recognized\"?"
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from this meeting was the discussion
    about acting professionally without certification. It may be challenging but I
    think it is possible to act professionally without certification. Certification
    is necessary to show others that you have qualifications and professionalism.
    Without certification, you would have a harder time convincing others that you
    are a professional in a field. If others have it, then you should get it as well
    to avoid having a disadvantage.
- desc: I thought the most important thing I learned from meeting 21 was the significance
    of professional bodies; for me in particular, I found the most significance in
    that these professional associations "seek to further the interests of individuals
    engaged in that profession and the public interest" because that is what is most
    important to me (in the context of what a professional body could provide). Engaging
    interest furthers the field, and furthering of a field usually further engages
    interest, and all of that (usually) serves the public interest.
- desc: I believe that professional association seeks to further a particular profession,
    the interests of any individuals engaged in that profession and the public interest.
    could you recommend additional professional association for Software Engineering
    students please. Also could you discuss the content of the final exam.
- desc: In this class, we mainly discussed about the last personal assignment and
    more about how to allocate the time of different projects reasonably. We discussed
    a lot about the use of tracking software and expressed our views.
- desc: In last lecture, we talked about a bunch of things. we learned about "Professionalism"
    with reference of an article posted on Wikepedia of Professional Association.
    It basically said that professional association is nothing but an association
    seeking a specific profession, the interest of people and one's indulged in it.
- desc: In our last meeting we discussed about certification and its impact/effectiveness.
    Its more of a follow up of the previous class. In the breakout room we discussed
    the point of having a certificate in the first place, why its needed, if its obsolete
    or not and the necessecity of it. It is a foggy topic so there was no clear answer
    to any of those. Additionally, we also debated about if Australia is a island
    or not.
- desc: In the meeting 21, we going to talk about the due date for Empathy Map, and
    some other questions to select the answer.
- desc: This meeting we have discussed the next guest meeting. We have decided to
    meet up with a researchers. In my opinion, it is very interesting to have a researcher
    as a guest because it helps us to see the new adventures of science and how researchers
    make up and Brianstorm their ideas with the selection of their parameters of data.
    I am personally looking forward to have this meeting soon!
- desc: Last class, we talk about what is a professional association. Wikipedia has
    clearly defined what a professional association is. We also explained this in
    detail in class
- desc: In class we were asked if one could act professionally without certification.
    My answer in response to this question is absolutely. Some of the most successful
    people in the world didn't get proper certification for the things that they created.
    Think about the guys who skipped university and became successful beyond belief
    like Mark Zuckerburg. He didn't have certification in computer science or communications
    but still created one of the most essential technological communication services
    ever.
- desc: The topic here is about the Professionalism and related professional bodies
    it means that a body acting to safeguard the public interest. It also describes
    a attitude , different behaviors and actions. This also has the profound implication
    which actually means this three are correlatively connected to each other which
    means that the attitude drives behavior and behavior drives action and this also
    re-enforces attitude. So this process does not end and which makes one professional.
    Hence the highest level professionals offer is judgement and the help they provide
    to support people.
- desc: In the last class we talked a bit about the presentation by Thomas Boxall
    on CIPS, we also had to do a poll on our thoughts about certification. I would
    love to learn more about different types of certifications we can get as computer
    science students because I believe in the future, it can help in qualifications
    of more advanced positions and also increase ones earning potential.
- desc: It is entirely possible to act professionally without certification. While,
    for some, certification may just be a label, for others it may provide incentive
    to uphold a set of ethical standards. Despite this, I believe that those who are
    committed to acting professionally and ethically will do so regardless of whether
    they have certification or not. This then presents the question of what acting
    professionally in the tech industry looks like, especially when there is no universally
    accepted code. Thus, it is necessary to develop a universal code of ethics that
    is required to be upheld by all computer professionals.
- desc: A business organisation or a standards society are other names for a professional
    association. It is a team made up of and for employees who work in almost the
    same field. Professional associations exist in every industry, such as with retail
    chains, fundraising events, publishers, scientists, and legal assistants. A professional
    association, regarded as a thought leader in its field, establishes, keeps, and
    enforces standards while also serving as a public framework.
- desc: Meeting 21 was great and our breakout discussion in class made me learn students
    are more interested in the practical learning and learning skill that would actually
    help them solve real-life problems rather than getting a certification from a
    professional body.
- desc: 'In this meeting, we discussed on being professional and being certified


    I my own opinion, to be a professional means one have a good knowledge of the
    field he is into.

    One can be a professional without having certifications.

    Though certification makes one outstanding

    In the field of Information Technology, I believe certifications are really needed
    because there are courses one need to be certified in other to have an in-depth
    knowledge.'
- desc: We discussed whether certification is important for the IT profession or not.
    Well According to me certification is not important in the IT profession. I believe
    so because a piece of paper cant tell a person his or her worth. In the end, it's
    all about how much knowledge you actually have and how u implement your logic
    and ideas.
- desc: Well mostly we talked about if we should have a neither quest speaker which
    honestly just having someone explain a new perspective is a very interest thing
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from the lecture is the information
    about the Professional association about CS, I think join a Professional association
    is very important for me as a computer science major student. The certification
    such as CIPS, AITP is a good way for the employer and employee to have a good
    understanding for each other.
- desc: In the last meeting we had a two polls. First poll was about who should be
    our next guest and second poll was related to empathy map due date extension.
    After that we all went to breakout rooms and discussed about why certification
    is important to get a good job. As per my perspective a certificate is helpful
    to learn a new concept beyond what we had learnt in our university.
- desc: I believe having professional bodies and certifications in certain fields
    is a nice thing to have but not necessary and can be somewhat misleading. If am
    employer is hiring for a position and two people apply but one has a professional
    certification but the same education as the other they are more likely to be hired
    over the person that doesn't have the certification even if the person without
    the certification is more qualified. Also having to pay for these certification
    make them just sound like a money grab for the companies that give out the certifications.
- desc: In last meeting we talked about whether is it possible to act professionally
    without certification? If so, why is it important? My response to this question
    is that yes. Certifications are just simply an award for gaining knowledge. But,
    knowledge not put in to action is technically useless. Certifications don't guarantee
    that the holder of it acts in accordance to the knowledge that is teaches. Professionalism
    is not defined by any certification. It's defined by a person's personal work
    ethics. To me saying professionalism is only for people with certificates is like
    saying maturity is only for people with certificates.
- desc: In the last, we had a thorough brief discussion about if the certifications
    are required in enrollment for the jobs. Additionally, there are several jobs
    incorporating technical skills (i.e electrical, mechanical) needs the certificate
    to get eligible for the job. Generally, I feel certification augments your career
    opportunities and helps you get one step closer to getting a professional job.
    We also talked about different certification which are CIPS, Microsoft and many
    others. Therefore, certificate programs can help you develop the skills and experiences
    necessary for a particular job.
- desc: "We were put into breakout room and there were more participants as compared\
    \ to last time which was good last class we discussed that is cips necessary?\
    \ According to me having cips certification doesn\u2019t define the skills rather\
    \ it just gives them the proof that a person is skilled ."
- desc: In the last class we discussed about the CIPS certification. Personally I
    feel that the certification for the code of ethics does not necessarily stop anyone
    from going against it.The decision to follow the code of ethics will always still
    be in the hands of the professional at the end of the day.
- desc: I found going down the path of certifications to be exhausting. So many acronyms
    that people love investing time and money on, only to add them to the end of their
    digital signature and still be useless in the office. I agree that the people
    you surround yourself with do help to define you, but your work and a piece of
    paper does not.
- desc: In the last class, we discussed whether an AITP designation is necessary for
    graduates in computer science. In my opinion, it is not required to have one,
    but the certification could be a plus. As computer science students, they should
    focus on improving knowledge level and problem-solving skills. When looking for
    a job, showing the employer that you can solve problems is more important than
    having an AITP designation. There is no doubt that the person certified by CIPS
    will be more advantageous if all candidates are at the same level.
- desc: In last lecture we talked about, certifications that are required for the
    jobs and how it helps us to develop the skills and experience needed for a job
- desc: 'In the last meeting, we discussed about why the certificate is important
    in the computer profession.

    I personally think that certificates are very important in the IT world because
    they are the proof that the person has completed the particular course and has
    the knowledge about the p[particular language or think.

    Secondly, there can be a situation that a person can afford a whole degree or
    he only wants to pursue in only one sector or language in this situation certificates
    play an important role because, in the IT world, the computer profession is more
    selective so Certificates plays an important role.'
- desc: In this meeting there was an interesting discussion that was asked during
    the breakout room about can we still act professional even without a degree and
    many student had different opinion. I personal think we don't need a degree to
    act professional because somethings are common sense and having a degree or not
    having one doesn't matter as long as you think before acting. For example making
    a software with intention to harm people could be done with someone who has a
    degree or not and also a person without a degree knows that making something that
    harm society or others is not right so there is no need to be educated for it.
- desc: 'The function of a Professional association mainly includes two parts: economic
    function and legal value. The Professional association''s purpose mostly includes
    promoting the industry''s economic development and making the rules. A professional
    association is usually a bridge between the government and the enterprises, affecting
    communication and coordination. However, it is not a government agency department
    or not-for-profit company; it is a social organization representing the group''s
    interests. Therefore, Joining a Professional association is useful for many people.'
- desc: The working of professional society was introduced in the past lecture. The
    professional associations consist of a group of learned people whose job is to
    maintain control over the practice of an occupation. The extent to which the importance
    of certification to pursue a particular practice in the real world was also explained
    in the last class.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is what acting professionally meant to
    me. I believe that acting with respect is just as important as acting with skill
    in your profession. A concept that was hard for me to understand was how certifications
    affect professionalism. To be more specific, I believe with or without a certificate,
    it is possible to act professionally, especially if you have acquired knowledge
    or experience outside of education. I would like to learn more about HOW certificates,
    and the path to obtain them, may potentially affect someone's level, or ability,
    to act professionally.
- desc: In this class we discussed about importance of certification we discussed
    whether certification is important in real world IT sector or not.In our group
    most of the people would disagree with this.I am also they argue that certification
    is not any surity about morality.We agreed that certifications like ccna and A+
    has their importance
- desc: in our last zoom meeting, we discussed about is certification is necessary
    or not by a poll discussion. As it is necessary to act professionally. Also, we
    discussed in the breakout room. Basically, certification doesn't describe the
    human nature or behavior.
- desc: We got extensions to our assignments in the meeting and professional associations
    furthers the particular profession.
- desc: In the last meeting we have breakout room discussion regarding role of certification
    in professionalism which was quite interesting and a majority view of my group
    was towards that in our computing industry experience and practice are main things
    that most employer are looking for. On the other hand we can not neglect certification
    which is also a first step when someone is looking for a job. I believe if someone
    did not have certification but has computing knowledge and skills he/ she can
    do something on their behalf instead of working for someone else for eg.(designing
    an application or build a software).In last meeting we had two polls one is for
    extension of due dates and second is for inviting another guest in class, for
    which as a student i vote yes, we should have guest in class which will be very
    helpful for future job seekers or also to enhance our knowledge.
- desc: Last time, we spoke about whether or not certification is needed for certain
    employment. This discussion sparked my curiosity because learning more about it
    would be beneficial to us in the future.
- desc: We get to learn about is certificates are necessary to get a good job and
    we had a detail conversation with the professor and other classmates . And sir
    asked us about what other kind of person we want to invite to our class to guide
    us.
- desc: In the class , we were assign to groups and for me I feel a getting a certification
    on ethics is not necessarily since following the code of ethics still depends
    on professionals
- desc: 'A concept I would like to learn more about is the relationship between CIPS
    and computing as a whole. Computer science is a very broad topic (incorporating
    many different careers) and thus would the CIPS code of ethics be a good general
    guideline to follow for say a software developer. For example, there might not
    be a designated organization for software development, therefore, an internal
    (and quality) code of ethics will be required. Another question is what is the
    reasoning for some of the code of ethics. What was the reasoning for say needing
    to contribute to the IT profession?

    '
- desc: In the last class meeting prof extend the due date for blog and also expalin
    about a interesting topic
- desc: In the last meeting, we came to know about roles of professional associations
    and the degree of the importance of the certification to perform a particular
    practice. Professional societies are those who look after to protect public interest
    by ensuring that right people get to do the right thing. The people with the knowledge
    about a particular skill and with a proper certification should be allowed to
    practice the skill practically for the benefit of the society. This will ensure
    protection to the public interest.
