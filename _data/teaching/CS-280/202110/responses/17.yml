- desc: In the last class, we talked about how technology can help make our lives
    more sustainable. We have seen the use of technology for the betterment of human
    civilization. All the satellites that we use for providing internet and to provide
    a prediction for floods and droughts have helped framers across the world. The
    use of eclectic cars has reduced carbon emissions across the globe. Technology
    in the current pandemic has helped a lot to connect people all across the world
    and teachers, parents, governments, and health officials could connect with their
    counterparts without fearing any data breach and they can feel that they are connected
    even when they are far away.
- desc: "On meeting 17 we discussed the sustainability for internet for this century,\
    \ and I have watched the two Ted talk videos for William Mcdough and Tim-Berners\
    \ Lee, they give us the idea of nowadays industry influence for public and why\
    \ we build an open web, Ideas for Cradle to cradle design, we have known that\
    \ Industry is damaging to the environment, Reducing, reusing and recycling are\
    \ good ideas but they\u2019re not enough to make a difference. For The New Web,\
    \ we\u2019ve learnt building a web for open, linked data that could do for numbers\
    \ what the Web did for words, pictures, video: unlock our data and reframe the\
    \ way we use it together."
- desc: 'Sustainability is very important. For example, nowadays human activities
    are constantly consuming resources. If resources are used up, then human beings
    will be in danger, which is also the importance of sustainability. However, sustainability
    is still important in the online world, and we need to build a sustainable online
    environment to cope with the growing number of users in the future.

- desc: 'The most important thing I learnt about is spime. Spime is an object that
    could be track through space and time throughout its lifetime. Its all information
    is stored in a cloud.

    It is a mechanism that could track any thing on Earth.'
- desc: "I do like breakout meetings if the people are willing to participate in them.\
    \ If they don\u2019t, then it just honestly sad.\nThanks for the blog post 2 due\
    \ date extension. Lots of people need it.\nWith all these tech gadgets available.\
    \ How can you maintain privacy once you have them inside your home?\nSustainability\
    \ from the computer professional side. Create gadgets that don\u2019t get outdated\
    \ right away and produce more e-waste. Some parts of e-waste are recyclable while\
    \ the other part is not. Create more efficient apps that require fewer resources\
    \ to run, so it doesn\u2019t make a lot of energy to power them."
- desc: 'We had a breakout room discussion about what responsibility do Computer Science
    Professionals have in order to embrace sustainability in their work. We agreed
    that the best that they can do is devise methods, create products which will help
    in solving sustainability of humans in the long run. Wikipedia defines that the
    field of Computational Sustainability, attempts to optimize the social, economic
    and environmental resources, using the power of computers to process large quantities
    of data and provide an efficient, sustainable decision to allocate resources in
    real-time. For example, the Intelligent Transportation System(ITS) attempts to
    improve travel safety and reduce travel times while minimizing the emission of
    green-house gases into the atmosphere.

    '
- desc: "In our 17th meeting we discussed about sustainability, our 2nd blog, SaskPower,\
    \ and computer professionals\u2019 goals towards sustainability. In class we were\
    \ asked to describe what is sustainability. When we were placed in groups to discuss,\
    \ we said that doing small things like not using single use non-biodegradable\
    \ plastic bags, straws and cutlery although businesses should also do their part\
    \ with sustainable responsibility and not simply leave it to the consumer. An\
    \ example of possible sustainability with the expense of security and privacy\
    \ was SaskPower\u2019s smart meters to control electricity consumption. One example\
    \ of sustainability that computer professionals should be responsible for is making\
    \ their obtained data released to the public."
- desc: I am interested in the concept of sustainability for software engineers. It
    is important for software engineers to create software that can still run on old
    hardware, so that there is not an unnecessary amount of waste created with an
    update in hardware.
- desc: Our talk about sustainability reminded me about these videos on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJnJ8mK3Q3g
    & https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvzvM9tf5s0). One video talks about why recycling
    is basically a scam due to many reasons (economics, lower concern for plastic
    use, etc.) and the other compares plastic bags vs more "sustainable bags" respectively,
    and it's pretty shocking information. It's pretty eye-opening to learn about things
    that you once thought were sustainable but actually are not. This just shows as
    important sustainability is we need to have better information of what is truly
    sustainable before making decisions on sustainability.
- desc: In last lecture we had a discussion about technology. That how it is useful
    in our day to day life. Even in this cureent pandemic, it became more useful in
    every field.
- desc: Something I encountered that is related to the past meeting was at a past
    workplace. I used to work at a computer repair shop, and the amount of technical
    waste we accumulated daily was extremely high. In class, we discussed the value
    that data can have on sustainability and environmental impact. Due to my past
    experience working with old and broken technology, when considering sustainability
    and how IT professionals can be more sustainable, I think it is also important
    to consider technical products and how those pieces of equipment can be more sustainable.
- desc: "In class, an explanation of Bruce Sterling's \u201Cspines\u201D was given,\
    \ and how it relates to possible harms from IoT lifecycles that have finished\
    \ serving their purpose. I think this is comparable to online spaces, as younger\
    \ generations spend their entire lives connected to the internet. Anything online\
    \ that they have done in the past could be accessible, stolen, or used against\
    \ them, despite that corner of the internet being at \u201Cthe end of its lifecycle\u201D\
    . I think there's a potential danger there for people being exploited for things\
    \ they have done when they are young and immature."
- desc: I feel like today's discussion about Sustainability needs to be done on a
    much larger scale than an Undergraduate class. I really love the fact that big
    tech giants like Apple, Microsoft and Samsung are shifting to recycled materials
    as come to think of it, it will mean that millions of people will indirectly be
    a part of the green initiative. Also, in my opinion, bigger corporations need
    to step up and start doing their part for the world otherwise we're headed towards
    Armageddon
- desc: It was great discussing sustainability and privacy in a group, also thank
    you for extending the submission for blog2. Under the submission of blog1 it says
    grades ready to release but nothing yet seen so if you can do that would be great.
    Thank you.
- desc: 'In the last meeting, we discussed how technology can help make our life more
    sustainable. We saw how technology is used for the betterment of humans beings.
    The satellites that we use to provide information about any upcoming disasters
    before time have helped people globally in many ways. Nowadays we are using electric
    cars which reduces the level of CO2 from the atmosphere and not only helping humans
    but also mother earth to heal. Most of all in a hard time of pandemic we can connect
    to people across the world on the tip of our finger. It made things easy for us
    like teaching, government, health officials etc can connect to the server without
    the fear of any data breach.

    It was an interesting lecture.'
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from this class was on the topic of
    sustainability. Sustainability is important because resources are scarce. Since
    most companies in various sectors use computers and software to do work, computer
    professionals can contribute to sustainability by developing better programs and
    algorithms for many areas such as manufacturing, distribution of energy, etc.
    Computer professionals have a great potential to contribute because they have
    already transformed the world for the better with the development of the internet,
    computers, and mobile devices.
- desc: The most interesting thing was how data is analyzed and used to boom the market
    for businesses but its also shocking how it is not breach in people's privacy,
    from google tracking to proctor track, data is being spelled by major organization
    for their benefits. Data plays most crucial rule role in todays world but there
    are rising concern for the same that needs to be resolved
- desc: "In the past meeting we had 2 breakout seasons. The first one about \u201C\
    What is sustainability\u201D and 2nd one is about \u201Cwhat\u2019s the computer\
    \ science view on sustainability\u201D. After both seasons, we had a discussion\
    \ about what was our thoughts about it. In my opinion nothing really has sustainability,\
    \ there will be always some new ideas to replace the old idea. On the matter of\
    \ computer science, I think sustainability is a growing field. There will be more\
    \ and more new methods and tools to upgrade the applications."
- desc: "In the last meeting we attended a breakout season to discuss about What is\
    \ sustainability. Then professor was asking about what\u2019s each groups opinion\
    \ about the topic. Then we talked about the blog 2. Professor discussed what should\
    \ be main focus for the blog 2. He also changed the date for blog 2 submission.\
    \ He also talked a bit about the 2 ted talk (cradle to cradle design) & (The next\
    \ web). In the cradle to cradle design, the speaker talk about triple top line.\
    \ It\u2019s the idea that any design can be used under component, and it can be\
    \ reintegrated. Any component can be reused to create something new so there won\u2019\
    t be much waste. In the next web, the speaker talked about raw data, making data\
    \ available through the link and through the web standards. After that we had\
    \ another breakout season where we talked about what\u2019s the computer science\
    \ view on sustainability."
- desc: It seems to me that sustainability as it relates to CS means systems that
    only collect data that is necessary and is known to the users, which is used solely
    to improve the users' experience.
- desc: "After listening to Tim Berners-Lee, it only continues to pique my interest\
    \ in the topic of data. Linked data is something I often desire, both in professional\
    \ fields, and my own personal interests or hobbies. I hope we explore the idea\
    \ of \u201Clinked data\u201D more."
- desc: 'Thoughts on the Next Web

    The Next Web is the title of a TED talk given by the creator of the world-wide-web
    and head of the W3C organizations that oversees the development of the web. He
    delivers an inspiring speech on the nature of the web, the dilemmas it solved
    and the atmosphere generated in rooms by people at the first few instances experiencing
    the web. He continues to talk about the next generation of the web, how data will
    flow freely though-out society. Much of this has already either happened or is
    in progress in 2021. With the rise of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence,
    data has become a popular commodity. However, to keep that open-source spark going,
    lots of sources of data has become freely available to those who wish to experiment
    with it. For example, Kaggle.com is a self-made website by Anthony Goldbloom in
    2010. Under the arch of Google, Kaggle seeks to provide free data sets from a
    number of sources like healthcare to the environment weather data. To provide
    free training sets to experimental models. The web itself is far more open and
    freely available than it was in 2009 and that pace is continuing to accelerate
    with larger organizations driving progress.'
- desc: When we are talking about sustainability I think the pressure is on consumer
    and producer, but more so on the consumer. When we were talking about cradle to
    cradle designs this would only be effective if the end consumer recycles it. If
    there is no incentive for the consumer to recycle these products then a lot of
    people wont. Look at can recycling, a deposit is paid and then gotten back when
    you return it. So I think when computer professionals are looking at sustainability
    I think we would have to focus on why people will be recycling it.
- desc: I would like to know more about the idea, or term I suppose, "spime(s)". The
    wikipedia entry was very brief, I suppose due to this being an unconventional
    term, and I wished to see a few more examples of what could be considered "spimes",
    besides the "six facets of spimes" which were described rather broadly. However,
    from the wiki it is clear what Spimes are (or could be), I suppose I would have
    appreciated a bit more detail.
- desc: In this meeting we talked about sustainability which is taking decision while
    keeping the future impacts of the decision in mind. We had discussion about these
    and it was pretty fascinating to hear new ideas. Another interesting thing about
    meeting was discussion about the smart meters that were installed in homes for
    watching the consumption of an household and we came to know about many new things
- desc: Meeting was pretty interesting due to the fact that sustainability was being
    discussed and fellow student have pretty good ideas when we discussed it in a
    breakout room. Other than that we had another breakout room discussion about how
    computer professional contribute towards sustainability. Discussion about Volkswagen's
    emission controversy was really surprising for me. Smart meters were also discussed
    which were installed in Regina as well. Deadline for blog 2 was extended which
    was really good.
- desc: While it certainly is important to make sure that we are developing in an
    environmentally conscious way, such as avoiding making an application with a hardware
    component that we quickly abandon, I think that sustainability in this context
    has another meaning. A big part of sustainability is ensuring that the way we
    are developing now does not abuse the rights of users in such a way that would
    cause increased restrictions to be imposed on future generations. While realistically
    it can be anticipated that some privacy is lost when dealing with anything online,
    if we are intentionally taking that multiple steps further, it can possibly lead
    to increased regulations or restrictions on future generations, which can lead
    to complications developing in the future.
- desc: William McDonough, a green-minded architect and builder, asks in the first
    video how our buildings and products look if planners take all kids, all animals,
    into account. The principal objective of McDonough is to build a safer society
    which is a true intention for the present and the future. In addition, it is always
    really effective how he believes using instances. I believe that having a clear
    goal is critical in guiding us to our destination.
- desc: 'With this last meeting focusing on sustainability, we had a great discussion
    on how computing professionals can contribute to sustainability practices. I really
    enjoyed the thoughtful conversation, but I really struggle when people ask, "But
    what''s the motive or incentive for companies to implement these practices?" Of
    course, it''s an important question to ask! Obviously it is important to find
    reasons to convince the companies we work for to change their policies or their
    products; however, I really struggle to understand why this question needs to
    be asked all the time when the motive/incentive is just to be ethical.


    Why isn''t ethics enough? Why do we need to convince companies not to behave unethically?
    Why aren''t companies behaving ethically in the first place? Why is the primary
    concern in a company always utility or the bottom line?


    I don''t want to have to convince the people that I work for that we should be
    ethical, I want them to be prioritizing that from the get go, and to me that means
    a shift in the entire culture so that we don''t need to ask that question so much.'
- desc: "We learned many things in this class. I learned one of the most important\
    \ things that is the scientist Tim Berners-Lee has expressed his thoughts to a\
    \ new web, since he was the one to discover the world wide web and URL. He expresses\
    \ that the collection of data has the relationships called \u2018linked data\u2019\
    . He talks more about the Raw data of everyone, and every community is important,\
    \ but some raw data should be revealed from the communities like government for\
    \ transparency and to acknowledge their works. And there are many data that are\
    \ not connected to those that are relevant or those helps others for knowledge\
    \ or education purposes.\n\n"
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about 2nd blog and the professor changed its
    due date. Later we were divided into groups to have group discussions in the breakout
    rooms.
- desc: In meeting 17, we talked about the sustainability. The country should have
    the plan of repair the damage of nature that caused by human development. The
    environment of the earth getting worse if we compare it to 20 century. Because
    of building needs land, a lot of trees are cut down, because of the exhaust emissions,
    the fresh air is polluted.
- desc: In previous class, we saw two TED talk videos which said nothing but different
    aspects regarding technology and the way it assists life of billions of humans
    in an appropriate manner. Almost Everyone makes proper use of technology in some
    or the other form. Scientists are able to forecast or foresee many things for
    the calamities or any other natural phenomena upcoming in the near future after
    the invention of communication satellites. Such kind of Devices helps in forecasting
    weather or any kind of natural calamity, supports live video streaming, live telecast
    of sports such as basketball, football, etc can be done very easily these days.
    The global pandemic has helped technology to develop drastically in terms of every
    area. People can easily do distance learning,, see their family from anywhere
    around the globe and in-short it has lead to people come more closer to each other.
- desc: The last meeting was interesting where we discussed a little bit about privacy
    and then shift our topic to sustainability.
- desc: "My contributions as a future computer professional in sustainability are\
    \ as follows:\n\n-pay more attention on public\u2019s privacy by adding code of\
    \ conduct that ensures safety of public\u2019s data ,as privacy is a very fragile\
    \ topic these days.\n\n-updates on my interface would be more public friendly\
    \ keeping public\u2019s necessities and recommendations in mind.\n\n-rather than\
    \ filling my bank accounts it would be more of public supporting and public welfare\
    \ work .\_\n"
- desc: 'The most important thing discussed in the meeting was about the spime i.e
    neologism futuristic thing to the internet technology and the videos about the
    "the next web" and about the cradle design.


    topic that is related to the previous class is

    about the insecurities of the internet technology


    topic that is difficult to understand was about Spime and its affects


    topic i would like to learn more is about the cradle design as it is more interesting
    and gives us much knowledge about the thing running in present world'
- desc: Everything we do is done for one purpose, but sometimes these purposes seem
    to be self-contradictory. For example, printing the slogan "Protect Trees" on
    paper is obviously self-contradictory. Therefore, when designing a product, people
    must think comprehensively and put an end to such self-contradictory behaviour.
    In the future development of computer software, data interconnection is very important.
    This not only allows a substantial increase in user experience but also reduces
    the work of developers and allows the Internet to truly connect data.
- desc: In the video of ted talk william mcdonough talks about preventing environmental
    disaster and improving economic growth by cradle to cradle design.
- desc: In the class we talked about sustainability and how as a computer programmer
    we can make a software sustainable. In our group discussion we all suggested that
    we as an individual should make privacy options for the users so that they know
    what will happen with their data.
- desc: In the last class we discussed about sustainability and how using information
    tecnology we can help us to use our resources sustainabilly. In the Break ot room
    we discussed that tecnology such as electric vehicles can bring pollution caused
    by carbon dioxide to low levels and helps earth's atmosphere to remain sustainable.
- desc: "It is worth remembering, recent the web is: in January 1992, there were 50\
    \ web browsers in\_universe, generated as a result of the web in 1990. To represent,\
    \ linked data must be free, so the old styles of file transfers must give way\
    \ to heritage of data sharing: a commons of material which can be mentioned in\
    \ various ways. Rather than hoarding files and records as people currently do,\
    \ Berners-Lee advocates for 'raw data now' to allow a future of exchanging and\
    \ increased collaboration."
- desc: 'I learnt from the video "The next web" the differences between days before
    the web and days after web was created

    and the speaker also said that we have not reached the full potential'
- desc: "As for \"Cradle to cradle design\", it allows us to understand the environmental\
    \ issues and impacts of manufacturing and industrial systems.\nAs for \"The next\
    \ web\", there are three sources of dysfunction affecting today\u2019s web: deliberate,\
    \ malicious intent, system design that creates perverse incentives, and unintended\
    \ negative consequences"
- desc: Sustainability is extremely important in the world of technology and business.
    If you are going to create something either a product or a business you have to
    think about the future and what might come and plan accordingly so that your product
    or business will survive. The longest running companies or products that have
    been around for a long time are here because they are sustainable
- desc: "When a product meets the basic requirements of appearance, creativity, and\
    \ function, it also considers the enterprise's social responsibility. It still\
    \ doesn't qualify as \"good design.\" A good design should eliminate the idea\
    \ of waste\uFF0Cso all that is leftover can be used to make a new generation of\
    \ products at the end of the product's life cycle. Therefore\uFF0Cgood design\
    \ needs to consider sustainability\u2014for example, the \"cradle to cradle\"\
    \ green loop design. Coca-Cola creates a system where plastics and other recyclables\
    \ are used. As this system's scale begins to expand, we will see all kinds of\
    \ old plastics recycled as if they were new. So sustainable development is significant."
- desc: The way in which our society is designed plays an important role in the society.
    The goal is to achieve sustainable development. It can be achieved by efforts
    and inovation. People should try to build a society which does not harm anyone
    and the basic rights of people should be protected. Inovation plays an important
    part in achieving this goal and people should be given opportunities so that they
    can achieve the goal they want.
- desc: In this meeting we learnt about sustainability. People have different point
    of view on sustainability.There was an opinion that sustainability would be resources
    you consume should be less than the minimum amount that a planet can regenerate
    to ensure no deficit.If computer professionals make their data more available
    and transparent to the public, it will increase accountability and people will
    be able to make more thoughtful choices. It will give the public a chance to make
    more informed and sustainable decisions.
- desc: For me, sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or project.
    Sustainability is when we wisely use the resources and utilize our time and make
    decisions that have the future in mind. In a general sense, it means doing something
    now that can continue indefinitely, without impeding the ability of future generations
    to do so. Mostly as a neither way we can look at sustainability is that its also
    a way of stagnation since there is no need to bring in new ideas since they have
    a steady source of income. In a very broad sense, sustainability is when the resources
    you can consume is less than the minimum that the planet can regenerate in order
    to ensure no deficit.
- desc: The past meeting was about the stuff related to design and the way in which
    designs impact the development of human. Every action taken by the humans should
    be in under rules of sustainablitiy. Inovation is a great step to get success
    in planning a bright future. Government should promote this things and motivate
    its people to be inovative so that the effort is in right direction.
- desc: With the concept of cradle to cradle architecture, William McDonough suggests
    a solution to our unsustainable methods of production. Many companies and countries
    (including Nike, Gap, and China) have enlisted McDonough's support to build sustainable
    structures.
- desc: We talked about cradle architecture and how it can help us create more sustainable
    structures.
- desc: We discussed about sustainability and how computers affect the sustainability.
- desc: We had group discussion regarding the ways to increase the sustainability
    and as an outcome we came to conclusion that sustainability is directly proportional
    to privacy. If we increase the privacy measure in simple way find solutions to
    the problem that user data does not get leaked then we can attain sustainability
    and I would like to see more ways through which we can attain it and I also watched
    the videos on website they are really good
- desc: One thing I'm really curious and want to know more about is that if they actually
    made/built that city with farm on the top of the roof. Also on the second video
    was talked about how we should put more data on the web and how helpful it would
    be to our society. But it's also very important to know that putting our data
    blindly online without a good plan could become dangerous. For example there are
    companies that does free DNA test for you to know where your ancestor come from,
    however it is important to know that with allowing those companies to access to
    your DNA we are also making ourselves venerable to them because now they know
    a lot more about you and with this DNA test the can sell it to other companies
    like medical insurance to what kind of diseases you might get in the future.
- desc: The most important thing i learned from the last class was how techonlogy
    makes our lives more susatainable. Also, I found the ted talk about the next web
    to be very interesting because it talks about raw data, web in next generations
    and making data availaible through links.
- desc: The most important thing I talked about last meeting had to be sustainability.
    Our breakout group mentioned how sustainability is making decisions with the future
    in mind. The hardest thing for me to understand was cradle to cradle design. The
    "intention of our species" is a very broad topic that was hard for me to correlate
    to the design philosophies and examples in question. Sustainability is something
    I have been thinking about for a long time in every day life. I have thought about
    the sustainability of my work, student, and life balance. Not only that but the
    discussion of sustainability and the environment has been ongoing for my whole
    school life from late elementary school.
- desc: 'In this meeting, I learnt that Sustainability means meeting our own needs
    without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

    It is also the ability for something to be consistent.


    I also learnt on the concept of Spime which is a neologism for a futuristic object,
    characteristic to the Internet of Things that can be tracked through space and
    time throughout its lifetime.'
- desc: In the last lecture, we talked about how sustainability is crucial in this
    world and particularly in the technological context! I think, one of the major
    driving factors to tackle climate change in the future would be AI. Moreover,
    All of the recent tech trends, such as AI, ML, the Internet of Things, Big Data,
    edge computing, robotic process automation, and others, are designed to make our
    lives easier. That is why both ordinary consumers and large-scale companies are
    interested in these technologies and improvements. For example, artificial intelligence
    has been instrumental in complex data analysis and management aimed at long-term
    decision-making in areas such as climate change, air and water protection, biodiversity
    conservation, disaster resilience, and so on.
- desc: In this meeting we learnt about sustainability and how it is related to computer
    Science. We also had discussion about the good software design. The TED talk was
    very much related to the discussion in class and William Mcdonough very well explained
    sustainability by "cradle to cradle design". In the other TED talk by "The next
    web" explained about the development in the every sector of life and also gave
    idea that it is not yet at its full potential.
- desc: From the meeting i got to know that the due date of the vlog 2 has been extended
    and also for the empathy map and i would like to appreciate professor for cooperating
    with the students. The important topic which was discussed in the class was sustainability.
    From the medium of group discussion the discussion became more brief. Frankly
    before the class i had no factual information about this topic. but the meeting
    was very useful.
- desc: When it comes to sustainability in computer programming, the first thing that
    comes to mind is the ability for a project to be maintained with a reasonably
    low amount of resources being spent on it. A project that is continually causing
    issues and draining time and resources is not very sustainable. The term sustainability
    is also often referred to in conversations about the environment and taking care
    of the planet. Using recycled resources and items is a sustainable practice and
    can help reduce the waste made in the industry.
- desc: In the ted talk it was intresting topic of design, and how in everything it
    was used and how is the cycle like according to me for example to success in anything
    you have to work for it for years learn all the stuff than you became masters
    in it and that is exactly happens with the technology and design like phone apple
    how the first one was made and how the iphone12 is capable of doing things, so
    it basically takes time to get the best out of design to make it efficient as
    in the video he talked about the oil industry and how it is not 100% good for
    the nature on the other side the windmills are not at all affecting and creating
    almost the same type of energy, so we cant blame the designs everytime.
- desc: It is important for designers to create a sustainable platform for their consumers
    ,to help when the number of users grow in the future
- desc: After watching "the next web", I have learned that the data comes in many
    forms and there are many connections between data. The web is full of linked data
    that has three rows. The first one is http name used for people, places, and events.
    The second one is the data representing useful information. The last one is the
    relationships between data. The purpose of using data is to improve people's lives
    and delivering information to public. Even though all kinds of information are
    available on the web, much of the data remains hidden from the public such as
    government data.
- desc: "In our 17th meeting we discuss about sustainability and it\u2019s very intresting\
    \ topic. Sustainability does not have any particular definition but it is helpful\
    \ at multiple place.Sustainability is one the newest degree subjects that attempts\
    \ to bridge social science with civic engineering and environmental science with\
    \ the technology of the future. When we hear the word \u201Csustainability\u201D\
    \ we tend to think of renewable fuel sources, reducing carbon emissions, protecting\
    \ environments and a way of keeping the delicate ecosystems of our planet in balance.\
    \ In short, sustainability looks to protect our natural environment, human and\
    \ ecological health, while driving innovation and not compromising our way of\
    \ life."
- desc: In last lecture, we discuss about the blog entry 1 numbers and also about
    the due dates of blog entry2 and empathy map
- desc: 'In the class, the due dates were postponed, and discussed the following topics.


    In the TED talk by Tim Berners Lee, he talked about the linked data and how it
    very important to have the data linked on the web which would be useful in every
    aspect of life.


    Spime is referred to as the "Internet of Things". An object is considered to be
    a spine when all of its information can be found on the cloud.'
- desc: In the beginning of meeting 17 the professor made an announcement on the request
    of student of changing due date of the second blog. Which was an act of kindness
    and cooperation toward his students. The main topic for the today class was sustainability.
    Sustainability is the term which describe the management and disposal of information
    technology un such a productive way that it reduces the harm to the environment
    in other words sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy company or
    project with the use of resources and time making decision that have the future
    in the mind. Which was briefly discussed by breaking groups by the professor into
    the breakout rooms. During the second breakout room the topic was how computer
    professionals are contributing to the sustainability. In the class Dr. Hepting
    also discussed about two video which was by the WILLIAM MCDNOUGH and Tim -Berner
    Lee. In the video important points were made about the nowadays industry that
    how they are influencing the individuals. For making the environment green and
    sustainable 3 R phenomenon which is reducing ,recycling and reuse could be the
    useful idea but still we need to think something which is out of shell.
- desc: "The most important thing discussed in the meeting was about the spime i.e\
    \ neologism futuristic thing to the internet technology and the videos about the\
    \ \"the next web\" and about the cradle design. Topic which we can count as related\
    \ to the previous class is about the insecurities of the internet technology so\
    \ how privacy breach can happen and how can we tackle. Topic which I find difficult\
    \ to understand was about Spime and its affects. Topic I\u2019d like to learn\
    \ more is about the cradle design as it is more interesting and gives us much\
    \ knowledge about the thing running in present world."

- desc: We had a good meeting, and in the discussion, I learned about privacy and
    sustainability. So, privacy is a collection of data to protect it from unauthorized
    access, whereas; sustainability is a way to secure the future for the young generations.
- desc: In last lecture we discussed about how sustainability in technological innovation
    can help in future. Many of our problems can have an simple solution due to sustainability
    in technology. AI - artificial intelligence is one of the foremost example of
    it.
- desc: "I wondering if you could discuss the content of the final exam. I believe\_\
    An object can be considered a spime when all of its essential information is stored\
    \ in the cloud"
- desc: Tuesday it was very interesting to hear my groups (1 other person) talk about
    sustainability and how meaningful it is for the future. we are certainly moving
    forward towards that type of future but there is always a cost, Its very cool
    to be growing in this time but at the same time thinking about climate change
    is scary, i hope to see the planet become healthy throughout my lifetime.
