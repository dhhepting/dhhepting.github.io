- desc: I'd be interested in learning more about what people want done with food delivery
    apps charging too much. It would be very difficult to regulate this kind of business
    in my opinion. Since restaurants do not have to use this feature at all, they
    can get their own delivery drivers or make their own websites. The only real regulations
    they could impose are things on the ones the apps employ, that being drivers or
    people coding the app. As the EU did within the supreme court on Uber and their
    employees. I would be interested in learning more about what other people are
    opinions are on how you would go about this.
- desc: "These quotes from old, famous tech figures sometimes don\u2019t age well.\
    \ From my belief, the world of technology had completely outgrown the old views\
    \ of technology. Like Mark Zuckerberg testify before the Congress show their age.\
    \ If Lawmakers can\u2019t keep up with the world, then society can\u2019t be equally\
    \ protected from the age of information technology.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncbb5B85sd0\n\
    I would say most of the restaurant have online website and menu. If you don\u2019\
    t want to order through third-party apps or so. Just order directly from the restaurant,\
    \ usually, the restaurant has its delivery driver as well. It will save a lot\
    \ of money for the customer and the restaurants, by not using a third-party app\
    \ to let these behaviors continue."
- desc: What interested me in our discussion was the use of technology in driving
    forward a gig economy. It is essential to carefully consider transparency, worker
    protection rights, and responsibility when deploying software that enables such
    an economy. Furthermore, it is important for institutions to reconsider their
    purpose. This will become increasingly necessary in the near future. We can already
    see people bypassing traditional education to learn online. What is the benefit
    to this, and how does this affect people who choose to attend and pay for post-secondary
    education? What becomes the purpose of the programs in place today, and how much
    value do they hold in a changing world?
- desc: "In our 12th meeting we discussed about food delivery companies, restaurants,\
    \ and how to efficiently analyze and judge a decision. Uber Eats and Skip the\
    \ Dishes take more than 30% of every food order. Restaurants will either overcharge\
    \ their food or shut down due to the lack of regulation. We also watched a part\
    \ of a software engineering video about proper analysis and judgement. According\
    \ to the video to not get stuck in \u201Canalysis paralysis\u201D we must analyze\
    \ just enough details to make the right decision first and then analyze more details\
    \ that are down the correct decision path."
- desc: "The most important thing that I learned from last class was the difference\
    \ between judgement and analysis, and how both of these ideas relate to software\
    \ development. Judgement is the ability to choose the right path. Analysis is\
    \ the ability go very far down the decision path chosen. My main takeaway from\
    \ a much larger class conversation about how these two ideas relate to software\
    \ development is that just because we CAN make something (analysis), doesn\u2019\
    t mean we SHOULD (judgement)."
- desc: in this meeting we discuss about software engineering. the reason why software
    projects are falling. we did the poll about the protect property values in this
    meeting. Even discuss about that the government should support the people who
    lost their property in situation like natural disaster. They government is collecting
    the funds from the people but at the end they should help the people when they
    need. discuss about the fire dispatching system. Moreover discussed about the
    food delivery app such as skip the dishes. we were send into breakout room to
    discuss about the house hold properties that they should be protected.
- desc: The situation regarding the delivery service fee cap is best fit for the government
    to solve and regulate. I also want to point out that these delivery apps are an
    example of technology changing the way industries function. For example, when
    the taxi industry is regulated, along comes ride sharing where anyone with a phone
    and their own car can do the same job cheaper. Apps like Skip the Dishes and Uber
    are here to stay. All we need are some regulations to make them more compatible
    with the older systems. I also wouldn't be surprised if restaurants begin putting
    out their own delivery services (I've already seen that Tim Hortons start)
- desc: I think the most important concept I learned today was the importance of transparency.
    Transparency is something I initially did not think was too important, however,
    it is kind of shocking to see how hidden a company can operate, and thus it is
    difficult to gauge its true nature. Without transparency, it's really difficult
    to judge whether a company is ethical, moral, etc. Thus, to make decisions on
    whether to support or not support a company is really difficult, leaving the ability
    to sometimes hide shady/scummy business practices from the general public (like
    the 3rd-party food application delivery fees).
- desc: 'I wasn''t there for the lecture but i came across something pretty interesting
    while I was working on Blog Entry 1, I''d like to speak about The graphical user
    interface, which is a form of user interface that allows users to interact with
    electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicator such as primary
    notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text
    navigation. GUIs were introduced in reaction to the perceived steep learning curve
    of command-line interfaces which require commands to be typed on a computer keyboard.


    Other than computers, GUIs are used in many more gadgets such as mobile devices,
    MP3 players, portable media players, gaming devices, smartphones and smaller household,
    office and industrial controls. The term GUI tends not to be applied to other
    lower-display resolution types of interfaces, such as video games, or not including
    flat screens, like volumetric displays[10] because the term is restricted to the
    scope of two-dimensional display screens able to describe generic information,
    in the tradition of the computer science research at the Xerox Palo Alto Research
    Center.

- desc: In general, the food delivery apps have taken significant position from the
    restaurant in view of the existing circumstances. As nobody in winter want to
    dine in restaurants when they have the same food staying warm at home and so do
    I. I had bought food too many times on the skip, but in the past 2 months, I hadn't
    been to these restaurants. I did not realize, though, that they are receiving
    such big charges that many restaurants are being disturbed because of them, which
    is really a matter of concern.
- desc: In a last lecture I attend a meeting very late so I have no idea about what
    discussion is going on at which topic but it something related to employment may
    be I am not sure.
- desc: "\u201CStranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software Engineering Judgment\u201D\
    \ was very interesting. I learned about the Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy. I also learned\
    \ the difference between Analysis and Judgement. Analysis Paralysis also made\
    \ sense to me since I have experienced it personally. On a regular basis I also\
    \ see developers under appreciate and disrespect Synthesis done by the upper management\
    \ as well. Overall this was a really fascinating video to watch and learn from."
- desc: 'In this class we discussed about the video judgement applied to bloom''s
    taxonomy. Analysing a problem going down several paths and making a judgement
    on

    what is the right path bcz we make that descison at the very begining. Making
    the most important desicion first and leave the least important to the leaves
    of the tree

    .Concerns about vendor propositons. In breakout session we discussed if delivery
    apps making commission on orders is ethical or not.'
- desc: In the last class, we had a discussion about our project then about the software
    engineering judgment and about the food delivery that about the software processing
    and how it helps, and discussing various things about this topic such as about
    its application and the brief description related to it. The last class was a
    nice one as the interesting class was discussed.
- desc: Well for this one I honestly thought it was interesting considering that these
    big companies is that there is no big accountability considering that they dont
    really get insetive to not do it. There just going to apoligize then come back
    and do the same time over and over again. I will say that the sad part is that
    i was put into a break room bymyself so i did not got to disscuse it with the
    other students
- desc: "The most confusing thing from last meeting is in regards to Steve McConnell's\
    \ \u201CStranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software Engineering Judgment\u201D\
    \ presentation. I understand the distinction he makes between analysis and judgment,\
    \ but I struggle understanding how we can have good judgment without good analysis.\
    \ What's confusing is how you can \u201Cchoose the right branch\u201D (judgment)\
    \ without first looking at where the branch leads (analysis). I believe what he's\
    \ getting at is it's more important to think about why something should be made\
    \ (synthesis/creative thinking), rather than getting bogged down in how it's made."
- desc: "The rise of\
    \ service style applications\n\nThe current COVID-19 Pandemic has caused numerous\
    \ business to shut down and catastrophic damage for all layers of the economy.\
    \ Due to the pandemic itself, and especially during the initial stages where nation-wide\
    \ lockdowns were imposed, people still strived to support restaurants. The advent\
    \ of food delivery startup accelerated with the development of Uber Eats and Door\
    \ Dash in 2014 and 2013 respectively. Due to their popularity it became quickly\
    \ viable and provided the convenience to users to not order directly to the food\
    \ shop. Allowing a sort of Amazon like marketplace complete with food products,\
    \ and ratings of various stores. This has had a tumultuous impact on restaurants\
    \ since if they agree to join these services and proceed to digitize, the service\
    \ takes a significant chunk of the cash flow. DoorDash takes around 20%, and Uber\
    \ Eats taking a bigger 30% chunk. What\u2019s even more interesting though is\
    \ that this idea doesn\u2019t just apply to food. A recent wave of Fin-tech startups\
    \ in the buy now pay later phase could be just as harmful for smalltime business\
    \ shops in the same manner DoorDash and Uber hurt business owners. Affirm, one\
    \ of the more notable power players in the space, offers consumer a \u201Cbuy\
    \ now, pay later\u201D scheme with the organization paying the seller in full,\
    \ and letting the consumer pay back the company with 0% interest. However, this\
    \ only works since the original seller of the product agrees to pay Affirm a flat\
    \ percentage fee based on the product for it to be sold via Affirm\u2019s service.\
    \ If this isn\u2019t ringing any bells, it\u2019s almost the exact same methodology\
    \ used by DoorDash and Uber to dissuade in-house selling and allowing small business\
    \ to become reliant on the giant service application. It\u2019s especially concerning\
    \ since a lot of these business aren\u2019t Dior or Prada, but more mom & pop\
    \ shops or boutique startups seeking to make an impact culturally and financially.\
    \ If we lose stores like this, it\u2019s akin to losing a part of our multicultural\
    \ heritage as an open trading society."
- desc: I think the most important thing I learned from meeting 12 is the importance
    of variables (or factors) within really, any given subject material. The food
    delivery apps are a great example of this. I think most people would simply say
    that they are a blessing (especially during a pandemic) without giving it a second
    thought. But naturally, analysis of variables (preferably many) usually always
    reveal that arguments are not so black and white.
- desc: It was interesting to learn about the high cost of being on the food delivery
    apps. Obviously, being on a popular app is beneficial for a business but charging
    the business so much commission that they can't be profitable is not ideal. I
    agree that there should be a reasonable cap on the commission because restaurants
    will eventually have to raise their prices which will be detrimental to the consumers.
    The government should do more to help the restaurants that are struggling during
    this pandemic.
- desc: To be sure, in the context of the pandemic, food delivery apps have become
    a necessity, both for restaurants and consumers. However, the high fees charged
    by the delivery platform are constantly squeezing the restaurants and delivery
    workers. In fact, the delivery companies have monopolized the industry, and it
    is extremely unreasonable to charge 30% commission. Personally, I think the delivery
    platform should appropriately reduce the commission, otherwise, it will only lead
    to more restaurant closures, which will affect the deliverymen. At the same time,
    I think the government should step in and regulate these platforms more strictly.
- desc: In this meeting we started discussing Delivery apps and how they are hurting
    restaurants. I had no idea that the mark up was so high for these apps and since
    its such a new development there isn't any restrictions yet put in place which
    there need to be. I did hear from a friend that the drives do make a lot of money,
    he was saying that a guy made 600 dollars on a single weekend.
- desc: The class on Thursday was an overview for the week and was a continuous to
    what we did in Tuesday class. The class began with the overview what of meeting
    responses.The only suggestion i would like to suggest is that it would be better
    to emphasize if the professor can mute chat and open it only at the time when
    he need to know opinion. Because, in the class the comments were very disruptive
    for me.
- desc: On last meeting, we discussed about food application, and I read two reports
    about how the food application affects restaurants profits and human behavior
    in society, due to the statistic surprisingly, restaurant did not gain more money
    as we thought, most of money was taken by food delivery apps, due to the pandemic,
    food application do get more profit, and people are more likely to use food app
    than before.
- desc: "Regarding programs like skip the dishes or Uber eats, in a certain sense\
    \ it is almost a necessary evil for convenience. While it is unfortunate that\
    \ it does greatly cut into a restaurants earnings, dropping their margins per\
    \ plate, the significantly increased traffic it can bring, especially during a\
    \ pandemic, should outweigh the alternative of no orders. I know many people who\
    \ would otherwise never order at any normal \u201Csit in\u201D restaurants around\
    \ the city, but do skip the dishes fairly easily because of convenience, compared\
    \ to going through a fast food drive through or just eating while at home.\n\n\
    Similar to other concepts we\u2019ve covered in the course, convenience comes\
    \ at a price, whether that\u2019s on the client or host side."
- desc: In the last meeting we discussed about the how the food delivery app dominates
    the local resturants and take hefty 25% to 30% commision from there gross sales.
    we discussed how unethical is to take this much percentage during a pandemic when
    the resturants are struggling and we also discussed same in the break out room
    where we got prons about the delivery app that when in lockdown when resturant
    were getting no revenue, this apps help them to survive.
- desc: "From last day we were discussing food-delivery apps, such as Door Dash and\
    \ Skip the Dishes which engage in what can most charitably described as 'unethical\
    \ business practices'. This can be said for much of the 'gig economy' -- they\
    \ rely heavily on exploiting their workers and shortchanging the communities they\
    \ purport to be helping. An important ruling happened in the UK which has big\
    \ ramifications for gig workers, the ruling stated that Uber drivers should be\
    \ classed as \"workers\" not self-employed -- which would mean they are owed minimum\
    \ wage and holidays.\_https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/britain-rules-uber-drivers-employees-1.5919865\n\
    \nWould be interesting to see a similar ruling here in Canada."
- desc: 'Being professional is not only a need but an asset, Computing professionals
    perform a variety of tasks: They write specifications for new computer systems,
    they design instruction pipelines for superscalar processors, they diag- nose
    timing anomalies in embedded systems, they test and validate software systems,
    they restructure the back-end databases of inventory there for security purposes
    professional rules need to be followed'
- desc: I really enjoyed the discussion on value-based software engineering, especially
    the poll done where we discussed whether or not we should focus on 20% of fires
    if they cause 80% of property damage. Numbers are not always representative of
    harm caused, and breaking things down into statistics and figures isn't always
    the best way to determine what is morally correct. I remember in one of the STATS
    classes I took my prof talked about how easy it can be to lie with statistics,
    and how people analyzing them need to be incredibly careful about what those numbers
    mean. I think this is especially true when it comes to mitigation practice, as
    numbers aren't always representative of all of the information.
- desc: "In this meeting, we discussed how different food delivery companies charge\
    \ so much for the delivery and that neither the user nor the driver is benefited\
    \ from it. I think that they charge so much for the comfort they are providing\
    \ to the customers and they know that even if they hike the prices people are\
    \ still going to order for home delivery.\_\n"
- desc: I learnt about different aspect of technology
- desc: The two articles about the delivery apps really bring home the idea of regulation
    and laws. I find that big tech is allowed to get away with too much, these 30%
    commissions remind me of the recent news about Apple taking 30% commission from
    app store purchases. It is ridiculous, we live in an age of "anything is a tap
    away" some kind of terms have to be set for restaurants and these apps to coexist.
    I personally drove for Doordash in Vancouver and I can tell you it was a mess
    most nights. Things going wrong and parking illegally was just commonplace.
- desc: 'We discussed many things in this meeting, we talk about the food delivery
    services which cause the small business to suffer a lot. As small food businesses
    are not registered into these online applications, they are bypassed from this.
    And those are registered they have their own earning, but apps are making lots
    of money with the taxes and delivery fees. We also discussed about the ACM software
    engineering judgement, that reveals the changes from the previous rule to new
    one from 1956 to 2001. Since evaluate should be prior step to take then create
    in pyramid concept of ACM.


    '
- desc: 'As far as my experience goes all the "free" stuff that is advertised is often
    not really free and is just a hook to get people to invest/spend their money into
    something. Even in several software ads they advertise how "cool" and useful that
    software is and that its "free" but as soon as you download and install it it
    takes you to a billing page where it says: "Just enter your credit card info -
    you won''t be charged anything and will have a week of fre use" - which is an
    excellent strategy to take your money because once that is done, the billing info
    has been recorded. As soon as the week passes and the next time you use that application,
    you will automatically be charged for it. I do not like this approach at all.'
- desc: 'In the video "Stranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software Engineering
    Judgment with Steve McConnell" indicate 8 levels of being a programmer: Remember,
    Understand, Apply, Analysis, Create and Evolution. I think there are several required
    skills skills that being a programmer specifically : Be able to read code, Programming:
    requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, Release and maintenance, and be
    able to rebuild codes, optimizing the code without affecting any existing functions.'
- desc: In the last meeting, we discussed about software engineering as why software
    related project are not working accurately. Moreover, a pole has been also done
    about the protect property values. Food delivery apps were also discussed a little
    bit. In breakout rooms, we discussed about the the household properties as why
    and how it should be made safe in future.
- desc: Regarding to the last meeting, I think I would like to know more on how applications
    like Skipthedishes, uber or amazon can become more ethical when it comes to their
    service. It seems that people/consumers/users are really just focused on the comfort
    of these services that ethical problems get overlooked. How can software improve
    to be more ethical along with being comfortable and usable? It seems like there
    is a lack of awareness when it comes to these things in the tech realm.
- desc: In these hard times, I appreciate the help provided by these delivery organizations.
    trying to run both the restaurant businesses and the country's cash flow. its
    better than nothing. according to me here nobody is wrong nor the business owner
    nor the delivery modes. this case is more of a lawful conditional than an ethical.
    both business should sit on the table and discuss about their requirements and
    allow governments to choose how things should be .
- desc: Projects always need to be organized and coordinated for the sake of the safety
    of people because safety has priority in the success of any project. The conclusion
    of this meeting was watching a video explaining the issued reports on the consequences
    of the software project. It determines how to use sound judgment in software engineering
    to significantly progress the understanding of software project dynamics, which
    in turn leads to correct failure judgement, more effective corrective actions
    for projects already underway, and greatly improved chances of success in each
    project.
- desc: The last meeting was really interesting.
- desc: the main questions that i have from last meeting revolves arounds the idea
    of analysis paralysis. if it is so prevalent in the field to have it assigned
    and name there must be a root cause in the instruction of the field itself and
    if that is the case what is being done to attempt to fix this problem.
- desc: One thing that I learned in this meeting and it really surprised me was the
    fact how much commission these delivery apps take from from restaurants just because
    people use a few swipes and click from their app. I thinks it's very unfair to
    restaurant owners because they are the ones that shoulders all the cost from goods
    to electricity and water that are used in preparing the food but however at then
    end its these apps that gets all the benefits. I think we as a consumer should
    not let this happen because usually these apps are not from local but theses restaurants
    are own locally and by using these apps to order more we are hurting our own local
    economy and people.
- desc: I enjoyed the discussion about the food delivery apps. I agree that there
    is not enough transparency in regards to how some of these services operate and
    collect revenue. I have used Skip the Dishes in the past, and was under the assumption
    that these types of services helped to promote more profits for local businesses.
    I enjoy when the classroom finds a rhythm and a discussion unfolds, the break
    out rooms lose me.
- desc: I found it interesting that services like skip the dishes, or door dash, were
    being considered "overpriced" for what they do. I can't understand how this could
    be a problem, when there is always the option for both consumers, and restaurants
    to just not participate in their business. The technology allows people to access
    takeout food from restaurants they may not have been able to get before, and I
    can only see this as being an increase in sales for restaurants. If the services
    really charged too much money, from restaurants or from consumers, the negatively
    affected groups would just not use the service.
- desc: In the previous meeting there was great discussion about the food delivering
    companies that how they are earning a lot by using their employees and not providing
    them proper benefits and their fixed salary. We discussed about "skip the dishes"
    and "Uber Eats" and these days everyone is enjoying this service but their employees
    are not getting enough pay for doing all this. Only these companies are getting
    benefited by earning the major share.
- desc: The most important thing I learned from last meeting is that food delivery
    apps treat their employees poorly. The most difficult concept for me to understand
    were the ways we can make a difference in regards to the treatment of food delivery
    employees. It was also difficult to wrap my head around the idea that most people
    know it might not be the best to support companies like amazon and food delivery
    apps, but still do. Although they might treat their employees badly and be putting
    local businesses or restaurants out of business, the convenience, especially during
    a pandemic, among other things, compel people to use them. I would like learn
    more about the extent of how badly workers are treated and the effects of these
    companies locally, especially because many friends and family use these services.
- desc: In the last meeting, we discussed about the food delivery companies and how
    they are ripping customers off. After reading those articles, I was shocked that
    how much of profits they take from restaurants and customers.
- desc: "From this class i got to know about the software engineering judgment and\
    \ about the food delivery .The major content was revolving around the food apps.\
    \ Such as being in popular app is beneficial for a business but if there will\
    \ be huge amount of commission pf another party than in other words there is no\
    \ long run benefits for the companies. Before this class i was aware that delivery\
    \ apps have their commission with the restaurant but was shocked to know that\
    \ they are hurting restaurants in a big volume.\_\n\nThe another thing is when\
    \ the whole word is going through a global pandemic and the local restraunts are\
    \ already struggling with their business than it is tryely unethical to charge\
    \ 25 to 30% from their gross sale.\n\nThe another important concept was software\
    \ engineering as the reason behind why software related projects are not working\
    \ accurately.\n"
- desc: "In last meeting we talked a bit about judgment applied to Boom\u2019s Taxonomy,\
    \ the video was explaining about different between analysis and judgement. Then\
    \ also discussed about the food delivery apps and the options. We talked about\
    \ what was good or bad about delivery app such as skip the dishes, and is it really\
    \ beneficial for a restaurant."
- desc: we discussed about the how the food delivery app dominates the local resturants
    and take commision from there gross sales we discussed how unethical it is to
    take this much percentage during the current situation when the resturants are
    struggling and we also discussed same in the break out room where we talked about
    the positive side of delivery app that helped whith the resturantsrevenue which
    helped them restaurents to survive.
- desc: "The food delivery apps have undoubtedly greatly reduced the burden on people.\
    \ After a tiring day, takeaway can save people the time to cook. Especially during\
    \ the epidemic, food delivery can also effectively reduce the flow of people in\
    \ restaurants and increase safety. But on the other hand, food delivery apps have\
    \ become a tool for capital to exploit the people at the bottom. The takeaway\
    \ company only provides a public platform, but it can get a lot of profits from\
    \ it, even without paying anything. Food delivery apps companies can also easily\
    \ obtain the user\u2019s home address and personal information, which is obviously\
    \ also an issue that needs to be paid attention to."
- desc: "In last meeting we discussed about the food delivery application such as\
    \ skip doordash earning from the incomes of restaurant by taking commissions from\
    \ them . It is completely unethical during this pandemic where all restaurants\
    \ are struggling to manage their own life\u2019s ."
- desc: Food service applications including skip and doordash are taking commission
    from the restaurant as their earnings . This is not doing justice to the restaurant
    as they are struggling themselves in the covid situation.
- desc: Could you explain the Project proposal assignment and do we have to read "Four
    Core Influences" framework from his upcoming book, Software Engineering Essentials
    to understand published reports on software project outcomes. i ask cause it was
    referenced in the Stranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software Engineering Judgment
    with Steve McConnell we discussed in class.
- desc: In last thursday lecture, we discussed about an article which showed how restaurants
    and cafe's are barely surviving cause of heavy use of these delivery apps.
- desc: 'As we discussed in group about food delivery same way if we can discuss about
    software engineering judgement and value-based software engineering that would
    be great!


    Thank you.'
- desc: 'Response

    In the last meeting the professor show a news about food deliver to us .There
    exists a common objective for businesses which is profit realization. This is
    achieved by careful scrutiny of business environment to ensure smooth running.
    Prices of goods and services are dictated by the cost the service provider incurs
    in production. Relatively, restaurants have incurred an additional expense through
    delivery apps. Accreditation of power to extract the value of general customers
    is a critical challenge, this give the apps authority to control restaurants leading
    to low profits and losses for restaurant owners. I think I would also go for their
    idea of employing delivery drivers than using the apps or the restaurants should
    ask for apps amendments. This would play a considerable role, for instance, the
    apps should earn only when they offer a service, otherwise, they should not earn.
    If firms increase in the production process the price is expected to be high,
    however, in this case there are few firms but delivery apps are ''self-centered''
    if I may call it, limiting profit for the owners. I can consider this greed which
    will lead to closure of restaurants, to prevent this I would request restaurants
    owners and customers to quit these delivery apps and organize their own delivery
    services to ease the load of increased expenses through the apps.'
- desc: 'in meeting 12, we talked about some reasons why some software engineering
    products fail and changes and procedures that can be done/incorporated to avoid
    this.


    Also, we discussed how delivery networks such as uber eats, skip the dishes, etc.
    takes a high commission from the restaurants and this has been a major problem
    as it reduces their profit. But what if restaurants can have their own delivery
    networks, would that help?'
- desc: In last lecture we had a discussion about project proposal which is going
    to due on 4th March. I am excited for a group project. I have curiosity about
    its discussion in next lecture.
- desc: "It is intriguing that apps that provide services are killing their means\
    \ of survival. As shown in the page discussing how delivery apps are damaging\
    \ restaurants, similar things are happening with companies and their workers.\
    \ While Amazon strives to be more efficient for their customers and make more\
    \ money, workers in their factories are put under conditions that nobody should\
    \ have to face. To me, it appears that our society is putting too much emphasis\
    \ on the happiness of the consumer and not paying enough attention to the workers.\_\
    \n\nThere need to be more discussions about the behind-the-scenes ethics of growing\
    \ technologies.\_"
- desc: In our 12th meeting we discussed about food delivery apps and how they charge
    so high and also about who gets the major share from that profit. There were also
    a discussion on two charts one was of 90's and the other one was new which tells
    us how to analyze first and then take right decision.
- desc: 'In this lecture, we discussed the group project which is going to be due
    on the 4th of March which we have to do on anything related to this course.

    We also discussed the video which was given last class and in the starting.

    We also discussed the ethics of the code of conduct. I am very interested in the
    group project.'
- desc: From Steve McConnell's presentation, I learned about four core influencing
    factors. It helps us apply sound software engineering judgment to greatly enhance
    our understanding of the dynamics of software projects so that we can properly
    diagnose faults, take more effective corrective action on projects already in
    progress, and significantly improve every chance of success for that project.
- desc: "In the last meeting, professor gave us a great news incorporating that a\
    \ U of R alumni will be visiting us soon through zoom and he would enlighten about\
    \ the MARS rover mission. We also talked about how facebook is influencing the\
    \ democracy by allowing the political ads. Therefore, I suppose, the company is\
    \ facing several lawsuits for\_pinching the code of ethics. I assume, they would\
    \ still politicize the platform to generating staggering income. Several democracies\
    \ are having a though to initiate some restrictions on facebook such as Australia,\
    \ US, and many others."
- desc: 'Firstly, we have discussed about the difference between judgement and analysis
    and how engineers and programmers face difficulties while doing judgement and
    end up doing wrong analysis. Moreover, after further research i got to know how
    judgement can save time and help to analyze a situation for practical environments
    rather than just theoretical.


    Secondly, how the food delivery apps are literally robbing the money of small
    businesses and restaurants were shown. Now that I think of it I find it quite
    disturbing. The apps are just trying to take advantage of people''s helplessness
    and charging extra. Furthermore, they are not paying enough which raises another
    ethical issue that most of the people working on hi-tech businesses are underpaid
    and mistreated. Even if a software company is worth of billions and doing profit
    of huge margin, employee rights are neglected, e.g amazon.


    This brings to the conclusion that transparency is not good for business and the
    software companies need to have more ethical rules and regulations so that it
    has betterment for everyone not just a group of individuals.

    I would like to learn more about judgement and analyses and how to prioritize
    them according to situation.'
- desc: The advertisements and the free stuff that we see is just to gather people's
    interest making them invest in it. Many software are shown as useful & interesting
    and free to use, but it not the reality. When one enters the app only few days
    are given as free trial and your accounting info os asked before using it so that
    once trial is finished they can charge you. Also we discussed about govt helping
    people who lose their property to natural disaster and skip the dishes app was
    also discussed
- desc: The meeting had a valuable lesson for the computer professional to learn how
    to get the work tested beforehand. Professionals develop the code and never try
    to conduct an analyses to see if it works properly or not. This needs to be understood
    by the professionals so that they will not have trouble after the work is done.
    Complete analyses is required at the end for best results.
- desc: 'Found these links to be helpful for people confused about how to write the
    project proposal due on thursday:


    https://www.discussdesk.com/computer-science-research-proposal-writing-guide.htm

    https://www.csuchico.edu/csci/_assets/documents/thesis-proposal.pdf'
- desc: Food delivery is best example of how can these company's are having a lack
    of ethics like the most of the food delivery company charge more to us for around
    $4 or even $5 dollars sometimes and other who do not charge more increases the
    price of food in menu compared to its actual price like if the food is of $9 then
    instead they would charge $12 for the same thing and state delivery is completely
    free which is not ethically right and on the other hand they do not even pay good
    to their delivery guys. So I would like to know about what can be done to change
    the situation like these.
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed the food delivery apps like uber, door dash,
    skip the dishes, which are so popular among local people that local businesses
    like restaurants and other food courts are getting less profit. Mainly we talked
    about uber eats.
- desc: I think its very scummy for these food delivery services to take so much commission,
    it does ruin the appetite to think they do. I want to see the government do something
    about it and hopefully delivery gets improved in the future as its a fun thing
    todo. There is a lot of nights where my family is busy and we'd need something
    quick so we all can get back to work and having delivery helps out, although most
    of the time we go and pick it up ourselves but when there is no vehicle available,
    its great!
- desc: We discussed the video regarding software Engineering Judgment, which in my
    opinion was very interesting. We also learned about Bloom's Taxonomy and the difference
    between Analysis and Judgment. We also participated in a poll regarding protect
    property values. Furthermore, we also discussed about, food delivery companies
    and restaurants. How they use tactics to profit themselves without thinking about
    their customers.
- desc: In the food delivery app the numbers was a shock until I saw the articles
    and I think it is not best for the restaurants though as much but I think the
    exposure is also one of the factor that helped the restaurant in more sale it
    can be seen as long term investment for sure it will be properly implicated to
    the small vendor not for the established restaurents
- desc: We had a talk about food delivery apps. Since, COVID-19 is going on, people
    prefer less to dine in restaurants. I also use skip the dishes frequently. During
    this meeting, I discovered that food delivery apps charges restaurants a high
    fee, which is a problem.
- desc: We talked about how food delivery applications have been bringing about changes
    in our daily lives. One aspect I was concerned about is how little the delivery
    person gets paid regardless of how far they go to make the deliveries
- desc: 'the most important thing you learned from this past meeting:


    the most important topic learned in this meeting is about fallacies and the wrong
    way how the food delivery apps are leading to deploy of restaurants.

    the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:

    the concept that was hard to learn from last meeting was the sedation code


    what you would like to know more about:

    I would like to learn more about is how the apps and the technological apps are
    deploying the physical world


    something you encountered that is related to the past meeting:

    something that was similar to past meeting was about the software project disasters'
- desc: In last meeting we talked about food delivery apps which is having changes
    in our day to day life. I just think about that how much money is getting to the
    delivery person and how much they rode fir deliveries.
- desc: "We talk in the class about the person who is here from NASA who will give\
    \ a speech. I think we will learn many things from him and we will be motivated.\
    \ I am looking forward to that speech. The other thing is about facebook is that\
    \ same for all. No I don\u2019t thing so, different people get different updates\
    \ which let them be on facebook to waste their time for a while. We need to be\
    \ aware of the consequences of using Facebook for a longer period of time."
- desc: In the last class, we talked about how food delivery apps have been affecting
    the economy. In my opinion skip and uber eats have been changing how the economy
    works. People don't have to depend ongoing on the restaurants anymore and if we
    look at the current situation the covid is a great opportunity to get all the
    restaurants back in business, and Uber and Skips have been giving so much employment
    to all the people who want to earn an extra buck. A lot of people I know have
    paid for their car.
- desc: Food Delivery sites such as Skip The Dishes, Door Dash, and much more are
    more favourable as compared to dine in the restaurants nowadays. The main reason
    behind this is the people found it more convenient to have any food on their door
    instead of going outside. Especially, in cold winter so many people use these
    apps or websites. There are also many benefits as well as the drawbacks of this.
    Benefits are that the individuals can have their favourite food in their home
    on the door step without waiting in the lines on the restaurants and going out
    of their home, By their mean they can do any important work. Now, Looking at the
    bad effects, these apps is killing the food restaurants. These apps do not provide
    that much benefit or profit to the restaurants as compared to if people visit
    them.
- desc: In the last class, we talked about the project proposal and how skip and uber
    eats have impacted the economy. Technology has created a great way to create employment
    and the world would have been a different place without it. We as creators of
    these platforms to create more employments in times like covid
- desc: In the last meeting, we discussed about delivery apps and about the software
    engineering judgment. Also about our coming project. it was really helpful meeting
    and also i have no idea before that
