Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. Okay, so. You can see my email. So. Yes, the grades are released.
    But some of you may not have a grade listed there. Because there's two fields
    are updated. there's. grade column, and then there's the feedback comments. Everybody
    should have feedback comments. which includes your grade at the bottom of the
    description. Which is. output from the. calculator on the assignment page. It
    seems like some some of the grades didn't get copied over to the great column.
    That makes sense. So trying i'm trying to get this resolved. So that everything
    is. sorted out. taken a long time. I didn't want to wait any longer.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey Professor. I have a question about the great.
  persid: S01
- desc: Sure go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um so I had submitted my head uploaded my blog before the deadline, but I
    did not hit the submit button, I thought it would submit on on. What I noticed
    that it did not submit a week later. I also submitted in my class blog section
    before the deadline so i'm wondering, like, I still was directed at marks for
    late submission.
  persid: S01
- desc: So I So the issue was that I said that. Draft submission drafts were OK.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK so.
  persid: S01
- desc: If you have. Something that indicates. The date of your draft submission.
    See the problem with your course is it doesn't save. This is a draft submitted
    on such and such a date and then submitted on such and such a date. If you have
    a draft and you submitted.
  persid: DHH
- desc: my blog is also in the clots block forum as well and it's. before the deadline.
    And I did not make yes. I have emailed you about this, but I did not hear back.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah because I talked about it already.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So point out. Please. send a note to the marker. send them a note just explaining
    that the dates were. mixed up. And here's. The post that was in the class blog
    here's some. On time submission okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks.
  persid: S01
- desc: you're welcome. Okay, so let me just catch up on the comments here in the
    chat before we go on. yeah so I have an office hour. Today at 330. going to talk
    about things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: To blog entries are each out of 12. And then the empathy map is of 11 so makes
    a total of 35. yeah so I can. I can talk to you, generally, about two comments.
    Then you can also contact the marker. Yes, responses to meetings engage with those
    meetings. You 20 that's. that's. The Max you'll get you get full marks for that.
    Neither great door feedback. That you made a submission. Take a look at that.
    You can talk to me in office hours or send me a note. Okay. Alright, so I think
    that's that's basically it. So my apologies for. Getting these comments to you.
    Okay, so it's not under comments it's under feedback So if you go through the
    spreadsheet. it's one that's further over. The heading is a C. feedback. Feedback
    comments. Very. Looking at the screen, the very rate. that the last column in
    this spreadsheet is final grade, which will show you a market of 12. And then
    before that is annotate PDF which is not applicable. And then feedback comments.
    So if you go. To the to the very end to the right most edge of the spreadsheet.
    Last. you'll be able to see final grade and feedback comments. And if you have
    issues. for not being able to see. The feedback comments. Please let me know via
    email and Gore come and see me in my office hour today. Okay. Now. Okay, so I
    did say anyway. I don't want to get into too much, I did say. You get 10. Penalties
    until Wednesday. If you have. A question of dates. Okay, so I see lots of comments
    in the chat now that are rehashing the email that I sent. And then other comments
    have been made about. again. In the feedback comments worldwide marks were detected.
    Now. i'm going to stop looking at the chat now. Because probably people. Okay,
    no I don't want to say that. In case in case people continue on this thread i'm
    not gonna look at the chat anymore. Okay, so Sharif comment here about. lab instructor
    so there's no lab instructor here. And I did give a rubric and the comments. are
    in fact. indicating which criterion on the rubric was. This is doing the same
    thing. Anyway, Okay, how can I go back to my original. comment about not making
    comments about the chat anymore okay. bit of business, I wanted to talk about
    was. That we're having. A presentation from kips. Anyone. Anyone like to offer
    with the microphone what kept stands for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I guess even.
  persid: ???
- desc: Any information processing so say, do I get.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah that's right Thank you. So they have an ISP. designation for information
    systems professional. And so the comments box all is an alumnus from the department
    is going to come and talk to us. A week from today. So the meeting is going to
    be open, so if none of that other people know about. Their computer science students
    know about it. and invite them to come you're welcome to do that and i'll post.
    a note on. That internationally advertised. Online so. And then, remember, on
    Thursday, the day before, is. robotic Mars exploration talk. At 7pm on Wednesday
    evening. prepare for the presentation event on Tuesday next week. So have some.
    grounding what he's going to talk about. Anyway, Okay, so let me see whether this
    link works. Fellow who started this year club. In the States. So he's a famous
    environmentalist. And he says when you're trying to pick out anything by itself,
    you find a hitch to everything else in the universe. What does that have to do
    with computer science. So to me this fits in with our discussion of last day where
    we ended up. So where did we end up lusty talked about. accounting for social
    cost. accounting for externalities. And maybe a carbon tax is a one way to do
    that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, and I almost think that that's the thrust of this class right as we're
    computer science students and we all spend our time staring at a monitor. Making
    our code work and never worrying about how it's connected to anything we just
    want it to work and then you're trying to point out to us that there's huge implications
    to these things that get released into the world.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay. Thank you. So. that's a nice summary of the class. This is not the same
    one. Link right hand right. Hand hand this is sufficient for. So in computer science
    abstraction. Is a simplified version of something technical, such as a function
    or an object in the Program. goal of abstracting data is to reduce complexity,
    removing unnecessary information. Value extraction and computer science. Good
    How does that relate to. The act of abstracting and. Decoupling things. Because
    when they try and click on anything by itself, you find it attached everything
    else in the universe. So that when we. When we. abstract things and make these
    cuts. of connections between other things, simplify into either information. Then.
    And then we think that the extraction is sufficient. to work with. Anyone have
    a fallacy that we discussed. misplace concreteness. So when we have. A model.
    You forget to the model we forget this is simplified model. And then we. work
    with it as if it's the real thing and then we. don't pay attention to the discrepancies.
    Not behavior is a model compared to to. hang in the real world. me. So let me
    start a breakout room so it's Finally, the question for breakout rooms. How do
    we do. Do we deal with everything being connected and still write code that relies
    on abstraction. Does that sound for question to discuss. Okay. So i'm gonna start
    breakout rooms, a little good 10 minutes. And then we'll come back and have a
    discussion again okay. 20 breakout rooms and opening now. Sorry, I realized, because
    I was in a breakout room that i've been muted. So is that discussion for everyone.
    Give me a thumbs up okay Alex go ahead and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have the question I think the question is a bit flawed because. we're asking
    how do we like, how do we connect stuff in a world with connections and still
    code for abstraction were in my mind. At the other day, a code has to do something
    like it's used to solve a problem it's it's like kind of saying well what's what's
    the, how do we keep like what's the meaning of math NASA 10 days, two plus two,
    you can see, we. can do.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay, so I accept that my question is fraud. I typed it in, as I was formulating
    it. And we didn't have a lot of review about it, so I accepted that was not a.
    There are questions that could have been. Better.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Still good because it didn't take me it took me until I got into the breakout
    room and actually discuss it with someone when I realized oh I don't understand
    this question that well.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah so. I do. If we have all these pieces. parts and pieces. That go into
    making up our understanding of the world and they're all connected. But then,
    if we. We want to create a model of something. You want to work with him and code.
    and simplify things. And what, what are we leaving out. For those intended. You
    have to pick and choose. things that go into our model. And what are we leaving
    out and how do we deal with. Those broken connections. Okay first David then Keegan.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh sorry i'm just making sure I understand so basically the kind of concept
    you're trying to get at is that if we want to work with something and say, create
    a program out of it, we often lose the finer details when we converted from real
    worlds to sort of a computer concept.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah so we use obstruction to hide details, so we have. You ever heard of
    information, hiding and then depending on where you are in your programs. In your
    studies. We don't want to have. More information available. at the interface,
    then. Going into solve the task. So we also have ideas of coupling and cohesion.
    So you want, like our functions to have. To be a cohesive. We would like to decouple
    them from one another, so they each have their own. Jobs to do so to speak. And
    when we're talking about decoupling. pieces, this is. This is idea that we're.
    Getting one or pulling on. One concept and then. Seeing that they're connected
    to everything else. So. So when we. write a program we have a model of. The world
    a simplified model, who are working with. So, even in the little calculator have
    for grades. You know I make some. make some abstractions due. To love. To be expressed
    the straightforward way. Man, am I answering your question, David.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I think I got a better idea now thanks.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay Keegan did you still want to. comment to make.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sure, I basically just said that I don't think this is the responsibility
    of the developer developers have so much to focus on already. Like, for example,
    if you're working at a big company like Samsung Google, you could be like specifically
    just working on one function. And they can use it wherever they want it's more
    the job of like the higher the higher ups and the project managers and people
    like that too i'm getting a better understanding they need to educate themselves
    more in technology. And so that, basically, they have a better understanding is
    their job to form how this is going to work in relation to the real world like.
    developers have to focus on too many other things he's basically what i'm saying,
    and that is not their job to focus on how their code is going to impact. The world
    it's the job of unless like it's your entirety of your project and, like your
    soul it's a startup or something like that, but basically. I think there's too
    many things to focus on as a developer it's not really the job of the developer
    to worry about how their code affects the world it's the job of the company they're
    working for. To us, in a manner that is proper.
  persid: S07
- desc: Somebody else's responsibility.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah yeah cuz if. yeah because if you're. Like if you're writing a code and
    basically they asked you to do something, you might not even know exactly where
    this code is going to be implemented in for like. as well, you also might not
    have the whole picture.
  persid: S07
- desc: Right. So I appreciate that. Okay, Maria.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um I think the developers still do have a kind of accountability when it comes
    to these things, for example. The code that we write should be as we've spoken
    and discussed about in our group about portability and how i'm having a piece
    of code portable and reduces costs and and just I guess. saves money as well,
    in the long run, so I don't know I think this question is really tying into that
    discussion we've had before of sustainability, so I think there is still accountability
    in the part of the developers here.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay, so sustainability of code is. Using best practices and making it. As
    useful useful and usable as possible in as many circumstances as possible. Is
    that a way to paraphrase your comments, Maria.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay Keegan you had your hand up again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah if you have more portable code, though, how do you monitor where it's
    being used and what it's being used for. Like because if you're making portable
    code, it should be reusable for any project, it should fulfill a single function
    if this function is used in something that is considered morally incorrect, are
    you responsible for that. Just because you develop the the function like I that's
    why I don't think you have accounted as much accountability. personally.
  persid: S07
- desc: Great great, so there are these. algorithms that. can be used for good or
    for bad. Now brings me to. i'd like we can talk about this next day. in more detail
    but. The free software foundation and. four fundamental freedoms of programmers.
    033, of course. Is articulated by Richard stallman. i'll get a link for that and
    and we'll talk about it next day. For more about. More about today's. topic I
    was thinking about. Maybe this is more familiar more practical example. KPI. Key
    Performance indicators. So I. I think very popular and retail For one thing, but
    not only, that is a way to. To. make things more measurable. The question is,
    if these are really key performance indicators. Are the controlling the behavior.
    Are they. Are they easy to compute. Or are they. more meaningful, are they actually
    driving. Performance they'd like to see in an organization. So let's listen to
    like code black art on CBC you're talking about health care. And they're talking
    about you know in saskatchewan, for example, and we had a lean a push towards
    lean management practices. And the comment was. You know, should we be measuring.
    So this isn't about to sketch one in particular, but it was about. hospitals.
    And then they the pointless question is asked. Should we be measuring efficiency
    or valuing efficiency or. empathy. i'm paraphrasing a bit there but. You know
    So how do we quantify an empathetic and empathic responses. to people who respect
    their humanity. That may not be as efficient as we'd like to. Wear as easy as
    easy to quantify as we'd like to. like to think. we're more comfortable working
    with numbers. You know. giving you a greater than 12. Instead of. Something more.
    difficult to quantify. Some comments. About. The question about. Everything being
    connected and abstracts writing code with instructions. is being complimentary.
    Naming any names say when I wanna. Take the MIC for that one and. again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, I think it's pretty impossible if you start looking at what things could
    be used for will you're going to stop any kind of technological growth at any
    rate, like dead in its tracks anything you make can be used for one thing or another.
    My car isn't evil, but I could go run somebody over with it my computer isn't
    evil, but I could start hacking somebody else's information and stealing it. Like
    there's any anything you make you can use for good or evil like it's so if you're
    going to start considering all these negative impacts, while Okay, now we can't
    really do anything.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay well it's certainly a challenge isn't it I. mean I think there's two
    things are. related. We have to. be mindful of all the technology that we create.
    and The same time. Not. stuck on. did not create something. Because of thinking,
    the worst possible outcomes. So if we don't create technology. It doesn't mean
    that somebody else won't create it. And so we have the choice, then, to think
    about how we're. making it available and how we're regulating it. If it's being
    dissolved responsibly or not, and so forth. So there. is an ongoing discussion
    about. killer robots and now embedding them. Finding that technology so that's
    kind of the. Management of the technology part. So the. And i'll find the link
    to. A video that talks about. These machine machine guns in the military zone
    between North and South Korea. that are capable of targeting. Humans on their
    own. they're not used that way. But they have that capability. So certainly that's.
    difficult. And I should say that these that these robots are built by Samsung
    so it's kind of a library, for example, there that's one of the manufacturers.
    So. interesting to see. The breadth of endeavors for that company. So it's a question
    of. If there's really technology that shouldn't be developed, this is a threat
    to. humankind. Then we have to agree about managing it. And that would be a good
    conversation to have. But then we also have. You know. are responsible development
    of it. And if we abide by code of ethics. And we can. Have that guidance. We can.
    Have a conversation about. What what what is good and what's not so good, and
    so forth. So I think to not to have that conversation, is a good. it's a positive.
    We don't need to be paralyzed by it, I guess. Any any questions or concerns. Coming
    out of that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That makes technologies, you making it sound similar to the nuclear bomb like
    we should be having our own Oppenheimer moments and deciding whether we should
    be doing what we're doing.
  persid: S04
- desc: No. That was my reaction to seeing the social dilemma documentary. little
    bit I mean not I don't want to make it sound too heavy. You know, because, like
    we say. it's not it's not like it's all dystopia. there's. there's some utopian
    extend that combination. Anyway, Alex you had your hand up so maybe we'll end
    with you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Smoke because notice a lot about these type of things, or people compare things
    from the past, there are horrible horrible events to vince now. And don't get
    me wrong there's still horrible events happening now, like there's difference
    between a nuclear bomb going off in your hometown and Google stealing your personal
    data. Like a clean day on new blows up and you don't get to write you don't get
    to do anything your dad you're just a fond memory well kudos to the person who
    data just means. Good so your personal data, you know boycott them or do something
    about it.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah Okay, I appreciate that comment. Our scale of outrageous. is different,
    these days.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S05
- desc: So we're out of time for today. So i'm just gonna. For and I guess just going
    to wrap things up and say thank you for today and have a great Thursday have a
    good weekend and i've got. office hours at three an office hours at 330. If you
    have questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks.

Zoom-Chat-Transcript:
- desc: Morning!
  persid: S10
- desc: good morning
  persid: S11
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S12
- desc: good morning!
  persid: S13
- desc: Regarding grades? IF so, yes
  persid: S14
- desc: Yes I saw it
  persid: S15
- desc: ^ Yeah!
  persid: S10
- desc: The grades were released
  persid: S15
- desc: gradesssss
  persid: S16
- desc: I cant see the grades
  persid: S17
- desc: I didn't see mine
  persid: S13
- desc: I can confirm, grade is visible in the feedback comments
  persid: S18
- desc: Me too
  persid: S15
- desc: what was the average?
  persid: S19
- desc: yeah
  persid: S20
- desc: Yeah that's what I see. Grade is in feedback, not grade column
  persid: S06
- desc: Glad for the feedback though!
  persid: S06
- desc: Thanku for the detail feedback
  persid: S21
- desc: can anyone tell me that how many engagement with meetings forum we have to
    attend out of 26 ??
  persid: S22
- desc: 20, I believe Bhumi
  persid: S18
- desc: ok ty :)
  persid: S22
- desc: is attendance done?
  persid: S23
- desc: not yet nupurben
  persid: S18
- desc: So for mine, it says " Instructions not followed" and hence deducted 10%.
    Can you elaborate a bit into that?
  persid: S24
- desc: yea I also got the instructions not followed on one part feels bad
  persid: S25
- desc: Maybe if you have questions you should go to his office hours instead of using
    class time y'all
  persid: S18
- desc: These may be office hour discussions, just a thought
  persid: S06
- desc: what what the blog 1 grade out of?
  persid: S26
- desc: exactly I was going to say same
  persid: S19
- desc: Sounds good
  persid: S01
- desc: '12'
  persid: S27
- desc: '12'
  persid: S25
- desc: thanks
  persid: S26
- desc: i didn't see my grade or comment
  persid: S13
- desc: if they have issues, they should go to office hours!
  persid: S19
- desc: I don't see the feedback comments section on the submission page as well
  persid: S17
- desc: If I go directly to the grades page it shows up on the gradesheet for me.
    Otherwise I can go to the submission page and scroll to the bottom where there
    is a collapsible section labelled feedback. If you click the + you can read the
    feedback. Hope that helps folks!
  persid: S18
- desc: For me the feedback is showing fine. but the actual grade (while mentioned
    in the feedback) isn't copied in the grades column on urcourses.
  persid: S10
- desc: And there is no column called feedback comments on my side! I guess we can
    take it to office hours later
  persid: S17
- desc: were we penalize for late submission if we hand in on Wednesday 24
  persid: S28
- desc: The deadline was Monday the 22nd so I would imagine so
  persid: S14
- desc: '"late (but within 48 hours of the due date and time): deduct 10% of the earned
    grade"'
  persid: S14
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: oh I thought he said he won't penalize us on Wednesday
  persid: S28
- desc: my feedback states what I have done but mentions nothing about why grades
    were deducted
  persid: S03
- desc: '"git gud" - the marker'
  persid: S26
- desc: i got 2.40 marks deducted but no idea why
  persid: S03
- desc: Sounds like actionable feedback to me shareef
  persid: S06
- desc: Class time doesn't seem like a good time to discuss deductions. If there isn't
    feedback I would attend office hours to get clarifications.
  persid: S18
- desc: '"git push -dobetter"'
  persid: S10
- desc: I am happy with my mark but yeah, our lab instructor gave a marking rubric
    and circled the one we got marked
  persid: S26
- desc: Office hours are a great time to discuss marking, agreed. I'm good to move
    on with class :)
  persid: S06
- desc: ^ yes please
  persid: S10
- desc: sorry, for my other class I mean
  persid: S26
- desc: sure let's move on
  persid: S26
- desc: connectivity?
  persid: S26
- desc: Computer science is connected to everything
  persid: S06
- desc: you debug one thing and then another bug pops up? hahahaha
  persid: S18
- desc: everything is connected?
  persid: S12
- desc: Ah, so you're saying if we remove irrelevancies we might actually miss important
    subjects?
  persid: S18
- desc: Sometimes you miss the big picture
  persid: S06
- desc: Misplaced concreteness
  persid: S27
- desc: 'breakout rooms: how do we deal with everything being connected and still
    write code that relies on abstraction?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: That works for me
  persid: S04
- desc: Clear
  persid: S06
- desc: sounds good
  persid: S29
- desc: I mistakenly left the room can u assign me again
  persid: S30
- desc: Good discussion! It's a tough question to answer
  persid: S18
- desc: kind of unclear
  persid: S26
- desc: Question too hard
  persid: S31
- desc: Question is a little hard
  persid: S08
- desc: was it relating to abstraction meaning not relating to reality or abstraction
    meaning, can code be used in other levels of abstraction...
  persid: S26
- desc: an addition calculator used for a calculator and then a tax filer program,
    as an example
  persid: S26
- desc: off topic, what the attendance code?
  persid: S32
- desc: ogsuhf
  persid: S33
- desc: if everyone worries about if they should, no one would do it
  persid: S26
- desc: Could you explain more about what you mean by everything being connected ?
    If it has to do with access to the files the codes are written in I believe that
    is something the companies security team should be dealing with
  persid: S33
- desc: 'What if my code is used to produce firearms or opiods more efficiently?  :
    )'
  persid: S04
- desc: IBM made a counting machine for Nazis during WWII
  persid: S26
- desc: should we cancel IBM now? XD
  persid: S26
- desc: '@warren were you intending to use your code for that?'
  persid: S07
- desc: Sounds like a conversation about intent vs. impact
  persid: S18
- desc: "Yeah that\u2019s kind of where I am going."
  persid: S07
