Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. how's everyone doing today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: sleepy.
  persid: ???
- desc: sleepy is. An appropriate reaction when it's cold outside. And it's kind of
    a Gray days well. Not even sunny day in the schedule and Canada sunniest capital
    city. Even know that about Regina. Any questions or concerns of where we're going
    so far. Okay here's a question about response. responses and I was going to talk
    about that as well, so let me. share my screen right away, but. Let me look into
    that first to answer that question about. necklace I don't see your engagement
    for meeting five. Can you say. So. The email that didn't get centered and form
    messages didn't get posted if you still have a text, maybe just included with
    your response today. would be my suggestion I wouldn't worry about. Having the.
    Sound so much the idea of having the response for last meeting but. i'm more interested
    in the ideas. me share my screen with you, first of all. You can see. What i'm
    doing here. today. So if you find that i'm. At the end of meeting. or whatever
    the meeting number is and there's no question. posted here. Let me know. Okay,
    so now let me switch to in case people haven't. I knew, to the idea of doing these
    responses. And I had a student I was communicating lesson. You seven problems,
    adding to the response, so let me just go switch to a student here. These are
    a question and answer. means you have to post something before you see something.
    For you see anything else, what other people. So the idea is to go click on a
    response. The discussion here. When you get to this. group reply to this. Once
    you reply, once you add your own message here. Then you can see other people's
    responses. For those of you have done this before if I missed anything. clear
    to everyone. If you miss the password for attendance. I had some problems. I know,
    last day was a bit of a hack problem because of. snow day can go by without any
    problems, right. Having said that, here. i'm going to do the password now. she's
    given me. Permission error, when I try and do something like that, instead of
    a blank page. Okay. OK.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK.
  persid: S02
- desc: today's stuff. I wanted to. seem that we're getting. giving me Google responses,
    so I thought I haven't tried duck duck go. and Now here let's do that, so this
    is the Google or sponsor. For me. seems like these are the top three sally's baking
    addiction our recipes and Betty crocker. So here's duck duck go. To PS and teen
    dot dot dot. Five boys Baker. maybe.com. And chocolate chip cookie. Center cut.
    co.dot.so those are completely different. And then, following those first three
    results we get an ad. And then we get another all recipes. very best faking. At
    cracker. Oh wow chocolate chip cookies are in the news. i'm. kendra cookie pie
    that's got to be on par with eating it drove me to tell, I think. The tie sounds
    better. Anyway, so the top results to be different for duck duck go. and check
    out being. US being.
  persid: DHH
- desc: accidentally sometimes yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: Anyway, okay So here we have the being results. So reading from. This kind
    of looks like a pinterest thing. Now I don't know whether you should read down
    the columns or across. The chatelaine has the. best. rated recipe, I think. In
    terms of positioning and search results. i'm not sure if these are the same. kind
    of cut offs here. same. or not. So, for that reason i'm going to say that the
    next one, is this entry COM. stars and 1000 reviews wow that's pretty good. And
    chocolate chip cookies dinner then dessert. And in 22 reviews five stars. Chocolate
    chip cookies emails. la times. Chocolate chip cookies for stars 1900 views. So
    I think we're not talking about chocolate cookies anymore in the chat. yeah the
    link to the story about Robin Hood. We can talk about shortly. Chocolate chip
    cookie. chatting. anyway. Okay, so there's that now that me. My page some things
    I haven't updated on. gave you a couple videos related to design. Any thoughts
    about. Everyone. For find find the links okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah. The previous day. Is cargo shifting to design. In sort of a human computer
    interaction perspective. This point was because of the. filter bubbles one, but
    the. Second, one of what what allegation to social media platforms have to the
    greater good. And how do we think about designing spaces and. As we are. Present
    and future computer professionals. What what obligation, do we have to think about
    design. As a public good. yeah so this. is a nice little video of. Norman doors
    limited to their calls Norman doors after don Norman. You talked about them and
    so those are the. doors that have. ambiguous controls so. If it's a flat panel,
    you know what's your I need to push the door open. But official handle that looks
    like it should be pulled but really need to push. that's that's confusing and
    that's. that's a problem and that's where the term Norman doors comes from. I
    remember a cartoon from the far side. really has imagery of school for the gifted
    and the kid is pushing on the door. Where it seems to be, I think it seems like
    a. season, a flat powder push, no, no, it is. Anyway, so. he's pushing on the
    door and this mark Paul. This is one example. That i'll put this video up here.
    Oh yeah okay so that's a good comment about securities feature. Because in this
    video as other video but Norman doors there's a scene from a movie about. US being
    stuck in that room because of the. feature. window.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah good good.
  persid: S03
- desc: audio.
  persid: S02
- desc: caption. yeah crystal yeah anyway, let me see again, if I can.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Make.
  persid: S04
- desc: Let me see if that's going to help with the audio.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor just a quick question. yeah. So, last week the videos we talked
    about they were all about social bubbles stuff like that, for example. And this
    week we're talking about design i'm just wondering, do you think a good tie in,
    for that would be the power of influence, for example, you're more likely to use
    something if it's easy to use or a nice to look at.
  persid: S05
- desc: Well, I was thinking about it from the perspective of happiness.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, fair enough.
  persid: S05
- desc: So. So I think you know, the idea of having influencers and so on. I mean
    we'd like to follow recommendations. without necessarily going and trying things
    ourselves. You know if you see somebody else doing it then we'll just do that
    instead. But, so the first video from last week for the filter roles one was the
    idea. And we didn't well. Because of the discussion there is about the algorithms
    that are being used and. To provide us what we wanted, so the question is maybe
    not just. How do we do this, provide tailored information to people but. Should
    we be doing this, and why should we do it. And then that goes back. To the. To
    the moral operating system.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You know.
  persid: ???
- desc: simple questions like. iPhone or android. And then. Should we take this guy's
    data and then what's the moral framework we should use when deciding to take this
    guy's data. So those are questions that got fewer and fewer responses. So I don't
    necessarily think there's all. there's enough. Enough why questions asked. Compared
    to, I think. Mostly in technology they're talking about. As asking and answering
    how questions. So then. The second video from last day about social. What kind
    of. connection with. Which What should the platforms, but to the platforms or
    us in terms of their contributions to the greater good. And I pride in the design.
    To me, and so that's why I went. shifted the. pride in the aspect of design so
    it's not just a matter of. To. me it's not just a matter of. Meeting the specifications
    but. meeting people in a train it to the public good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's okay so basically. What you're getting at is that with our design with
    the design of these different platforms and technology, this could be a way to
    contribute to the greater good.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, I understand, thanks.
  persid: S05
- desc: No.
  persid: DHH
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: ???
- desc: So just following up on the chat discussions here a little bit. about the
    cars with their touch screens. I agree that. they're a little bit distracting
    maybe a lot distracting. And the fact that well. Sometimes I have a cook I hook
    up my iPhone and. It sometimes says to me that the keyboard is unavailable, which
    is good when i'm driving. But still I can touch. do a lot of touching and. That
    sounds funny anyway, I can still i'm still free to touch the screen for other
    functions like navigation and and music. and I think that people that companies
    think Oh, I have this ability to touch screen, and so we can create this one piece
    of for the. Center of the dash that's. That can take on all these functions. and
    We can just replace it all as one unit if it fails, and so on and so forth. But
    I mean the question isn't. What kind of design. it's the technology in search
    of a problem. You know, we don't want to create other ones. So we do. It is to
    not. it's not just think technology. Is a solution now that's the problem. But
    rather. To me it's computing as about. How do we augment. people's ability to
    perform the tasks they want to perform without fundamentally altering the tasks.
    And I saw the Mercedes. I don't know what car, it was but they're planning a moto
    with it with a whole dashboard is. The touch this I don't know if it's all touch
    capable or part of it is just display. That seems. It seems nice if you didn't
    have to drive as well. stirring the cauldron I talked to like Sam Jackson. expletive
    deleted expletive deleted. anyway. today. So i'm gonna try a breakout room. And
    the question around would like you to discuss this. What is their responsibility
    to design in designing technology for the greater good. That makes sense is that.
    Open ended enough but specific enough to. Have you go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: make sense to me.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay. anyone else, like to. So your responsibility as. Computer professionals.
    As future computer professionals. And we'll discuss the idea of what makes it
    professional. At other points during this. This semester okay. Okay, so having
    said that, let me make 2020 groups and we'll take it from there. Okay, so video
    for about. 10 minutes. Now checking on you and then we'll. Come back to discuss.
    So there's a. You can continue this discussion on. asynchronously with the our
    courses forum for breakout discussions. as well. Very good. Okay, here we go opening
    rooms. And a good discussion.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have you heard about the Microsoft for some companies are pattern that is
    some sort of software that will that can use deceased person as a chatbot have
    you heard about it.
  persid: S02
- desc: you mean to observe provide. Provide companionship from the deceased person.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't know the full detail, but the topic is that they'll turn a deceased
    person has a chat Bot i'm not sure how they're gonna do it, but they'll be patented.
    And that's.
  persid: S02
- desc: patented it yeah. No, I haven't heard some of those details about the patent
    and so forth. If you have a link please you can. invite you to share that. So
    did you get put into a room. And, and you left the room.
  persid: DHH
- desc: room want to be silent, we talked for a while and we run out of ideas, basically.
  persid: S02
- desc: um.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, well then, I better.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep link to the channels.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Other stats something recently played a video game seven bronco December seven
    I hope people heard about it, so in that game, there was almost the same idea
    like one of the main characters friend died, and one of the company recreated
    almost recreated that deceased person. He talks, like the real one, but doesn't
    have all the functionality like lines are limited, what he can talk about isn't
    limited but the basic idea is saying and the game is set on a dystopian future.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. Okay, so how is that going to go room.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It was.
  persid: S06
- desc: It was good wow okay. So two owners about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: rate.
  persid: S06
- desc: or no time.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I would say a little too long.
  persid: S07
- desc: We actually got cut off so.
  persid: S08
- desc: yeah we kind of ran out of stuff to talk about so yeah.
  persid: S05
- desc: OK so i'll make them. i'll be more. Strict with the time then. Okay, so. Anything
    you want to share with the whole class. In the vein of. responsibilities as professionals
    to the world to the greater good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think we all had the same thinking that filter bubbles should not be there.
    This was the common point between all of us.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay, so. So, on what basis do decide to to not provide filter bubbles. Is
    that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The rationale.
  persid: ???
- desc: Go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm. On the basis of searches.
  persid: S06
- desc: Sorry.
  persid: ???
- desc: No, no, I don't mean. Technically, how to do it or to not do it, but. But
    why would you not do it. what's the basis for decision to not do it. Is it a.
    Is it a practical issue is it a moral issue.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it's a model, as well as practical it just limits us.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay anyone else, want to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um i'd have to do with. Getting rid of filter bubbles I think it's more of
    if the consumer doesn't want filter bubbles then you'd have to move over to a
    platform that doesn't have them rather than limiting them it's not on the choice
    of. The company i'd say it's more on the choice of the consumer, like if you're
    against filter bubbles, and you only ever use Facebook, well, I think that's.
    More or less your point and, if you think you can make something better will amaze
    will why don't you make a better platform and not include these things.
  persid: S07
- desc: What about the like apple and, like the APP stores limiting them, so you can't
    even buy or can't even use software's without filter bubbles. Because like that's
    what they did with. parlor.
  persid: S09
- desc: don't buy an apple them.
  persid: S07
- desc: Well, just.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah that's fair, that is a fair point but like.
  persid: S09
- desc: Even know that those things exist.
  persid: S08
- desc: yeah I think if you take an ECON class it's it's on the onus of the consumer
    right like.
  persid: S07
- desc: A consumer you haven't deployed.
  persid: S10
- desc: yeah. We kind of discussed that be more optional rather than like whether
    you wanted or not, which.
  persid: S11
- desc: I feel like. I feel like i'm platforms should make it's an option issue once
    it's not I mean.
  persid: S12
- desc: Have you guys. used to trust or other sites that mostly shows pictures so
    when you have an account they give you an option, what kind of pictures do like
    is. zadroga watercolor stuff you if you want, you can create your own filter bubble,
    if you don't want that you can skip it out.
  persid: S02
- desc: When you pick what you are interested in yes.
  persid: S12
- desc: I don't hold as long to talk about Hollywood and stuff sometimes I want to
    say about other stuff now if I don't have any food travels i'll get news from
    around the world, probably not the one i'm currently looking for I need to have
    that option, at the same time.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah so that's what we discussed that to make an option. And also like keeping
    in like all the. security concerns and everything in my.
  persid: S11
- desc: With the filter bubble we're not choosing what. What are the gaps, but if
    we don't have any filter bubbles it'll be a whole math. i'm complete math there
    is no order at all.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, so filter bubbles I don't care about sports. These are a lot of sites
    that like basically scan me or something like that they'll never give me sports
    because they never click on anything about sports they only give me everything
    instead of what I do enjoy, but I can always look up sports if I truly wanted.
  persid: S13
- desc: No.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah so let me just make a comment here. So I appreciate the. The discussion.
    That in terms in terms of. So about the discussion. it's not clear it so if we
    want to say. pick a platform that has filter bubbles are not filter bubbles are
    these different things. Then we need to. there's an expectation there's some transparency,
    but what features exist on the platform. which I don't think we didn't you don't
    think is. required or. discussed very much at this point. And secondly about our
    going to run discussions. I think. Since I enjoyed all the conversation, but I
    think we need to use our. raised their hands from the participants window. or
    not sure whether it's a blue hand or an emoji for you on your list. Okay, so it
    looks like it's an emoji for me on this list. So if you'd like to speak, please
    let me see your hands up and. yeah sure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah so previously, I was thinking that there are mixed opinions about filter
    bubble so just you know, to get everyone's you should we have all or something
    like that about whether our platform should have filter bubbles or no. That you
    can start a poll right now.
  persid: S14
- desc: yeah I could do a poll I don't like those polls, but. i'll do something in
    your courses. Okay, so i'll put up a your courses. instrument this afternoon.
    Okay. So that'd be something to. Attendance was right at the beginning. let's
    see. So it's after call 45 now. Okay, so I don't want to make a big deal about
    attendance. alright. So, only one way to indicate participation. And maybe it's.
    Not a great way. But I will keep an open mind about that. Go ahead yeah sure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh sorry it was from before I didn't do it again.
  persid: S14
- desc: Okay. Okay, so. So the engagement with meetings is just a general asking you
    to write a response to today's meeting. And the breakout room, you can talk, you
    can enter something about the discussion from the breakout rooms, if you like.
    Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm sorry, are you referring to the engagement section.
  persid: S15
- desc: So i'm just looking at the comments here in the chat. The prompt for the discussion
    is the same every day yeah so that's the engagement with meetings, if you want
    to talk continue discussion about the breakout room. And there's a forum for that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. Thanks for thanks for clarifying oh you're welcome.
  persid: S15
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Have a good weekend and we'll. See you. On Tuesday. Take care everyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you bye.
