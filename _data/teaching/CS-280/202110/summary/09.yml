Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. Okay, well, here we are, on Tuesday know. Covering it, so this
    is the last week before. greinke. And it's bitterly cold in February. Anybody.
    think this isn't too cold to go outside. Eastern think that cold weather wasn't
    so bad was kind of bracing but now, now that i'm. Older and have more perspective
    I think it's just. nicer to stay inside. Let me start by sharing the screen. Put
    the link up for today. The audio and the transcripts are from the meeting on Thursday
    or up in this on this page below here. Anyone had a chance to look at it. Anyone
    find it helpful. keep doing that. So what I would like to i'm trying to do here
    is. settled on a form that might be useful for all of us here. So i'm going to
    summarize the responses to last meeting. Here, and then the plan for the meeting.
    And then, once the meetings done via MEDIA I could whiteboard or other pictures
    that come up in the meeting. Here, and then a summary which will be based on the
    transcript. So i'm trying to take into account everyone's. constructive comments.
    There are a lot more, I did. I went through the responses yesterday afternoon.
    And I noticed, there are a lot more. last evening, so I haven't updated this to
    the. For the ones. That came in last night so. I thought this was the most. Pressing.
    Question to address just what do we have to do in this class and what topics,
    do we have to write about, for the first blog. So my answer the first part is
    engaged in a critical examination of computing identifying challenge assumptions.
    too short. Understand it's also about understanding. What it means to be a computing
    professional and have. and code of conduct or ethical code or a moral operating
    system. I think I mentioned this page earlier but i'll just link to show it to
    you know. there's a few quotes here that are. This first one someone asked me
    about what I thought the purpose of computing was. So I think this first one is.
    A good starting point for that. By JCR lickliter wrote this in 1960 at the time,
    he was head of Defense advanced research project. Administration, I guess that's,
    the other is DARPA otherwise. So ensure it, it seems worthwhile to avoid argument
    with other enthusiasts for artificial intelligence Ai conceding dominance in the
    future. In the distant future celebration two machines alone there will nonetheless
    be a fairly long intro during which the main intellectual diligence will be made
    by. People in computers working together and intimate association a multi disciplinary
    study group examining future. Research and development problems in the United
    States air force estimated be 1980 before developments artificial intelligence,
    make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving of
    military significance. So times when i've had the sun slide. This is where I show
    a picture of terminator. and see if we had. functional Ai in 1980 then maybe 10
    skynet would be active and cetera et cetera et cetera. They would still get that
    reference I feel like i'm sticking to the an old reference. Even though they keep.
    Trying to. make new movies, are the same. As the same franchise fairly regularly.
    anyway. So. let's say 1980 but let's say 2025. I would you say five years to develop
    a human computer symbiosis and 15 years to use it. At 16 maybe 10 or 500 but those
    years could be intellectually, the most creative and exciting and history of humankind.
    So, to me, this is what the possibility of computing is that we're not. Taking
    away from people but augmenting their abilities and. computing is a tool that
    supports people then.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Being.
  persid: ???
- desc: Intellectually creative in it. haven't had enough coffee, yet today. Such
    a thing as too much coffee on a day like today. anyway. So I just. sorry about
    the. terminator reference there in this quote but. Anyway, so you can see that
    there's possibility, I think. For augmentation of human activities. People are
    in charge, but. Not being manipulated by computers. Or the systems we program
    for them. anyway. Now i'm not sure how it's gonna affect this is funny. But. The
    slide from. This is a commencement speech he gave this fellow. David foster wallace
    who's a famous author in the States who's no longer with us. Anyway, he said in
    his commencement speech, these are. There are these two young fish swimming along
    and they have to meet an older fish, and then the other way not to them says warning
    boys how's the water, the two young fish swim on for a bit and then eventually
    one of them looks over at the other end goes what the hell is water. So. To me
    this class is. What we're doing here is sort of understanding what. The water
    is in our environment, what, what are the things that are. So present that we
    don't even think to. notice them. And then. And then. see what happens when we
    change. So there's a short quote from Steve Jobs for this as well. here's an interview
    back in 1995 so when you grow up, you can tend to get told the world is the way
    it is and your your life is just to live your life inside. That world try not
    to bash into the last too much try to have a nice family have fun save a little
    money that's a very limited life life can be much broader once you discover one
    simple fact. Everything that you call life was made up by people that were no
    smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your
    own things that people can use once you learn that you'll never be the same again.
    So I think that's written for a particular perspective but. The idea that we don't
    have to. Accept the way things. are just because somebody else created that structure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I mean.
  persid: ???
- desc: Facebook has this. This motto. move fast and break things. So maybe that's
    a little bit too extreme. version of this sentiment. Because it's maybe it's important
    to also understand. why things are the way they are. And if you move fast and
    break things and maybe it's a good to take some time to slow down and fix things
    as well. anyway. A little bit of my perspective on. What we're doing in this class.
    So that's. This philosophical grounding. more practical things over writing blog
    posts and. Discussing and thinking about these ideas. Related to topics. That
    are outlined in the. body of knowledge. Now I clicked on the wrong. realized that
    my link wasn't quite working. For this, for the list of knowledge units and so
    forth. and go to the page, but it wouldn't open. It wouldn't show the contents
    of the. Of the. So, here it is right here. So the knowledge areas. Are the two
    or three letters in front. So social and professional practice. So there are lots
    of these SP. analytical tools professional ethics. Intellectual Property privacy
    and civil liberties professional communication. and sustainability, and then there
    are also a couple from hca human computer interaction foundations and designing
    interaction. Okay, so, then there are some topics, so you might. So we talked
    to lots of comments with accessibility in from. In the responses to last days
    meeting so. Accessibility issues and creating legal requirements. That could be
    a topic for a blog post. Because it's. Certainly topical. mean. In the current
    discussion, I think. give you a bit more perspective on. What we're doing in this
    class and what topics, do we have to write about, for the first blog. That makes
    sense any questions or comments about that. my microphone on.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry, I wrote it in the chat so but yeah that that helps for me thanks.
  persid: S02
- desc: Thanks. choose the blog topic specifically from the list. So I would say.
    The themes, can you can think of a theme related to the topic on the list. So
    it doesn't so the accessibility legal issues one doesn't have to be you don't
    have to say exactly for that exactly. But you can indicate. That it's. Coming
    from relate to that theme. Inspired by that that topic. I mean the idea is. To
    pick something. which you can have a personal connection. My helping you there.
    Okay. David.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry, I don't think that's me someone else must have their MIC unmuted.
  persid: S02
- desc: Well yeah your your rectangle is highlighted that's why I thought, maybe.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh gotcha.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, so. More questions will take it up as they come along. More. clarity.
    meet everybody. So you saw permission to unmute yourselves. To contribute to the
    discussion, but just because there is a. microphone on. Okay, so I think I specified
    how long how many words. And all the details in the blog post entry. If there's
    a question that arises for their let me know. I don't wanna. written down. Remember
    i'm gonna. hear the pass code for the. record your attendance. Okay, so. your
    attendance is handled as far as i'm concerned. Back to. Okay, let me just quickly
    address some of these points here. So, we talk a lot about intuition and how do
    we dissolve intuition about something. So, if something is not intuitive To start
    with, but we developed some intuition. over time. And then maybe it's well designed,
    because we can understand how to, or we can. We can figure out how to use it.
    And maybe we have to. start from a difficult position of unfamiliarity with something
    that's new. that's. The idea of. The idea of having an intuitive interface means
    that it's connected to something else with with which you're familiar so that
    was the basis for the metaphors that we talked about. last day. Finding a metaphor
    that say well as new activities like this old one. And so we can transfer some
    of the the old or the familiar activities. Familiar ways of thinking about things
    to. The new context and then i'll help us to go. to proceed more easily. So a
    metaphor helps us to develop a mental model of an interface. And the mental model
    is. useful for us to. We want to make. A model out of if something's work in a
    certain way, then we say oh okay well, that means that. If this function works
    like this, then functional probably work like that. So we make some models based
    on our experience and then, as we get. More experience with system, the model
    becomes more complete. So the designers might have a very elegant model of the
    system, but users only discover the model based on their interaction with the
    system, and so the users model is ad hoc. So if we choose a an appropriate metaphor,
    we can help the users. To create models that are. more elegant and more complete.
    So we can't. ever. can't ever dictate them a mental model to a user but week.
    encourage them. So there's in there's an idiom in English, can lead a horse to
    water, but you can make a drink. So unfamiliar with that one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: One before.
  persid: S03
- desc: So i'm not the only one all right, thank you. So some years ago, I was. New
    to Twitter and now i'm not on Twitter anymore, but I had a. So, based on my experience
    with other communication applications like email. I decided. or I developed a
    mental model of Twitter that. That I should send the same message to different
    users. And this promptly got me kicked off of Twitter. And there was, I was trying
    to promote an event. One day, so I begged and pleaded with Twitter to let me back
    on and and they did, and then I. So that was a problem that was an issue of mental
    model I think my mental model of Twitter was a little bit too much like email.
    Yes, the blog is due on the 22nd the Monday. So just under two weeks. So I should
    have surgery looking for the dates for assignments. You should be able to find
    them in the calendar. And then, if you click on the description. For the assignment
    it'll go to page on my website that has due dates also listed in one place. Okay,
    and if there's an issue with that. Please let me know with bug report email and
    the participation discussion. Okay, so I don't know what about the time duration
    for the blog the time, but the length so it's a written document. Okay. So. Any
    questions keep them coming in. Okay, anyway. So my model of Twitter was more too
    much like email and not enough like. So much like email that I got. I got flagged
    by their. Inappropriate mental model police. and Then, and still now they don't
    have. A great metaphor. For Twitter.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is there any way you think they could improve this.
  persid: S04
- desc: well. So anyway, I did get a warning I guess. But then I didn't know how to
    fix it. And then they locked my account. So fixing it i'm not sure. So, sending
    a tweet on Twitter is like. broadcasting. So anyway i'm not the best for some
    asco Twitter, because I gave up on it. I haven't been on Twitter for several years,
    I tried it out.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: I decided that I I couldn't. deal with it in a. productive way so. i'm sure
    there's sort of asked me. If my 24 hours or whatever I had. anyway. How many people
    are, how many of you are on Twitter. Twitter. How would you describe. The. metaphor
    for using Twitter. To explain to people who don't have it. standing on a street
    corner talking to yourself. In a loud voice or. Not in a quiet voice. hmm interesting
    okay. In terms of everyone anyone replying to everything or. Anyone can reply.
    So notice on the news reported. They might laugh ensure tweets. of people who.
    aren't. well known, perhaps, but there they've written a few good words about
    or. The written media friendly tweeted they can. That can be shared. And there's
    a nice interface to include tweets. In. In web documents and our web pages and
    blogs, and so forth. used to be. counted as a feature of sort of web two point
    O is that people could. You know, we don't have the same gatekeepers of knowledge
    same curators that people can. share their opinions. The same time, maybe that's.
    The experience of. The benefit experience for the 1010 years or so of having this
    web two point o where you can read and write on the web. And maybe there is some
    benefit to having curators and gatekeepers. Because it's not only about. Not only
    the amount quantity of information. But it's about. The quality of information.
    So maybe we just. Whereas we had some. People who are trusted to produce quality
    information. Standards through it was posted and now. That responsibility has
    been delegated to us a little bit more. And maybe not everybody. carries it out
    with the same degree of. rigor that's the word i'm looking for. anyway. So, moving
    on a little bit, I just want to say so. discord is like cooking but look it looks
    easy but it's not. So that says something about the author of the comment as well.
    As cooking isn't easy for the person that person. So that's not so much an interface
    metaphor is. A comment about. complexity. hello, but I think so. discussion going
    on offline on your courses about the metaphors for discord. So, to me, the thing
    to address in the metaphor is about. explaining this. The term server. That was
    discussed in class last day. So as being a console confusing part but, so I think
    if. we're going to have the discord interface be more intuitive. The metaphor
    could address the. idea was a server. and make that connection, a little more
    clear. Before we run out of time today I want to get into we're going to talk
    about. Today anyone able to access the video here. Okay, so this is a new version.
    I had seen there was. An episode on May Day, I think that was. The Canadian produced
    series on discovery or the active incidents leading up to this. This seems to
    be more. I don't think there's any life as well. Come on every call there's. kind
    of a restatement of facts here. But the idea was. That they were going in for
    landing on a on a night when. It was. There is no clear, there is no moon. So
    it's very dark. And so, when they put the landing gear down. The light on the
    control panel didn't. In light up. And so they send somebody down into the control
    area below the cockpit to look to see if there is. If the landing gear is locked
    as the front landing gear was locked and it's so dark he couldn't he couldn't
    tell whether it was. locked properly or not. So it was an issue. hmm so that they
    tried to change the light bulb. But in the process of changing the light bulb.
    The disk engaged the autopilot. and They had a warning when they were, but I think.
    I can't remember exactly the. Though the Odyssey there at maybe 1000 feet. and
    The warning was. The first one, it was not sufficiently trying. To get the monitor
    task of changing the light bulb, which was stuck in the in the. In the dashboard.
    And then. When they when they very loud alarm went off at the pilots were there,
    the crew were. not able to get to themselves into back into the problem. Say well
    we're still we're still circling at whatever altitude right. and And, by the time
    they realized the real situation they didn't have enough time to act. So. Jesus
    that seems like a mean that's not the only example of an interface that causes.
    As deadly consequences. But it's. it's a good example of the pitfalls of. interfaces
    and thinking about what our ethical responsibilities are. when designing interface
    so pagans you have a comment.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh yeah I have to disagree with that a little bit because they had a bunch
    of redundancies like that alarm you mentioned, they also mentioned that. The comm
    tower message the plane and asked if everything was Okay, but didn't mention they
    weren't following the directive of flying at 2000 feet. So it's like I don't think
    the interface has anything to do with it is they had redundancies to fix these
    things just nobody. You know, they all miss messed up like there's more than one
    person I thought i'd say.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah Well, no, I wasn't. Trying to assign blame to anyone in particular, but
    mean the fact that the message from the control tower was another example of.
    You know, without interesting okay yeah yeah we're okay. Without. Well, there
    was the radar there was a radar issue. I think that. Or that there had been radar
    issues at the. Air Traffic Controller decided was not. The information on the
    screen was not reliable. So, to me, the issue is. President assigning blame. Just
    thinking about. The idea of the. flight crew so they're organizing. cells to change
    the light bulb in the control the dashboard. Or the instrument panel. And they've
    engaged the autopilot. So they have some expectations about the autopilot. But
    they didn't realize that by bumping the the stick. That the disengage the autopilot.
    So I mean it's an issue it's an issue of training graphs. You know server idea
    about. How much we can rely on an autopilot. Every single day the technology is
    great. We set it and forget it. and And that can lead to problems. Just like when
    the self driving cars. If we. If we had the idea that they're going to. continue
    to work without any kind of supervision. And, by the time we were asked to, or
    we realized that the revisions needed, we might not be able to get back into the.
    Take control and we need pre avoid a problem. Does that make sense. gone on too
    long here and let's see. These three quotes from Jeff raskin so Jeff raskin was
    one of the designers of the apple MacIntosh. In the early 80s. his son appears
    in the. Social dilemma documentary. Anyway, if you watched either the Steve Jobs
    movies, a few years ago Jeff raskin had a small part. As a character on screen.
    So the first thing is he talks about interfaces humane if it's responsive to human
    needs and considered a human frailties. So his first law of interaction is he
    called it. So computer shall do no harm. shall not harm your work North your inaction
    allow your work to come to our. Which is an homage to as them off and its laws
    of. androids. And then he said as a good second law might be a computer should
    not waste your time or requiring you to do more work than a strictly necessary.
    So we're I think. What I think is an ethical. consideration here is. When we.
    certain amount of work. To be so low that we disengaged people from. Their oversight
    role. So, in the case whenever supervising on autopilot. or revising a self driving
    car. And we should be engaged. engaged in oversight so that's the threshold for
    strictly necessary work. So required, you know doing. require you to do. More
    or less work than a strictly necessary. So we don't often think about. Humanity
    of an interface new faces you mean we don't think about. just trying to you a
    nice and convene considered of human frailties. Of that much. So Keegan you really
    did anyone tell Microsoft, the last one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh, that was a joke because Microsoft waste my time all the time. alright.
  persid: S03
- desc: So I. did anyone see Dave plumbers talking December. At the end of the Semester.
    it's online i'll i'll share the link with you and i'll go and find it, but do
    you use a Microsoft employee for 10 years, I think. And he created Microsoft task
    manager and. So on, but he added it. He told a joke about the. helicopter was.
    And lost its navigation and so they were near an office building where there was
    somebody in the Office could see them, and so they wrote a sign. Where. You know,
    to find out where they were. And the guy in the office replies you wrote a message
    saying you're in a helicopter. you're flying a helicopter. And then the pilot
    made some adjustments and flew back, who made it to the airport safe and sound.
    And how how did he know. From that message you knew that because the help was
    correct, but not useful. That he was at Microsoft, and so we made an essay correction
    to this course, based on that information. So I had i'd heard variations of that
    job before but. Never with a helicopter also as a small plane. Anyway, I thought,
    because a Microsoft employee. Shared it that I would like, I could share it as
    well. I think I have a poll from the other day that I didn't get to answer, so
    let me call that. relates to the moral operating system video. We didn't discuss
    this aspect, so much. So it's about. How do we make decisions or how do we answer
    why. That make sense. So let me just share that with you. I think I was typing
    too quickly here to. I could have given more. Or, more detail so Dr D ontology
    the ontological approach is saying. there's a right way and a wrong way to do
    things so. there's an objective standard that we need to follow so that's. that's
    one way to answer the why. utilitarian. says what what's. what's the benefit or
    the harm. And we want to greatest benefit with the least harm. We have to apply.
    particular set of rules to make decisions about. How to behave or why we should
    take on or not take on something like this. Whatever that question is if it's.
    A new question. hasn't been. decided before then we need to. find a place for
    in terms of. Well, like doing the metaphors. For interfaces that are our new.
    So we have to make a connection or an argument. A common discussion now is. Are
    we.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You know.
  persid: ???
- desc: A common question is. Are we facing new problems. And the problems that we
    face now new or they just new versions of the same old problems. So let me create
    that poll. This one. Okay, so most popular was utilitarian. And I have to stop
    sharing if I want to add another poll, so let me do that quickly. examples. So.
    Is. Information on the Internet, these days. Is that a new version of the old
    same old problem. Or is it fundamentally different because of the scale. Where
    it is the Internet and computers change. The quality, not just the scale of the
    problem. About. visible to you because i'm sharing and selected zoom windows.
    When I share the polls that become. visible. So some examples of brand new problems.
    Surveillance capitalism even heard that buzz words oh. we're getting out of time
    here, so let me share end the poll. and share it. share the results. So we're
    out of time for today, so thank you very much and we'll see you on Thursday. Okay,
    everyone stay warm and stay well. And thanks for today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you have a good day.
  persid: S05
- desc: thanks you too. Take care everyone.

- desc: You can communicate with anyone but only by yelling in short sentences, any
    sort of nuance is pretty much hopeless
  persid: S28
- desc: It's way more informal than email/FB/any other messenger. You just shout out
    things to the world that are on your thoughts. "Change the world 140 characters
    at a time"

  persid: S15
- desc: Is this the first time some types of problems are being considered
  persid: S13
- desc: Very mixed results on the poll
  persid: S02
- desc: I'm torn on this poll tbh, I think there are some new problems and some that
    have existed since computing started tbh
  persid: S15
- desc: I saw the poll
  persid: S15
- desc: What are some examples of brand new problems?
  persid: S13
- desc: Personally I'd say same myself.  People stay the same, its only the medium
    that's changed.  The scale in which some problems are apparent has changed though
    definitely
  persid: S02
- desc: surveillance capitalism meaning like, data mining in order to drive purchases?
  persid: S15
- desc: One example with a new problem would be that instead of worrying about criminals
    in immediate proximity to us, we can potentially be targeted by criminal organizations
    or nation states from anywhere in the world
  persid: S28
- desc: How about surveillance capitalism?
