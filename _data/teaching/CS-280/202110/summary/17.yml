- desc: Good morning. today. yeah so far, so good. My second cup of coffee here. yeah
    So the question about feedback for the. Chris blog. He ran into a few. difficulties,
    but I should be able to. As the marks posted today. I remember. So I spent some
    time working in New York state at IBM research. and My boss, a fellow then we'll
    mental growth. Because I was also going to be too. I had I had moved or I was
    going to move to Vancouver. To do my PhD at Simon fraser university. And he was
    commenting on the. On the need for caffeine on the west coast. Can to match the
    level of intensity on the east coast. Without the caffeine. So. I kind of. Remember
    that so here in Scotland we're kind of in the middle of so he's a little bit less
    caffeine attacker. More than. in Toronto or New York. anyway. So last day we talked
    about privacy, actually, first let me do this. Okay, so we talked last week about
    privacy. And I was talking to a friend. Over the weekend see today's Tuesday right
    yes. Talking about his. wife taking a job with a big company as mad as a manager
    in charge of sustainability. And the comment was that his boss her boss didn't
    understand what sustainability is. And I thought it'd be interesting to explore
    sustainability from our. Computers in society perspective, a little bit here.
    So how do you understand sustainability. will do, maybe one or two one maybe two
    breakout sessions. today. sustainability. We start off with one. Sure, so. How
    do you understand, sustainability, if someone says, sustainability is important.
    What is it really. Being able to. use. Your own mug for coffee again. You go to
    TIM hortons or something like that. David doesn't give you enough said enough
    elaboration. Let me get that setup. make sense. Can opener. i'll do five minutes
    and we'll keep. will keep the same room circle back to them later on. Okay, so
    you came back the last five people are so. sure when when that. Was that was going
    to are coming back from the rooms anyway. So did anyone have some ideas about
    sustainability they'd like to share. Okay. So, can you please stop saying me direct
    messages. Just messes up mother chat. So talk about questions about the blog in
    a second or two. Sustainability in terms of. maintain. A healthy company or project,
    they want to think about healthy planet. making decisions for the future in mind
    all right. doing something now, without compromising the ability to do that for
    future generations yeah. Okay, so there's some comments about data. So this. I
    see this as a connection to our discussion last table privacy. and discussion
    about smart meters smart electric meters. So if everyone has a smart meter. That
    means it's good in essence we're getting data back to the utility. So they can
    understand peak usage and. there's. no better way than that. Okay, so I said I
    would talk about the blog in a minute. So let's stop. discussion and talk about
    right now. So would anyone be offended if we allow the due date for the blog to
    be pushed to Tuesday next week. Okay, so. The idea. blog is. Just to clarify it's
    not necessarily. about looking at Defense distributed, although you can use that
    as your case. You can use that as. The example. Your focus. But the idea was more
    generally could be more general to say. There are different groups claim to be
    in the act in the public interest. So Defense distributors, one of them. So you
    may think I claim is somewhat dubious. or not. But i'd like you to critically
    examine somebody claim to be acting in the public interest. And that is that's
    the focus of your blog post. Clear. Okay, so I already talked about the blog one
    i'm gonna release marks. Such as they are today later today okay. public interest,
    I think we could make a case for that. Okay, so let's. let's. make that change
    here, let me. make a change right away and. Your courses. Dealing with zoom windows
    here. Coming up. The settings end to change for the assignment. The empathy map.
    i'm inclined to well. We can talk about that next week, see where people are at
    okay. or. not opposed to. being flexible on the date. Okay. So I just said i'm
    not opposed to being flexible a dates, but we'll have that discussion. Tomorrow
    next meeting our next week. Well, I suppose you could have it now. Since we're
    having this discussion. So I can move to move at the same amount to from the Thursday
    to the next Tuesday, so the 30th. Anything else. questions that you can send to
    everybody. And not direct messaged me about. Things not related to our discussion
    today. Seeing none will continue with our discussion, then. So. Last year we talked
    about privacy and. collection of data and the risks of being identified, even
    when data is de identified. So this to me relates to the smart meter idea as an
    example. Smart power meter does anyone. Remember the well. There were some effort
    to get smart meters in China in saskatchewan. The then the meters that were selected
    caught on fire. And i'm not sure the overall status of the. So those meters are
    replaced and i'm not sure the extent. To which the smart meters have been. implemented
    here, I need to check that. But what I found interesting is. When I was looking
    at that. problem originally so there's the idea that. you're going to have aggregate
    data, so people can. Compare their consumption and make. decisions based on data.
    So we don't want to be too. To clear about whose data is. which belongs to whom.
    Because that could. Put somebody else put a target on somebody. Somebody else
    is using a lot of electricity. Then they might be singled out if we could understand.
    Those would be. So the other thing is. So it's sharing enough data. To make comparisons
    interest that useful. Say that we're above. Their utility customers above the
    average or below the average at the average. And then doing some analysis to say
    here are some ways to save power. So there's also. An issue about. Making a data
    available to. The household. So even if we're not sharing. With the with the Community
    with back to the utility and they're not. The identifying data. it's still be
    nice for the household to see what is going on a throne you, with your own utility.
    So I know is water meters. And I think this is a drive by and collect them. there's
    a transmitter. connected to the water. So that the city can. Read read the information
    once a month for billing for the billing cycle. But the issue is there's no way
    for me to see that. Information exactly. So I can't make use of that data it's
    going to utility. And it's going. to know that i'm not sure where else it's going
    it's not being made accessible to me. So I can do my own analysis on the data.
    which might be interesting and useful say you know so for you the water. And for
    the. power. goes up to good sources so when I was talking to. Someone earlier
    about. Some one of the suppliers, that those meters, they said. Well, we can give
    you a console you can install on your home. And they were they were able to sell
    me, and I think there's a subscription involved as well. Some. access to the data.
    For my house and then I could. I could do some maybe do some analysis and. gain
    some understanding of what the sources of the power consumption, where are in
    my house. So we talked about data and sustainability. About singing. The planet.
    i'll do me, is there a way for information technology and computer scientists
    to make a contribution to. Sustainability on the planet. Considering that. data
    is an important part of understanding. how things are sustainable and things might
    not be so sustainable. I put I just posted this before the meeting but. I just
    give you an overview of some of these things. The first video that I posted was.
    What cradle to cradle design, this shows an architect. So he worked with Elsa
    does to work with a chemist. And talked about triple top line. So cradle to cradle
    design is the idea that. You design things so that they can be reused and their
    components can be. reintegrated so they're easy to. When something's at the end
    of the end of its life cycle, it can be components can be repurposed to create
    something new. Without much waste at all. And so corresponding ideas, a triple
    top line. that's the idea of having information about. alternatives. Measuring.
    measuring the impact collecting data about the impact of. processes and products
    and. and materials. And then. I was choosing. The one that is the most. Effective.
    So the one that has the most. benefit for. Or is most easily. return. To the cradle
    after. After its. What it's been used for has come to an end. And so the one that
    is. most easily returned. To the credo without to a new product without. severe
    impact. Those are the best choices, and so we need. A triple top line ideas that
    we can. make choices, you can cut cut gather information and. make choices about
    the impact two different choices and then. And then, as the last effective solutions
    are placed by more effective solutions and no less effective ones. fall out of
    use. So you can see that's an information problem. And then i've included. taught
    by TIM burners Lee both the next Web. And this is interesting because he talks
    about raw data, making it data, making data available through the link. Through
    web standards. And it's also interesting because it's from 2009. So you can see
    the. The maybe there's still some work to do in that. So, in terms of how it can
    be used and. made more useful or usable. And the third link is to the Wikipedia
    page for spine. So Bruce sterling who's a science fiction author. I don't know
    him as a science fiction author, but maybe some of you do. Anyway, so he gave
    a talk at siggraph, which is the computer graphics Conference, and I think he
    gave the talk a similar talk at some other meetings as well. We talked about how.
    We need to leave this. things better. than we found them current and future generations.
    And what he talked about was the idea of a spine, which is. Where it gets coined
    by combining space and time. So that we can. track. objects, so when they reach
    the end of life, and we know that. there's this much of materials X, Y and zed
    available. When. The original. Product. lifecycle. Is. Now, I think this is often
    used as a. Internet Internet Internet of Things kind of. example. opportunity
    with. The different sensors like are fed or. or other technologies. The question
    is. In those cases, when do you. When do you want. example of her boots and some
    videos. So, when does a pair of boots they're finished and when they entered the
    landfill. And when can we activate. The scanner to say reuse me. Some issues.
    In our in our homes. That have. This technology in them to. be activated once
    there. Once they're no longer. serving their purpose. For us. We don't want to
    accidentally turn on the identification, while we're still using them in our homes.
    Or to still. or two well there's the risk to certainly some privacy concerns if
    we. Understand who's got which pair of boots. and which other. items in their
    homes. technologies and sufficiently secure. Then might be a big problem as well.
    So I think there's an opportunity. For not just Internet of Things kinds of. Technological.
    implementations of this idea spines. And I think that there's. Opportunities using
    link data and so forth on the web. Help us keep track of. Which. pair of boots
    or. Which office chair, or whatever the case is. which ones are the best or the
    most effective choices. For the environment. So the question. Is a little bit
    of sense. In terms of thinking about. Sustainability and data. So the second question
    for the breakout rooms is. What is the computer science angle on sustainability.
    Okay, so i'm going to open the breakout rooms again and then we'll take 10 minutes
    for this. So it's not just a guess it's so there's two angles two parts to that
    So what can we do as individual professionals. And then, what kinds of. software
    and systems can we create. That contribute that contribute to sustainability.
    Okay. So here we go for the breakout room. same rooms. How is that discussion
    was just. Productive the questions come up and he. Okay, again, please don't send
    me direct messages. So I know that groups aren't always balanced. Okay, so CS
    professional should release more data to the public. yeah I can see that. So this
    is seems to be also related to our. Ongoing theme of filter bubbles and polarization
    and. not accepting. or resistance towards having a. shared understanding of what
    the truth is. So it's about transparency and then it's also about. Agreeing. Yes,
    means yes and no means no and so forth. So who is the CIO Sri or they could just
    do what Volkswagen did in live but.
  persid: DHH
- desc: There is a really interesting discussion in the chat just about how transparency
    tales and what these companies, and I think one of the hardest concepts is. corporations
    that are still operating for financial gain it's kind of hard to tie them down
    and get them to display data that that doesn't necessarily look good on them all
    the time.
  persid: S01
- desc: So Okay, but VW.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm not sure if you heard it oh. yeah a lot of decent while ago um Volkswagen
    had emission ratings and on some of their cars and they. underestimated significantly
    on those emission ratings and then I think when a third party company, later on,
    like a couple of years down the line investigated them, then it came out that
    those admission ratings were far above the minimum limit Rom enforced by the EU.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah so the. The falsified their. Data from the test, so they could. Essentially,
    tell the car that they were in the special in the laboratory so they should. not
    admit as much, so the settings were. tuned to make the test look good. In practice,
    the cars never delivered and so Volkswagen paid a hefty hefty price for. That.
    problem, and so there. was a another angle on in terms of computer professionals.
    Because. It was a software. solution, they used to enable the the testing settings.
    So it's a question of. that's computer impression on you are asked to falsify
    data or educated. create a setting so that we could fool the. regulator. Something.
    that you would like to do. So. Now I didn't mean to. put a damper on discussion
    there it's gone quiet now. So we have to agree as a set of rules, we play by.
    and Have. Penalties that discourage cheating. that's one thing. and David go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just want to talk about something I think is pre closely related to this,
    an ECON 130 this concept that we talked about. And it's the idea of a social cost
    versus a private costs, and I think when it comes to anything to do with corporations,
    they never look at the social cost of what they do. They only look at how it will
    affect them, so we need to find a way to make the companies pay for the social
    costs so that they're interested in actually you know, protecting the environment
    and being sustainable, for example.
  persid: S02
- desc: Thank you. He can.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Do yeah what you're talking about is basically the carbon tax rate since market
    equilibrium didn't consider the pollution to the air like that's exactly what
    the carbon tax is trying to. six.

- desc: Good morning!
  persid: DHH
- desc: good morning all
  persid: S04
- desc: Morning!
  persid: S02
- desc: Good morning!
  persid: S05
- desc: all right!
  persid: S04
- desc: Good! How are you?
  persid: S06
- desc: Everything's okay so far
  persid: S05
- desc: I forgot to have coffee so I am barely alive
  persid: S02
- desc: ^^^^^^^^
  persid: S07
- desc: Will we get feedback for the first blog before the second one is due?
  persid: S08
- desc: I had coffee and breakfast already which is better than usual hahaha
  persid: S04
- desc: Ayyy NYC, the city that never sleeps :)
  persid: S09
- desc: Awesome, thank you
  persid: S02
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S08
- desc: haha
  persid: S02
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: Care to elaborate a little first? I'm not sure what to talk about
  persid: S02
- desc: 'breakout room: what is sustainability?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes I think so! Thanks
  persid: S02
- desc: Our group seemed to think sustainability is the ability to maintain a healthy
    company or project. Wise use of resources and time.
  persid: S10
- desc: In a general sense, it means doing something now that can continue indefinitely,
    without impeding the ability of future generations to do so.
  persid: S04
- desc: Mostly as a neither way we can look at sustainability is that its also a way
    of stagnation since there is no need to bring in new ideas since they have a steady
    source of income
  persid: S11
- desc: Yeah! In our room we floated around the concept of sustainability in terms
    of data. To what extent companies can continue to harvest/collect data on us before
    it comes to a turning point where that data is too critical to be collected.
  persid: S01
- desc: in our group we discussed sustainability is the tern used to describe the
    management and disposal of it in a way that it reduce the harm to environment
  persid: S12
- desc: Our group did
  persid: S06
- desc: In a very broad sense, sustainability is when the resources you can consume
    is less than the maximum that the planet can regenerate is what I wrote in our
    group discussion
  persid: S02
- desc: I think true sustainability would be that the resources you consume should
    be less than the MINIMUM the planet can regenerate, to ensure no deficit
  persid: S04
- desc: Is it possible to extend due date for blog 2 please
  persid: S13
- desc: I saw sustainability in context with this course to be more so about developing
    in a sustainable way, as abusing the things we are able to now may lead to increased
    restrictions online for future generations
  persid: S14
- desc: sounds good
  persid: S15
- desc: 'No'
  persid: S16
- desc: 'no'
  persid: S17
- desc: "That\u2019s fine"
  persid: S18
- desc: 'no'
  persid: S19
- desc: that would be good
  persid: S20
- desc: more time works for me lol
  persid: S21
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S22
- desc: That would be nice
  persid: S09
- desc: I'd much prefer that, gives me time to reflect with what I needed to improve
    on with the first blog
  persid: S14
- desc: sounds good
  persid: S01
- desc: that's good
  persid: S23
- desc: that would be good
  persid: S24
- desc: That would be awesome
  persid: S25
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S26
- desc: yes it will be good
  persid: S27
- desc: great
  persid: S28
- desc: 'I''m done but feedback would be great before I submit #2'
  persid: S02
- desc: That would be great
  persid: S29
- desc: Yes would be nice to see how the first one was to see if we need to improve
    things
  persid: S18
- desc: yeah feed back for blog 1 would be great
  persid: S30
- desc: Would the Empathy Map still be due on same day then?
  persid: S01
- desc: Would "social good" also fall under public interest?
  persid: S04
- desc: so the due date of blog2 is March 23?
  persid: S31
- desc: cool cool thanks Daryl!
  persid: S04
- desc: The blog2 2will be due on 23rd march and the empathy map on 25th?
  persid: S32
- desc: what about blog 3
  persid: S30
- desc: What blog 3?
  persid: S04
- desc: "That\u2019s fair"
  persid: S18
- desc: yeah I meant the empath map!
  persid: S30
- desc: so it's not due on 25 then
  persid: S33
- desc: Sounds good
  persid: S18
- desc: Hmmm, I hadn't thought of that
  persid: S04
- desc: there was this Canadian show where they built a home 90% with reusable landfill
    material
  persid: S34
- desc: He's new to me.
  persid: S35
- desc: Bruce Sterling?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'breakout room 2: how can computer professionals contribute to sustainability
    ?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yup
  persid: S34
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S06
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S02
- desc: It was good
  persid: S03
- desc: I said that CS professionals should release more data to the public
  persid: S34
- desc: Ours came to it usually comes to insentives to be sustainable. For example
    the deposit on aluminum cans
  persid: S03
- desc: let the public have a better chance at making more informed sustainable decisions
  persid: S34
- desc: Solid discussion on how hard it is to nail down the sustainability concept
    to companies.
  persid: S01
- desc: I think being transparent about those things would increase accountability
    - people can make more thoughtful choices. I like that.
  persid: S04
- desc: Make it law to let their data be more available and transparent
  persid: S34
- desc: Back to transparency hahaha
  persid: S04
- desc: Or they could just do what VW did and lie about it. :)
  persid: S01
- desc: Privacy for the individual, transparency for the corporations seems to be
    the idea
  persid: S36
- desc: The VW jetta I think
  persid: S04
- desc: other than corporate manufacturing secrets (not slave labour obviously), true
  persid: S34
- desc: Yeah, they used the sensors to trick the tests for emission ratings
  persid: S02
- desc: It was more than just the jetta it was like all their parent companies diesels
    wasn't it?
  persid: S03
- desc: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15339250/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-vw-diesel-emissions-scandal/
  persid: S01
- desc: I mean, I found out recently that my car was upgraded to a Turbo engine during
    development to meet emissions standards because otherwise it didn't meet them
    lol
  persid: S04
- desc: But turbos are more fun so like theres some utility
  persid: S03
- desc: But most of those penalties are an extremely small fraction of the companies
    profit
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah, exactly. That's the argument for it, I agree
  persid: S02
- desc: I don't know how youd make a law for that in computer science though
  persid: S03
- desc: That's the big question
  persid: S03
- desc: Thanks Daryl! Good discussion today!
  persid: S04
- desc: Thank you for the interesting discussion! See you Thursday
  persid: S06
- desc: Thank you for class Professor Hepting, Take care :)
  persid: S02
- desc: Thanks!
  persid: S37

  persid: S28
- desc: Thank you! Great discussion today! Have a nice day!
  persid: S24
