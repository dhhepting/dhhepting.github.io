Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. So i'm happy to see the snow stop coming down. And it's a little
    bit discouraged with seeing the white stuff this morning. blog entry do. A couple
    of seminars coming up tomorrow. If you're interested in that. already moved the
    other assignment. Okay. So. Then a little hectic you're interviewing for. Parents
    to term instructor positions. And we have the guests. From. The JET propulsion
    lab at caltech. Very massey's computer science alumnus tomorrow. And we have a
    guest from kips. The Canadian information processing society. this coming Thursday.
    So, can you see me typing in the question here or not I can't remember. If i'm
    showing zoom windows to you or not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah, we can see.
  persid: S01
- desc: So you can see a different background today. Is. The main floor here because.
    My wife has an appointment that later on, so. I have. So, having Elgar coronas
    CRATE i'm gonna supervise him from. This location. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: S02
- desc: i've given three choices so gonna stick with zoom use webex I am familiar
    with it. were useful access try something new. So. If you're familiar with webex
    and you want to use webex and tech the. second option. Is your like to try using
    webex and the third option. Okay. I have to find the button to save it. Here we
    go. give it a few more seconds. Now. Okay, so. I wanted to stick with zoom. In
    here is my here and I echo that sentiment. To the yes and. Because. I thought.
    This software to download for webex. And I thought that having to download software
    is going to be more of an issue. than. Just using zoom. So I think will will be
    here in our regular space, and if you have. friends who are free, at this time
    they'd like to hear about kips the Canadian information processing society. and
    The pathway to certification as a it professional information services professional
    in Canada. Then that. Part of the presentation is open to the public and i'll
    put in a note out. your son on Facebook. i'm not sure exactly send an email but.
    If you have people who are interested if you know anybody who's interested in.
    becoming a certified. Information Services professional. Please let them know
    to come to the class. On Thursday. Okay. So one thing I noticed installing the
    webex. Three dialog boxes, I can get rid of. verifying Cisco webex meetings. And
    then, when I try and test. This out software just I get a warning that says the
    meeting hasn't started yet. So I don't know what it's like with zoom. I have a
    feeling that they're a little better with that. That you could actually see that
    you're making a connection. Testing a connection. So I was thinking about the
    empathy map. And empathizing with people. Maybe. So could be further developed
    with Cisco webex platform. anyway. Okay, so the other thing. Coming up tomorrow
    is the robotic Mars exploration. clock at 7pm. that's open to the public, so if
    you want to share that information, please go ahead. yeah just looking at the
    chat here. Not a question over switching. It was just a question of our going
    to if we're going to have this. keeps meeting done in webex or zoom. And I suggested
    that we might have some substantial attrition if we have. People to download and.
    get their. Could a new APP working. For the meeting starts it's just. going to
    limit our potential audience. So there are a couple of things that came up last
    day. and So one is about. new philosophy. canoes recursive acronym for canoes
    not unix. Hello. yeah. we'll see if we can just. need everybody to be on the safe
    side. You can you can unmute yourself that's fine. Okay, so let me read it. out
    loud here. So free software mean software that respect to users freedoms and Community
    roughly means that users have the freedom to run copy and distribute heard me
    run copy distribute study change and improve the software. that's free software
    is, and that is liberty not price. To understand the concept, you should think
    of free, as in free speech, not as in free beer. sometimes called libra software
    or in the from the French or Spanish word for free, as in freedom. To show we
    do not mean software is gratis. You can paint for these students, because everyone
    deserves them. With the scene with these freedoms users, both individually and
    collectively control the program and what it does to them. When users don't control
    the program we call it a non treat or proprietary Program. And non free program
    controls the users and the developer controls the Program. This makes the program
    and instrument of unjust power. To the forest central freedoms. So program is
    free software, yet the program's users of the forest central freedoms. And these
    are labeled freedom zero to three. So the freedom to run the program as you wish
    for any purpose that's freedom zero. Freedom to study how the program works and
    to change it, so does your computing as you wish. Freedom one. So access to the
    source code is is. Is a. is a precondition for this. The freedom to redistribute
    copies, so you can help others freedom to. The freedom to distribute copies of
    the modified versions to others to freedom, three by doing this, you can give
    the whole Community, a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source
    code is a precondition for this. So those are the four essential freedoms. The
    program is free software if it gives users adequately all these freedoms. Otherwise
    it is non free while we can distinguish various non free distribution schemes
    in terms of how far they fall short of being pre you consider them all equally
    unethical. keep going here. One more paragraph.
  persid: DHH
- desc: or.
  persid: ???
- desc: two. In any given scenario these freedoms must apply to whatever coded plan
    to make use of. or lead others to make use of, for instance, consider a program
    a which automatically launches and program be to handle some cases. Who plan to
    distribute as a stance that applies users, only be given, so we need to judge
    whether both A and B are free, however, we plan to modify a so that doesn't use
    be on the needs to be free be is not pertinent. he's calling me. must be available
    for commercial use commercial development and commercial distribution. Policy
    is a fundamental importance, without this free software could not achieve the
    same. Okay, so that's far enough, I think, for for this about the. essential freedoms.
    I can see that. 1212 and three. Are. Different than freedom zero because. Joe
    talks about to run the program as you wish for any purpose. Can we reconcile freedom
    zero with. public interest and. Making sure that we're serving the public interest.
    here. Clear as a question breakout room, can we reconcile freedom zero public
    interest. Can I clarify what this means. I want to explore. So I guess to clarify
    what I was. So that's the freedom is freedom zero is freedom to run the programs
    you wish for any purpose. So that's a freedom zero that's right. it's asserted.
    Now is their responsibility to consider the public interest in this. And or the
    incompatible or disease for together. helped clarify. Okay, so let's start a breakout
    room for 10 minutes. And we'll get back together and. and discuss.
  persid: DHH
- desc: know.well.yeah.bye.
  persid: ???
- desc: comments about breakout rooms, not being very. Active. Part of the issue here,
    I think, is. OK, let me. And the poll here and shared. Issues. Being able to.
    Find groups. Because if people don't register with email. This is my understanding,
    anyway, if people don't register. and tell us. If we. have some stability in the
    group, then we could serve treated as. So the accountability, with the groups,
    because they're.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.

  persid: S07

  persid: S08
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S09
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S07
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S01
- desc: Yes we can see it
  persid: S10
- desc: While I definetely prefer WebEx when I've had to use it for work, I think
    its another situation of "use what everyone else is using".
  persid: S10
- desc: True but It is a good thing to learn how to use other software eventually
  persid: S11
- desc: oh yeah, come on and slam...welcome to the Space jam!
  persid: S11
- desc: Seems like it was an accident.
  persid: S12
- desc: 'breakout room: can we reconcile freedom 0 with the public interest?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can you clarify what this means?
  persid: S12
- desc: '"The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose"'
  persid: S11
- desc: ^^
  persid: S09
- desc: If you make something and someone uses it for not its inttdended purpose who
    is at fault fo any harm
  persid: S13
- desc: yes, thank you
  persid: S12
- desc: tired of sitting in rooms where nobody talks, I left my room.
  persid: S12
- desc: Same for me
  persid: S14
- desc: 'promised from last meeting: https://www.google.com/search?q=ban+on+killer+robots'
  persid: DHH
- desc: I say it was good, its just some people are not active
  persid: S11
- desc: ^ I agree
  persid: S07
- desc: I've only had 2 breakout rooms this semester where anyone other than myself
    has posted something
  persid: S10
- desc: Sometimes, they have been awesome (shoutout to Maria), and other times, no
    response from the other members
  persid: S15
- desc: ^^^
  persid: S09
- desc: ^ to those two
  persid: S13
- desc: Yeah it's a toss up
  persid: S05
- desc: same
  persid: S16
- desc: honestly it us how are not using the opportunity to the fullest but calling
    them bad will be so mean because they are somehow this is among possible way we
    can interact in a group
  persid: S17
- desc: "It\u2019s good if everyone participates. Last 2-3 times, my breakout rooms\
    \ have had virtually no participation"
  persid: S18
- desc: Agree
  persid: S14
- desc: I'm leaning towards having a breakout discussion once a week rather than every
    class. Just because there will be more to discuss about.
  persid: S01
- desc: Will say whenever in David galgan group the awesome points are made its always
    cool to interact with him
  persid: S17
- desc: Thanks dude! :)
  persid: S05
- desc: "My business prof jumps around and joins random breakout rooms, which encourages\
    \ people to participate. If you\u2019re the only one active, when he joins your\
    \ group he\u2019ll find you with your camera on and mic and whoever else silent."
  persid: S15
- desc: I usually need a couple extra minutes to think about the prompt before talking
    in the breakout room, which I know slows things down a bit
  persid: S19
- desc: Had a good discussion with John.
  persid: S20
- desc: I've tried my best to accommodate people who prefer to type vs talking but
    I find about 70% of the time nobody will answer me at all, or it will be just
    me and maybe one other member of the group having a discussion.
  persid: S12
- desc: ^
  persid: S13
- desc: ^ same Dayne. Sometimes offering chat works, but not always
  persid: S15
- desc: I think they're a good idea. They create class discussion after the groups
    are done at the very least. The issue is a lot of people don't want to participate.
    It's an online issue, I don't think this would happen in in-person classes
  persid: S05
- desc: I find when you ask a question and we answer it in the chat as a large group,
    while it can be hectic, is a lot more beneficial then hoping you get good group
    members in breakout rooms.
  persid: S10
- desc: I agree, I just am not sure how to improve the situation when a small portion
    of class is dedicated to participating in discussion.
  persid: S12
- desc: We could just do less breakout rooms so theres moer people
  persid: S13
- desc: Yeah bigger breakout rooms sounds great
  persid: S09
- desc: I think it must be an online issue. In person, a group of 4 people, 3 of them
    would never completely ignore the 4th
  persid: S15
- desc: I must say they are a great way for us to get in our thoughts on a subject
    since there is only one spotlight in a big group, so opinions can get buried easily
  persid: S06
- desc: perhaps marking should be present somehow
  persid: S11
- desc: The problem with me is sometimes there is a lot of noise going on in my background
    and I don't want to have that interrupt the discussion, so at times I prefer the
    chat but then people don't read the chats
  persid: S21
- desc: I agree with Keegan, Bigger breakout rooms are better
  persid: S20
- desc: What if we make shorter breakout rooms to start the conversation, then continue
    together as a class? Just an idea
  persid: S05
- desc: ^ I think that's a good idea
  persid: S19
- desc: 10 minutes is short... when there is actually discussion
  persid: S12
- desc: 10 minutes would normally be decent if its a large group, but if your group
    isn't doing anything its just 10 minutes of silence
  persid: S10
- desc: Useful for a bathroom break but not much else.
  persid: S10
- desc: If there is discussion 10 minutes is barely enough. but gettting discussion
    can be like pulling teeth
  persid: S22
- desc: Larger group will be better.
  persid: S20
- desc: I think if we make group sizes to like 8-10 at least 2-3 others will be active
  persid: S09
- desc: Yeah, bigger groups means higher likelihood of active participants
  persid: S06
- desc: ^^^ Tim
  persid: S15
- desc: Yeah 8-10 seems reasonable, even if 50% don't participate, there can be a
    good discussion
  persid: S21
- desc: "As long as there are 2 people, it\u2019s great."
  persid: S15
- desc: ^
  persid: S05
- desc: It may also help to discuss the topic a bit or get some more lecture before
    going into the breakout rooms. That way, people will have more background before
    discussing
  persid: S07
- desc: funny that we are discussing how to discuss
  persid: S23
- desc: Yeah this last one threw people for a loop I think. GNU makes some pretty
    serious judgement / moral claims that I dispute, but I think the complexity of
    it further discouraged my breakout teammates from responding
  persid: S15
- desc: It is not worthwhile for all types of situation if the organization is planning
    or making anything that is harmful for public then it could be dangerous.
  persid: S24
- desc: For me, "as you wish, for any purpose" is not universalizable with regards
    to the public interest, as "any purpose" can include misuse.
  persid: S12
- desc: for me it was the opposite. I just focused on one particular topic/news story
  persid: S11
- desc: However that doesn't mean they can't coexist.
  persid: S12
- desc: ^if there are restrictions on the usage, it cant be called freedom 0
  persid: S21
- desc: My thoughts are that software is a multi-purpose tool, so the same software
    can be used for or against the public good. Therefore, with that caveat, it can
    coexist with the idea of the public good
  persid: S05
- desc: My group found that this related back to the responsibility topic. Ultimately,
    whose responsibility is it to uphold the public interest? The producer, consumer,
    or both?
  persid: S07
- desc: It seems to me that with the freedom of a user to use a software tool as they
    wish, there comes a responsibility to use it properly and constructively
  persid: S06
- desc: "If you read the context on the GNU page, what I take more serious issue with\
    \ is that they claim all software out to be FREE, and that if it isn\u2019t it\
    \ must not be shared (without being immoral). Their claim is that to share software\
    \ without transferring FREE ownership is to wield unholy power over another person.\
    \ I strongly disagree with their assessment"
  persid: S15
- desc: "ought\u2026 not out"
  persid: S15
- desc: public good is means that someone can't use a software to steal their money.
    This means there are some restrictions with using said program, this means less
    freedom but better for the greater good

  persid: S15
- desc: there is already cyberbullying with just text chat...forget virus making
  persid: S11
- desc: freedom should be restricted enough
  persid: S11
- desc: I really struggle with the concept of intellectual property. I agree that
    open source increases transparency, collaboration, and makes the work more accessible
    and diverse, however people still need to be paid for their work and their accomplishments.
    We can't expect people to do labour for free.
  persid: S12
- desc: '@Kurtis their (weak) response to your concern is that developers should ALL
    be paid exclusively by providing support to FREE software'
  persid: S15
- desc: GNU is a lot more ideological than I ever would have guessed
  persid: S15
- desc: Non-threaded chats are bad for the human side of digital communication
  persid: S15
- desc: Could anyone share the attendance code? I have missed it from the beginning
    of the class
  persid: S25
- desc: isn't robot in battlefield impractical enough in the first place?
  persid: S26
- desc: pickkz
  persid: S27
- desc: nope, not really. they are already using predator drones
  persid: S11
- desc: self flying robots
  persid: S11
- desc: drones are human contolled
  persid: S26
- desc: Yeah target acquisition is the dicier thing. As whose decision is it
  persid: S10
- desc: I would say target acquisition is fine. The problem is is the robot or human
    pulling the trigger
  persid: S13
- desc: welp, missiles has been able to acquire target on their own since the 60's
  persid: S26
- desc: Can even look at Winter Soldier/Minority Report as an example.
  persid: S10
- desc: You can use thermal to find targets easy enough
  persid: S13
- desc: Targets as in deciding who to kill, not how to guide the ordinance
  persid: S10
- desc: I love those movies
  persid: S11
- desc: Eventually it all comes down to whose calling the shots? Humans or the machine?
  persid: S21
- desc: I don't agree with the "nerfed police bad" however
  persid: S11
- desc: in Minority Report but I digress
  persid: S11
- desc: machines don't call the shots. but in insurgency maybe machines would be more
    accurate than human
  persid: S26
- desc: Currently, with a drone strike there is a pilot and command responsible for
    their actions. One of the (many concerns by the site https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/
    is that there will no longer be a direct link to a PERSON who can be held responsible
    for serious actions/inactions of deadly technology
  persid: S15
- desc: "\u2026 (many)"
  persid: S15
- desc: Yeah. The concern is more so a "develop a robot that has the goal of stopping
    harm", and what the conditions are for that,  and how it isn't really something
    we should leave up to a machine, which could essentially be developed to follow
    a specific mindset, and not take into consideration other factors.
  persid: S10
- desc: http://pledge-of-the-computing-professional.org/home-page/the-oath
  persid: DHH
- desc: drones operate based on ground intelligence. they don't hover in the sky,
    scan people and bomb them
  persid: S26
- desc: '...yet'
  persid: S11
- desc: For now at least
  persid: S19
- desc: As of right now. The concern is them getting to the point not needing human
    input.
  persid: S10
- desc: a good book to read :"robopocalypse".
  persid: S28
- desc: Something very interesting is that regardless of the degree to which they
    are right, https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/ has a ton of logical fallacies all
    throughout their argumentation
  persid: S15
- desc: more concerning will be the huge availability and cheap prices of drone
  persid: S26
