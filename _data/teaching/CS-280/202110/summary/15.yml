- desc: Good morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: ???
- desc: So back in a bit of white today after. Taking it was maybe spring was coming
    too early. seem to be proven right. how's your weekend.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good.
  persid: ???
- desc: It was okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: Good. So the first thing I want to talk about is. Details of the. presentation
    on the 24th from. The alumnus from NASA jpl. I don't like. So many times and everything.
    Facebook event. 15 or 20 people register on. The zoom link so far so. You want
    to go ahead and do that. No pressure, of course. To promote this. Let me just
    show you the rest of the description. So, Dr Larry Matthews, to the dispatcher
    science here in 79. or completed his bachelor of science in 79. Is. NASA jpl.
    Where his job allows into personally participate and putting robots and other
    planets like perseverance on Mars. The public lecture series by alumni and friends
    of the product computer science, please be sure to register in advance. So this
    actually is a link, even though there's a few cards in it. So the perseverance
    Mars Rover line is in general creator or you can see from orbit that it river
    floated to the crater which hilda lake and adult is formed at the mouth of the
    river. mission of perseverance, is to explore the around the delta to improve
    our understanding of these ancient climate and to examine the possibility of life
    or precursor molecules evolve their. Rover also acquire set of samples and lead
    information that the US and Europe plan to send back. Send send later this decade
    to bring back the samples to earth. sequence admissions is called a small sample
    return campaign. perseverance also carries a small helicopter called ingenuity,
    which is intended as a technology demonstration of the first heavier than air
    aircraft ever to attempt played on another planet. Electrical give a brief introduction
    of Mars exploration and these mission. So the both him and then. So. If you see
    less if you choose to see less than you get nothing. fits into the. First. Page.
    long enough to trigger the see less. You can look at. Some of the details of his
    work, if you like. mars.nasa.gov. So the title is a bit longer. Good Facebook
    forced me to use hundred characters including. His name, so all included, so we
    came up with it, this ever shorter title, which probably is a better thing anyway,
    but. So if I wanted to spread the word about this, what other social platforms.
    places, would you suggest, I put it. Facebook account is unnecessary here, let
    me just. Okay. So i'm curious about Okay, so I understand discord and instagram.
    Wherever we're on stack overflow. Ensure. That being. A destination for. event
    postings or information. Okay well fair enough. So. What kind of. go under, China.
    So what i'd like to. target is a little bit for. A local audience, so people who
    are around region in the university. yeah so we're gonna put on the your guns
    counter so. that's true, we can put it on your courses. Well, I think I can. So
    I was thinking of sending. an email today to see students at. Everyone on the.
    account. i'm a little nervous. Because I may not. nervous, since my experiences
    Twitter. I love it wouldn't want to. yeah okay. So there's a vote for me not worry
    about reddit so i'm happy to take that advice. Okay. I guess I would. Okay tick
    tock. that's another one that i'm not going to touch, I think. snapchat. support.
    chatters diverge from. discussion here. linkedin. who's on linkedin. Okay. And
    the news this weekend i'm not sure exactly when it happened, but I saw it on the
    weekend. It was about. Anyone heard of a weave the social project social fabric
    project from the Aspen Institute. Is the website. yeah. So, the reason I made
    the news was because. there's a columnist for the New York Times, who was being
    paid as a columnist for the New York Times. But did not make clear that he was
    also being paid by the Aspen Institute. and The Aspen Institute is funded by Facebook
    so nonprofit. So here's the description, as we, the social server project, you
    have a crisis of connection in this country, people are isolated. and seen and
    in Warren camps social distressed in isolation underlie our most pressing problems
    from continuing to racial and economic justice to political gridlock and epidemic
    of loneliness rising deaths from suicides and directs. The stress keeps us from
    tackling issues like poverty homelessness hunger and climate change we've supports
    the many Americans in every community are working to create social trust and we've
    neighbors together to strengthen our communities. nonprofit organization, so I
    guess it's all normal. well. In a sense that. there's some philanthropy going
    on. Sometimes grab the MIC on. i'm just gonna. mute everybody you're free to unmute
    yourself. As required. Okay, so it's not about encouraging philanthropy but maybe
    it's encouraging. it's a question of. whitewashing, so to speak. The activities
    of. These groups are these companies. Facebook and Amazon can both give. money
    to worthy causes but. Is that distract from their own. Core. yeah better than
    bad behavior is odd. To be here without anything else to go with it. yeah. i'm.
    watching the documentary on Lincoln so he's not quite as. he's a bit more pragmatic
    then. idealistic, I suppose, it seems. yeah okay so. let's see incentive well.
    it's the question of is there a right or. wrong way to do things. Perhaps. And
    maybe it's just a. call for more regulation, more. legislation. Okay, so I appreciate
    the conversation going on in the chat and I don't want to. diminish it, but I
    also don't want to just. couldn't. Read the chat with all of you. So thinking
    about the theme that I proclaimed for today rights and responsibilities. So we
    have. We don't want to diminish. The company's rights to right to make. A profit.
    To get a return for their shareholders. Then the other question is. Do they have
    responsibilities at the same time, and what are those. Talk about rights and responsibilities
    in a different way. here. So i'm looking at the Wikipedia page for claim rights
    and liberty rights. celebrity claim. is one where we have to where we require.
    behavior and support from. Other others to enforce it. So claim right is a rate
    that and which entails responsibilities duties or obligations and other parties
    regarding the right holder. So if I have a claim right, I could say that I have
    a claim right. For. Other people to not kill me. And that's compared to liberty
    rights, which is. isn't about what other people do what I can do. The freedom.
    that I have. The freedom that doesn't impinge on anybody else I have the freedom
    to. To. drink coffee her my favorite mug. The freedom to choose which month. Are
    you. So claim right. Really relates, the responsibility of others. So if I have,
    if I have a liberty to speak. speak about my feelings. about a subject. I speak
    freely on a subject, and I also. If I, if I have raised as a liberty right. Then.
    there's a claim rate that says. Other people need to respect. My right to speak
    freely. Miranda rights. In the States. I believe. Yes, Sir, I remain silent and
    so forth. So that would be. The elements of both because you know, the right to
    not say anything but then. you're also. Putting on to the. Law legal authorities
    that. The requirements that they. Not. do anything untoward. The face of your.
    you're free. To not say anything. seems to me that. there's. Elements of both.
    kinds of rights and lots of things that we encounter. Not a straightforward thing.
    Somebody. Wanting to speak or turn the microphone on by.
  persid: DHH
- desc: mistake.
  persid: ???
- desc: So let's think about. rights and responsibilities in terms of Wikipedia. So
    we might have a right to. Encourage to. write articles about. What else what are.
    The topics we. know which were passionate. So we have the freedom to choose a
    topic. If we're going to participate in the Wikipedia community, then we need.
    Also to. uphold the standards so. This is a. This is a header that can be put
    in by editors I believe. see this article needs additional citations for verification,
    please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. And
    so I satirical may be challenged and removed. So that's been here for a while
    it looks like 2011. lens of claim rights and liberty rights. How do we view. Do
    we have online. How about let's make a question for breakout room. yeah so there's.
    Stories I don't know what that one in particular, but there are stories with people
    who have become. fairly high ranking members of the. editor so 40 pedia. And they
    were found out that they were not. found out to them, not be who they claim to
    be and so. That brings into question. enterprises are not vetting. candidates
    and vetting information properly. On what r. return. Wikipedia is a good place
    to start and not a good place to finish. So okay great good room question, what
    are your rights responsibilities online and upon what do they depend is that.
    sufficiently. Concrete to. Have a discussion. Okay, so i'm going to make up for.
    groups now. And then we'll take 10 minutes and then we'll. Come back at 1230 to
    discuss. time for good discussion. Okay, so anyone want to tell me what they talked
    about. or share with the group what was discussed in your breakout room. Okay,
    can you tell me more about the right to protect yourself online. So is it what's.
    The question discuss does anyone actually have responsibilities online.
  persid: DHH
- desc: People or users have responsibility to share the correct information and do
    their due diligence protect facts and not just share. misinformation and lies.
    Sometimes they're hard protect what people should have our expect that responsible
    behavior from other users. Who. That information against.
  persid: S04
- desc: Being truthful. So, in terms of. see what what. So if. greater responsibilities
    as individual depends on. The developers. So what are the. Well, what are reasonable
    rates, the responsibilities of. developers as a platform providers to. engage
    with the population yeah go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I would just kind of ask why i'm we would have specific responsibilities or
    rights defined at all because, like these are basically based off morals and each
    individual's morals are different it's different globally cross culturally. So
    how do we define like what's right and wrong for everybody versus. As an individual.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's.
  persid: ???
- desc: Certainly, a question, but we have a. Declaration of Human Rights from the
    UN. mean, so there are examples where we come to agreements beyond. The scope
    of our individual. or individual. model campuses, so to speak. So if. If online
    were. Dealing with people from different cultures and different groups. Then needs
    to wait for us to. communicate respectfully. And if we don't have a way to communicate
    respectfully then we get. The polarization. which seems endemic on social media
    platforms. So, in answer your question, how do we, how can we define something.
    I think that the, the answer is what happens if we don't define something. some
    common ground. with which we can work. And we're. And we're going to. be in a
    much more difficult place. So i'd encourage everyone to. See the social dilemma,
    if you can, if you have access to. The documentary. And people have seen it already.
    So I just encourage you, because it's interesting and thought provoking. presentation.
    it's called the social dilemma so netflix. So. It features people from the Center
    for humane technology and that's the link tonight right, the other day. anyway.
    Simple as. You know. printing. Always. Having the responsibility. to publish things
    that are well cited. Alright, that. can be supported by reliable sources. and
    taking care of. not spread false hits. It is a big issue and when social media
    platforms are interested in. Adding things go viral and encouraging activity on
    their platforms. and call Center lot more lucrative in terms of monetization on
    the platforms. So what about privacy or we consider privacy is a right. And the
    responses are the elements of responsibility to that as well. So one thing about
    privacy is. That allows us to do is have some agency over our. lives and the.
    And the way that our. story that we share our own story with others and with the
    world. So, if everything that we do. Well, both good and bad is. Online then we
    can't. Make it we don't we don't lose the ability to make decisions about. What
    things to. sharing with whom to share them. I think that's an important. aspect
    as well. Okay, so now, you can say that. There are privacy settings that can be
    applied. or they meaningful, in the sense that. in the sense that. clear what
    to do to achieve a certain level of privacy.

  persid: S07

    \ access it from there \xAF\\_(\u30C4)_/\xAF"
  persid: S19
- desc: at least everyone from this class!
  persid: S19
- desc: you're own personal reddit account and link the event on there
  persid: S06
- desc: the UofR website would probably be the best place to advertise locally and
    more officially
  persid: S20
- desc: Can also see if they'd let you utilize the announcments email through UR Webmail
    to let other students know about it
  persid: S13
- desc: That would be perfect
  persid: S09

    if there isn't an established community for your target.

  persid: S07
- desc: Please receive this politely and respectfully, but I am really tired of discussing
    this and would like to receive instruction in this class time.
  persid: S22
- desc: I
  persid: S05
- desc: me
  persid: S09
- desc: No, I haven't heard of that.
  persid: S07
- desc: 'no'
  persid: S06
- desc: 'no'
  persid: S21
- desc: Outside of looking at it before this class no
  persid: S13
- desc: That's new to me.
  persid: S23
- desc: Facebook funding a project about building trust, great!
  persid: S24
- desc: well amazon supports non profit organizations, so I guess its all normal
  persid: S21
- desc: Good step, plenty more to go...
  persid: S06
- desc: Better then bad behavior with no beneficial distraction
  persid: S13
- desc: attempting to balance the scales. "but look, we did the thing!"
  persid: S07
- desc: 'true'
  persid: S06
- desc: Humans have been doing that for centuries
  persid: S25
- desc: Hitler was the first to promote a non-smoking movement
  persid: S06
- desc: He also gave his troops meth
  persid: S25
- desc: war on drugs as you do
  persid: S06
- desc: Plus as bad as those companies can be, what is the incentive for them to do
    anything about it if we give them crap about it anytime they try to make a positive
    change
  persid: S13
- desc: tax exemption, somehow
  persid: S16
- desc: I mean first of all amazon could just not treat there employees like crap
    to start? Instead of just throwing money to calm the fire maybe put it out
  persid: S25
- desc: i am but a drop in the ocean but I will take my droplet elsewhere if I don't
    like that particular ocean
  persid: S06
- desc: I think the criticism is that if your business model is exploitative by nature,
    doing superficial things to change things is more of a bandaid or a PR move than
    an actual good thing.
  persid: S07
- desc: Right or wrong is impossible on a large scale like that though. Theirs always
    bad apples.
  persid: S05
- desc: A lot of companies do this sort of 'bandaid' cover-up. Bell with Bell let's
    talk is a good example. Its a little slimy IMO
  persid: S26
- desc: Sorry but could some tell me the attendance password think I might have missed
    it
  persid: S27
- desc: The thing is, that exploitive model has worked for them and now they will
    not be changing it because it is earning them profits, they are doing all they
    can to steer away from that and have this fake front where they are doing everything
    good
  persid: S24
- desc: I'd say they certainly have responsibilities, giving employees a safe work
    environment, living wage, etc. But, if there is nothing to "enforce" it, realistically
    they don't have any incentive to do so other then "being good". Which, if a company
    is there to make money, generally will come second
  persid: S13
- desc: what is the miranda rights?
  persid: S06
- desc: claim or liberty?
  persid: S06
- desc: none, but slightly liberty
  persid: S28
- desc: I would think that's a claim right on the state for expected behavior when
    they arrest you.
  persid: S23
- desc: '"This genocide is incomplete...you can help by expanding it" muhahaha!'
  persid: S06
- desc: '*genocide list'
  persid: S06
- desc: I would say Wikipedia is a right or a responsibility. Having users who don't
    know about the subject working on it wouldn't be great for the integrity of the
    article, and while open access to information is something I think should be a
    right, practically it isn't.
  persid: S13
- desc: there was a story of a 14 year old boy falsely writing up a scottish dialect
    until he was caought
  persid: S06
- desc: I would choose Wikipedia source links over a decade old book
  persid: S06
- desc: as credible as possible ofcourse
  persid: S06
- desc: well in some topics Wikipedia info is manipulated so many times by so many
    people its hard to trust
  persid: S21
- desc: Its a good place to get a base line, but same as everywhere, don't take only
    one source as the entirety of your knowledge on something
  persid: S13
- desc: breakout room; What are your rights and responsibilities online and upon what
    do they depend?
  persid: DHH
- desc: you can't just use Wikipedia as a source just like you can't use "the library"
    as a citation
  persid: S06
- desc: 'true'
  persid: S06
- desc: sure
  persid: S06
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S17
- desc: is there no attendance code again?
  persid: S29
- desc: there was
  persid: S06
- desc: Attendance was posted about 5 minutes into class
  persid: S13
- desc: th26oc
  persid: S29
- desc: yup
  persid: S06
- desc: I think so
  persid: S26
- desc: I think so, we had a decent chat
  persid: S07
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S30
- desc: Yes!
  persid: S17
- desc: you have the right to protect yourself online
  persid: S06
- desc: Does anyone actually have responsibilities online?
  persid: S05
- desc: don't just sue websites left right and centre for your unsecure behaivor
  persid: S06
- desc: I think the difficulty with this is that claim rights and liberty rights interact
    with each other in really unclear ways and it is difficult to regulate them.
  persid: S07
- desc: In terms of online anyway.
  persid: S07
- desc: Since the internet gives us an access to information it should be our right
    to make clear informed decisions based on information gathered.
  persid: S31
- desc: not to threat anybody else's privacy or security.
  persid: S14
- desc: do proper citation? mayhaps
  persid: S06
- desc: We discussed about how the rights and responsibilities of an individual online
    depends on how the developers implements the system.
  persid: S30
- desc: cite from credible sources unlike the Onion
  persid: S06
- desc: Onion is a weird example considering they are intentionally satiricle
  persid: S13
- desc: The developers must punish racist ideologies
  persid: S06
- desc: Just because there is no jurisdiction doesn't mean we should not have responsibilities
  persid: S09
- desc: I love the Onion, they make me practise my online trust of news
  persid: S06
- desc: You could ask the same question for in-person rights, why do we have them
    if the moral compass of everyone is different?
  persid: S24
- desc: We've also discussed that these rights and responsibilities online should
    depend and mirror the offline life.
  persid: S30
- desc: ^
  persid: S06
- desc: I don't go running around saying my address and my SIN
  persid: S06
- desc: Yessss that's a great point.
  persid: S07
- desc: I like that, Daryl
  persid: S07
- desc: We discussed the relationship and precedence between claim rights and liberty
    rights. Although we have liberty, there is a responsibility that supercedes this.
    So we have freedom of expression and speech online, but to what extent? We also
    need to have responsibility and regulation of hate speech, cyberbullying, and
    so on. So then we need to ask where this regulation comes from/how it will be
    enforced. Will online speech be regulated by governments, committees of people,
    or bots, for example? Also, can this regulation even be implemented in the current
    systems in place, or do we have to redefine and restructure the systems altogether?
  persid: S17
- desc: your sin number is the amount of money you have, how rich are you, xD
  persid: S21
- desc: I have, its interesting
  persid: S26
- desc: Which documentary, sorry? I missed it.
  persid: S07
- desc: The social dilemma on netflix
  persid: S26
- desc: Its a great documentary
  persid: S09
- desc: I really liked that video on "Remaking the Internet" for that reason, how
    he talked about how negative stimuli are cheaper.
  persid: S07
- desc: Honestly that set of videos made me want to throw my phone in the garbage
    lol
  persid: S07
- desc: what was that quote..."what I want to see is what I will see" something like
    that...
  persid: S06
- desc: privacy is a right
  persid: S06
- desc: Privacy is a civil right
  persid: S07
- desc: We mainly discussed privacy rights in our group.  Given the current state
    of the internet, I personally think it's safe to assume that you really don't
    have any privacy rights at all when posting online, or at least theyre being violated.  Basically
    everything can be tracked or recorded without your knowledge. However, there should
    be protections to protect privacy rights. Using something like a VPN can be used
    to help protect yourself, however
  persid: S26
- desc: you can however choose how much privacy you want
  persid: S06
- desc: '....one day...'
  persid: S06
- desc: I think the user is still accountable to whether how much of their privacy
    rights they want to give up online
  persid: S30
- desc: +1 Maria
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah, i'm not sure that there is transparency on how those settings protect
    your information
  persid: S07
- desc: true...
  persid: S06
- desc: do your best to protect yourself regardless
  persid: S06
- desc: often times things are set up with full permissions and you have to go in
    and change them on your own
  persid: S07
- desc: and if it's hidden in a deep submenu it's difficult for you to find or even
    know of its existence
  persid: S07
- desc: Thanks Daryl! Great class.
  persid: S07
