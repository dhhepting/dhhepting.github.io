Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Hello. how's everyone doing today. Little rushed around i'm trying to organize.
    An event and. I want to get your input on that. Never a dull moment around here,
    it seems. So we have an alumnus from the University of Regina. did his bachelor
    series grow. warning me raised in China. He said NASA and he's in charge of. robotics
    division Program. So there's a. wired article from July when perseverance was
    launched. To talk about building a self driving car from Mars. His name is Larry
    massey's and. So he's like he's agreed to do a zoom seminar for us. So he was
    he was here in 2004. So you don't remind remember 2004. Like I do but anyway,
    he was here giving a battlefield lecture. Which is. Now we have the science public
    lecture. anyway. started the science public lecture. To replace it. So he came
    to talk about in the earlier. Mars Rover mission. Anyway, so it's time to have
    him back. semester. Ninth and after April 9. i'll try to make it a weekday evening.
    Okay, so i'd like your input on that. Okay, so still waiting for about. 15 people
    to reply to the pole so goodness 30 seconds. Okay. 30 seconds we're still waiting
    for a few people but. i'm going to end the poll now. Okay, so. Have a slight preference
    for before March 29. So, looking at the calendar. i'd say about. That last full
    week of full week of March. So we need to pick a date between the 22nd in the
    25th of March that's a Monday to Friday Monday to Thursday sorry. And we'll try
    and have it at the same. 7pm. time slot in the evening. I can ask. One more question.
    Okay, so i'm making a multiple choice multiple. Answer vote for as many days as
    you like. But it's that week march 22 to the 25th. Now, where did it go. keen
    on Friday, because that's just. included. ready now. 30 seconds. Okay, so any
    6% of you voted. i'm going to end the call. So Tuesday, is the least popular day
    and Wednesday is. This edging out Monday, as the most popular. So i'll just take
    this information and. Oh, see what his availability is like. So let's let's see
    evening, going to be like well introduce the speaker. and Then we'll talk for
    I don't know. 45 minutes or so 45 minutes to an hour and then they'll be some
    live question and answer. So he'll, be it won't be like Dave palmer's talk, because
    it will you won't have a pre recorded talk don't do that live. preference. Speaking
    of Dave Palmer Let me give you. A promise video. Okay, that should be the. link
    to the first seminar with Dave Palmer the guy who created windows task manager.
    So I edited that video on my MAC. Some of the bloopers from the live meeting.
    anyway. What the idea would be for. This talk by Larry massey. So thank you for
    your input about scheduling it. no guarantees that they would come up with all
    natural we've talked about here. Data point. I tried to keep up with email on
    the questions about the assignment but. seemed like most people got it in Okay,
    in the end. And the marker and I will be understanding, if there are some issues
    and. So it will be in touch with you about things that need to be clarified okay.
    So I put up the second blog. Entry description. And, as anyone had a chance to
    look at it yeah. Okay, so anyway i'm open to some clarification, yet about this
    so maybe we can just. Let me, let me share my screen and then we'll get to. OK
    so. The details are writing. well. This paragraph that. describes what i'd like
    you to discuss in your second blog post. So that deals with.
  persid: DHH
- desc: me.
  persid: ???
- desc: Upholding are defending the public interest to public good and examines how
    to define it in a practical way. sedation code of ethics says that the code. gurus
    principles formulated a statement of responsibility, based on the understanding
    that the public good, is always the primary consideration. Now. I have a link
    there to Defense distributed anyone heard of Defense distributed before. Not so
    much in the news of present, I think. They created some 3D printer files for a
    gun. I can't remember a single shot. gun and. So that was their claim to fame.
    and interest in the Department of Justice in the States. I think that case is
    dropped. And now, they have some. they're involved with. cnc. devices to do some.
    parts. and so on. So I remember hearing. cody Wilson, who is the founder of that.
    Company, who is talking about. Their work being in the public interest. and It
    seems like there are lots of people who companies who would say that. Their work
    is in the public interest. But maybe. Maybe they benefit from the. idea of. or
    a lack of a clear definition of what the public interest or the public good, is.
    So i'm not saying you have to look at. That company. Or that history that particular
    story for your blog post that. Something where. claim or. The claim is being made.
    Public the public good, is being. placed with highest importance. And then, then
    to explore what what what is it what they meant what that. What definition of
    the public good, is implied there. isn't really in in the interest of the public
    good. So find an example of a claim that the public good, is is a primary is the
    primary consideration and critically examine that claim. Further than we can.
    discuss and clarify is required. There is a there is an ongoing discussion about
    Facebook in Australia. Seen seen in the news. So a version of this is. The Australian
    Government is trying to. pass legislation that would. not allow Facebook to scrape.
    Australia news sites. free of charge. And then have. Mark Zuckerberg make more
    money. To have them pay for that content. So that the local media ecosystem in
    Australia is supported. So in Canada there's similar. Like legislation being.
  persid: DHH
- desc: contemplated.
  persid: ???
- desc: So it seems like. they're talking about some people were. Saying. Rupert Murdoch
    is. Trying to keep us stake in the industry, and it was about. Protecting the
    little guy. So I thought we could do a little breakout session here for 10 minutes.
    To discuss. Ideas around Facebook. Is Facebook. The bad guy here are the. Okay
    yeah i'll do attendance in a second here. thanks for the reminder. Mention is
    that. Facebook removed Australian. News content from the site. So Facebook users
    couldn't. can share news stories, but then it wasn't always just about news, it
    was about. Public health information was also unavailable. So related so think
    about that is also related is the question of free. I think, because I listened
    to. ads on TV. comment about already proposed to replace them. Can. anyway. Everything
    is being proposed to be. free to the consumer, all these like. sell your home
    via home it's all free. Everything is free. Now is that the model. says, this
    is a sustainable model. When it comes to. news on the Internet. Talk about. Facebook
    and free. there's legislation being prepared in Canada. i'm not sure the details
    have been released, yet it's still being worked out. Okay, so is that seem clear
    enough. Okay i'm going to. Do breakout rooms now. Okay i'm opening the rooms now.
    For 10 minutes we'll get back. here. Okay, so do you want to share some of the
    interesting things that were going on. New breakout rooms, either in chat or.
    With the whole group with microphones. So what is the hardest subject. Okay, serving
    see the password for the. attendance. Any comments about Facebook discussion.
    centers encouraged.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That um I think you read a little bit that there was a backlash and Facebook
    restored the. News articles or something like that, but it didn't day it's going
    to happen again like Facebook has not learned their lesson. Most of the time,
    all these backlashes are kind of pointless because we're just gonna keep doing
    it.
  persid: S02
- desc: renews a proprietary platform to. enable our communication. it's not. We don't
    have the same relationship with telephone providers and. Maybe. The Facebook situations,
    a bit like the power outage in Texas. Is you don't have public accountability,
    we have private companies.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But on the other hand, Facebook, is a private company, so in a way, they kind
    of are allowed to do what they want, with their system. Like. Like. Like the only
    thing that we can really do is basically go cool you're allowed to do that, but
    we just want us anymore and we'll make our own system so. yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: I noticed, for example, the CBC or. Well, not, not a single to CBC but. They
    make use of Facebook. And, to me it seems like the public broadcaster should not
    be using private. platforms like that. Then we know some complicated issues, I
    guess, in terms of. Managing. Managing the accessibility and. Providing platforms
    that are always. And then, if we don't. We don't require them to be. used because
    they're all these different options, then. Will they be enough uptake to. Keep.
    Keep the public platforms. open and. Relevant. So it's not an easy issue. well.
    Bad. Anyway, thanks for your concern. didn't sleep last night. At the coffee's
    not strong enough today i'm not sure. My apologies. So let's talk about the project
    proposal on the project. project is. So originally in the class some years ago.
    2010 or so and I started. There was an essay. group project. combination of them.
    So you can, if you're interested in doing a research paper. You can do that. But
    you can also do a book review. You can contribute something to Wikipedia. Creating
    promotes online content. Like a video blog or a podcast. You can picture yourself
    as a competing professional. and So I had something particular in mind there.
    In the sense of finding pictures of. People who would inspire you to as a competing
    professional. and talking about. The connection, you have with that person or
    persons. So you can also discuss your contributions to an open source project.
    Where you could write some code to test, an idea. So the question of small groups.
    So let's say. Since we have a large class. five people in the group. So you don't
    have to have five, but you can have up to five. So I can give you some examples.
    One from a couple years ago as weapons of mass destruction. And they don't have
    this math myth. So what would be the topic to discuss well the idea would be.
    to explore something that's of interest to you. relate to the class name so it's.
    Something that's connected. To the. Knowledge units were discussing. give you.
    Okay, so. Yes, you can be less than five in the group. Yes, I did say that I thought
    thanks. for that. Okay. The idea is. To give you a range of choices to. deeply
    consider some. Some topic related to class. and I didn't I don't want to close.
    The door and your creativity. So you're writing blog to blog posts so. I see I
    figure. That, if you and. you've got some writing in, and if you want to do more,
    reading, you can. In some different ways. In the proposal. You just outline what
    you're going to. Work on. You give a plan. Put in here. So one mark, so the topic.
    OK, so the way. Instead of. doing the group thing ahead of time. Well, you know
    the group. So stick with my first thing instead of doing the group's ahead of
    time. If you have. Your you make up a group for the project and you. clearly indicate
    the group members. On your submission, so you only need to submit one copy. Then
    we'll make up the groups based on. The submissions. That make sense. Okay, so.
    Take a look at that resource and all are given it. will make an addition to the.
    To the assignment description in terms of a sample. For your proposal okay. So
    I don't have one. And two the link to at the moment, but all create one. And we
    can talk about it. On Thursday, if needed. Okay. Okay anything else. That, I may
    have neglected or you have questions about. Today, so. 230 to 330. So. I investigated
    my issues with zoom and office. Do you know where to find the schedule. So let
    me. Go to. My office hours link. That can you see where i'm pointing at. i'm not
    there all the time, so here's my schedule. So today's Tuesday. And then I have
    an officer is gone hits the button. Yes, the proposal is one or two pages. Okay,
    and this should also link you to the meeting. I click on the link here. i'm not
    gonna leave the class. Back to. The knowledge units. yeah I thanks Nicholas that's
    what I was gonna say the knowledge units or the discussions. Why stop at font
    size 3070 or 100 and. Some. So that would not be the. spirit of one to two pages,
    so one to two pages and 12 point. Now, with. crazy timelines facing or. or very
    quiet and narrow margins and small tiny face but. You could do a. Little say single
    space. And default margins whatever editor using. say the word limit, so I don't
    know. yeah. I said pages so. You know when. So the reason i'm talking about the.
    size of the. Or the lines facing in the tightness of the margins and. So on is
    because when you give a. Page limit. And people want to write as much as they
    can they. Can they. can fill in the details as much as possible, so every nook
    and cranny. So i'm not. i'm not trying to. i'm not going to entertain this discussion
    anymore, since it's 1246 so i'm going to say goodbye for today. And we'll we'll
    talk about similar things. and we'll go through the. Is a video about self judgment.
    That I didn't get to publish before class today so i'll do that. afternoon and
    see you on Thursday. Take care everyone stay well.

  persid: S29
- desc: what do you use kmaps for in 340?
