Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. dropped out and restarted on me. Maybe that's a sign that we
    shouldn't do too much today, or maybe that's an April fool's. prank. zoom. Stick
    around. I found some resources. An acm website for. professionalism that I thought
    might be interesting to. To have a look at. Do the attendance here, first of all
    let me get sorted out here. Okay, so I thought I would share this. Little six
    minute video it's from the states, of course, but. Maybe it's. interesting and
    useful. For us today. Okay, so it should have sound being shared as well. six
    minutes long. unmuted. That sounds so boring seriously if you're a founder executive
    or worker in the tech industry, then your work is likely covered by one or more
    codes of ethics lack of familiarity with the codes. can have serious financial
    and legal consequences for you and your business now, the first thing you should
    know is that there are two main professional organizations that cover the tech
    industry.
  persid: DHH
- desc: acm Association for computing machinery and I Tripoli, the Institute for electronics
    electrical and electronics engineers between them, the acm and the ieee sponsor
    most of the conferences scholarly publications journals.They set curriculum standards
    and they set the code of conduct for people that are working in computer science
    computer engineering software engineering and electrical engineering.So that the
    acm I and the ieee each have their own code of ethics and they've also jointly
    collaborated on the code of ethics for software engineering, so if you're practicing
    software engineer, for example.You might be a bit surprised by some of the things
    that are in here principle one software engineers shall act consistently with
    the public interest.I mean really That was the first principle of the software
    engineering code of ethics and professional practice so everything that software
    engineer does every day is supposed to be consistent with the public interest
    should be in your mind all the time.software engineers show assist colleagues
    and professional development.
  persid: ???
- desc: So does your employer help pay for you to attend conferences or to increase
    your technical or leadership skills, did you know that the code of ethics says
    that they're supposed to do that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: also got some some mail, these are sort of frequent objections, I hear about
    the code of ethics, so this one was sent in.from New York in 1919 I guess.So.Dear
    Bo stop wasting my time come back when these are laws not codes well i've got
    some bad news for you, even though there isn't really any law in the US that requires
    adherence to these codes.they're trying to find their way into some court case
    you might remember the Oracle versus Google case.Oracle was suing Google because
    Google had copied some Java api's into the android operating system at trial Google
    argued that it was fair use but oracle's lawyers snapback deciding the acm.code
    of ethics and professional conduct violations of copyrights patents trade secrets
    and the terms of license agreements is prohibited by law in most circumstances.Even
    when software is not so protected such violations are contrary to professional
    behavior copies of software should be made only with proper authorization unauthorized
    duplication of materials must not be condemned.So.let's do another one here.See
    here, dear Dr brinkman you've convinced me to cancel my memberships and that acm
    ieee.Okay yeah I mean I hear that idea, but while it's true that the acm ieee
    can't enforce the codes of ethics against.People that aren't members of the acm
    and I Tripoli.You know, when a big professional organization creative code of
    ethics and publishes it out in the world.The public and the courts tend to see
    that as a statement of the conscience of the profession, you know, so you know
    we saw in the Google case.The Oracle versus Google case that even though the the
    people that were involved in that case may or may not have been acm members, the
    lawyers for Oracle clearly considered the acm code of ethics to apply.To the Google
    engineers that were involved in that case.So one last postcard here depot if there
    aren't any laws regulating our conduct, why did our professional organizations
    waste all this time, creating.burdensome regulations on us okay two points, first
    of all, I mean these rules are intended to be.The basis of self regulation, you
    know sort of the philosophy of regulation of the professions is that if we do
    a good job of regulating ourselves then hopefully we'll avoid some more burdensome
    regulation.from outside forces so that's part of it, but also, you know, these
    rules are also meant to help workers, stand up for what's ethically right.If they're
    in a situation where.they're under pressure to do something that's incorrect,
    you know, for example, I have a recent.op ED here from the New York Times.So here.
  persid: ???
- desc: If apple employees refused to perform the software engineering tasks that
    would be necessary to provide the FBI with access to the contents of an iPhone
    used by one of the shooters in the December mass killings in San Bernardino California
    their decision would be explicitly. wasn't just you. Okay, so let me. I got bumped
    out again. screen share. So we're not going to watch the whole thing again just
    give me a second here. Okay let's watch from here. Oh, did I not have this sound
    on for the last bit. I see lots of chat messages. yeah okay. Let me try and get.
    again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: gonna continue.apple to unlock that phone.So what I hope you take away from
    this video is that, regardless of what career stage you're at or what role you
    play if you're in a tech industry.Then acm code of ethics I Tripoli code of ethics
    and the joint ieee acm software engineering code of ethics.are going to have an
    impact on your business, and if you want to find out more about them or read the
    full code of ethics, you can go to http ethics dot acm dot O rg.And you could
    also like and share this video that would help us and, if you want more materials
    that will help you discuss ethical issues with your co workers or with.Your boss,
    then just subscribe, the Committee on professional ethics is going to continue
    to create new videos and new materials over the course of the next couple years.
  persid: ???
- desc: So who appreciated his sense of humor. This the hands in his face at the end
    and. The postcard from 1919. yeah So this was made in. I think 2016. and yeah
    it's not been a tidal wave of new material since then. This is her look at the
    integrity projects YouTube channel. So don't forget. soon as crash twice and then
    since we've and meeting. And I forgot to turn the audio on once. So that's why
    it's taken. The time. For a six minute video. OK so. The fact that this is the
    video you just watched it four years ago and there's 3.1 page views. And hundred
    57 subscribers to the acm. Ethics integrity project. 757 K subscribers.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just.
  persid: ???
- desc: Just noticing that. Maybe has a bit of a popularity problem. Go ahead Keegan.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um I think one of his arguments was fundamentally flawed when he said that
    Oracle brought up the code of ethics in their battle against Google. The problem
    with, that is, you can bring bring up anything in a court case right you just
    basically throw on everything and see what sticks with the judge so just because
    we brought it up doesn't mean that it's has any legal basis. So my problem with
    this is if you're asking people about ethics and not like Okay, I agree, we should
    all be ethical, but if there's no actual law stating how you should act well anybody
    that act on ethically it's easier to get. Through most businesses and stuff in
    like our society so when you're looking at it if there's no actual law guiding
    that then everybody who's unethical will slowly push out. All the ones that are
    ethical because they won't be able to make as much money, so their businesses
    will go under, so as soon as you don't actually have it as a law, I feel like.
    It doesn't really matter.
  persid: S02
- desc: So I think okay fair point. But I think, also the common wasn't that it wasn't.
    They weren't forming the basis of decisions but. They were being mentioned in
    court cases in it, the next step would be for them to be. cited as. An authority
    in in those decisions. So it's not it's not yet there but. yeah. Gaining some
    traction. People start to. to acknowledge it then. it's playing a bigger role
    in the conversation. i'm not defending. i'm not saying that. i'm not disagreeing
    with your point Keegan it's just. I think it's it's different how they. serve
    on a continuum of being. Granted, more authority. That makes sense. Okay. So there's
    lots of different codes here so there's the code of ethics for kicks. And the
    ieee and. ECM and software engineering code of ethics and. So there are many different
    versions of this, so I think what the takeaway is not. Is not to. diminish. Not
    to say well there's, no, no agreement about particular code of ethics, so I can.
    Because there's no agreement then there's. No comment concepts. shouldn't be bound
    by anything. However, we look at the code of ethics codes of ethics. You see there's
    lots of overlap, so the kips ethics. We looked at the other day. A little bit.
    let's see if I can. So the first principle in the kips statement to protect the
    public interest in privacy of information. I invite people to. Use audio me instead
    of trying to read through the chat and keep track of things. Okay. I wanted to
    just. show some these other what else is on this YouTube channel. So recommended
    viewing for the integrity project. The ethical dilemma of self driving cars. Stanford
    set so it's four minutes and 16 seconds that's a Ted ED video. Stanford seminar
    on Oracle vs Google Java eight our API is copyrightable that's an hour and 15
    minutes. And then there's a story about hackers remotely kill a jeep. On a highway.
    And then there's another. minute and so video about quarter inch across the nation
    or using a computer program to protect. Who will. be a feature criminal. there's
    a resource if you're interested. Okay, so. These. pages are not very well maintained,
    I think. So there's a couple. Items here both vulnerability disclosure and software.
    And then grey hat hacking. But there's also some case studies. i'll put this link
    in the chat. Let me look for some other places here. See if we get any other better
    hit on. The on professional ethics. We have a microphone on the SME to say.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Go ahead.
  persid: ???
- desc: breakout rooms, based on. The case studies here. So. Make. Bigger rooms like
    I did last time, the larger size. And we'll take 10 minutes. And then we'll. we'll
    take it from there after 10 minutes okay. So clear enough. Okay. So it seems like
    everyone's back now. To set a good discussion.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It was OK.
  persid: S03
- desc: OK.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think I had some troubles reading the article I was reading. Can you do
    it, she would you explained a little bit more what it was about can I do for like
    more context.

  persid: S07

  persid: S04

  persid: S05

  persid: S16
- desc: there's no sound from the screen share this time
  persid: S11
- desc: no audio
  persid: S17
- desc: no audio
  persid: S06
- desc: can't hear
  persid: S18
- desc: I liked this video, very concise with the ethics
  persid: S07
- desc: I liked it too. Prof, what would you say is the code of ethics CS professionals
    should follow? Theres at least 3 that have been mentioned in class
  persid: S05
- desc: He says they're going to make more videos at the end but this is the only
    video on the channel. :(
  persid: S04
- desc: Shoot I missed the start of class. As a short list, what have I missed for
    context?
  persid: S19
- desc: I think CS Ethics is like early Babylon. A ruler finally made the first Constitution
    that everyone followed
  persid: S07
- desc: first law "An eye for an eye"
  persid: S07
- desc: '@Philip we''ve basically only watched the video on screen'
  persid: S05
- desc: Philip, there's a video on the Mtg 22 page of the CS 280 website that you
    missed
  persid: S04
- desc: Thank1
  persid: S19
- desc: Thanks!
  persid: S19
- desc: maybe that's why he did that at the end lol
  persid: S10
- desc: Hahaha :) And I slept in after a late night for the 476 project
  persid: S19
- desc: Great start
  persid: S19
- desc: Yeah there isn't much reach regarding these code of ethics
  persid: S11
- desc: I'd say clearly ethics is undervalued in tech lol
  persid: S05
- desc: I thought an interesting point was that the codes aren't legally enforceable,
    but they are in place to help a professional to avoid breaking the law.
  persid: S20
- desc: if it affects the case or had any value in that particular case, it sets a
    precedent for future cases
  persid: S21
- desc: CS Ethics is like Jurrassic Park kinda, We are concerned if we can and not
    how we should.
  persid: S07
- desc: "I LOVE the new respond to meetings. Very clear what\u2019s expected, and\
    \ the list of meeting numbers is broken up to include due dates and \u2018submitted\u2019\
    \ status. Thank you."
  persid: S19
- desc: '@levi IF that''s a big if seeing as a lot of judges don''t understand tech'
  persid: S02
- desc: I mean, the case is out there, I'm surprised he didn't mention the affect
    that the code of ethics had on that confrontation
  persid: S21
- desc: I also don't think you need to be particularly familiar with tech to know
    about fair use and the ethics of behind some of those "rules"
  persid: S21
- desc: I think CS professionals should promote their ethics like the Hippocratic
    Oath
  persid: S07
- desc: ^^ The Hippocratic Oath also wasn't universally accepted at first
  persid: S04
- desc: What ever Dr. Mengele did, don't! XD
  persid: S07
- desc: I mean @levi I would argue for the finer points you do. If you look at how
    the senate interrogated zuckurger none of them knew what was wrong with what he
    did. How can you make laws if you don't understand the problem
  persid: S02
- desc: Does this mean Facebook is violating the very first CIPS code of ethics and
    standard of conduct?
  persid: S17
- desc: Ye, since its conception it was a troublesome child
  persid: S07
- desc: did we do attendance?
  persid: S22
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S23
- desc: pngky8
  persid: S17
- desc: thanks!
  persid: S22
- desc: Thats a very good point @Keegan, but I believe a major part of these codes
    are to separate tech from their ethics and to make clear, using terms lawmakers
    might understand, the problems like what zuck did
  persid: S21
- desc: the problems with what Zuckerberg did*
  persid: S21
- desc: Yeah for sure but even a senator said they weren't going to do anything about
    it in the interview which is more concerning
  persid: S02
- desc: maybe thats why the code of ethics needs to hold more weight, legally
  persid: S21
- desc: So do they still not understand or are they apathetic?
  persid: S02
- desc: Oh I agree that was my earlier point.
  persid: S02
- desc: https://ethics.acm.org/integrity-project/case-studies/
  persid: DHH
- desc: Last year the US senate kept asking the Zucc and the Twitter CEO how to do
    the social media things and not really anything actually important like changing
    the outdated DMCA laws
  persid: S07
- desc: Well, I dont think you can bash the argument from the video that the code
    of ethics are trying to become more legally binding
  persid: S21
- desc: He never said that in the video. All he said was it is important because Oracle
    brought it up in a court case which is not true.
  persid: S02
- desc: Bringing it up it court shows how it can be though. Its significant that it
    was a part of such a large case, it would be even more important if it affected
    such a case in a meaningful way. I dont think it did tho or he would have mentioned
    it lol
  persid: S21
- desc: 'breakout room: pick a case study from https://ethics.acm.org/integrity-project/case-studies/
    and discuss'
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can and is are very different. Normative things aren't relative in court battles
  persid: S02
- desc: relevant*
  persid: S02
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S05
- desc: I thought the point he was making in the video was how the code of ethics
    could one day become something more than normative
  persid: S21
- desc: and how showing up in court was an example of it getting there
  persid: S21
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: DHH
- desc: "that\u2019s my interpretation"
  persid: DHH
- desc: GOOD discussion?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S24
- desc: yup
  persid: S07
- desc: Yeah
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes, but a bit too short
  persid: S25
- desc: Took a little while to read up on the article and decide though
  persid: S05
- desc: "Longer might\u2019ve been nice for time to read and discuss"
  persid: S26
- desc: it was very straight forward, "don't make heart pacer Bluetooth enabled"
  persid: S07
- desc: A picture of the website design in question would have been helpful as it
    was difficult to visualize from the article's description
  persid: S20
- desc: It reminds me of when you go to download a program or media and there will
    be an ad that says DOWNLOAD that's for a completely different thing, but you are
    more likely to click the ad rather than the proper download button because the
    ad is more flashy.
  persid: S04
- desc: and making the X the smallest thing in the universe
  persid: S07
- desc: I wish I could Alt F4 that sh*t
  persid: S07
- desc: and then you press X it redirects to another website
  persid: S16
- desc: ^I swear this enrages me so much!
  persid: S11
- desc: Get an ad blocked extension^
  persid: S27
- desc: was a kid back then ^
  persid: S16
- desc: I wish the ad was the tiniest thing on the planet and the X is average or
    bigger...
  persid: S07
- desc: I like ads with a big X...mmm...
  persid: S07
- desc: literally force quitting because of the avalanche of ads hahaha. the internet
    was a dangerous place in the 90s
  persid: S04
- desc: facebook is worse than those tho. selling my data and showing me god knows
    how much ads
  persid: S16
- desc: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0
  persid: S07
- desc: I swear every time I talk about something an ad for that exact item appears
    within minutes
  persid: S27
- desc: ^ same
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah! why?
  persid: S07
- desc: the internet needs a patch fix?
  persid: S07
- desc: understandable, they read your data and sugest products
  persid: S16
- desc: Starlink taking up all the bandwidth
  persid: S02
- desc: but how does wish algorithm actually works
  persid: S16
- desc: I never searched for those
  persid: S16
- desc: the matrix is going through maintenance...
  persid: S07
- desc: "Ahahah wish\u2019s algorithm is on something that is forsure"
  persid: S27
