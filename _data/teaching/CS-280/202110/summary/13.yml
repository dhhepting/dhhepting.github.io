- desc: morning everybody. In a. meeting with. tech and. tech and innovation saskatchewan
    vote. And well round table for discussion technology. And how. To. Hello. Please
    again. No direct messages. In the chat. So what happened at the round table and.
    interesting discussions. We had we had somebody. From Mike another. Microsoft
    employee from scratch and give it participate in. giving us. an overview of the
    situation and cheerleading for scratch one. So i'm going to talk about the project,
    and so on. So to just as a nod to some of the things going on the chat. So we
    talked about a little talked a little bit of data, science and machine learning
    and Ai and empathy. Is a soft skills that people need to have. And we talked about
    democratizing technology. Which is interesting juxtaposition now that your talk
    about technology being incompatible is democracy. Any thoughts about that. So
    that. So that's RON he say. So. Referring to the articles about. Facebook being
    incompatible Walker see. We discussed the other day. So I used to talk about it,
    I used to think that democratization of blank is a good thing. But it's also not
    necessarily. it's not just about providing access to something it's about. Providing
    the tools for meaningful engagement. That are. that's important. So. it's not
    just providing the availability of the tools and so forth, but it's. Providing
    meaningful access to these things that's the key. So as i'm concerned. it's not
    you're not democratizing things by. letting people fill out things. themselves
    or take responsibility for filling out things themselves. And they don't necessarily
    have the background or the. knowledge or the details to. To. To understand what
    they're doing and. democratization of technology can sometimes be a euphemism
    for. offloading work to somebody else. Say hey I can do all the stuff myself online.
    Then that's just another job that you have to do for yourself online. So. that's
    a potential pitfall, not to say that. everything's bad everything's. Just like
    i'm not trying to say everything's good. We have to think critically about these
    things that's my point. Okay, so. Let me first do the attendance. Share screen.
    passwords repeating character. password. places won't. allow you to have repeated
    characters like that. Even though well repeated characters have some value. that's
    a beat us to death because they know you're just talking about the difference
    between. pipe and an L and one. And so, this is how. You can make. Your you look.
    Look legitimate that there's some differences. Different different URLs that look
    the same for phishing attacks. Okay, anyway. attendance is handled. So I just
    wanted to talk about. The blog entries and the project proposal and due dates.
    I feel like maybe. Okay, so. You first look at due dates. So. We had some confusion
    with submitting. Yes, and i'll talk about the project proposal okay. So i'm just
    wondering if. So we don't run into the due date for the second blog entry. And
    so you get the feedback from the first blog entry before submitting the second
    one. We push back the. Second blog entry. Okay. So I know we make second blog
    entry the 18th. And the project proposals you on the 11th. That be okay. Let me
    make a poll for that. Okay, so give another minute for people to reply. Okay.
    Any. Anyone like to share. Anyone who said no, would like to share a comment about
    why. I don't want to put anyone on the spot, but. Around but i'm. Welcome to be.
    just trying to give a bit more flexibility. I will be i'm i'm okay with keeping
    them in the same. The same as well. Okay, so. You have a good more time if you
    need it. The empathy map stuff is not connected to the blog post. Okay, so i've
    seen some. Some shortcomings in my description of the project proposal. Because
    I mentioned things in the rubric that I don't mention in the description. So the
    idea is that you're going to pick another topic a different topics and you. notice
    in your blog post. or a different angle on the topic. and you're going to have
    the option to do a research paper, if you like. might be tired of doing research
    papers and just writing. Not just writing writing isn't your thing my life to
    do some other things. Maybe you'd like to do a book review. contributes to knowledge
    to Wikipedia. Creative and promotes an online content and video or blog. That
    you yourself as a continuing professional. This idea they're being as. to identify
    some professional competing professionals with whom you identify or aspire, who
    are role models for you. You can contribute to an open source project and discuss
    your contributions. write some code to test, an idea. So when I said, making a
    video. And doesn't have to be a live action camera. Video it could be a recording
    of a. slide presentation. And I encourage you to put that onto YouTube or something
    like that. I don't have to do YouTube. And there's a way to do it to our local
    video gallery. And the media space we have set up at the University of Regina.
    possibility. Okay, so if you change your put your project idea after you've written
    the proposal. I guess that's. that's possible. But I would encourage you to think
    about. The table here, I said three marks. change it to. I didn't change the three
    marks, but I did to five marks here. Okay, so what you should cover in your. new
    proposals you describe the coffee you're going to deal with. You don't have to
    present a lot of details that. indicate how the topic is you raise the class.
    And then the deliverable and the rationale. So. Which what form, are you. Trying
    to. Are you choosing one of these in the list or are you keeping. Are you identifying
    some other. deliverable. For your project and then why have you chosen that deliverable.
    And then you make a plan. What you're going to do. And if you're doing this with
    a group, then you should have your plan broken down. Amongst your group members.
    So. Your project can change. Maybe account for that little bit. Okay, so I said,
    one or two pages, maybe it's one page. But it should have these two pieces, so
    you should talk about why you've chosen. The topic you've chosen and indication
    of how it relates to class. What you're doing. yeah so you can do this by yourself.
    Or you can do it in groups of up to five people. So. i'll add these notes to the
    description of the project. Later today. So, what are you going to choose to do,
    and why have you chosen. And then, how are you planning to do it. i'm just reading
    the comments here. So. And the group gets a mark. So you can give feedback about
    your group members. That can. differentiate. can differentiate the greats. And
    i'm. Considering the group. Feedback as a way to indicate. Whether the groups
    are. functioning properly so i'd rather that you talk to me forehand about a group.
    issue. then wait till the end of the Semester and give me feedback on the project.
    That makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor I was just thinking so if it's a group project like suppose I have
    two or three people in my group are we all supposed to submit a project proposal,
    one of the person going to do it.
  persid: S01
- desc: So the way you can do it is just to. submit one and that one submission indicate
    the other people in your group.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So just write your. name and user ID on top of it, and I should do.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah see can you. see an example here. Because i've already i've made everyone
    into their own project groups of one person. So there's 146 of these groups. And
    everybody has one member in them. So. If you indicate there are going to be three
    people in your group. and You can see from your group. A group number like a group
    designation like that, so you can see projects. And it'll be one or two letters
    and calling the project work project. So it sorry for looking at one person in
    particular. So if you want to indicate the group. The group that you're in to
    begin with. That might be more helpful than putting the ID. and make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm just looking verse that group option in New York curses, though.
  persid: S01
- desc: So, if you look at your profile. At the bottom, the profile. You don't need
    to. list the group members, the Members in your project you don't have a new project
    group. Knowing. The group of people, I need to submit one proposal and then we'll
    we'll change the project groups to reflect the submissions of the project proposal.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, so that's making sure oh sorry go ahead.
  persid: S02
- desc: So if you have people. In groups A, B and C. And Kirsten and Kobe submissive
    proposal. Then we'll do is just move the people from groups B and C into green
    Bay, so a green Bay will have three people in it. make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So just making sure I understand here would it be acceptable if what we did
    is we just on the proposal itself, we put each group members name and student
    number one person submits it and then. You will change the groups to match with
    the proposal says.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yes. So get rid of the extra. group, so in that my example a group A, B and
    C. So people are in there's one person in a in groups each group of a B and C.
    Then, based on the year proposal submitted. Then there'll be three people in group
    a and group B and group see would be removed. So all three of those few people
    in your group in that initial. Proposal group would be project or put the in group
    a. And they're all in one group and group B nor. Nor group see would remain. Neither
    grew up in our group see would remain. After the proposal submitted. Am I making
    a better.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah that seems clear now, thank you.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay you're welcome. I will add those notes to the proposal. description today.
    and change the due date to. 11. Not that you have to use all the time until the
    11th. Okay. Any other questions about the proposal. Okay, so see no further questions.
    Leave that topic for. yeah yes so topics that are related to the class. So you
    need to pick the topic thats related to the class in some way. So we've talked
    about. Now. let's say that there are lots of topics and have connections to the
    class. To those knowledge units. To go into bit more detail, if you like, to look
    at those. topics on the. On the course page. learning outcomes. Okay, so you can
    actually come and talk to me. that's that's true. just looking at it i'm paraphrasing
    a comment in the chat. So for sales, you can talk to me I don't play, especially
    over zoom. So we ended last day with a list of fallacies. No i'm not suggesting
    that I bite in person. You know. who's that guy as far as. from Ecuador, the World
    Cup last time around. is known as a bite us know which bite. I might have those
    details around. But that's not me i'm not known for my bite. Nor have I bitten
    anybody. Okay i'm gonna call. Call into this line of discussion. So back to the
    fallacies. So. there's an argument. So I thought, maybe we'd have a breakout discussion
    about. Which ones you think are most. which ones are most popular. which ones
    are most dangerous. That seemed like a good discussion question. Okay, so. The
    fallacies which are the most popular which ones come. Which one come to mind was
    quickly. which ones are the most dangerous. Okay. breakout rooms for that. See
    you in 10 minutes. Okay, so everyone's back. Any comments on the discussion topic.
    The one is most popular or most dangerous.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So i'll go um I think. raise my hand. The worst is probably bandwagon, because
    the reason why is like most things in this world. If enough people agree on fan,
    it becomes quote unquote fact it whatever decisions are made, even if they're
    wrong they happen. there's no these people you just kidding break laws, because
    people go well you're wrong you're wrong like nothing, as far as well as the fallacy
    in some shape or form. If you have enough people, you can overcome it or the facts
    event to get through these more and more people can then information oh bandwagon.
    It kind of is basically a lot of people jumping on the same thing, and if that
    populations greater than the population that's right. Hopefully, they lose But
    until then they basically have power.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay again first. Then, David later.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um I would say the most common ones that I see especially nowadays mainly
    are like ad hominem or to quote Gray ones where it's basically just like oh you
    as a person or bad or or Oh, because you participate in this thing, that means
    that your argument is is wrong. And I think in general, those ones concern me
    a lot because they're not. good faith interpretations of other people it's really,
    really hard to have a conversation or a good discussion with someone if their
    intent on not looking at you in good faith, which means that that renders your
    arguments something they're not even going to listen to. So that that's always
    something that really worries me.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay. Good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just a really quick one I think a popular one is the sunk cost fallacy, especially
    with technology. Because. Even if technology or software is unsuccessful because
    so much money is invested into it already oftentimes it'll just keep going and
    more money will be poured into it, so I think that's a really common one tech.
  persid: S02
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: ???
- desc: Your status much so we can't just abandon it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Exactly yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
Zoom-Chat-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning :)
  persid: S02
- desc: Morning
  persid: S06
- desc: Good morning  :)
  persid: S01
- desc: good morning
  persid: S04
- desc: The sun is shing through...
  persid: S07
- desc: '*shining'
  persid: S07
- desc: Good morning
  persid: S08
- desc: Morning
  persid: S09
- desc: good morning
  persid: S10
- desc: morning~
  persid: S11
- desc: Good morning!
  persid: S12
- desc: Morning!
  persid: S13
- desc: what happened?
  persid: S10
- desc: SIr, about the project if I want to choose write 1000-1500 word research paper.
    What is the topic for this paper?  Is topic same as before blog1?
  persid: S09
- desc: that's wrong...
  persid: S07
- desc: Why are democracy and tech incompatable?
  persid: S14
- desc: What is the support for the argument?
  persid: S04
- desc: technology is like any other tool...
  persid: S07
- desc: Increased availability to tech is increased access to information, I'd say
    its the inverse of what an authoritarian regime would wan't.
  persid: S08
- desc: used for good of all, good, used for the benefit of some, bad
  persid: S07
- desc: Given, people are incredibly stupid, so it depends how it is used
  persid: S08
- desc: Technology is a tool that can be used, or abused, just like any other IMO
  persid: S02
- desc: Im curious to know what the points about that in the talk were
  persid: S02
- desc: If we're specifically talking about facebook, I'd agree with the statement
    that their current way of doing business is incompatible with democracy. I don't
    think that technology in general - or Facebook with a different set of priorities
    and restrictions - is inherently incompatible with democracy.
  persid: S15
- desc: I would technology 100% supports democracy; case in point being Wallstreet
    frenzy happening. Now finally retail investors are able to stand up against hedge
    funds thanks to technology
  persid: S06
- desc: I think maybe the rise of social media in general is such a relatively new
    thing in society that we're just now getting the hang of how to regulate it, and
    what kinds of threats (and benefits) can come along with it potentially.
  persid: S15
- desc: is that an i or L?
  persid: S07
- desc: L
  persid: S16
- desc: l
  persid: S17
- desc: L
  persid: S08
- desc: thx XD
  persid: S07
- desc: haha
  persid: S13
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: gonna make my new password as lIIIII or something like that
  persid: S18
- desc: throw in a | (absolute sign) as well for added fun
  persid: S13
- desc: well some are I and some are L
  persid: S18
- desc: and some are |
  persid: S18
- desc: Internet and social media were quite democratic in the way they empowered
    people. Problem is they empowered good as well as bad people equally. Case in
    point being how easy it has been to spread fake news by barrage of posts using
    army of fake accounts and gullible users. Censorship through noise as it is called
  persid: S19
- desc: l is larger than capital I
  persid: S16
- desc: https://xkcd.com/1105/ <-- relevant comic heheh
  persid: S04
- desc: lol nice
  persid: S02
- desc: I just encountered Vimeo.org recently
  persid: S20
- desc: The good old "You cant report me cause you can't find out how to spell my
    name" defence
  persid: S08
- desc: Keeps you safe drom the death note
  persid: S14
- desc: laughs in berutorudo
  persid: S18
- desc: or berthold, or boruto
  persid: S18
- desc: what's the topic for project, it's open topic or better to choose another
    topic in student blog topics?
  persid: S21
- desc: Can you please provide some more information about project proposal and how
    to write it? Should I just include what I am supposed to in project in project
    proposal?
  persid: S22
- desc: Can you please give a bit more information regarding project proposal like
    format,etc ?
  persid: S23
- desc: that would be great
  persid: S24
- desc: I would LOVE at least an extra week on the second blog
  persid: S02
- desc: Yes, same
  persid: S04
- desc: That would be great!
  persid: S16
- desc: ^ March 18th sounds great
  persid: S13
- desc: sounds good
  persid: S24
- desc: Even better! I needed some more time to research a good proposal
  persid: S13
- desc: yes please
  persid: S25
- desc: That sounds great, Thank you!
  persid: S16
- desc: sounds good
  persid: S26
- desc: Especially during midterm season a week means everything
  persid: S02
- desc: Thanks a bunch Dr.Hepting
  persid: S13
- desc: I'm still unsure about the topics for the project?
  persid: S27
- desc: If we make a project proposal, and upon working on it realize it isn't that
    practical, can we change our deliverable from the original proposal?
  persid: S08
- desc: then blog 3 is on 25 th
  persid: S28
- desc: I had uploaded my blog 1 submission and left it. I was under the impression
    it will be submitted automatically when it reaches due date.. but it did not I
    just noticed this morning so I clicked on submit.. Am I going to lose marks for
    this?
  persid: S19
- desc: so project proposal is on 11th?
  persid: S29
- desc: Sir, I still don't know  what the project topics..
  persid: S09
- desc: omg relax y'all he'll get to it
  persid: S04
- desc: "\U0001F602"
  persid: S27
- desc: lol
  persid: S26
- desc: what is the topic of the project?
  persid: S30
- desc: you just pick something that relates to course material
  persid: S31
- desc: "Dr. Hepting said he\u2019d talk about the project topics after discussing\
    \ the due dates"
  persid: S12
- desc: Project topic info now.. now now now..  :D
  persid: S19

- desc: okayokay thanks
  persid: S30
- desc: can I just pick a topics from knowledge unit from his website?
  persid: S09
- desc: He said he will get to it
  persid: S33
- desc: '@Maria azam but people only know that if they listen'
  persid: S14
- desc: like blog
  persid: S09
- desc: word limit for project
  persid: S34
- desc: hey he will let you know
  persid: S28
- desc: okay
  persid: S09
- desc: That's a pretty high majority
  persid: S02
- desc: whos the 3% who said no lol ?
  persid: S16
- desc: lol
  persid: S01
- desc: I just dont like constantly moving deadlines already planned around them so
    I dont see a point in changing them
  persid: S14
- desc: maybe they have supergift
  persid: S09
- desc: You can still write it as if it is due tomorrow though
  persid: S08
- desc: Then hand it in early. There is literally ZERO reason not to move deadlines
    back.
  persid: S35
- desc: Fair. When that happens I just pretend like the original deadline is there
  persid: S02
- desc: Thats just me Ill probably hand it in on original date and leave it
  persid: S14
- desc: I'm still going to binge write the whole thing til 3am Wednesday night as
    originally planned.
  persid: S08
- desc: blog 3 empathy map's due is on 25 th march, so it might be closer from 18th.
  persid: S28
- desc: need to prepare for my midterm on 4th, glad if the project proposal is a bit
    delayed
  persid: S18
- desc: yeah I have a midterm on 4th too
  persid: S27
- desc: I personally have a bunch of stuff due at once so pushing things a bit helps
    me out.
  persid: S04
- desc: lol, i'm already finished 2 midterm  last 2days
  persid: S09
- desc: same I have a midterm on the 4th as well
  persid: S36
- desc: i had 2 midterm on 4 march
  persid: S34
- desc: this week have too many midterm to do
  persid: S30
- desc: cs330?
  persid: S09
- desc: ok
  persid: S28
- desc: That extra time is awesome, thank you professor
  persid: S02
- desc: '210'
  persid: S27
- desc: it will help us with a little more time
  persid: S28
- desc: Thank you for extending he deadline.
  persid: S22
- desc: i had 4 midterms
  persid: S22
- desc: the research paper  is for proposal or project?
  persid: S09
- desc: It's an option for the project. The proposal is only supposed to be 1-2 pages
    to describe what you want to do.
  persid: S04
- desc: "Research paper is one of the things you can do. It\u2019s all on his webiste"
  persid: S33
- desc: okay, I got it
  persid: S09
- desc: thx
  persid: S09
- desc: Can our project proposal differ from our actual project if we find it not
    feasible to accomplish?
  persid: S08
- desc: Sorry if I'm repeating but does the proposal need to be 1-2 pages? Because
    if the research paper only has to be 1000-1500 words, wouldn't that be excessive?
  persid: S06
- desc: does it have to be team work or solo is fine?
  persid: S18
- desc: Solo is fine, Rhythm. Group is optional.
  persid: S04
- desc: Thanks for the clarification professor!
  persid: S06
- desc: sounds like it is another essay
  persid: S30
- desc: How are we graded in a group? are we graded as a group or as individuals in
    a group?
  persid: S11
- desc: if we write research paper than in exams beginning of that we have to submit
    in proposal,right?
  persid: S29
- desc: can you please also add the topics as a note
  persid: S27
- desc: so individual has to write 1000 words or group of 5 can write 1000 words together
  persid: S34
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S11
- desc: Makes sense
  persid: S08
- desc: So should we have to email you the group members names first?
  persid: S37
- desc: Has he done attendance please
  persid: S38
- desc: Yes, he has.
  persid: S04
- desc: yep
  persid: S09
- desc: Yes he did attendance about 10 minutes into class
  persid: S08
- desc: "What\u2019s it please"
  persid: S38
- desc: scroll up
  persid: S14
- desc: t7cdfl
  persid: S09
- desc: should've made it an I
  persid: S08
- desc: thanks
  persid: S38
- desc: I don't think that's something we have access to
  persid: S08
- desc: If anyone is willing to do a group project, please ping me :)
  persid: S06
- desc: if you go on to the submission page you can see it
  persid: S27
- desc: can you give some example on URcourse except research paper?
  persid: S30
- desc: Yeah but where to change it more so. I see what group I'm in under submission
  persid: S08
- desc: For the research paper is that an upper bound of 1500 words? Like what if
    we go over that? Will it be viewed negatively?
  persid: S13
- desc: Got it, makes sense. Thanks
  persid: S02
- desc: '18'
  persid: S30
- desc: any example for topic name??
  persid: S39
- desc: if we write research paper than in exams beginning of that we have to submit
    in proposal,right?
  persid: S29
- desc: can we write about artificial intelligence or cyber security something??
  persid: S40
- desc: Worse comes to worst you can always go to his office hours and talk about
    the topic you're considering. I've done that a couple times.
  persid: S04
- desc: ok
  persid: S40
- desc: So are you suggesting you do bite in person?
  persid: S06
- desc: Yep that's him
  persid: S06
- desc: A fellow biter
  persid: S16
- desc: He must have a great dentist
  persid: S13
- desc: There was odds on betting if he would bite someone during the world cup
  persid: S14
