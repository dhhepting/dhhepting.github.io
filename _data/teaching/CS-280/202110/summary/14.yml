Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Hello. Well, just as as. I was late because my cat ran to the room here and.
    I was not trustworthy of his motives, so it has a good amount of the room lock
    them out. And then. it's a connecting connecting connecting connecting and I knew
    it wasn't going to connect. And then I had some problems rebooting. So it's been
    quite a good morning already. Thanks for sticking around. So did anyone see my
    post to the forum about technical difficulties.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah I had some technical difficulties, putting that out as well, anyway.
    Never a dull moment. So how is everyone today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good good.
  persid: S03
- desc: cannot complain at all.
  persid: S01
- desc: Not at all wow i'm really happy to hear that. do some more coffee, yes, I
    agree with that. Coffee is never a bad idea, I think. So let me. Do our attendance
    here well. So a connection. To login again. Or do I. One place told me I had an
    invalid session key. And then I went to a different screen or I want us. to access
    the attendance that's letting me work so. not sure about that. i'm happy I didn't
    have to login again but i'm not happy that I didn't have to log in again because
    i'm likely. On borrowed credentials here. Let me share the screen, so you can.
    see if you can beat me and copying it. From here to the chat. so slow there by
    having to select. A direct message and send it back to everyone. That was slow
    because and i'm 55 couldn't be 56 so. knock on wood. All goes to plan i'll be
    56 by the end of the Semester. So my birthday is on April 17 so that's. that's
    a Saturday. This year. yeah like being married my wife and I are both areas and
    sometimes that's. that's not a good combination, but. again. anyway. I was born
    in Chinese calendar, I did at one point.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have to look into it.
  persid: ???
- desc: Anyway, okay glad we could have some quality time there. Alright, so attendances
    handled. Okay, so let me show you the changes I made to the project proposal see
    if they meet your. approval. Okay, so can be done, individually or in a small
    group of up to five. If you choose to work in a group list all the. So if you
    choose to work in a group list all the members of the group, on the proposal so
    that. Project group can be created for you. well. As I discuss late, the other
    day it's see i'll be put into the same project group, because at this moment you're
    all in your own project groups. anyway. So there's five of you only one copy needs
    to be submitted. trust that the system will work. So, if your project changes
    after proposal submitted, please keep me informed. and keep in mind that the goal
    that proposes for you to do some planning, so the changes will be necessary. me
    choose what you will do with for the project, it almost feels class themes in
    some way, and I am open to your ideas about how to how you will do it your options
    include but are not limited to. So I moved the list so I should have made that
    line as well. Let me fix that right away. So, on the first first page. You say
    project proposal. group or if it's an individual put your name and if it's more
    than one person in your group. and put all the names of the people in your group.
    Okay, so just so it's clearly identified at the top. So. i'm editing the website
    with Adam. And when I release when I reboot my computer which i've had to do a
    few times lately. Adam doesn't start properly. I wonder why that is. Anyway, so
    i'm just starting it again now. So i've heard people say nice things about vs
    code. Well, that i've looked at a little bit, and I was having problems. Getting
    some things set up but we're gonna take another look at it. Now I like Adam. As
    much as I use it. But like I said i'm open to new things. We still not still capable
    of learning new tricks. me see if that's. checking to see whether. jacqueline's
    running in the background. Okay, so here i've changed at the same so you can put
    into the project together, only one cognitive repurposing needs to be submitted.
    me choose what you will do for the project, unless you have class things in some
    way and i'm open charities or how to do it. contents and foreign either proposal
    to match the River colonias appalling headings topic describe your topic and how
    it relates to class, so I have a link to the list of topics and learning outcomes.
    For the Semester, which may be of help to choose a topic that's new to you, but
    you haven't done your blog entry. The general topic is similar please indicate
    how you're treated differently, such as from a different perspective. So you might.
    tackle the same general heading general topic knowledge unit sort of speak sorry.
    we're going to try to talk to you quickly now to make up for time. Anyway, it's
    interesting to see what comes out in the transcript on him. I have to look at
    some of these words and think what was I trying to say and some of them are. Are
    guessable but others are. rude require trip back to the audio recording to see
    it listen to it again, I think. Anyway, so the general topic is similar please
    indicate how you'll treat it differently, such as it from a different perspective
    or. I hope that's clear enough. So, then, the deliverable and the rationale choose
    the form in which you deliver your project your options include but are not limited
    to. So you can do a research paper a book review Wikipedia article committed create
    and promote some online content. Video. and video doesn't have to be a live action
    shot, it could be a recording or presentation with narration can be a podcast
    or blog. picture yourself as a computing professional identify and discuss role
    models for your life as a competing professional. discuss contributions you've
    made to an open source project such as on github, for example. write some code
    to test, an idea. And also explain why you are choosing it. I can probably make
    that a little more clear, let me try that quickly. lost focus on my text editor.
    Okay, so I said also explain why you're choosing that particular deliverable.
    it's not a big improvement but small and perhaps. And then tentative plan provide
    a clan of some milestones realizing your chosen deliverable. This plan may look
    like an outline of what you plan to. include you're doing this with a group make
    clear how each Member will participate in the final deliverable. So it doesn't
    have to be two pages long. I didn't give a word count. So if you have a group,
    then you might use extra space to. you're doing it individually, you might be
    able to fit onto one page and if you're doing a group, you might need two pages
    to describe how you envision everyone working together. To complete the deliverable.
    So that makes sense. Okay. right then. So I wanted to touch on embassy today.
    And I wanted to also show you the empathy map assignment. So you can let me know
    what you think what needs to be clarified, and so on. So I suppose the describe
    the steps. should be under the list of what you're asked to do. So let me change
    that quickly. let's see if we can do it quickly. So in hindsight, I realized.
    That my zoom was having problems yesterday, or it may have been my zoom and problems
    yesterday, if someone tried to connect to me during my office hour, and it would
    just it just tongue there connecting to audio for several minutes and I tried.
    I tried to. connect communicate with the students in other ways, but I didn't.
    Use I had not sufficient. So, if it was you. say it was Jason. Here and trying
    to get Ahold of me in office hours yesterday. And I apologize, it was my assume
    that was acting up, I can think.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: I hope I can. answer your question. Perhaps today at 330 is another office
    hour. And if not by email or. message for. discussions. Okay, so it seems like
    forever ago but the beginning of the semester we talked about proctor track. And
    lots of. unkind things are said about proctor track. So we're not going to this
    is not indication that we're going to use proctor track. For the final exam. Because
    we're not. However. i'd like you to. go through the process of onboarding. And
    then. Think about the activity. So describe the steps you take to underperform
    the proctor track onboarding examine onboarding and practice rock onboarding and
    practice exam. Well, I don't know what i'm going to ask for the final exam. So,
    still a bit early. I have to. I have to. go over some good topics. yeah Okay,
    so we could have some fun with talking about. What could be on the final does
    anyone know what could be on the final well I probably have a better idea than
    most people. So the i'll say that it won't be something that it's that's. outside
    the context of our discussions. In the topics we've considered in class in our
    meetings. It looks like too many zeros on that se. So it'd be something. i'm leaning
    towards a take home exam kind of structure. Where there'll be a choice of. you'll
    you'll be given a choice have. You heard me you won't be given a choice you'll
    be given. A topic from a set of topics, so not everybody will see the same topic
    or topics. And then you'll be given some time to write. An article or an NSA about
    that topic. Okay, so I didn't see what Dane said, to begin with. yeah so the exam
    is. 20th 20. Thinking it's a 20th I could be wrong. Anyway, yes that's off topic.
    So what I. What I want. This idea to this assignment to focus on is. Looking at.
    developing our skill for empathy. Which is a coin to that Roundtable I can't quite
    a lot is in terms of a soft skill that's important for computer professionals
    to have. So an empathy map looks like this, I think this is the right link to
    it. Okay. Just an article called empathy mapping, but it has a. there's an illustration
    here, so an empathy map, according to this. Article, that is the definition it's
    a collaborative visualization us to articulate what we know about a particular
    type of user. It externalize is knowledge about users in order to create a shared
    understanding of user needs and to aid and decision making. Okay, so you're going
    to be doing an empathy map for yourself. So here's what an empathy map looks like.
    So it doesn't have to be a square with four squares. can be rectangle there's
    four quadrants and we think about what the user. says thanks does and feels. Well,
    completing the task. Or the activity. So. We can, maybe say think about these
    these four categories Category four types of or the four quadrants in terms of.
    do the same and different. So if we ask the person. To speak to talk about their
    experience as you're doing it. So we can we can get. Information, we can quote
    the user. By asking them questions and ask them to think aloud when they're working
    through the activity. So they might say this is. This is clear, this is not very
    clear. This is. frustrating, what do I do now. Those kinds of things might be
    said. By the user. And then, what the user does, we can observe what the user
    does. So that's somewhat straightforward. move that's the most straightforward.
    However. Well, so if we're talking about a user other than ourselves. asking them
    to speak aloud during an activity. or ask them questions is maybe not very natural
    for them so they will. They might say some things that are different. Then what
    they would. Be might come up with. A different explanation. And the does because
    they're under observation. They may be. Somewhat self conscious about. performing
    an activity with someone else there. or. Whether they're being recorded well performing
    the activity. But it's still. These are still some. This is still reasonably better
    sources of information than for us to guess what the user wants. or think about
    the poor user has to do these things. If we can get some things that are. or.
    Even coming directly from the user, however filtered they might be it's a benefit.
    And then thanks and feels. Those are a little bit more. difficult to find it.
    So the fields. it's more about user. Experience or the emotional. So here i'm
    going to switch to the text. So the thinks quadrant captures of what the users
    thinking through the experience ask yourself from the qualitative research gathered
    what occupies users thoughts. What matters to the users, a possible to have so
    it's possible how the same content and says, and thanks, however. A special attention
    to what the users think that may not be willing to vocalize try to understand
    why they're reluctant to share they unsure self conscious polite or afraid to
    tell others something. The fields quadrant is the emotional state often represented
    as an adjective plus a short sentence for context. Ask yourself what where is
    the user, what does the user get excited about how does user feel about the experience.
    impatient pages low to slowly confused too many contradictory prices worried,
    they are doing something wrong. So here's a sample empathy map. If we're going
    through the activity of buying a TV. The the person may say where should I start.
    What size best I want sending reliable. I was expecting something different. Thanks
    and we're wasting too much time what else, am I missing. I want something awesome
    too many acronyms. Why is this so hard. And under what they do check the web,
    a web site. make small decisions postpone big decisions observes and store asks
    friends. Listen list pros and cons compares products. and feel overwhelmed excited
    unsure who to trust anxious inadequate fear. Okay, does that make sense. I would
    say we don't need to include the goals at the bottom. Is in this example.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So is this assignment like imagine if you were in their shoes sort of anger.
  persid: S04
- desc: well. I want you to do it for yourself, but this is just i'm just sort of
    outlining the process.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S04
- desc: gotcha you can. If you, you can construct empathy maps for other people doing
    an activity. In that case, you would. You would have to rely on other data that
    you've collected. You wouldn't be able to. get exactly what they feel or think.
    I mean you can observe it, you can record what they say and what they do. But
    you'd have to. do some work to in empathizing with them. You know, putting walking
    a mile in their shoes, so to speak. From all the other information you've collected
    to you, you would. Get you make. guesses about informed guesses about what they
    think and feel while completing an activity. make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S04
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: ???
- desc: And then the third part of. This is when you've. gone through the process.
    Some of you may have already gone through the process of onboarding and doing
    the practice exam. When you've gone through the process, you can look at what
    you've observed about yourself. And then think about. areas or opportunities to
    redesign our improvement of the process. In the interface and. You know, to say.
    If there's a particular thing that made you nervous about. If the concern is about
    privacy is there a particular thing that makes you nervous. And could that be
    improved, for example, could that be restated. can be made more clear that the
    data is not store is stored in Canada. And that nothing is. nothing, nothing is
    capped. for purposes other than verifying your exam participation. And so on right
    So how could we. How could we improve the onboarding process. that's the last
    part about the opportunity to redesign. seem okay. And as far as i'm concerned
    that you know if we can. If there are questions or concerns about this. Over the
    next while we can. We can clarify things. as well. not opposed to doing that either.
    So there's a related article sympathy versus empathy and user experience. So rather
    than. know I feel like we've talked about this a little bit. That we have sympathy
    for the poor user. And we're going to do the user favor because they're so hard
    done by. So that's using simple that's using having sympathy for the user versus
    empathy is. Understanding their position and what. And how they perceive. Things
    so it's not looking trying to look at the problem from the perspective of the
    user and not just. look at it from the outside. So I invite you to look at that
    article as well. For today. I apologize for my. system problems. Then again, if
    you try to get me with an office hours. Let me know i'm trying to keep keep track
    of all the different. ways to keep in touch. But my my intention is to is to be
    available for questions and so on, so i'm not trying to hide out. Okay, so have
    a great weekend. and enjoy the sun. Take care and stay well. And i'll see you
    on Tuesday okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.

- desc: Even a 1500 word essay would be great ngl
  persid: S07
- desc: Im with Dayne lets just get some content first
