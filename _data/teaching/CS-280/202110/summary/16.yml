Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. how's everyone doing today. that's pretty good I think can be
    considering. You know, turn the stage.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We cannot complain about the water.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah. I was worried when I was raining on. Monday night and then snowed and
    I thought that might be a lot of slippery ice underneath but. Because I fall under
    those conditions before. But it was. It was nice to watch. Nice to walk pardon
    me. and actually sell it to my neighbors. And conversation with them. Socially
    distance of course because you're wearing masks especially. Anyway, you know it's
    a nice. Nice interlude I guess. let's go right to attendance. Let me share my
    screen. Here we go. This privacy. To work on the navigation. So these are actually
    a couple of videos. Anyone has had a chance to look at them. The first one is.
    steam is cathcart. he's in charge of whatsapp. And the second one is. Glenn greenwald
    who says the New York Times and worked with Edward snowden to. publish stories
    about surveillance programs in the state. A couple years old, but. Still. Okay,
    so. We come to yesterday with our discussion about. rights and responsibilities
    and privacy. Any thoughts about that, like to. comments or. Even questions. Start
    us off today. Okay well what's the point right if it's not respected. can't always
    be. In terms of kind of think of the things in terms of rights. and responsibilities
    as well. So there's interesting. The second part of the comment is. That privacy
    rights violated simply due to lack of knowledge. So. How many. How many people
    are. confident in their privacy settings a set up on different platforms. Read
    the terms of service and understand the law. and How many people are willing to
    not use a platform if the terms of service aren't. aren't supportive of you have
    your own privacy.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I do feel like there is something coercive about the way in terms of service
    or use just in the sense that I think most companies know that. No one or most
    people are not going to take the time to read every word of these documents, and
    so they can essentially put whatever demands on your privacy, they want. We use
    so many digital services now and we have to agree to so many terms of service
    that clicking yes, except just becomes second nature and we signed a lot of way
    in that process, but what choice, do we have we want to use these services now.
  persid: S02
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah. Exactly so between a rock and a hard place, so to speak. And you might
    think that. there's so many. People using these services like there's something
    like billions of messages sent per day on whatsapp. yeah so there's so much traffic
    going on who is going to be interested in me. So this is your losses taught chatting
    here both things, so why don't we start with a breakout room about. let's see.
    out and. have some agency or your privacy online. Is that a general enough topic
    yet specific enough. Right now. Okay, here we go now paste the question as a message
    to the groups as well to the bigger rooms. So See you in 10 minutes. From. The
    breakout rooms. We missed her last a few people, but that because that's. What
    happens raises operation and oh. Sorry, that was. A humor. anyway. Any ideas come
    up that you want to share. This is a good discussion.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I know my group there we were chatting a little bit and we got on to how hopeless
    it feels right because these companies are so massive and it's We just have to
    rely on the government to hopefully do something and that's it's it's hard to
    handle sometimes.
  persid: S04
- desc: In our group he thought that we don't really have a choice, right now, like
    you, can't really be private.
  persid: S05
- desc: We had kind of a quieter more sedate discussion in our group, but it came
    up a bit we talked about. The fact that there's applications out there that are
    explicitly designed to harvest our data and disregard our privacy and it's challenging
    to maintain privacy in the face of things like that.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. platforms to. To do things to protect our privacy, not in their self
    interest. So please don't do that, so that I can. Messages everybody. Okay. there's
    an interesting comment about what is somebody with agency look like on the Internet.
    The person could be using tools that are available Internet to create their own.
    profile online. So that is. reputable sources or authoritative source of information
    about the person. online. So that, of course, implies that people want to be online.
    You don't want to be online. And it's a bit more difficult, so in the year in
    the European Union, they have. The right to be forgotten as far as the gdpr. General
    data and privacy regulations that came into effect. Almost three years ago. To.
    give up some privacy is some control over your information. For convenience or.
    So there's a poem written after the Second World War. I believe, is a first, they
    came for the. Here, let me. Let me look it up. description. yeah. So I mean. We
    can say it depends. And we can say it a little bit more. easily when we're not
    directly affected, but if we. If we don't. Work to. send the importance of privacy.
    For others. Then, maybe. It will be so eroded by the time. We we hope to apply,
    then that. Our own privacy is threatened. Maybe. yeah okay so it's really a brilliant
    business model. it's a very. it's not it's not a very pleasant one. Because. Software
    is designed to prey on. Even weaknesses. and And, especially when it's not clear.
    So and. Anyone familiar with the terminator series of movies. yeah there's so
    many of them don't remember, which is which. So Facebook and these other platforms
    are. Are not marketed as having. A terminator, on the other side of the screen,
    are they. mean so we talked about metaphors. yeah. yeah. metaphors so if we think
    of. representation of what the processing power of. Facebook and other platforms
    have going. Have going for them. And it's not to support people. To get connected
    to family and friends or to learn about something. that's interesting to them.
    But it's. What we want, because they're trying to monetize every bit of interaction.
    So if we were. Take the. Mark Zuckerberg mark Zuckerberg face off the. business
    model and replace it with. something a little bit more scary. I would be improving
    the. Transparency around. Around the around the interface and. picture with mark
    Zuckerberg screen. mime attacking from the ocean, as some. references to it. privacy
    as relates to our use of technology in this class. Are some issues here. Get identified.
    In. The chat. And in the transcript. audio transcript. i'm. i'm trying to remove
    names from those places. urination those places. There are still more concerns
    what are other issues. Ownership of. This class. Sure, so I think. I think the
    idea. Is that it's your choice, so this is a bit of the agency issue. You can
    decide what we want to have. You on a claim that this was caught if you're a student
    s 13 and this discussion. there's a way to. for you to reclaim that identity for
    yourself. If you want to do that. If I can. give you that choice to. To make a
    claim. And having it. forced upon you that. You know the tennis student s 13 and
    today's. transcripts.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Where you. I kind of want to hear your thoughts on. Pro track since you're
    you're talking about the security and all this data stuff. What do you, what are
    your thoughts on that whole matter because it's kind of relates, I feel.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah so I mean one one of the issues, is where the data is being stored. And
    so, for the pro track. The data is stored in Canada so it's not. it's not a cross
    border enterprise. So. Because this data is stored in the states, for example,
    then it's subject to other things like Patriot Act and. But in terms of. The features
    in pro track. track pardon me. there's some flexibility in terms of what kinds
    of things get logged and i've heard horror stories about. People failing exams
    or people who are coming so stressed out because. They are flagged as cheating
    when they needed to go. Have a bathroom break and. So on so. say the student is
    to. fill in the blank to. make any judgments about that, but making association
    between crying you're showing emotions. Maybe that's like. kind of a recapture.
    kind of test. So. I think the idea is with project track is to. Do do its best
    to ensure some conditions. A level playing field for the exams. So. I could see
    that. You may not want to have any other devices connected Internet browsing cable
    devices connected to the network. yeah you can go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, my thing with, that is if you're wanting no other devices in the room,
    you should you should need their full room scan not just this wasn't an exam that
    required a full room scan so. Since it wasn't required to full rooms, can you
    know, theoretically, I could have my laptop and I could have my other computer
    behind it, and I could be scroll on my computer behind it right. So I don't see
    why it needs to know what every single device is connected to my network when
    they're not necessarily in that same room so it's going into your network now
    where else is it going to check that you're not have other things on like. I think
    there's better ways, it could do it, that would be more privacy protected as all.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah so maybe talk to your smart fridge and find out whether you have some
    performing enhancing smoothies in the fridge that are. Going on a limb here but.
    wired up the Internet connected fridges. Could report to your health insurance
    company or. You know whether you're. In following the doctor's advice and whether
    you deserve a good premium on your life insurance and so on. So I mean there's
    certainly. Lots of issues, the issues Ariel enough. and related one I don't want
    anyone sees these all state ads on. Anyone who watches TV, I still watch TV with
    ads. broadcast ads. And it says. Show she was a safe driving APP or something
    like that. And the APP is connected. runs on their phone and. They take a listen
    when they're driving. And I think it's not very far away, to say that they would
    monitor. It was connect with a car and. see that you're following the speed limit
    and so on. So. i'm. More concerned. scanning the network. It should be. transparent
    about life scanning the network. Anything that there'd be some kind of. permissions
    involved. So if I want to use. well. I guess is a nod to. My own agency, they
    absolutely COP and say such and such would like to use your camera or your microphone
    is that Okay, yes or no. He would like access to your contacts, yes or no, and
    so forth. So you think. Maybe your computer. would be on your side and say. This
    proctor track application wants to. scan your network. yeah go ahead Keegan.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't recall proctor track ever asked me if you wanted to scan my network
    it asked for hardware of your computer access to your camera and microphone but
    I don't remember it ever asking me if it could pro my network. Which is why it
    was concerning to me.
  persid: S07
- desc: So, how did you find out about it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um well, I had a fire stick plugged in, and it was on on like a different
    level of like my house like somebody else was using it, and it was like Oh, you
    have to turn this device off to continue. A fire stick is just like a streaming
    things you like plug it into an hdmi port and you can stream like netflix and
    stuff so basically turn your TV like into a smart TV. And for anybody that doesn't
    know what it is. So, like.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah so i'm i'm just wondering like why it doesn't why there's in the permission
    for that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah That was my problem with it like I brought it up with my teacher time
    was actually David gearhart so like he investigated for me said it was Okay, but
    I don't know I still wasn't a fan of. The probing all your network when I don't
    think it's useful for what they're trying to do when they have other things that
    I think would be more effective.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah. So anyway, it could be clear we're not going to use proctor track in
    this class. I just wanted you to. The empathy map assignment is about. going through
    the process and. Thinking about. pick up on how that's presented and. If there
    are opportunities for improving the presentation. Kagan.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I just didn't have any.
  persid: S07
- desc: Other Keegan. zoom I see that the rectangle is shifted to the other Keegan.
    I wonder if you have that happened many, many classes. I remember one year in
    public school, there were five girls in my class, including me. names were installed,
    the same way, but. That was an interesting year I remember. Anyway, so you're
    welcome. I know not to rely on the rectangle but, if anyone wants to make a comment
    just put your. emoji hand up and. we'll go from there. So. yeah so there's a question
    about your courses and as a question about proctor track. And how to set a practice
    track so that appropriately. invasive. or records the things. that are necessary
    for. individualization. But not anything more than that. i'm trying to fall on
    in the chat here. So your courses is too difficult for people, then what. So how
    many people are. comfortable with your courses. who's not comfortable with your
    courses. So I think it's a discussion about. platform. And there are so many platforms
    out there, some of them are free, students, some are free to the university, some
    are. not free. I mean, some are proprietary or some are paid. To the university.
    involve some involvement big. purchase for the university some. involve purchases
    for students. And I think at some point there's. needs to be agreement on. The
    platform, and so I think you are courses as a version of moodle, which is an open
    source project. which has gone through a lot. And it gets a little better all
    the time. Too much clicking for me. set things up. So I think the issue is proctor
    track in the. data breach last year was. resolved. and I don't think that. invalidated
    selection. Anyway, so some some people some classes make. Use of different platforms
    i've heard people use school ology and. different things like that. Lots of issues.
    I see the scrolling by quite quickly now. But in terms of. Can we maybe need to
    have freedom from choice about the different platforms like somebody will say,
    well, we should use top ad. Creative so creative. or. or. School G or. etc, etc.
    So. can agree on your courses and agreed on. proctor track when required. So I
    think there's lots of interesting. ideas. To. Keep the exam. exams, like the final
    the take home exam that will have. In. In this class and have it. be challenging
    and stressful. and difficult to. phone in and as well not fun in. So I think there's
    ways to have it be fair valuation be fair. and reasonably cheap proof. and Now
    require individualization. Any questions. In terms of Canadian privacy law. grace
    from the University of Ottawa is. A restricted authority. and i'm just gonna.
    post. A blog post about. His. Analysis of. Canadian privacy law see 11 I think
    it is. And it's not it's not yet law. A bill. to revamp the privacy law. So there
    are other related posts and. here's a sample to get you started. The identification
    of data. So we may want the identify the data records, so that we could make some
    aggregate comparisons, without compromising the identity of individuals. The problem
    is it's difficult to de identified data that. Or the data looks de identified.
    At first glance, can be. We identified fairly easily. And one of the best ways
    to identify people is real estate. So how many people are, how many people protect
    their birth date. From. From widespread online access.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I used to protect my birth date but I no longer do that because I find with.
    recap password recovery if I forget my password I often need to know that, as
    part of the credentialing process, so now that we all need so many passwords and
    password managers to track all the dozens of accounts, we have in our lives, I
    feel like I don't have that freedom anymore.

    a lot of privacy rights get violated simply due to lack of knowledge
  persid: S08

  persid: S13

  persid: S15

  persid: S20

  persid: S13
- desc: I skim....sometimes...
  persid: S17
- desc: Ok I don't read terms of service hahaha, it takes waay too long
  persid: S08
- desc: Depends what the platform is.
  persid: S13
- desc: I will immediately use other platform without question
  persid: S17
- desc: I even ignore the sites that forces me to accept cookies
  persid: S21
- desc: nowadays the media will do that for us
  persid: S19
- desc: lol
  persid: S19
- desc: if the benefits outweigh the cons
  persid: S17
- desc: But like at the end of the day, more end users need to take responsibility
    for the data that they upload...
  persid: S22
- desc: I usually skim over it just to have an idea how secure my data will be, but
    in the end it all comes down to how badly I need to use that app
  persid: S15
- desc: I agree privacy laws and all but like it was you who agreed and uploaded the
    data..
  persid: S22
- desc: The terms of service that require "your immortal soul" always gets me
  persid: S07
- desc: there's always an option for me so I am not really bothered by the compulsions
    to accept cookies or terms and conditions or show them my location
  persid: S21
- desc: when you get a car you go through hours with an agent
  persid: S17
- desc: Works for me
  persid: S08

  persid: S02
- desc: How to have some agency about your privacy online
  persid: S08
- desc: 'breakout room: how to exercise some agency about your online privacy?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: good discussion!
  persid: S18
- desc: Yes!
  persid: S23
- desc: Yeah!
  persid: S09
- desc: Yeah :)
  persid: S08
- desc: 'my question beyond the breakout room: I wanted to know what people think
    a person with agency on the internet looks like'
  persid: S18
- desc: '@Dayne My image, to keep it brief would be some very tech savvy person'
  persid: S08
- desc: Well depends on what the definition of agency is
  persid: S10
- desc: ^^^
  persid: S06
- desc: Exactly - everyone defines it differently haha
  persid: S18
- desc: '@Dayne someone who emulates their operating system on a vm and bounces their
    ip using a vpn'
  persid: S24
- desc: That's a tricky phrase
  persid: S21
- desc: '...god people, this is the nth time we direct messaged the prof...'
  persid: S17
- desc: So it might be good to clarify what agency means and what that SHOULD look
    like.
  persid: S18
- desc: The fact that your mobile devices are listening to you all the time, and if
    you speak something around it, you will get ads and recommendation based on that
    topic.
  persid: S15
- desc: I f it is two parties being transparent with each other then they kinda have
    it they just can tell us all the bad things they are doing and all the good
  persid: S10
- desc: we need an universal agency?
  persid: S21
- desc: time to put my phone in a faraday cage...
  persid: S17
- desc: lmao
  persid: S08
- desc: maybe it is because social sites are basically free so they ARE taking data
    to make money?
  persid: S25
- desc: "some of those things I don\u2019t even think about anymore"
  persid: S26
- desc: But like us end users decide to use it so can we really put the entire blame
    on the companies?
  persid: S22
- desc: sites that need payment upfront to use do not sell data or privacy
  persid: S25
- desc: Are these companies really doing anything wrong? Of course it's an invasion
    to our privacy, but we're all agreeing to it in the terms of service
  persid: S27
- desc: Exactly, I 100% agree with @Reanne
  persid: S22
- desc: Just because it's legal doesn't mean it's ethical
  persid: S18
- desc: time is money and they aren't leaving you enough time to read
  persid: S17
- desc: I also agree with that point
  persid: S06
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: I'd say yes it's wrong. Legality != morality
  persid: S08
- desc: Just my opinion though
  persid: S08
- desc: agree David
  persid: S05
- desc: Everyone's in a business LOL. Everyone makes money by somehow doing something
    ethically wrong to other person
  persid: S22
- desc: I do blame the companies. If they provide a unique service - like Facebook,
    whose user base is part of the value of the service - the terms of service can
    be coercive. If the user doesn't accept them, they can't use the service - so
    they may agree to things they normally wouldn't.
  persid: S02
- desc: When everything we do is highly dependent on the use of internet services,
    they need to change the legality of it to protect our privacy
  persid: S15
- desc: "waste of time to try because I like my life easy so it\u2019s just a little\
    \ price I pay for it"
  persid: S26
- desc: It's definitely not ethically right but I think that's how they're avoiding
    conflict with the government
  persid: S27
- desc: 'no'
  persid: S25
- desc: Depends
  persid: S10
- desc: I agree with you, Michael.
  persid: S18
- desc: Unlike you Bilal, I won't give up
  persid: S17
- desc: Yes it's totally fair in my opinion
  persid: S22
- desc: I like to think so
  persid: S26
- desc: its my privacy so I should decide what I want to do with it
  persid: S25
- desc: It's a bizarre twist on 1984
  persid: S08
- desc: It depends on what service I am giving up my privacy for
  persid: S15

  persid: S25

  persid: S21

    needs to be defined.
  persid: S06

  persid: DHH
- desc: I think firm and fair regulation is the only way to ensure consumer privacy.
    Companies have incentives to seek data for profit, we can expect that they'll
    do so as long as it's legal, so the best way to address the issue is to draw clear
    and firm boundaries around how to respect privacy.
  persid: S02

    tho
  persid: S25
- desc: Interesting poem, Prof
  persid: S08
- desc: Ok let's look at it this way. We all agree that "selling" data is ethically
    wrong, well then how is retail business ethical where they sell a $3 product for
    $100? We don't mind that LOL
  persid: S22
- desc: That I agree with
  persid: S22
- desc: because retail only harms our pockets
  persid: S21
- desc: not our souls
  persid: S21
- desc: data is worth more than just currency, true
  persid: S17
- desc: '@Panth If someone sells a $3 hammer for $100, that''s different from if someone

    someone selling it affects me in ways that someone profiting off selling an object
    doesn''t.'

  persid: S21

    Skynet?

  persid: S17
- desc: Your efforts to anonymize the transcripts are much appreciated, thank you!
  persid: S02
- desc: Why? should I not have ownership of the ideas and thoughts that I share in
    this class?
  persid: S30
- desc: I think you've put in a lot of effort into making this class an ethical course
    and I think you've done very well :)
  persid: S08
- desc: no, give em to me!
  persid: S17
- desc: I had a friend flagged for crying lol
  persid: S08
- desc: Ok ill stop
  persid: S08
- desc: I have a computer science professor who is very firm on using ProctorTrack
    in a 400 level class lol
  persid: S22
- desc: that's interesting things to flag for
  persid: S25
- desc: Gotta hold those tear back next time ahaha
  persid: S06
- desc: Proctor track probes your entire network. It told me I had to shut off certain
    devices and I dont see why it needs to go that far through my privacy
  persid: S07
- desc: 'I have a question regarding privacy: What term/condition would completely
    turn you away from using an app?'
  persid: S20
- desc: That is the one thing software don't have
  persid: S19
- desc: Panth, do everything you can to thwart the proctal exa...I mean proctortrack
  persid: S17
- desc: People will find a way
  persid: S17
- desc: play games, and get played
  persid: S17
- desc: It allows cross website tracking
  persid: S22
- desc: hahahhaa
  persid: S18

  persid: S06

  persid: S05

  persid: S26
- desc: Prof, TV is still like $60
  persid: S17
- desc: "Ya I didn\u2019t know that either tbh"
  persid: S06
- desc: people are still cheating even in proctored exams idk what the point
  persid: S21
- desc: its expensive, I like the free radio
  persid: S17
- desc: true Raj, I would even say it people are more entitled to cheat
  persid: S17
- desc: But with those things they are usually voluntary. If you want a better insurance
    rate because you follow the rules of the road go for it
  persid: S07
- desc: cheating is best rebellion to prototrack
  persid: S21
- desc: '"If you are not hiding anything, you got nothing to worry about!"'
  persid: S17
- desc: already heard lots of student to say that they pre-recorded and uploaded that
    in proctortrack
  persid: S25
- desc: oh my my my lmao
  persid: S21
- desc: Yeah it lost it at my Chromecast Audio too
  persid: S13
- desc: i still haven't had any proctored exams till now so i dont know much about
    it
  persid: S21
- desc: Well the teacher allows that I have multiple devices hook up with the wifi
    and it did not do anything
  persid: S10
- desc: Lucky you, proctortrack really spikes the cortisol
  persid: S08
- desc: thank you prof
  persid: S17
- desc: I've had 1 proctored exam and the prof kept it open book and allowed us anything
    to search up the answers, so I'm really not sure why he used the software in the
    first place
  persid: S15
- desc: I have proctored exam tomorrow aha fun midterm worth 30%
  persid: S26
- desc: good luck buddy
  persid: S21
- desc: what course bilal?
  persid: S25
- desc: Wait so in my room itself, there are 11 devices connected to the network,
    will that be a problem?
  persid: S22
- desc: yea thx aha, cs 310
  persid: S26
- desc: Woops not used to haveing two keegans
  persid: S07
- desc: "Many of the teachers outside of the filed of CS just really don\u2019t know\
    \ how it works I feel."
  persid: S06
- desc: field*
  persid: S06
- desc: no offence nor judging but many are still not familiar with even ur courses
  persid: S21
- desc: if UR courses is too difficult for people, what will they use then? homing
    pigeon?
  persid: S17
- desc: mail?
  persid: S17
- desc: The online transition for some profs would've been pretty large, I could see
    that. Especially if they aren't in a technical field
  persid: S08
- desc: What are the topics for blog 2?
  persid: S31
- desc: no i am talking about proffs
  persid: S21
- desc: and not the whole ur courses but mainly the quizzes and exams that are given
    through UR courses
  persid: S21
- desc: Its fine
  persid: S10
- desc: me
  persid: S29
- desc: It works fine for me
  persid: S04
- desc: I am comfortable with URcourses
  persid: S17
- desc: I'm definitely comfortable with it
  persid: S08
- desc: I like UR courses makes handing in easy
  persid: S07
- desc: all good
  persid: S32
- desc: I am totally down
  persid: S21
- desc: UR courses is fine for me
  persid: S13
- desc: I like its dark mode so far
  persid: S17
- desc: me too
  persid: S21
- desc: Dark mode is great til you have to use a comment field, and then its dark
    grey on darker grey
  persid: S13
- desc: Ur course's exams are better than TopHat ones
  persid: S21
- desc: its got some issues but better than being flashbanged
  persid: S17
- desc: "This semester alone I have to use Wiley plus, vital source and urourses just\
    \ to monitor what\u2019s up in my courses"
  persid: S06
- desc: I like UR Courses quite a bit, very easy to navigate, allows for easy communication
    with professors
  persid: S20
- desc: I mean you could also argue that the money spent on proctor track could have
    been put to better use
  persid: S07
- desc: faster servers
  persid: S21
- desc: Yeah! Or even more simple approach like having a pdf document to be downloaded,
    then scanning in your solutions as a different file.
  persid: S09
- desc: Proctortrack was hacked last year, makes no sense to use it
  persid: S33
- desc: If people want to cheat they can still cheat.
  persid: S33
- desc: if you are in a class with more than 100 students, UR courses is definitely
    going down during exams
  persid: S21
- desc: Money is not a problem, our tuition covers the cost no problem hahah
  persid: S06
- desc: true, services like TurnItIn are reasonable!
  persid: S17
- desc: Money is always a problem haha
  persid: S07
- desc: Why there is Scarcity
  persid: S07
- desc: wiley plus needs member ship as well as vital source needs subscription for
    the book.
  persid: S32
- desc: Instead professors should design exams that are harder to cheat on..
  persid: S33
- desc: or assignments
  persid: S17
- desc: I mean a sticky note beats proctor track
  persid: S07
- desc: hahahah thanks for the idea Keegan
  persid: S22
- desc: time limits can be too unreasonable I would say
  persid: S17
- desc: Literally hear of people using a sticky note on the monitor yeah lmao
  persid: S08
- desc: So was it a good use of resources ?
  persid: S07
- desc: I had a professor for math class last year and it would be near impossible
    to cheat on that exam as students could barely finish in allotted time if they
    had done all the studying
  persid: S33
- desc: ah yes
  persid: S17
- desc: rushed math got us to the moon
  persid: S17
- desc: Mandeep was that for 221?
  persid: S07
- desc: ^^^^
  persid: S06
- desc: my engl final was 6 hour long, imagine it being proctored , thankfully it
    was not
  persid: S21
- desc: I feel like I had the same prof
  persid: S07
- desc: I hated 221
  persid: S26
- desc: Ya I was in that class to keegan
  persid: S06
- desc: 116, 221 was similar but I was talking about 116
  persid: S33
- desc: but mine was in person
  persid: S26
- desc: Yeah I thought you were in a couple of my classes
  persid: S07
- desc: before covid
  persid: S26
- desc: What prof was it for 221? I am currently taking it and now I'm worried lol
  persid: S15
- desc: do not take Fernando for math 221
  persid: S25
- desc: ^
  persid: S07
- desc: before covid, people had a chance to meet in person to study, there is more
    to learn than just colors on a screen
  persid: S17
- desc: I second that Rhythm
  persid: S27
- desc: Guys has anyone here taken CS 473 before?
  persid: S22
- desc: It was Fernando hahahah
  persid: S06
- desc: I'm retaking 221 with Remus and it's 10000% better
  persid: S27
- desc: well I'm bad at math theories and he focuses on that heavily. if you have
    no issues with theory go for it
  persid: S25
- desc: No, I really liked the conversation today though :)
  persid: S18
- desc: Remus is an angel
  persid: S22
- desc: Also yes Remus is an angel
  persid: S18

  persid: S34
- desc: So not even necessarily encryption, but just removing the metadata that relates
    the data back to a person?
