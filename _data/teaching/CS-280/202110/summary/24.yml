Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. I had a cap in my room in my. zoom room, I had to get out before
    cause any problems, so I apologize for that delay in joining me today. today.
    is not good, is it. Canada is the only country in the world, dealing with all
    the variants of once and. Not it's not over yet, so I need everybody to stay vigilant.
    keep working on. Restricting the public health rules and so forth. yeah i'm feeling
    a little under the weather today. Oh it's nice weather yesterday let's see how
    long it stays. Class today. keeping up with. Listen make work project to repost
    the. links to the. meetings and. The raw transcript. audio and transcripts. For
    me just look at show you this is a student. hidden the other. Individual links
    have added this one. Meeting details as transcript summaries and responses. Taken
    i've copied this from my website. So this is. This is on your courses, but it's.
    generated from. Well it's it's a copy of what's on my website. So on Thursday
    march 11 was meaning 16. And here's the summary. Of the transcript audio and tech
    chat transcripts. And these are the responses. So, the reason I did this. The
    reason I did this was to. And the identifiable transcripts. people's names on
    them. i've taken names out in these. Some reason responses. more consistent approach.
    This is more readily available, I think. So, in the end. meeting here that aren't
    having occurred yet. So saying you can still click there but there won't be a
    summary there until until there is one. summary from yesterday's meeting. Our
    last meeting pardon me not yesterday's. So there we go. You can see that it looks
    a lot, like this one. Just has a different styling to it because it's in your
    courses. makes sense. microphone on. Okay, so talk about your courses website.
    So there might be some. There might be a few of you who've gotten. just a minute,
    a project proposal, but then. didn't get a grade for it. And I think this is maybe
    due to the way the group's reformed. So if you can let me know. i've alerted the
    markers to this issue. But if if you're in a position where you submitted a group.
    submitted a to hang this there's maybe particularly. An issue with. People who
    are working in groups. So the maybe the crowd. So it seems to me the groups are
    formed properly So if you said you're working. If Alice and Bob are working together.
    In a group platform with Alice and Bob then there's no submission, so I think,
    maybe it kind of God may have gotten lost in translation. So if you're if you're
    in a situation. Or you had a you had a submission and. It wasn't. created. I mean,
    so in that case race at Alice and. So Alice and Bob must have made a submission
    to make to cause the group to be created as it was. So that's the proof that something
    that the submission was there. and make sense it kind of makes sense to me. As
    i'm saying it but. let's just say, if you have problems with the. proposed project
    proposal marks, let me know so we can get that started.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor I just had a quick question about that.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So if another student in your group submitted the project proposal should
    we still contact you or just the person who submitted the proposal.
  persid: S01
- desc: i'm aware of your situation.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, good thanks.
  persid: S01
- desc: i'm not. Okay. So I suspect they might be a couple other people who are having
    the problem, besides the ones who said, they are the ones who said they are in
    the chat. i've already. working to figure out what happened. So. don't be deterred
    from working on your project. That will make sure that the grades get. sorted
    out as quickly as possible okay. Welcome To the cracks here. Okay, so. I spent
    more time working on the website yesterday than I anticipated, so I didn't quite
    get. The full answer to my. final exam questions for. ISIS. So maybe i'll touch
    on that a bit more detail on Tuesday again. A 24 hour take home final. is still
    the. tool is still what we're working with. give or take. So if you need the niqab
    accommodations around that then. Your courses can handle that. So i've lined up
    somebody from kips to come back on the 15th for half hour so. Talk about. professionalism
    and mentoring. I guess that. seems to me to be have employer included in that
    as well, but. The key words that I got was mentoring. So that can go, it can be
    a longer discussion, if you want, on Thursday. Today, I want to look at a couple
    few news articles. Maybe we can. apply the same kind of. case study approach to
    them as we. said, we saw utilized on the acm website. From the other day when
    you're looking at those case studies. So the first one. This about. uber and lyft.
    And I found that on the Twitter feed from the acm ethics page. Although I thought
    I was getting this newsletter I didn't seem to recall this particular article
    is from the end of March. The. New graphic. uber and lyft. Being good. Focusing
    on the public good here. I don't know if we have left anywhere in Canada. here.
    The attendance first. student. You see, when does it get in the way. Okay, so
    what i'd like to do is now that we've got that sorted out is. let's take. We will
    do to try to visit the same breakout rooms. be nice to somebody in the group can.
    Take notes or if you're doing chat. This to save the chat window you do in the
    group. Okay, so some kind of reporting. That would be great. Okay, any question
    so i'll put those links out again. Let me put them in the chat first so here's
    the code of ethics. So i'm just gonna. give you a case study kind of a discussion
    of the news article.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Hello.
  persid: S02
- desc: Hello.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I got kicked out of the breakout room by mistake.
  persid: S02
- desc: just give me a second i'm gonna put you back in.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: I think we're all back. Back is coming back. how's that discussion said okay.
    Any reports that the discussions you've had. And to that. Yes, Okay, so a comment
    about sharing data being in violation of 1.6 1.7 which I respect privacy and.
    honor confidentiality. So they could be identified. So they're not personal a
    personal intimate not personal information. That gets shared and distributed when.
    You look at trends. And the granularity of the data could not be. so high that.
    So find that. Effectively identifies. People who are using the service and. The
    de identified data to be associated with own individuals. To find to find. 2.5
    and 2.77. yeah so 2.7 foster power coordinates and understanding of computing
    related technologies and their consequences. That seems to be related to the.
    Misleading interfaces that we talked about the other day. They were featured in
    one of the cases so. When we. promote the system as. Being only positive. And
    that we knowingly. withhold information about the negative. So this seems to.
    Have relationship to the. Tobacco lawsuit so some some years ago. When the tobacco
    companies understood from very early on that. Smoking was. a health hazard. Substantial
    health risk for serious. lung cancer and so forth. They didn't make that information
    that were available. yeah same thing with climate change. From the oil from fossil
    fuel industry.
  persid: DHH
- desc: 3.7.
  persid: ???
- desc: So, about how early some people knew about climate change. I seem to remember
    a short film by frank capra retire or they talked about. Greenhouse gases, and
    I think that was well not sure when that was done. yeah it's been me said, for
    a long time. So 3.7 does recognize and take special care systems and become integrated
    into the infrastructure of society. So this is a. thanks for the 1968 was the
    data that film. So, even as simple as computer systems are the potential potential
    to impact all aspects of society, when integrated with everyday activities such
    as commerce travel government, healthcare and education. When organizations and
    groups develop systems have become an important part of the infrastructure society,
    the layer seven added it responsibly be good stewards of the systems. Part of
    that stewardship requires establishing policies are fair system access. including
    those that may have been excluded included for those who have may have been excluded
    that stewardship us requires is competing professionals monitor the level of integration
    of their systems into the infrastructure of society. As to level adoption changes
    the ethical responsibilities with organization or group are likely to change as
    well. Daniel monitoring of societies, using the system will allow the organization
    or group to remain consistent with your ethical obligations outlined in the code
    when appropriate standards of care did not exist computing professional seven
    duty to ensure they are developed. Well, that seems like a. Very applicable one.
    Especially our discussion. The fact that Facebook. So honor trying to avoid. responsibility.
    Okay, so any other people who haven't commented, yet the like to. add anything
    to this from your discussions in the chat. So. The other one that was in the news,
    and I heard about this on CBC last weekend. How many of you know who David topic
    is. very easy YouTube content creator. there's an article here is this links to.
    The podcast. transcript. been found to be. Not being too strict with the content
    and encourages on this platform. So this. youtuber. and Then very successful.
    And he's. then called the generation said. Jimmy fallon. and Anyone. Anyone here
    Jimmy fallon before. Okay. I don't know if he's kind of. Oh it's a Saturday live
    years ago I mean even as on the tonight show. Still. That is you tonight show
    is doing very well up until I know 2016 when you lost. A lot of audience, I think.
    Anyway, I was just making that comment, a little bit. facetiously. Thanks for.
    The. matter of consent, but it's also a matter of. sexual assault. Accusations
    level that. at him as well. So the question is. Is YouTube doing enough to. in
    force. or police the content that's created for the platform or. Is it youtube's
    responsibility to do that. And what kind of regulations are. Appropriate what
    kind of. rules need to be in place. Okay, so I won't give you i'll try the Washington
    Post article. No, I will. I had another one. This is the one. I judged to be most
    reputable for as a new source amongst those providers. Okay, so. let's have a
    shorter breakout session seven minutes and then we'll come back and talk about
    this. Okay. Okay. Any any insights and your discussions. Any comments to share.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think our group kind of came down to who's responsible ability is it is
    it the company's responsibility to do something or the consumers right to do something
    or responsibility to do something. So I think we really came down to it'll come
    to that, as if consumers aren't happy with something they should not use that
    product and things if you don't agree with David. philbrick don't watch his stuff
    and then, as you don't watch his stuff then well no company is going to sponsor
    him if his videos aren't getting the views right.
  persid: S04
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So I think just comes down to like somewhere between there like ideally consumers
    hold the power, but not always true. So, then I think we came down to that argument
    of. Consumer versus producer. responsibilities.

  persid: S13
- desc: okie dokie
  persid: S13
- desc: 'breakout room: case study discussion of news article'
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it went alright, some people had trouble getting to the article though
  persid: S01
- desc: I think both the government, Uber and lyft need to work togheter using the
    collected data while following ACM ethics 2.5
  persid: S05
- desc: '*together'
  persid: S05
- desc: 2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their
    impacts, including analysis of possible risks.
  persid: S05
- desc: basically be transparent as possible, nothing behind closed doors
  persid: S05
- desc: One person in our group pointed out that sharing information could be in breach
    of 1.6, 1.7 - and that that data could be used for attacks of areas where there
    is a lot of travel.
  persid: S13
- desc: I also think 3.7 is relevant in this case "as the level of adoption changes,
    the ethical responsibilities of the organization or group are likely to change
    as well"
  persid: S13
- desc: how long a person uses a service, where, what time, how old (if they input
    that), etc
  persid: S05
- desc: I think it can be fairly personal data
  persid: S05
- desc: oil and gas companies knew about global warming in the 80's
  persid: S04
- desc: even earlier actually, I've seen some reports from the 70s with projections.
    horrifying
  persid: S13
- desc: hmm interesting
  persid: S04
- desc: he made that film in 1958 apparently wow
  persid: S13
- desc: that's what I thought lol
  persid: S13
- desc: '1.1: How well do these technologies meet accessibility, social needs, and
    respect diversity'
  persid: S17
- desc: no ide
  persid: S16

  persid: S13
- desc: Never heard of him
  persid: S18
- desc: Yes ofc
  persid: S17
- desc: Yap
  persid: S19
- desc: Yes lol
  persid: S01
- desc: Has anyone here not heard of jimmy fallon?
  persid: S04
- desc: i mean he has his own night show now i would be surprised if people didn't
    know him. i know him from SNL tho
  persid: S13
- desc: David used to post comedy content on YouTube with the group of his friends
    called the "Vlog Squad" and included some questionable skits. Some people in the
    videos are coming out and saying they didn't consent to some of the clips being
    posted.
  persid: S20
- desc: Honestly there is such a high volume of content being posted every day, I
    wonder how possible it is to properly regulate the sheer amount of infractions
    that occur
  persid: S13
- desc: "Reading the story, they seemed pretty fine with the content being posted\
    \ at the time. It was only years later once the guy was rich off of it that they\
    \ had a problem. Doesn\u2019t really seem like a YouTube problem to me."
  persid: S21
- desc: yes, YouTube in particular should not be the only platform taking in everything,
    its too much for them even right now
  persid: S05
- desc: It seems to go off how popular the people are
  persid: S04

  persid: DHH

  persid: S08
- desc: keegan has his hand up
  persid: S13
- desc: the accused guy is being smart and going away from Social media for a bit
  persid: S05
- desc: using his right to remain silent
  persid: S05
- desc: Where any of the sexual misconduct videos uploaded to YouTube? If not, I don't
    really see how it is their responsibility
  persid: S18
- desc: Ya I dont understand how this could really be put on YouTube.
  persid: S21
- desc: Our group agreed that there is a lapse in regulations when YouTube deals with
    creators who have a higher fan base and are well established on the platform
  persid: S09
- desc: just look at any Cardi B video compared to anyone who even says the word H
    E L L
  persid: S05
- desc: So Yug I would say that people shouldn't watch him then
  persid: S04
- desc: Yeah. It seems certain people are almost allowed to bend the rules a bit.
    But I think organizations should try to be more forward thinking with whom they
    sponsor.
  persid: S11
- desc: But if he has a mass viewership (who might be children) aren't there potential
    harms?
  persid: S13
- desc: parents should control what their children watch
  persid: S05
- desc: The video in question is borderline inappropriate for the guidelines of YouTube.
    It mostly has to do with a prank and the victim being upset with what happened
    to him.
  persid: S20
- desc: not everyone is tech savvy but parents should learn
  persid: S05
- desc: Arent there other laws outside of youtube to stop content like that from staying
    up?
  persid: S04
- desc: DMCA which sucks @$$
  persid: S05
- desc: Because like people have said, youtube will keep up whatever makes them money.
    So if you want it regulated youd have to go outside of youtube to
  persid: S04
- desc: I think that's what's happening now, lawyers are getting involved.
  persid: S20
- desc: Yes and as we have discussed previously, controversy and negative thoughts
    are "cheap" and therefore get a lot of engagement.
  persid: S13
- desc: Take care
  persid: S01
- desc: oh profeesor I have a question not related to class
  persid: S23
