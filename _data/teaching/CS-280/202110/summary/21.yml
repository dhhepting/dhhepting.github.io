Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning, everyone. Okay. So. it's winter again hey. The next day or two
    anyway. So any thoughts about our speaker last week.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That was great I had no idea that organization even existed, so that was good,
    you know.
  persid: S01
- desc: Usually it's something I mentioned everybody that longest continuously department
    in Canada. there's some question about what's. So accreditation as a department.
    is one thing and then accreditation of yourselves as. Computer professionals is
    another thing. Here, let me. Do something on the web. For today's meeting I got
    the responses. together here. So I read on this a little bit so. This is. These
    are the responses. And I tried to. Identifying information. A couple of people
    who first identifying information in each time. So I. Remove. This is going to
    be on the public website. And then I thought, because we're limited to 100 words.
    So I have the original data. The identified. And i'm just for the display i'm
    putting it in words that we talked about. So in the summary of the meeting from
    last week. The transcription the audio. So our speaker. I think appears as. one.
    See. well. Yes. Okay, if I wasn't sharing my screen so that. it's a little bit
    less informative isn't it sorry about that. Okay, so let me check out see. here.
    Okay, so. David and then. The responses to meetings. Ideally I would like to just
    have it as a have an opening time that the the forums don't have an open time.
    So I will endeavor to. Ask the questions, no more timely fashion. I think ultimately
    i've chosen the wrong instrument to. For these responses. Online text. text. Alright,
    so very popular in the chat today, but nobody wants to. Use the microphone. The
    chat window here a little bit. that's do today. was extended a week exactly. So
    if you submitted on Thursday, then it's a 10%. penalty. Okay, so. Let me take
    care. Okay, so here's the password. In the chat and on screen. So the idea of
    the assignment about the empathy map is to. have some empathy for. The process
    of doing the onboarding. For proctor track. So we're not going to be using it
    for our exam. Have a discussion about. The practice test as well. Okay, so a couple
    of polls here for based on last meeting. So the first one is about certification.
    So certification, important to you, yes, no, or only if it's required for employment.
    So watch that. give it a couple of minutes for that. responding. winning. answer
    is only if required for employment. will explore that a little bit. Here today
    in. breakout rooms. Another guest. In class so i've got a Pole, for that so. Yes
    or no for. First, is no not another guest in class, yes, from an employer perspective,
    yes, from a recruiting perspective and, yes, for another perspective. give people
    a little more time to reply to that current poll. Alright, so. Nine people voted
    for not another guest. 30 so the most popular responses, yes, from an employer
    perspective. closely by yes from a recruiting perspective. And then, yes to another.
    20%. So i'm going to type in a question to the chat to we can reply to you. Or
    we can even discuss using the microphones. Okay, so question what is. Driving
    you'd like to see. That relates to the pole have. Another guest in class. So pull
    it i'm still sharing it should be visible on your screen says another guest in
    class question mark no yes, an employer yes recruiter yes either. So. But what's.
    So i'm particularly interested in the people who said yes other. As a way to.
    Okay. Okay. Okay, so please don't send me direct messages. Okay, so let me talk
    about Philips comment. comment is. Definitely out of the scope. of our class but.
    I think it professionalism as a discussion is. This is the scope of the class.
    and I think there is some questions that Thomas has left open about. What, how
    do we decide what are it professional jobs. So let me ask a quick question about
    the exam the empathy map assignment. Project deliverable. Stop reading. Well,
    focus on typing a question. So the question for the breakout room is Australia
    and island. Just kidding. mom is from saskatchewan I believe. The kind of connection
    that. is in practice. So is it possible to act professionally without certification
    if so. supplement here's the tips ethics page. The question clear enough i'll
    make it i'll send you off to breakout rooms. Now. we'll See you in 10 minutes,
    and you can ask for help, if you want. Okay, so we're back. size of breakout room
    much better today. Okay, so. We have three or four people talking. When there's
    10 or 11 people in the room, then that's better than. Having. One person talking
    when it's four or five people in the room. So anyone want to share what the discussion
    was about and I don't want to hear anything about. Australia, being an island.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, I in our group. We talked a lot about the, the number of options out
    there that there's a lot of paths to demonstrating your skill set and your knowledge,
    including certifications kits and otherwise and. undergraduate degrees, we talked
    about the fact that none of these things is by itself, necessary and that it's
    kind of attractive to to have a lot of paths to demonstrating that you're a professional
    but. We also talked about the limitations of organizations like kits and their
    ethical certifications in the sense that. it's almost impossible to get one industry
    wide standard in one industry wide organization that certifies all computing professionals
    by just by nature of how huge the field is there's. going to be a lot of smaller
    organizations like caps that have a smaller jurisdiction and we sort of have this
    big jumbled puzzle of ethical frameworks, if that makes any sense I. think my
    colleagues expressed it much better than i'm explaining it.
  persid: S02
- desc: Oh, that sounds good. i'm not sure that there are too many. Professional designations
    in Canada, I mean if you do if you're in. Here in the software systems engineering
    program, then you get a different there's a different path, but there's also a
    certification. A professional certification. But, in general, though the. The
    computing field is. Not like medicine rainy or or the. Or the Bar Association
    for lawyers, where you need to be a member. Of the professional group in order
    to. be certified to practice. In a jurisdiction. Because I think competing as
    much more results oriented isn't that. You can write code. And you're willing
    to. Work on some projects, then. OK. So the benefit. Of a membership in a professional
    societies more than just the certification. I would say. So you work defines you.
    And also, maybe your. you're also defined by the company you keep. So if you're.
    On your own and not belong to a group. You don't benefit from the. From the. status
    of the group. anyone else, like to share a comment about this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Actually, I was wondering if people lose their certifications if they are
    unethical.
  persid: S03
- desc: If the people who are the certifications still might still act unethically.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah. Well, I think that's.

- desc: good morning
  persid: S04
- desc: Good Morning!
  persid: S05
- desc: I hate winter
  persid: S06
- desc: You never know when it flips around
  persid: S05
- desc: its so drastic! +16 this friday
  persid: S07
- desc: Hey professor, is there any way that you could open up the class response
    forum earlier after each class? I completed my response on Thursday and it wasn't
    available until Monday at noon. I even checked monday morning. As a result, I
    didn't get the mark for my effort, so I would appreciate an earlier forum opening
    time. Thanks!
  persid: S08
- desc: sorry what are we talking about?
  persid: S09
- desc: I mean id be more interested to hear about what people who hire think. I know
    people who always got a job without cips
  persid: S10
- desc: "^ David\u2026 I get more and more frustrated with this each class :("
  persid: S11
- desc: Professor I sent you my 20th meeting response on your email.
  persid: S07
- desc: what is that map assignment?
  persid: S12
- desc: 3 pages-ish of using proctortrack and what you think, feel, say and do. Also
    how to improve proctortrack from your experiance
  persid: S07
- desc: Is the prof sharing his screen?
  persid: S05
- desc: nope
  persid: S13
- desc: Is it possible to get a little more time for the maps assignment, unsure if
    anyone else feels the same but I realised this was due this week during the weekend
    and havn't had much time to figure out proctortrack. Unless its easier than I
    think?
  persid: S14
- desc: yes please
  persid: S15
- desc: Yes Please
  persid: S16
- desc: yes please
  persid: S17
- desc: is there an attendance code?
  persid: S18
- desc: An extension will be helpful
  persid: S15
- desc: yes please
  persid: S19
- desc: I think it was already extended almost a week
  persid: S20
- desc: not yet mario
  persid: S14
- desc: can we submit it on Thursday?
  persid: S21
- desc: just a couple more days will be helpful too
  persid: S17
- desc: I feel the same was. I feel like we need to talk about the empathy map at
    some point before it is due
  persid: S22
- desc: I usually like more time but the empathy map is very straight forward. I got
    it all done in 3 hours this morning
  persid: S07
- desc: way*
  persid: S22
- desc: We have talked about it in class
  persid: S10
- desc: 'To anyone who hasn''t done the onboarding with Proctortrack, be warned: save
    everything ahead of time. It closed all of my open applications (including LibreOffice)
    without any warning and without saving anything.'
  persid: S02
- desc: I even had fun recording myself talking about a movie (its part of the proctortrack
    quiz)
  persid: S07
- desc: lol true@ Michael
  persid: S23
- desc: thank Michael, that actually saved me because I was going to do it on the
    side as I did other things
  persid: S14
- desc: "For me it didn\u2019t detect the microphone at all. Even though nothing was\
    \ wrong"
  persid: S24
- desc: Might be helpful to just post the question for the rest of the forums now
    so you don't forget
  persid: S25
- desc: Good point by Michael, I lost some work data due to proctortrack lol
  persid: S13
- desc: I had to use a different device
  persid: S24
- desc: 'Would it be okay if I sent you my #20 by email? And rip Philip :('
  persid: S08
- desc: David, I did already. go ahead I say
  persid: S07
- desc: noted dude, thanks
  persid: S08
- desc: Was the attendance code posted? I may have missed it
  persid: S26
- desc: Proctortrack closed the word document I was doing the assignment on and I
    lost everything haha
  persid: S25
- desc: nope aden
  persid: S14
- desc: U are supposed to keep the proctor track on ???????
  persid: S27
- desc: lol
  persid: S27
- desc: "I was doing mine in browser in Google docs, didn\u2019t lose anything if\
    \ anyone needs an alternative"
  persid: S20
- desc: Me too Nicholas
  persid: S28
- desc: Same nicholas
  persid: S29
- desc: you guys are lucky, I had previous proffs who made me use proctortrack
  persid: S07
- desc: Yeah, force closed my OneNote but asked if I wanted to close discord. Priorities.
  persid: S30
- desc: I think the video posted on the website of the guy doing proctortrack onboarding
    is pretty accurate for reference while writing
  persid: S26
- desc: Didn't even think of doing it that way, Aden. Good idea
  persid: S25
- desc: "Proctortrack was incredibly invasive in my laptop\u2019s privacy. I was very\
    \ uncomfortable providing it access to most things that most of my other apps\
    \ don\u2019t have access to"
  persid: S31
- desc: attendance password??
  persid: S32
- desc: i guess you should know about the proctor track onboarding if u don't know
    than try for it and after you close write your experience. i think it is best
    way to go.
  persid: S33
- desc: No attendance yet
  persid: S20
- desc: I had a proctortrack session ask me to disconnect my second monitor... :|
  persid: S07
- desc: BEcause dual montiors wasnt allowed on it haha
  persid: S10
- desc: "Same here, I can\u2019t use my main monitor so I had to switch computers\
    \ to do it"
  persid: S20
- desc: Wow that sounds incredibly sus
  persid: S34
- desc: I have chem final proctored but there are tables and and other stuff that
    we are supposed to use during exams, idk how I woukd use them with prototrack
  persid: S35
- desc: Mandeep, if you are worried, take all the files out of your computer, use
    prostate exam and the factory settings the computer
  persid: S07
- desc: The host can enable proctor track to allow certain programs
  persid: S10
- desc: '*then'
  persid: S07
- desc: use a virtual box, no risk to any files on your machine
  persid: S05
- desc: Yug you cant use a VM it checks for tha
  persid: S10
- desc: Could be flagged and wanted as cheating though
  persid: S20
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: Do we only do the onboarding part or do we do the practice test as well?
  persid: S20
- desc: proctotrack should not have been invented
  persid: S35
- desc: both are the same test for the most part
  persid: S07
- desc: both will ask what is the capital of Saskatchewan and what is the weather
    like
  persid: S07
- desc: '...offhand but why is Greenland the biggest island? is it not Australia?'
  persid: S07
- desc: australia is 4x larger?
  persid: S10
- desc: probably saw one of those wrong world map where Greenland is as big as africa
  persid: S09
- desc: found same hing in many other places too
  persid: S09
- desc: Australia is classified as a continent and hence it is not a contender for
    the biggest island
  persid: S05
- desc: that, does not make much sense
  persid: S09
- desc: Whether or not something is a continent has no bearing on whether it is an
    island
  persid: S02
- desc: island definition is literally != bigger than continent.
  persid: S34
- desc: mainland Australia is smaller than Australia+tasmania+new Zealand, makes it
    an island lol
  persid: S09
- desc: bros island is something that is surrounded by water on all sides and something
    that is not a continent
  persid: S35
- desc: hmmm, Wikipedia seems to agree with Shrey! well, today I learned
  persid: S02
- desc: "\u201CAustralia is technically an island [...] but it is more commonly considered\
    \ a continental landmass.\u201D Greenland is the largest non Australia island"
  persid: S20
- desc: (assuming Wikipedia is correct)
  persid: S02
- desc: Actually Shrey, island would have to require fixed mass (so not ice sheets,
    Antarctica). It also requires that it is not a continent (so something could be
    bigger than Australia, not a continent, and an island, theoretically.
  persid: S11
- desc: '....to the Geology faculty! Banananan!'
  persid: S07
- desc: Agreed. It's an interesting jumble of logic and landmass.
  persid: S34
- desc: its simple and logical
  persid: S35
- desc: It also has to do with the fact that Australia sits on its own tectonic plate,
    whereas Greenland doesn't
  persid: S05
- desc: Australia is a continent that's why its not an island!!!!!!
  persid: S35
- desc: there are some weird stuff with geology. Caspian sea is ompletely surrounded
    by land, makes it a lake, worlds largest one at that, but everyone calls it a
    sea
  persid: S09
- desc: Whoa, boom! @Yug with the definition of a continent now :)
  persid: S11
- desc: 'Breakout room discussion: Is Australia an island?'
  persid: S08
- desc: hhahahhahhahah
  persid: S36
- desc: Might have more participation rate for it
  persid: S10
- desc: lol
  persid: S14
- desc: "Question : What is an example of \u201Cother\u201D you\u2019d like to see?"
  persid: DHH
- desc: what do you mean by other sry I zoned out
  persid: S14
- desc: oh I see
  persid: S14
- desc: maybe we could have our
  persid: S06
- desc: a researcher
  persid: S37
- desc: a researcher sounds cool
  persid: S14
- desc: a researcher
  persid: S38
- desc: like a researcher talking about their role in a project
  persid: S14
- desc: software engineer
  persid: S32
- desc: guys poll is already done
  persid: S35
- desc: Honestly it will be great for us if we get a guest from computer profession
    because it would be a great opportunity to explore about  jobs
  persid: S39
- desc: Basically I am good for all of them like I am neutral
  persid: S40
- desc: "I voted \u201Cno\u201D, but if we are having another guest I would like a\
    \ really intriguing philosopher/deep-thinker. Somebody to provoke thought and\
    \ challenge how we think"
  persid: S11
- desc: Justin trudeau
  persid: S41
- desc: '@Neha agreed, I''m always down for anything career related'
  persid: S08
- desc: smith going big
  persid: S14
- desc: It will be great to have IT Professionals
  persid: S42
- desc: agreed with @Neha
  persid: S15
- desc: agreed with smith
  persid: S35
- desc: lol
  persid: S08
- desc: "I\u2019m not so interested in career/work stuff in this class. There are\
    \ other places for that, and it doesn\u2019t align with the scope of this course."
  persid: S11
- desc: That is a good point
  persid: S08
- desc: The guy from Regina and then Freakin NASA was awesome, perhaps someone from
    Boston Dynamics as well
  persid: S07
- desc: "Right. Networking is what I was saying probably isn\u2019t"
  persid: S11
- desc: elon is from it right?
  persid: S35
- desc: we can have elon
  persid: S35
- desc: hey, using software to control a robot can come to mind!
  persid: S07
- desc: Heads up, project is also due In like 9 days
  persid: S08
- desc: It would not affect if someone has done EM he can submit and start project
  persid: S38
- desc: ^ April is here unfortunatly
  persid: S14
- desc: Admittedly I'm far less concerned about the Empathy Map than the final project
    as we already got an entire extra week to work on the EM. I'm swamped and a little
    more time to work on the project would take some of the pressure off for me.
  persid: S36
- desc: me too, our group better start with combining our coding and such
  persid: S07
- desc: My problem with the project is Dont we have to wait for the response for your
    proposal?
  persid: S10
- desc: I would like the project's deadline extended
  persid: S35
- desc: Empathy map took me like 40 minutes last night, pushing it back causes issue
    with the research project timing I feel
  persid: S30
- desc: and we also get our feedbacks for the proposal we submitted to know if we
    should carry on with what we had in mind
  persid: S23
- desc: Pushing back to Thursday (2 days)
  persid: S11
- desc: can*
  persid: S23
- desc: I would like some type of feedback from project proposal
  persid: S26
- desc: I'd rather have the project deadline pushed back and receive feedback on the
    proposal before it's due
  persid: S25
- desc: ^yeah that would be better
  persid: S05
- desc: Yet to get feedback from the project proposal
  persid: S42
- desc: what do we have for our final exam?
  persid: S35
- desc: I think the project due date is much more important to extend than the empathy
    map due date just because of its size. So if we choose one to extend, I'd really
    appreciate the project having an extension
  persid: S08
- desc: yea
  persid: S23
- desc: maybe talk to him in his office hours for feedback is my best guess if you
    want it early
  persid: S14
- desc: EM is fine. project is the matter.
  persid: S43
- desc: I think bonus marks should be awarded to students who finish the assignments
    on time if we are going to push back the deadline.
  persid: S44
- desc: 2 people getting ahead of themselves and submitting the Project Deliverable
    already. The real MVPs...
  persid: S11
- desc: Wow!
  persid: S42
- desc: interesting name Zoom User...
  persid: S07
- desc: is User german?
  persid: S07
- desc: ITs straight and to the point
  persid: S10
- desc: very accurate name
  persid: S10
- desc: Honestly bless you Daryl
  persid: S36
- desc: Thank you for doing that prof :)
  persid: S08
- desc: oh dang
  persid: S14
- desc: what would we have for final?
  persid: S35
- desc: Yeah, thanks for listening to our recommendations!
  persid: S45
- desc: Since my CS 476 is due tomorrow, pushing the empathy map to Thursday allows
    me to work an extra hour or whatever on 476 today (my Thursday is wide open).
  persid: S11
- desc: Not too picky either way though
  persid: S11
- desc: ^^
  persid: S46
- desc: A personal extension for that might be better in that case
  persid: S20
- desc: I agree with Phillip
  persid: S03
- desc: I agree with Philip, I also have CS 476 due tomorrow
  persid: S17
- desc: Yeh same
  persid: S46
- desc: "Depends on how many it\u2019ll effect though"
  persid: S20
- desc: I have an assignment due tomorrow so I agree with Phillip as well
  persid: S47
- desc: If you guys find the time to do the EM, it is honestly the easiest assignment
    on the planet (the only hard part is accepting that horrid ProctorTrack on your
    computer)
  persid: S07
- desc: Thank you!
  persid: S03
- desc: Thank you :)
  persid: S15
- desc: Thank you so much
  persid: S46
- desc: thanks much!!
  persid: S48
- desc: ^ Shareef, I do expect that to be the case. Nice not to divert my train of
    thought from the 476 project though (worth 100% of the weighted grade in that
    class)
  persid: S11
- desc: Hahha :)
  persid: S11

  persid: S14

    If so, why is it important? Discuss.'

  persid: S05

  persid: S11
- desc: More people was a good idea
  persid: S08

  persid: S58
- desc: I mean we had 3-4 people talking instead of 2
  persid: S10
- desc: or none lol
  persid: S36
- desc: it seemed to provoke much more discussion
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah, it was better
  persid: S22
- desc: we discussed Austraila being an island for the last minute
  persid: S07
- desc: Yeah much better
  persid: S59
- desc: Better because we actually had a discussion (last time I was alone with 3
    silent people)
  persid: S11
- desc: lmao much better, last time it was just 2 of us
  persid: S35
- desc: mine had only me and one other talking
  persid: S14
- desc: Better than 1 talk in a room of 5
  persid: S30
- desc: nice
  persid: S33
- desc: Better than nothing yeah
  persid: S20
- desc: Why should we have to pay every year for a certification skill, we acquired
    and very will have it for the rest of our lives? And is this ethical?
  persid: S05
- desc: Was some good discussion this time
  persid: S20
- desc: "Yeah. 3 of 10 is better than 1 of 5 because there\u2019s a discussion"
  persid: S11
- desc: haha
  persid: S08
- desc: xD
  persid: S57
- desc: oh shoot, there goes my discussion
  persid: S13
- desc: I think it is possible to act professionally without certification. Tech is
    a very 'loose' field educationally, so I think there are multiple ways to achieve
    professionalism, including, but not limited to, certification, education, and
    work experience.
  persid: S08
- desc: I am not paying $200 just to label someone that I am ethically certified.
    My work defines me!
  persid: S35
- desc: "It doesn\u2019t defines the firm though"
  persid: S41
- desc: Oh my mistake, I think I slightly misinterpreted the question
  persid: S08
- desc: Also if you have a membership with a group there are accountability processes
    that can ensure that you're representing that group accordingly
  persid: S36
- desc: I am fine with the membership if it comes with a number of different benefits,
    however, if it is solely for the purpose of keeping the certificate, then I wouldn't
    want to pay
  persid: S05
- desc: "Not a compelling enough narrative for me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll choose\
    \ to have a membership with CIPS. Their value-proposition isn\u2019t worth jumping\
    \ through the hoops to me, especially not any ongoing hoops, and not to mention\
    \ ongoing fees."
  persid: S11
- desc: The certificate is good to have but realistically, I don't think it helps
    with getting a job
  persid: S13
- desc: I think if an employer wants to make their employees certified, they will
    have the cost
  persid: S07
- desc: I think joining a social group that codes and puts on community activities
    would be good. Like that group on campus that hosts hack-a-thons
  persid: S11
- desc: I believe it definitely helps with "getting" a job, but certain certifications
    might be better at preparing you for specific jobs like diplomas from polytech
  persid: S22
- desc: Microsoft certification is good
  persid: S41
- desc: I would say certifications of commonly used softwar is more important than
    cips. Seeing as cips gives it to all uni students in regina. This doesnt mean
    you know how to use the software that a company needs used
  persid: S10
- desc: I feel like certification are great for knowledge, like a "I know how to do
    this", they feel less impactful when its a certificate saying "I will act this
    way"
  persid: S30
- desc: I 100% agree with Keegan
  persid: S13
- desc: like a driver's licence. "I promise I can drive and drive safely"?
  persid: S07
- desc: As far as networking goes, however, I have been advantaged by my work terms
    and am not worrying about finding work / proving myself
  persid: S11
- desc: I think the point where CIPS will be valued highly is when it's treated like
    a professional practices college, if that makes sense. Im not sure if those are
    the right words
  persid: S08
- desc: Shareef a drivers license you take a test that states you know how to drive
    a vehicle. Notevery kind of vehicle however
  persid: S10
- desc: "I am thankful that we don\u2019t have a gatekeeping society. Lots of room\
    \ in the world for bad programmers / I.T. people. Lots of room for good ones to\
    \ stand out"
  persid: S11
- desc: IT doesnt promise you will drive safely
  persid: S10
- desc: that's my point, it proves competence
  persid: S07
- desc: not promises
  persid: S07
- desc: Thank you for class today, I appreciate the extensions and clarifications
    on the assignments as well. Take care
  persid: S08
- desc: Thanks Daryl! Good discussion :)
  persid: S36
- desc: ohhh makes more sense
  persid: S10
- desc: Thank you for class :)
  persid: S11
- desc: Thanks!
  persid: S45
- desc: Thanks ^__^
  persid: S57
- desc: Take care!
  persid: S30
- desc: thank you
  persid: S60
- desc: thank you
  persid: S32
- desc: Thanks Daryl, Have a nice day!
  persid: S05
- desc: hi prof, I have a question?
  persid: S53
- desc: Can you come to my office hour today?
  persid: DHH
- desc: yes, thanks
