- desc: Good morning. here's a chance to test your microphone good morning. Good morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good morning morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: morning, sir.
  persid: S02
- desc: Good morning does anyone ever see the movie wanted pythons meaning of life.
    And it just occurred to me that. The fish in the tank and then we're going to
    say well look harold's being after around for good mornings and. Anyway, if you
    like, Monty Python naked that's the opening better than movies. was your weekend.
    Good morning. Okay, so I. tried to do things and yes there's a new password for
    attendance, which I will share with you shortly. Okay, so somebody sent me a direct
    message so. As I said before. I. turned it off, but I guess not. So please try
    to avoid sending the direct messages. feeling to communicate with me directly,
    outside of class, you can do, though, female. So that's the general rule just
    reiterate. Okay. going to be. engage the moment the password comes out and. can
    find it in your chat room chat archive then. Then you can put it in and do the
    attendance it tenses it's supposed to be a big thing. So. don't worry about. Past
    ones. Because this past this past. Okay. So just the comment of I appreciate everyone's
    engagement with the meetings. And I realized that I probably gave you the wrong
    impression start with. I said that I was like. On the day that was cut short because
    of my emergency, then I had to. I said well just summarize things. Really, I would
    rather have to. Not summarizing some matches. Tell me about what you. thought
    was the most important thing, or what you learned, or what was. hard to understand
    or well as exciting. You know you don't have to provide it along summary. Of what
    we discussed or what the movie what the videos showed. And so on so i'm just.
    cringing either say, less is more but make it with a bit more of a. Personal connection.
    So let me go to your courses. I can. change things up a little. bit here in the
    description. response. To the most recent meeting. And you can tell me i'm trying
    to get to the point where it to save so. So today's meeting five so you have until
    tomorrow night at one minute to midnight, in order to get ready response to. This
    meeting today. So your response can include one or more of the following most
    important thing you learned from the past meeting. concept from this past meeting
    that was most difficult for you to understand what would you what you would like
    to know more about something you encountered thats related to the meeting. My
    use of past meeting. over the top. More. Anyone suggestion more clear wording
    if the wording is not clear.
  persid: DHH
- desc: make sense to me.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I read some of them and i'm. I made some. Some notes. All but I didn't
    well anyway. So I find it very interesting what you've written, so we just say
    that. Okay. I realize i'm not sharing my screen. put it into one form here the
    engagement meetings form. Originally, because I was advised that this is this
    would let me do what I want to do. But it's not letting me do exactly what I want
    to do so. So for meaning five here's the form.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And click.
  persid: ???
- desc: So i'm not asking detailed question here. i'm just asking for a response or
    responses, the discussion. And then response question mark is the question. Okay,
    so we'll have one of these forums for every meeting from now on. And they'll be
    set up, so that there. They become read only at the same time, the due date. i'm
    going so I know there's some discussion about breakout rooms. And so on there
    so i'm going to create a. Separate form under meetings. where you can. discuss
    a topic from. well. want to talk about what you discussed in the breakout room.
    Then there's this form here. Okay. So I said, the first assignment is going to
    be due on. Thursday February. And I thought that might be. You can still submit
    it then. Acceptable until February 25 22nd the first day back. So Monday is the
    first day back after the break. Okay. So this is to pick a topic from once you
    discover we're discussing are covering in class this Matthew one that we've already
    talked about. is currently or was recently in the news. find a personal connection
    to the topic. identify two to four reputable online sources to reference and supportive
    your topic. References or could be included as hyperlinks at the post close to
    the texts that makes reference. And then i've included some. Some principles for
    good writing for the web. And there's a sample blog that I wrote a little while
    ago. So what i'd like you to do is. To create to mark up the file html. And you
    can submit it as a file or is online text so you can paste it is online text or
    create a file. and upload that. So i've created individual student blogs. See
    space where you can. Work on formatting. So. Then. So there's a submission, you
    can use this. This your courses submission to either upload the file or paste
    is online text. And then you can optionally. copy or blog from your individual
    student blog and put it into your put into the class blog. And i'll be kind of
    evidence of participation. Okay, so. engagement of meetings is really just about
    making those responses and everything else is about participation. Okay. So, and
    just. just another comment about the engagement within the meetings. So there's
    26 meetings, all together, and we started doing this meeting to. That. you'll
    have a few free free ones, so if you started meeting. And do the rest of them,
    then you'll still be able to get 10 marks. So. i'm so started, we started meeting
    to. i'm going to. So that means we get 25 different marks for these meeting comments
    responses. And i'm going to take the top 20. That make sense. So you don't have
    to. respond to every meeting to get full marks. respond to 19 meetings, then.
    You won't get full marks. I mean. Okay, so there's that. So I wanted to get make
    sure that was open clear for everybody for for progressed any further. window
    and it shows the people who are in class was on top of the window that showed
    what. Or it gives me updates or notification to what's going on and to. So. it's
    not. The best way to not the best place to put notifications, for me, anyway.
    Because, by the time I see that this one there and then cover it then Scott. Maybe
    that's a feature, not a bug. Okay. Okay, so I haven't. Completely gotten the plan
    and the summary sorted out yet so I started making notes about what was. I did
    do the plan. For today, which includes the videos. Alright, so then here's. I
    mentioned, please know the summary, the meeting is not what i'm after for an engagement,
    please read the description thanks for your engagement. So everything's appreciate
    it. it's just. Since there's like 150 students here. Almost it's low. Everybody
    writes the page then it's a little harder to get through them. And the message
    of oh what. What was the most important thing today. Anyway, okay. Second thing
    first, so this is what I got. On my computer last night. So for the client is
    vpn. client, so if i'm going to access. grade. input grades and do other kinds
    of things from home I better have a vpn running, otherwise I can't access can't
    login to the university systems. So already this permission is required for for
    for protection. So MAC os reading for the client from accessing some folders please
    enable full disk access permission for for decline processes oh. Another actually
    reading it out yeah I see that it's mentioned in the name. So. Oh. That kind of
    takes the wind out of my sails. But it's not very clear. It took me seeing this
    more than once, to see this actually mentioned. So anyway so pretending that I
    didn't see that. I can go by and. click on open security and privacy settings.
    On the left, here we can see full disk access. Which when it first came up I changed
    the see could see that it was highlighted I scroll a little bit to highlight this
    full disk access it wasn't even. Showing to begin with. And so I see for the client.
    And it's got a check mark. Listen here's one that this. And then here's the, the
    process is asking for. So now, I know that I can do that. So, my comment was.
    My feeling was that this is likely for the client. But. it's not quite clear that
    should be. The the association, I mean like I can just call it so for the client.
    So, again back to this one. Name clear enough. about putting it up here in the
    heading or something like that. name this name appears in the dialog box. I have
    a good amount of. Trust to do it. Making too much. So here, I was listening to
    ideas last night and CBC is driving around getting some cat food. And I thought
    it was a very interesting discussion about. Trust and scientific expertise. So
    there's a link here to CBC. invite you to read that. headline is interesting,
    is it the philosopher science. who's speaking, who gave a talk, I think it was
    a world vaccine conference recently. it's concerned that voice assistant encourages
    delegation of judgment to algorithms. So do we put too much trust in algorithms
    and is it only because of. alexa and other. Other cool gadgets. example of. Asking
    for a chocolate chip cookie recipe. So if we ask the voice assistant for the chocolate
    chip cookie recipe replies immediately, but it doesn't say. You know this is highly
    rated or this was recommended by your mom or. This case came from a from the site
    that you, you seem you visit a lot or anything I just gives a recipe, and then.
    And then it's a concern to see. You know, are we concerned about these details
    or do we just accept the results given to us by alexa. Because it's got a fancy
    algorithm that must be Morse. more accurate than. People. Like like our mom or
    and or. friend who's a chef pastry chef. So I was thinking about. Creating a filter
    bubble experiment. So I think we can. We can try. The breakout room. Okay. So
    let me. write this out as i'm doing it. Okay, does that seem clear for a question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep that's clear.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Are you wanting to skip over the ads or use the top add as a result.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: I that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: advertisement.
  persid: ???
- desc: advertisement results. URL here okay. Can I turn that off right. Okay, so
    take a man to do that now. Results are. sally's baking addiction all recipes so
    he's baking addiction or recipes. I got two contenders here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's crazy how much they've converged like there's no there's no variety.
  persid: S03
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: ???
- desc: There is some really good certain organization on sally's making predictions
    part.
  persid: S06
- desc: Am I be. Here is one joy for sunshine.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So there's a third one.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well, I think sally's baking is shown to almost everyone, because it has the
    highest rating. And after that comes all recipes rating so maybe that's why people
    are getting only those two.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah it is. A question about. Which one comes first.
  persid: DHH
- desc: relevancy if I saw a video and Google, it was mostly come from YouTube.
  persid: S08
- desc: So I think we get different results if we all looked it up on YouTube like.
  persid: S09
- desc: got an ad for Dell instead. Normal.
  persid: S10
- desc: Know what's normal.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I.
  persid: S11
- desc: wonder if logging into it and accounts might have affected your search results
    as well.
  persid: S12
- desc: yeah well, so you can try it in different cases.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I like the cold audit that we did, though, where it was just no extra factors
    just do it right now and see what you get.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah so it's not we're not quite so much a filter bubble, and then I realized,
    too, that these disease recipe displays a little bit tougher to organize them.
    So did.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And recipes recipes might also be less subject to a filter bubbles, and something
    more political.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so let's try another one what's a good. A good one that one inflamed
    tensions in the classroom. About. governor general of Canada. Since she recently
    resigned. or or how about. Something related to covert vaccines. We try could
    just do a covert 19. search. let's test here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: 19 is going to be location based if the location services are on its it's
    gonna show the local, provincial governments website at first.
  persid: S06
- desc: I go to hulu international. I mean, who wanted organizations website.
  persid: S07
- desc: Oh yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: International and then coven 19 Ontario.
  persid: S13
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S14
- desc: yeah same here.
  persid: S10
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: something about looking up coven. Is that it's likely it's likely a curated
    topic, whereas the governor general they probably don't have staff curating that
    front page.
  persid: S09
- desc: hmm. All right, okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I believe that Google generally goes according to its running Google ranking
    algorithm which is said, and whenever someone searches. Like something like you
    search Google 19 vaccine right so for us it searches for the keyboard Secondly,
    uses your location. So just to show something related to you shortly your history
    and, for me, like the most recent ones or most visited websites. In this, where
    the Google ranks everything in in his website, like the multiple times us like
    most of the people, visited let's suppose know who website, then it will show
    that of force, so I feel that it's according to that.
  persid: S15
- desc: yeah well so google's algorithms trade secret for some, for the most part
    right. I mean, I mean search engine optimization can be done. In reasonable ways,
    but the precise details. Of what's going on aren't aren't known.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe related by one, so a TV series they I mean it was about searches and
    stuff and they showed that even the good guys change. domain CERT the preferences
    of a search engine by their own world so.
  persid: S08
- desc: I started getting the forum replies for chocolate chip cookies in my email.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah. There is a comment about how to. Set preferences to. For notifications,
    but let me just change the. requirements. OK, so now that i've got. That into
    properly. So let's look at some of these responses for covert 19 vaccine. writers
    from the UK. Canada public health. Some surprises, the number of arguments on
    this URL. html. wasn't a criticism is just a comment about. URLs with tons of
    arguments and I don't know if i'm copying that that might don't. pass on the arguments,
    so that things can be tracked. anymore than. They need to be. org.
  persid: DHH
- desc: perhaps.org is the regulatory affairs professional society. And it tracks.
    The vaccine type and to the developers are and the authorization approval, where
    they're from etc. I thought it was a bizarre first option to get actually.
  persid: S16
- desc: Does it government or private, who is.
  persid: S03
- desc: Just clicking the who we are, it.
  persid: S16
- desc: looks private.
  persid: ???
- desc: As it's the largest global organization of and for those involved with regulation
    of healthcare related products. blah blah blah headquartered in suburban Washington
    DC with chapters and affiliates world worldwide.
  persid: S16
- desc: It almost sounds like some kind of weird anti vax front doesn't.
  persid: S03
- desc: I don't think so. i'd be concerned if it was.
  persid: S16
- desc: Was it's not doing a very good job at it, because it's showing where it's
    all approved.
  persid: S13
- desc: homepage from the website. pretty well. i'll put together website to be a.
    disease to call astroturf. Or the fake grassroots organizations. The Canadian
    association of professionals and regulatory affairs. hoping to find a Wikipedia
    page about wraps or something like that. blog post about. So. You may have something
    related to covert there. raps is a very. very popular alternative. Health Canada
    again CBC. saskatchewan. So Google ad services, I think this isn't click on an
    ad. i'm not sure. CDC. and Canada. anyway. Interesting so we have a winner in
    terms of. Consensus, but not. So now we've learned about wraps now it's, the question
    is. Since. How many people have heard of it has heard of wraps for for today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: First time for me.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So that leads to a question. Do we decide whether that's reputable source.
    Just one website. How do we decide.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Basically, that really puts the onus on the searcher to do their due diligence
    to actually check the source.
  persid: S16
- desc: yeah well as always right, whether you're looking for chocolate chip cookie
    recipes or. Something more crucial like. covert vaccine information.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just gonna say something i'm in the government general of Canada, so I searched
    one from Korean IP and different from German and they don't match either and they're
    not very important to know.
  persid: S08
- desc: Where where our the two searches done.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For the gentleman one.
  persid: S08
- desc: I mean vpn.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I didn't even get the link on the first page of Google, which I got in the
    Canadian ap.
  persid: S08
- desc: No, but what was your first. result from. Okay, let me go to that. i'm surprised
    that there isn't you. know in Germany, you get the Wikipedia page.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No digital at all.
  persid: S08
- desc: Well here's one news related. Article the conversation. or not new news. opinion
    or or topical story. Okay, so this this thing URL looks like a search instead
    of the search results. Try. interesting. Jennifer. we're almost out. it's kind
    of unexpected well. An interesting exercise, I think. So i'm going to post a couple
    videos. So, based on. eli pariser second video about the social the. Role of.
    social media platforms, the responsibility towards a greater good and. design
    and so forth. And I would, I have a couple of videos in mind one by David Kelly,
    and the other by don Norman. About design, because he talked about designing spaces
    so. there's other videos that will be about designing. software. And then, how
    that relates to. behavior they can engender the software and genders. Whether
    it's like Twitter it's all over the place, or whether it's more like linkedin.
    Something else. So i'm gonna leave that with you. And then.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What about the attendance password.
  persid: S17
- desc: Oh yes, thank you. So much fun with this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't think it'll, let us do the attendance because it closes at 1245.
  persid: S13
- desc: yeah. well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah it's not letting me add here.
  persid: S09
- desc: When someone sends me a direct message, then I it takes me a while to get
    it back set back to everyone. same password it should be good for five minutes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's working.
  persid: S11
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S17
- desc: sorry about that. Okay. Thanks for today. And will. Thank you, on Thursday.
    Okay. Take care. stay well bye.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you take care.

  persid: S07
- desc: Not to the common user
  persid: S12
- desc: it seems like FortiClient server control
  persid: S07
- desc: My pet peeve about this stuff is that it's often not accessible for the average
    user. I know my grandma panics anytime these popups come up whenever she's doing
    anything gon her computer.
  persid: S16
- desc: agreed!^
  persid: S27

    in todays meeting, it can be this, or any of the videos on the website under today's
    date
  persid: S14
- desc: I mean I think that we should accept it with a grain of salt
  persid: S31
- desc: I like to believe it is more peer reviewed than a few family members
  persid: S28
- desc: "I don\u2019t see this content about Alexa in meeting 5.. am I missing something?"
  persid: S32
- desc: ^same
  persid: S14
- desc: 'I don''t see it in meeting 5 yet either but here''s a link to the article:'
  persid: S33
- desc: thx
  persid: S28
- desc: I think top ad is the first result
  persid: S25
- desc: for me it is
  persid: S25
- desc: God damn, I got rice krisplies recipe as my first result XD
  persid: S28
- desc: I'd be curious to see which search engines we're all using to get these results
    too
  persid: S18
- desc: sally pulled a amazon on everyone...
  persid: S28
- desc: Could it depend on the search engine used?
  persid: S34
- desc: Yeah I think it does
  persid: S14
- desc: I used duckduck go
  persid: S28
- desc: On duckduckgo I got allrecipes
  persid: S12
- desc: I used duckduckgo and google both, got different results
  persid: S14
- desc: someone use Tor...
  persid: S28
- desc: I think maybe if we used a more controversial topic, something politics related,
    we would see more varying in the results
  persid: S35
- desc: Where is the link for us to post our ad url?
  persid: S10
