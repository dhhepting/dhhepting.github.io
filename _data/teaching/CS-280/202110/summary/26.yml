    member and rashmi who's a one tree and committee Member out they kind of. They
    also support us in this initiative and they're very insightful, so I think we've
    got a prior commitment they could not join the call, but I just wanted to give
    a. shout out to them as well, so without a wasting time so just wanted to let
    you know, this is very informal, even though we are an incident deck I will call
    out you guys in between, and expect you to. ask any questions, if not, then, then
    I have to you know bowl you by my stories and maybe not sure how exciting, it
    would be for you, but at least. feel free to ask your questions, so we want to
    make sure that this discussion is for you and we address any any things that you
    will which you're looking for, and we will tell you our perspective, and we want
    to hear from you know your perspective. So about myself, I am actually in it.
    line as well i've been working since 99 years I have my bachelor's master's and
    PhD in it. Like I am he rp a consultant, if you if you say so so and then i'm
    currently serving board member for gifts Scotland. And i'm also a manager at eli
    Canada, I have worked with us prior and i've worked with Peter Lucy out perfect
    I was in India. Be back around 10 years back, and then I was actually worked i've
    worked with Oracle so I have, I have. kind of Wagner multiple companies and seen
    a lot of culture and one thing I always have gathered from this experience is
    having a good mentor always help you grow and kind of. stays with you, even though
    no matter how many companies, I have changed my mentor who's from my first company
    is still in touch with me distal still you know, like. I almost always go back
    to him, and we are encouraged to kind of I sometimes ask for guidance he's always
    practically telling me what he feels and then based on you know, like.
  persid: S02
- desc: Our discussion we. move forward and he actually helped me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: make the right decision, which I feel is good for my future so that that is
    what I know from the mentorship if you have any questions on my bio I have my
    linkedin. Link as well, feel free to connect me over linkedin and we can actually
    you know, Chad and, if you want to know we can do that post. The session as well,
    going to the next, what does mentoring and mentor coaching mean so basically it's
    informal. You know, like basic association between two people and it actually
    helps you grow, and you know, in your carrier and also personal growth so. long
    time people confuse it again okay mentoring is merely carrier, you know, like
    it's kind of focused on specifically. of you know at target of technology or something
    no, it is, it is very, very, very like highly integrated view which were personal
    growth as well, so you're you're. Good as a person as an individual and also in
    the character, because if you grow as a person as an individual, then it will
    help you. convert that growth into your carrier or what whatever you want you
    want to achieve, so it could be, maybe, if you are actually working in the. 70s
    job and going towards like you know, a CIO position or if it's a like you I will
    be going to a partnership. Or if it's a if you're an entrepreneur you kind of
    you're trying to establish yourself as an entrepreneur and going to be Elon musk
    one day, so all all those. journeys, as always, even have mentors and then you
    have right to guide you and kind of share their perspective of you know, with
    you, and what works best for them. So with that i'll let you add few things so
    what i'll do i'll give a pause and I want to know from at least one or two of
    you what mentoring and coaching me to you. Because I just shared application my
    language, but I want to make sure that I understand what you are looking for a
    new order entry, so please anybody feel free to speak up.
  persid: S02
- desc: You can also put it in the chat box, if you want to shake we can come back
    and see what comments have been made, yes awesome.
  persid: S03
- desc: You can do that.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. We might have some shy people.
  persid: S03
- desc: Should don't. don't worry i'm very passionate calling names, so I may pick
    some random guys just to you know, like. I kind of asked you questions i'm just
    kidding yourself don't worry about that feel free to speak of, and you, you want
    to so, but then. The idea of this particular meeting is having a informal discussion
    with you and understanding your perspective, we just don't want to be, you know,
    like another speaker going on and kind of just talking is, we want to have a dialogue
    rather than monologue. So agenda, I just go through the onion nearly complete,
    we will talk about the kids program what we are doing and how we have done so
    far and. Like it's a great thing for us, we have been recognized why our mentorship
    Program. Internationally, we have national mentor and mentee relationship we have
    a we have mentored so many people, and we have set up fast experience like Doug.
    lauren said he he runs his own mentorship of farm and he has mentored a lot of
    leaders who are actually coming in our country in the. high positions and he is
    such a wonderful networking, you know what vote and what now like does not our
    word for some when somebody is is kind of making their carrier of. Because it's
    always good to have knowledge but experience tell you okay these decision work
    for me, maybe two time cheese, maybe it's not productive that sharing or tech
    perspective always help you. In second again mentor and mentee what does you know
    we from kiss protective orders mentoring and mentor means, then, what kind of
    timeline we're looking for who can be. Who can take part in this program and,
    at the end up is again open forum, please don't be shy, we will check check the
    chats also so feel free to write your life of questions or the chat. So. Maria
    to you wanted to slide so they can actually give some. background on the gift
    Program.
  persid: S02
- desc: mentorship there, I also wanted to mention, we have a few. comments in the
    chat box and Doug if you're more if you want to check some of the comments I will
    check if you're comfortable answering some of them, you can, and I think Doug
    can i've been where you might want to add some more comments. Sure sure the mentoring
    program started in 2018 and that was thanks to our public appointee board member
    Doug Lawrence. We happen to lucked out when he was appointed, and that was his
    background and. kept the schedule and decided to launch a mentoring program to
    give back to our Members. But we also noticed that some of our students probably
    would have been interested in it as well, and even though you're not in the workforce,
    yet. what many of you may have had jobs during the summer or you know may have
    jobs during the school year and it's kind of hard to identify. Who a mentor is
    what a mentor should be doing or how they should be exchanging conversations,
    the relationship between a mentor and the mentee. And I think when we're younger
    it's like we're being told what to do and how to do it, whether it, whereas a
    mentor. You share your thoughts you share your challenges the mentor shares their
    experience and so that's an exchange of conversation. And we're finding that we
    have that even in the workplace, even with people who have been in the workplace
    for over 20 years and have had lots of experience, they may not have had a mentor
    they don't have to work in your field, either because what you're looking for
    is some you know. Just shared experiences or learning from someone else has been
    in the workforce, or has had challenges with. You know, in other fellow employees
    or in the workplace, so I think that. it's been very successful since we started
    we've also as Pacheco alluded to, we have international members so number of years
    ago sketching immigration nominee Program. made it mandatory that the kips designation
    would be part of the immigration process since then we've had to we've had many
    international members. who've come to us and wanted to be part of the mentorship
    program so that they can learn more about Canadian culture Canadian businesses
    what's expected what's not expected and again just to share experiences and learn
    from us. And the program runs from September to June so we're kind of late and
    getting to you guys this year, but with your membership as. A student and their
    last year of this program you're able to remain an active member with kip saskatchewan
    and you can join the mentorship program at any time, and so you can just let us
    know if you're interested. Thank you.
  persid: S03
- desc: Thank you, my friend, thank you and I just wanted to highlight that's a very
    like good points which you have put in like a difference between the mentorship
    and coaching how a second you know, like. You kind of doing the coaching is more
    kind of feedback and kind of teaching maybe you know I kind of more. More in terms
    of teaching or that they're teaching mentoring coaching that they're very is norms
    for everybody and database 10 line between where you actually cause. So, and the
    idea is actually to kind of have your to basically the mentorship, in my view,
    is kind of sit on a covering your idea is to have your. be successful know is
    kind of whatever you decision you take, whether it's there's nothing right and
    wrong is all about kind of. telling you Okay, this is, this is something which
    I have seen this is something which I have maybe you have read you know, maybe
    I have. You know they experienced our effort towards it so it's kind of sharing
    the good to mindy what mentor has perspective to an idea is to have this more
    successful normally. you're you're you know the kind of life and teaching becomes
    you know you have. Reading about a subject, maybe a yard you kind of reading about
    how to be good at SAP Oracle or or any salesforce.com. or any of those stats but
    it becomes a teaching that you kind of doing a particular teaching, then the coaching
    is in the middle of a you actually have. You you want to be a i'm just giving
    example of these system because i'm from that background, so. You want to be a
    consultant and Oracle functional or maybe SAP function or Sep technical or whatever
    line you choose so that to be that person you kind of have the coaching you know.
    To be be be prepared for that for so it's very telling and actually goes hand
    in hand and one person can play multiple roles. In in your life so it's not your
    teacher can be your coach and mentor so it's nothing that your your teacher cannot
    be your coach and mentor, this is not is how far you. And relationship goes really
    long is not a short time short term. goal like very you actually you know it's
    not something when you're done with your schooling you leave your mentor there,
    and whoever you have chosen your mentor in the school in time. know your mentor
    relationship with course for life and sometimes I have my longest mentorship relationship
    with I have is 20 years so. That is something which still stay and be a student
    Dutch sometimes some years it's less some years more but yeah if there is still
    in does that's that's what one of them, moving to the next. piece now again I
    was always already are touching base on how the mentor and mentee relationship
    box so far. Our mentorship program in terms of skip, we have to be they have to
    be current members escaped us numbers and. You know you will say okay why gifts
    program is accessible to what I have seen and i'm fed is. Why, we are have been
    successful in this this area, and this mentorship program to call them, the experience
    of Ross expediency good so. If you when you actually see the, the total number
    of experience, so if you if you're talking about number experience in terms of
    mentor committee. Maybe i'm just maybe you know, like 10% plus minus, we will
    have at least 100 years of experience sitting on Ted that slide I showed you.
    mentorship Community like Maria has like 20 years or 30 years like Doug has to
    maybe wouldn't 25 to 30 years so and then josh me everybody's coming with average
    2025 years experience so all six of. You know all four of us, including has ended
    year of experience, and when you combine that henan European towns boss because.
    there's a difference in knowledge, but you gave and there are some differences
    experience experience cannot be replaced anywhere, so you. Those things you see
    things, who died, is that is the reason which I personally feel why gifts membership
    program is catch when membership Program. Successful and has always been in my
    other people because experience and loss of connectivity of network of the book,
    who had seen so much. Are there like we have a board member traveler who's says
    power, and we have like bev so all others are who are leaders in their sectors,
    who are actually working across and you have international Members who actually
    have a. very vast number of experience, and I am myself as a mentee i'm learning
    at each time if for some I may be playing the role of mentor as for some I am
    on Monday, who am I learning every day so yeah. So again, this just sum up all
    there you can go ahead and feel free to read them again mentee you need to be
    skipped Member so that's something which, if you are your friends few that you
    want to you know, encourage somebody to be in that arena than one of the requirements
    is to. Have membership of the script. Again and again it's a two way relationship,
    both from both sides, so is you, placing the trust because trust trust is very
    important, you have to trust someone sometimes. The dissonance or maybe you know,
    like things we shared, you may not know a lot of background, and you know, like,
    I may have feeling, so you do we have a trust on each other to kind of go with
    that. So this is, this is the idea and then again it commitment. We are committed,
    Maria has been committed are two gifts and dog and others, like so many people
    will be committed to making this successful made sure we can help whoever we can
    and i'll sharing our thought process with you guys is something I feel is a blessing
    for us. On this anybody I Doug ellin Susan or my you want to add anything before
    we move forward or anybody audience anybody would want to share some. points will
    be will be move forward.
  persid: S02
- desc: i'm good with this.
  persid: S03
- desc: I will ask our attendees. Would they they want to share their. thought process
    if what they as a mentee because, like if you are an idea, what do you want to
    see what are you looking for. Anybody. Are. Like please feel free to let me see
    if I can.
  persid: S02
- desc: See one.Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: awesome so Doug Doug has also provided this perspective of personal and professional.
    bias and with that i'll share the experience right, so I have changed multiple
    companies and whenever you resign from company there's two types of people. Like
    one who feel very bad that you're leaving them and you kind of leave the company
    and you're like, why are you actually doing that and. Now they'll they'll try
    to make you work and all those things and other other person who actually see
    the happy for it, they won't say Okay, are you. There are more concerned, whether
    you are taking the right decision and you're carrying. Wherever you're going so
    they will try to not discourage you from me, but from try to understand whether
    you are taking right decision which will make you, and if they feel that this
    is the right decision to say yeah go ahead and you know. Good to that bus, so
    that you can actually go much, much further in your in your career journey. So
    those are the mentors you want to always are fine and kind of stick with because
    those are the people who always note in terms of your successful story and where
    you are being successful like Oh, my first job back in 2002. I like and i've been
    there and I was. Like I, as I said, I have a European data and they were updating
    er they were doing an implementation and implementation and back into them to.
    In India, it was not that common of a yuppie still it was still have like a very
    sought out like today was you have Apps at that time. It was crp so I found a
    mentor who actually said Okay, no, you should focus on which areas which will
    make your carrier, you know which areas and a certain time, he said okay in this
    organization, where you are. If there's already been 10 people who actually looking
    at finance, so you don't want to go that area, as you should focus on supply chain,
    because there's only one or two people since you're already fresh. You know, you
    can actually move to you know those things you this okay Maybe you can actually
    pursue some tactical for because there's something so those kind of small our.
    Guidance, which actually helped me and i'm still in touch with that person is
    still thought, yes, so David David said what i'm looking for that with someone.
    She tried to get into feel make the right decisions. If that makes sense. Yes,
    definitely because from I know from a student perspective, the most important
    thing is getting the right job and also helping you get a job and that's why it's
    important for you to kind of have someone kind of have a discussion where you
    want to take your career. What what what exactly your strengths are you know which
    which area is actually you know you feel their credit, because when you actually
    doing a job interview, can you speak about that with passionately, because I do
    a lot of. pressures hiding from Einstein young, so I know we always when we take
    the interviews from from the students be more more look tend to look in the software
    soft skills, rather than you know, like. of technical skills, because from from
    from the screen perspective, what exactly you are good at, so the discussion goals
    on how what were you articulated. So if I asked you a question, then, based on
    your answer those discussion will go so it's important to know what they are you
    standing which areas, you are good at which area is also have your interest.
  persid: S02
- desc: Somebody saying.
  persid: ???
- desc: share value i'm just needing it out. Yes, yeah well it a feedback is also
    very good, so, as you know, like. Give a positive feedback and also feedback,
    as you know, like. Feedback la I tell you once i'm so i'll give you example on
    the feedback so there's there's no like the quality feedback it's like when I
    was. Around seven eight years back, I was new to us, and I was doing you know
    I kind of I was doing a project, where we are responsible for checking the revenues
    and I like cleared an excel sheet for them to have their. numbers of vetted by
    the CFO and what are the client who's working what he actually kind of. told me
    that Oh, can you wish I can you actually send me this numbers and can you use,
    you should have it and go ahead and send it to me. So what I did, because I was
    new to company and I thought okay if trying disaster me I should go ahead and
    you know, like I should share that with the client good that you know that's what
    i'm here to do so, I went ahead and share that. Like the working accelerating
    and then. Next week I got a feedback that I should whenever we're doing some work,
    we should always review it internally. So it was a very positive feedback my manager
    came to me and say okay i'm sure you did put up at the I snore there's there's
    some mistake, there is still working is great, but it was not client ready so
    from my perspective. I want to make sure that going forward this time that's Okay,
    you have done it as we're done, we can always take care of it but going forward
    nature anytime the client asked you. We do have our internal checks in the reviews
    the as a team has to be saying Okay, this is good, this is good for our client
    to be. Seen or, for instance you're you're you're predicting on your end you're
    actually creating a project group project your professors is your client. So you
    want to make sure your for people who are in group are everybody senior did i'm
    totally fine with that output and that's when you actually shared it with your.
    Professor who actually said Okay, you know this is this looks good rather than
    one person thinking of professional saying Okay, can you just. Show me what you're
    working on, and you know, without concerning because you don't know what other
    where other people are thought process. So you just share with them and then other
    piece, we are not ready so that's always very good so do we have been dealing
    with mental question about that anymore, I think they're asked to do things yes.
    Yes, I have, and I tell you the example so. The normal example is the dog i'm
    just giving my example you know turn yeah we are a professional services firm,
    so we do lot of. Like building to the client and time and a lot of you know, so
    we have we have a strict. strict guidelines ethical guidelines, you have to be
    we do audits so and we have a reputational like you know things to provide and
    there are certain cases where people. You know they tell you to do stuff which
    is not in line with the you know our company policies or company guidelines which
    you are, you have been trained on. So at that time I I what I have always done,
    as well as politely tell them that no I think i'm uncomfortable with this and
    I will not take me to you know from dead. is true is like you know there's a lot
    of people, and then you have to so I always say Okay, if you have something do
    you mind emailing me. Or that because a lot of time he will say oh let's, let
    us do you know do do it. Like why don't you actually do it, and you know go ahead
    and performed his activity and now it's Okay, the policies are just for paper
    or or anything it's just lucky, but no. I personally believe that nothing is on
    paper, if if you feel it's not come comfortable, you should say no. I know you
    should hear your concern with whoever you're working with because it's always
    know like it is not advisable to be a yes person. is always good to be someone
    who actually can say no, and I have learned in the seminary in my initial days
    by manage to complete it, why you always say yes to every everything said no,
    you the value comes, then you can say no, and you have a reason behind that know.
    So yeah so anytime you feel ethical dilemma, I know, make sure you actually whatever
    you're comfortable with if you know it no, this is not a policy, this is not ethical.
    And you should press you know, like your concerns to the right person and also,
    we do have obligations and report certain you know ethical. dilemma, so if you
    feel if you there's you know you're seeing some activity which is not good, so
    you as a person, you should report if it's not in ethical dimension, because how
    would anybody else know otherwise. Because if you if that's not ethical, which
    is going on, and if you if you as a spectator does not inform about that medical
    practice then it may, it may go into rapid It made it. So it's always advisable
    to you know kind of raise your concerns and in an appropriate manner, you don't
    have to be you know barging in and kind of making sure you. concerned with your
    mentor saying how best way, I should like raise it because, again there's different
    personality types intimate like where the sophistication of a working relationship,
    you have a lot of things, but yes, you should always do that does that answer
    your question there. I was considered it does add but yeah any other questions.
    Am I still available to everybody, or no. just want to make sure.

    our escape members in you know dollar bills, you know more than what I do. So
    yeah it's great in you know and share with your friends or you know other students,
    if you want to take part of you know, take part in this thing, there is, you can
    always refer to that that to Maria and. that's has been how they can be bought
    off if they asked already not escape number or they're not even they they're not
    us our students yeah. So. Now, now, this is the best slide which I would say so
    now here the time when I will open the forum and i'll give a 32nd pause for you
    guys to speak up or or write something whatever you're comfortable with so that
    we can actually discuss those rather than you know. doing a monologue. To or floor
    is open, now, this is the. Is David going.
  persid: S02
- desc: So, just a quick question I was wondering if you could. kind of give us. A
    quick overview of how to get into the mentorship program just a quick one.
  persid: S06
- desc: Sure, oh. My. That or do you want me to run through.
  persid: S02
- desc: into that for you, you can take a break and have a drink of water, if you
    need. Thanks thanks David so if you're in an eclipse accredited program which
    I believe you are in right now. than it was it's as simple as sending us an email
    and letting us know that you want to be in the mentorship program and I would
    send you an application and you complete it, and then we would match you. In cases
    where we don't have a mentor available I would let you know that, and then we
    would just put out a call out for mentoring. candidates.
  persid: S03
- desc: gotcha Thank you.
  persid: S06
- desc: Oh you're welcome awesome. Also, as a third year student or the last day or
    is everyone in their last year on this call or not.
  persid: S03
- desc: No okay good varies quite a bit.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, so in your last year of the. CS program you are eligible to be a student
    Member at no cost, and in that year in that timeframe, you can apply to be a mentor
    or mentee. And that's for all students coming from this program in the last year.
    If that computer just send me an email. And I can chat with you so.
  persid: S03
- desc: Maria it's Doug I just saw him, one of the other options we could offer for
    when we're short on mentors is, we can provide them access to a mentoring circle.
  persid: S04
- desc: Thanks Doug great. So if everybody on this call is interested in doing something
    like that Doug send quite a few of them so i'm sure he'd love to host another
    one. Darrell you can let us know.
  persid: S03
- desc: What is that what would that involve he tell us a bit more about it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah so a mentoring circle what I typically i'm running them every second
    Saturday and we're doing them virtual but what it is, is it's instead of having
    everyone matched with a mentor you have two or three mentors that facilitate a
    group discussion. And it can be you know it's about all things mentoring is typically
    what we do, but you can get into the. You know, into the personal and professional
    development of an individual or a group of people, and what we end up doing is
    we learn from those that are in the group, so it becomes that collaborative approach
    to to to learning.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay, thanks awesome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So yeah I think I think that's a great idea, and that will be like it would
    be great learning from. The matrix in that ways we can cover a bit bigger portion
    and if there's more than based on based on how you actually go work you actually
    do one to one mentoring, because it is not that mentoring is about Okay, if I
    have, I am good at something and just have to be. Like mentor have asked with
    someone who's actually in my area is only as as as long as the broader. idea in
    Texas story connects, as you can always find those metrics mentoring circles also
    very good kind of see your learn from your peers and colleagues or students or
    themselves and learn from their stories. On below cushion the volunteer opportunity
    we are working on that, so we will definitely come back to you, once we have laid
    out upon we are thinking about kind of. Having some water create an opportunity
    where we can actually give you some some experience and they might kind of get
    you more connected to gifts, so that that's something which we are working in
    background. awesome see and then Maria is the best person to reach out, and you
    can reach out to us as well, so feel free to connect with us so and we will be
    happy to answer your questions any of them. Any other questions, since we asked
    the. Are there's no more slide for me to kind of go over and kind of speak about
    so any other questions you want to or. And again i'll tell you my story, so I
    I was basically working in us up for last eight years and then, when in US I got
    connected to like someone in my organization in Canada and I was having a good
    mentor relationship with that. You know, like that person, and we were in touch
    and there was opportunity where they were looking for a person to have of my my
    experience and they asked if I would be interested in I said yes, why not, so
    I took that. Decision and kind of moved, you know to Syria and that time of when
    I was taking their decision i'll tell you it is not that. I took that decision,
    because it wasn't it wasn't What do you say. I when I was in bad position or no,
    no, I have to take the decision I was really good I was progressing everything,
    but then this a good option and. And the great opportunity came in, so I discussed
    with that her than you know okay what it would be for long term what we will better
    for me know. Week, because in both both part goes to right now right direction,
    both are good, so now have a choice to walk into two different part, maybe you
    know, like. Google myself and either I can actually progress in us keep keep practicing
    us or I can actually be in Canada, so when I was talking to her and she she thought
    okay in ocala is great, I must have been international. Movement and and all of
    the law of a student who who would be similar and all of a sudden, who actually
    are from the local area. You know who had been from scratch and always so so I
    decided Okay, maybe moving to Canada right decision and. My time out for my carrier
    and for long term, and I can do the network, and I am happy about that CNN i'm
    actually very glad that she. helped me take that decision when I was you know
    in dilemma, or what to do so, definitely that that is the role of which a matter
    of place. So any any other questions before I I can actually add more studious
    us issue, but I want me to answer specific questions for you, rather than sharing,
    something which may only be relevant for you. everybody's okay anybody has a question.
    We have a we're winding up at I think 1215 so feel free to ask you, questions
    and i'll be happy to answer that for you.
  persid: S02
- desc: You can also share your questions in the chat box yes. Since he knows me the
    word kidding i'll share my.
  persid: S03
- desc: story, so I have also done a PhD in the area, so when I was doing a PhD at
    that time, like when I taught not I was doing I really thought of doing a lot
    of people actually said okay why you were doing a pst why you know. Why, you want
    to like first up is why don't you actually do an MBA like that is more bid and
    more like stuff. And then I had certain things in mind, I have my I have done
    my own calculation, I went to him and I said Okay, you know. What what should
    I do should I actually go for PhD which. is definitely difficult I don't know
    whether i'm leaving to complete it, because a lot of people are already is discouraging
    me that you know or just not a great bar, you may not able to finish it. Is takes
    a long time, and you know, like all sorts of things and you'll it will not be
    that grateful and then to me is definitely a you know much vetted route everybody
    knows once you're doing MBA good basement and. You get so and the person does
    not have any idea what vcs which is not that that is that was his. idea, he and
    neither he has done MBA so he was sort of shake out from my perspective. Again,
    both are good, you know, like, if I have actually look at it from the outside,
    both looks to be a good area again. majority is definitely I will go smooth majority
    i'll say NBC for now and bsd is kind of you know at 20 20% only. Successful so
    but I would ask the question, what do you want to do, and then he said okay tell
    me convince me. Why, I should say yes for you to do business, then we had a good
    discussion of one hour and then, finally, he said yeah it looks to me that, even
    though after do this can look to me, you are kindness, if you are convinced, then
    go ahead and i'm with you. Then our MAC because the idea was to kind of whether
    you're able to the end of the journey and he said yes huge based on our discussion
    I feel you're ready, and you can. Take the journey of going through a bsd and
    you can complete it, and then he said yeah move forward with that, so I have moved
    ahead and completed a lot of. My friend, we were kind of surprised that yo we
    because they are the one who actually saying discouraging me that Oh, this is
    very long why you're doing that. Part so that is important role of mentor mentor
    may not know where you actually heading. You know, like very, very you are not
    where you want to go, he may not know if you want to work with tesla not everybody
    works with tessa right so not everybody has worked with. If you want to work with
    mobile and Google, not everybody, but to understand, to help you Okay, whether
    you are convinced, you are ready to be on that journey that is something which
    mentors job is to help you take the decision. To make sure that you in the long
    run, whatever I do like you know decision you're taking that makes sense to you.
    That you know, to show that whole whole big picture end to end picture, when you
    actually talk about not just a one piece. Whether it makes complete sense in thread
    30 years when you will your profile when you pull your resume it. Is that, as
    you may have a person who you who you want to be in 30 years, whether it's a mosque
    weather is you know the project. Whether it's you know any any CSE I see your
    CIO or will will, are you inspired to be so, the idea is in that 30 years for
    next from now two or 35 years can you be that. Can you please, if not be that
    at least close to that our journey, so that is the better, you know, like goal
    is to help you. guide you through that process and give this year in design is
    always out in the field, but at least give the perspective. So with that. Any
    other questions I know we are already. Beyond over Prescott times so. So do you
    so let Okay, let me ask you do you feel this is this condition was useful. So
    if If yes please raise your hand I see someone doing it, so I use one you know,
    yes, I have one or he is so please, I want to see how many hands are raised to
    see if it's if it's useful or not. Because I know you and you're shy, and you
    know, like you, don't want to speak, and if you have if you feel that Okay, this
    is something which you want to do it. A personal your you have a personal question,
    something which you don't want to share with the group, you know the via here
    i'm here so yeah. This is good to know that a lot of people feel that way, so
    thank you so much for raising your hand because we don't want to do that, that
    if you don't like it and we come in and we can. kind of go ahead and. do the same
    thing again, but with your doctor you on that whole thing, so you want to do something
    which works for you and that's, that is the reason I was asking questions like
    tell me what do you feel that is what you seek out a mentor so yeah. So.
  persid: S02

    to me. Not to me, but to everybody. Whether. we're not doing proctor crack. we're

    write a blog style entry. On a topic that you're given at the start of the exam
    period. Now. i'm open to your suggestions for exam for top question topics for
    questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey Darrell. I just have a another question in that same line of thinking,
    so I guess my input to your question would be. I think blog one was handled really
    well like pick a topic from the list of topics that we have and choose one from
    there, I really like that idea. And I also just wanted to ask if the timing of
    this, so I see a lot of chat saying it might start on Monday and then continue
    to the Tuesday date, or are we starting to standing going to Wednesday thanks.

  persid: S09
- desc: So. things we talked about during this to master our will will focus on. So.
    I i'm. i'm working on making sure that all the all the transcripts and summaries
    are available. I think i've got most of them are there might be one or two that
    are missing still. So I would say that. that those are the. Things to study the
    resources listed there and the discussion we've had in class.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. Thank you.
  persid: S09
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey Professor sorry just. Just one more question. Sure, I was wondering if
    once we're done this discussion, if, before the test begins, if you could. Put
    the details of the exam like what it's going to be on stuff like that either in
    an email or as opposed on your courses, so that way, if anyone forgets any of
    this they'll have that information that clears things up. Okay.
  persid: S06
- desc: Sure, I can do that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: awesome Thank you.
  persid: S06
- desc: um when it comes to your expectations on the blog portion of the exam will
    they be similar to the blog. itself assignments that we did like will you be marking
    them the same.
  persid: S10
- desc: same. Expectations are similar yes. And i'm going to be marking the exam.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, will we be required to use online sources for the blog portion of the
    exam like we did in our assignments.
  persid: S11
- desc: Yes, that's. Certainly possible and encouraged.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you.
  persid: S11
- desc: hi.
  persid: S08
- desc: hi.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just one more question that we need to submit in any. Doc file or something
    like or. PDF or something or it will be on like you, are courses like. exam thing
    so i'm not sure.
  persid: S08
- desc: So it will be a your courses squares structure so you'll. you'll see it that
    way. And it'll you intend to settle us, you have a turn it in assignment.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay okay okay you got it, thank you, thank you.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay. sure you review so look at the materials that are online. Reading details.
    exam. Certainly, the use of sources are encouraged and they can be links. message.
    Today at 330. To 430. So I have to apologize, because I. started out with the
    intent of using discord but. Because i've had computer problems I haven't kept
    my login. Active all the time. are forgotten to restart it, and so I looked at
    it yesterday, and I see that there's some quite active discussions which I haven't
    contributed. To which I haven't contributed so I apologize for that. i'm trying
    to get through email. as well, so if you have. Questions about marks on assignments
    and work. i'll do my best to get them sorted out before the exam. But I will definitely
    get them sorted out before the final marks are in place.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey Darrell I just had another question again on the project, so if we're
    doing a research paper and we're talking about it, and our topic is kind of lengthy.
    I saw an arbitrary limit of 1000 1500 words on the the page if we go over that
    by some margin is that Okay, or is that a hard limit of 1500 and nothing else.
  persid: S07
- desc: I would say. it's a suggestion. But at the same time, if you're gonna write
    twice as much. That might be a little bit of a. I wouldn't encourage you to do
    twice as many do double the size thinking it's twice as good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Definitely not trying to like blow blow it up, which is wordy paragraphs,
    but I mean if the content is still there and the content is still fresh, then,
    are you okay with that.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks a bunch.
  persid: S07
- desc: I will. I will provide as much detail as possible about the way the exam is
    going to work. i'm. I will have it set up tomorrow earlier in the day, so you
    should see it on the list of upcoming events. The exam I mean. swinging for more
    awesome thanks. And you're not waiting for more, but just. noticing it. anyway.
    it's been a long day already. For me, but that's I mean that's not a not a complaint.
    So i'll be around during the exam. If there are. issues that come up. I will do
    my best to help you resolve them. So Can somebody provide. The password. cuz i'm
    stuck on a direct message again. So I hope this semester you've had the opportunity
    to think critically. develop your critical thinking skills and ask. Important
    questions about not not only of how to do things, but why we should do them. And
    I appreciate.

  persid: DHH
- desc: I've always considered mentoring to be more like, "learn by watching me, ask
    questions" whereas coaching is more about instruction, benchmarking, feedback,
    etc.
  persid: S23
- desc: I'd say mentoring is kind of like having someone to go to for guidance about
    a specific subject, that will also teach you about how to work on said subject
    properly
  persid: S06
- desc: Coaching is more formal, comparatively, where you only get training from that
    person
  persid: S06
- desc: That's my perspective, anyways
  persid: S06
- desc: Id say good coaches are considered mentors
  persid: S24
- desc: Mentoring is defined as a two way trusted relationship where both the mentor
    and mentee will learn and grow together on a personal and professional basis
  persid: S04
- desc: What I'd be looking for in a mentor is someone who could offer guidance as
    to how to get into a field, make the right career decisions, and how to be an
    effective employee in said field - if that makes sense
  persid: S06
- desc: Thanks David, yes that makes sense.
  persid: S03
- desc: I personally learn by example and through hands-on stuff so I would need a
    mentor that shares my values and would trust me to do things with them. I also
    need one who can give good feedback (including positive feedback) so that I know
    where I need to improve but I also know what I'm successful at.
  persid: S23
- desc: A good mentor is a story teller and shares their lived experiences with the
    mentee through story telling.
  persid: S04
- desc: "Do mentors (here) have experience in dealing with mentees\u2019 questions\
    \ about the ethical dimensions of things they are asked to do/consider?"
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S13
- desc: yes you're good
  persid: S16
- desc: Yup! We can hear you Abhishek
  persid: S06
- desc: Keep in mind we are done at 12:15.
  persid: S03
- desc: almost me
  persid: S12
- desc: Is there any volunteer opportunities in CIPS during this spring and summer?
    Next year is my last year.

    are interested please send me an email. executive.director@sk.cips.ca

    that stuff in mind though for 4th year
  persid: S06
- desc: It was cool, I'll definitely be looking into that when I'm closer to graduating
  persid: S10
- desc: So Monday 5pm to Tuesday 5pm, instead of Tuesday 2-5pm
  persid: S25
- desc: It would still be doable in a 3 hour time window though, correct?
  persid: S25
- desc: I feel if these presentations were done earlier in the semester, there would
    have been more time to look into it
  persid: S29
- desc: "So it\u2019s one essay type question"
  persid: S14
- desc: What kind of questions will be on the final
  persid: S32
- desc: What will the format be?
  persid: S10
- desc: so what is pattern going to be like?
  persid: S18
- desc: is it open notes?
  persid: S33
- desc: Or we have questions like in sample
  persid: S14
- desc: "Sorry didn\u2019t mean to direct message"
  persid: S32
- desc: Can we use hypertext references in research paper?
  persid: S34
- desc: Is the final open or closed book? Will we be proctored as we write it? Is
    there any study information we can find?
  persid: S26
- desc: "^^^^ Kurtis\u2019 message (that it is doable in a 3-hour window)"
  persid: S35
- desc: Philip he answered kurits message already
  persid: S24
- desc: so, one we open it should be complete immediately or from Monday 5 pm to Tuesday
    5 pm
  persid: S08
- desc: imagine 24 hour proctored exam haha
  persid: S36
- desc: was the attendance code given out at the start of the class?
  persid: S37
- desc: Literally sleeping haha
  persid: S06
- desc: Get reported for cheating
  persid: S06
- desc: Shoot. Keegan can you Y/N for me then?
  persid: S35
- desc: EH said yes
  persid: S24
- desc: well he said "sure"
  persid: S24
- desc: He said anything is possible lol. I wouldn't recommend leaving it until the
    last minute though.
  persid: S23
- desc: My bad haha, I was under the understanding that we had a 24 hour period to
    open the exam, but only 3 hours to complete it from the time we opened it
  persid: S26
- desc: He said anything is possible. So I'm assuming that means you might want to
    allocate more than 3 hours for it lol
  persid: S10
- desc: Would it be possible to send us an email with exam information, or make a
    post regarding the exam on URcourses?
  persid: S06
- desc: Long as its doable in 3 hours I'll be fine. Got two exams on Tuesday and one
    on Monday
  persid: S25
- desc: ^Kurtis
  persid: S35
- desc: what time is exam?
  persid: S38
- desc: Starts at 5:00pm Monday
  persid: S39
- desc: Ends 5:00pm Tuesday
  persid: S39
- desc: 5pm to 5pm, from Monday to Tuesday respectively.
  persid: S07
- desc: Sounds like we'll get the question/prompt on Monday at 5 and then we'll have
    until 5pm on Tuesday to hand it in
  persid: S10
- desc: so basically 24 hour exam, nice
  persid: S40
- desc: "How should we review\uFF1F"
  persid: S41
- desc: "So we\u2019ll use the same type of hypertext references as we did for Blog\
    \ 1 and Blog 2 ?"
  persid: S42
- desc: I mean depends if you got a good mark or not
  persid: S24
- desc: If you did id assume yes if not maybe dont
  persid: S24
- desc: did he reply this question already?     Can we use hypertext references in
    research paper?
  persid: S15
- desc: So we review assignment only or you have other material can give us
  persid: S38
- desc: A pdf or post on UR courses with final exam information in detail would extremely
    help with helping us prepare
  persid: S17
