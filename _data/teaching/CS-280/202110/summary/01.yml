Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning, everybody. see so many people Online with cameras on And not
    talking So I I muted your Your AUDIO So I now I can I can request for you to To
    unmute yourself, but I can't do it for you because of privacy concerns.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So you want to send muted.
  persid: S01
- desc: Oh, sure. We can do it.
  persid: S02
- desc: Just explaining the way the lay of the land, so to speak. Okay, so my name
    is Darrell happening. You can call me Dr happening or Darrell just try and limit
    yourself to one of those two And I'm a professor in the Department of Computer
    Science and This is the US to at risk reward and information society. So, I just
    want to go over a few things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Today,
  persid: ???
- desc: So how is the break for everyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Break.
  persid: S01
- desc: T shirt.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, I feel that
  persid: S01
- desc: My wife and I are kids, they're not at home with us anymore. And so we got
    a puppy. We started talking about Gagan new puppy and then the opportunity came
    up and so Now we have a puppy. Is not yet host trained But otherwise, Yes, you
    will see the puppy. But not today. I think Okay. Well, yeah. I'll do something
    I'll make some arrangements for to make an appearance, maybe, maybe on Thursday.
    So he's a. His name is Elgar after the British composer, not all guards after
    the famous Rough Rider player. Only people get that reference Not, not to the
    composer, but to the right to the Rough Rider. So this would be a good time to
    see how we're gonna Do things Because you have 100 and I didn't check last number
    I saw was 139 students. So I'm not sure for for still there. Or some people Need
    some other choices. Let's So, Keeping you muted during the meeting is Why while
    you don't have anything to say. While you're listening. I mean, Is good because
    then it just keeps the car keeps the audio clear There's not a lot of going back
    and forth. But I suggest that we use the little blue hands. Okay, so you should
    see Your participants window, you should see Some icons. I'm not sure why the
    hands aren't blue. Very good. Are you doing emojis. Looks like So thank you for
    giving me your reaction which is okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, the other blue hands that are normally underneath the participants window,
    they're not there right now.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, there is an update yesterday and I might even class had them in the
    morning one didn't offer did the update. So I'm guessing that's it.
  persid: S04
- desc: My morning class this morning did have them.
  persid: S01
- desc: Just kidding. I have no idea.
  persid: S04
- desc: 20 minutes ago. So I'm assuming that's not the issue. But I don't know.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. Let me just See whether it's hidden a new option army. Emoji hands are
    You would even work better than the blue hands. Let me just take a peek here about
    a setting. Yeah, I did an update. Recently, too. I don't see anything immediately
    popping up. So look into it for next day. minute ago. I don't understand why.
    You see if I can If anyone wants to Have a chat on discord. There's a an invitation
    to my Server. Okay, so I made a text channel in this Court for our class. To add
    2021 can So I what I did last semester. Is I saved the chat and I'm so I wanted
    to tell you that I'm also doing an audio recording As Well, I'm actually doing
    a video recording as well. But I'm not using that I'm not posting that anywhere.
    So that everyone gets The note about being recorded. This meeting is being recorded.
    Okay. So what When I did last semester was I Did it I use I can get an audio transcript
    of the recording. So I use the transcript to summarize the contents of our meeting.
    And then So I put The chat window guy saved and the audio transcript and I match
    them up. So that was somewhat successful, but I think it's probably better to
    Summarize what's what's going on. So we don't have A minute by minute breakdown
    of Are the students last semester said, instead of having The transcript organized
    by By timestamps it's better to have it organized by scenes and then Make it a
    little bit easier to track down what's going on and where So I'm gonna try and
    adopt and So I will So if you if you find that you need to have a copy of the
    audio transcript of the meeting. Or is it not the transcript with the audio recording
    Because I think what I might do is just To keep that for myself and then just
    post the the summary based on the transcript. So you can let me know how that
    goes. All right. If you can hear a little bit of a Muffled bark in the background.
    That's my puppy. Did you hear the phone ring there. Anyway, I apologize for that.
    Didn't turn on. Do Not Disturb, I guess. Okay, so let me share the screen with
    you are Emoji hands up. Is there a question. You have a question. welcome, you're
    welcome to unmute yourself and Let me know. Okay, so can you see that screen here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yep.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Great. Okay, so here's your courses student user guide. And I'm going to post
    a link to the department head David guard made a student orientation video And
    I'll post a link to that as well. Over here under the general course information.
    So the next one. Next, like there's she has to add on my website. So the arrangement
    is that I'm going to Use your courses for For work and for scheduling things and
    But the content with the on my website. Will be on my website. So let me just
    show you what that looks like. Know 10 To 120 21 winter. Okay, so I have a list
    of office hours here. A little bit bigger than I'd like to make it Screen space.
    For the Participants window. Well, good. Parts that aren't candidate or the class
    meetings and gray here. That's not great as smart as I am. Thanks. So starting
    Starting today, I'm going to have an office hour at 330 to 430 And then a tough
    times between On Mondays and Wednesdays. To office hours to office hours. And
    one and one. So makes total of six contact hours. I should post the link to my
    Office. Meetings. There's 26 meetings during the semester. Here's the first one.
    So this should link to the upcoming events in your courses. Calendar. Okay, so
    I haven't added my office hours. You can see the Course meeting time So next week
    we'll Start doing attendance during During our zoom meetings. 5%
  persid: DHH
- desc: Participation work.
  persid: S06
- desc: And did anyone have to go through the US YOUR QUESTIONS site policy agreement.
    You have to agree to that before you could get into your courses this semester.
    So I thought I included here just to make sure that people saw so so dealing with
    intellectual property, so forth. Those are Parts. Part of our discussion this
    semester. And in this course. Your courses page link. So here are the past exams
    have had I didn't update. This was a final exam from last winter. But I will do
    that shortly. So these are the past kinds of these are the exams are done in the
    past when I've taught this class. And I'm inclined to to forgo a mid term this
    semester. That Would anyone be heartbroken without a mentor. Anyway, so Trying
    to not have the final exam. I mean, not the midterm. And the final exam. If we
    do I suppose there are cut Well, Do the final exam will do will be using proctor
    track. And we can talk about proctor track. More detail, but that's That's the
    way to do final exams. That are Well, I think that's maybe the easiest way to
    do it. And the final exam date has been set. The 29th of April. Or it might be
    the 20th I think one is that one. I still not sorted out in my head in terms of
    which dates are which Anyone taking two or five In an hour. Ago switch from one
    One zoom meeting to another. Okay, so then in terms of topics that we're going
    to talk about the semester. So we can look at Overview Work in progress. But our
    SP that where we get most of our topics from Stanford social issues and professional
    practice. So this, this text is written for the 2013 report. So there was supposed
    to. There's an effort to revamp this for the 2020 We're supposed to be a 2020
    report, but I'm not sure the status of it. So, Some of the details are Are not
    quite as fresh as You might expect, you might See them today. Just remember that
    things were written in 2013 Of ethics. Professional Conduct Was rewritten in 2018
    I believe So question that we have before. So, Let's just read the preamble competing
    professionals actions. Change the world to act responsibly, they should reflect
    upon the wider impacts of the work consistently supporting the public good. So
    a question. That I have for you, not just for today, but for the semesters. How
    do we talk about how do we understand the public good. If I'm a member of the
    public and it's good for me. Does that mean that I'm doing something in the public
    good. Maybe not. But we'll, we'll examine that a bit more closely. A look at things
    in the news. Certainly some things that Are going on these days that Reflect on
    reflect on the fact that computer professionals, change the actions, change the
    world. So what does it mean to be a computer professional And Yeah, how do we
    support the public good. How do we understand the public good, because you see
    that there's A lot of discussion about keeping upholding the public good, but
    without An operational definition of public good. It's a little bit vague, I think.
    So some of the things are going to social context or The social implications of
    competing in a networked world. The impact of social media and individualism and
    collectivism and culture. Person control the Internet. Referred to as a digital
    divide differences in access to digital technology resources that's resulting
    ramifications for gender, class ethnicity geography and or Under underdeveloped
    countries. Or countries in the developing world. access issues. Accessibility
    issues, including legal requirements. And context or computing Okay. So those
    are the that's the general Overview of The topics will consider So in terms of
    the plan. The same as what appears under the meeting for the day. And then under
    the meeting for the day. After the fact, also at the transcript. So that's just
    how lovely things out. And Material to look out for. In support of the meeting
    would be here. So we'll see some of that for next day. Can you hear the commentary
    from my headphones. No. Okay. Okay. My headphones are telling you which devices
    are connected to And when when they lose connection with my iPhone and Anyway,
    I'm never sure what's What's the audible
  persid: DHH
- desc: Anyway,
  persid: ???
- desc: My schedule. Make sure that this link is correct for the office. So if you
    want to send me email. Please don't try and message me On your courses or Either
    use a discussion forums. Or send me email directly. And then this would So don't
    do your courses email. And I don't accept your courses contact requests, because
    it seems to me that the contacts are just They come up and go ahead of any context
    around them. So it's hard for me if I have three classes going on in this semester,
    I don't know where the messages are coming from. So, I just try and Encourage.
    Encourage I encourage you to use the discussion forums or send me email directly
    So in terms of meetings. The meetings are So here we are on the 12th of January.
    And then we go through So we have two or six meetings in January. Six. In February,
    and then Many more nine in March. This is worse than doing math on the board.
    21 plus five. six and six and nine and five is 26 So, Briefly. To look at the
    breakdown of marks. So, I'm going to ask you. Not starting today but To write
    something about the meeting. Within 24 hours so When When I Created the transcript
    and posted that so you can eat. Look at that, for your comments. So If there's
    a question or comment or resource. Or something. Some related idea to expand.
    Upon the discussion. So ask you to submit that here. Seems like the beginning
    very semester. There's a few hiccups so This technology. And so I wasn't sure
    that we're going to have our Your questions. Page Setup and properly put that
    worked out. Anyway, so we'll get into force for stride on Thursday. Individual
    assignments. Will be 35% of the mark. There'll be a project. That involves A number
    of different options. For 25 And then the exam final exam will be 25 And then
    five marks for participation. So that will include attendance at meetings and
    some other things. OK, so The PDF version of the syllabus on Thursday. Do the
    breakout rooms breakout group. So instead of having them act be randomly. Configured
    from date from meeting to meeting. I'll make up a list of groups. So you'll have
    be in the same breakout room breakout group for the whole semester. So instead
    of Having to Click on your microphone when there's 129 practice people Listening
    to you. So we'll make the groups, a little bit more manageable. So you can have
    a discussion. And maybe I'll call on different groups, different group each day
    to to the summary. See how that works. So make sense. Any questions or concerns
    about The breakdown of So,
  persid: DHH
- desc: How the marketing of group assignment will be done. Make 100% so
  persid: S07
- desc: Yeah, so there's no group assignment. It should add up to 100% without the
    group assignment. So 10 plus 35 is 45 plus 25 is 7025 for the exam. 95 and then
    five for participation. If that's not correct. I'm not gonna give you something
    other than It should total 100 Oh yes, I forgot to say about research credits
    up to the 2% up to two bonus marks. So in the case that there are research. Credits
    available. You could get a new god all 100 marks. Then you could end up with 102
    So those So the total with a bonus are On the page. Has anyone heard about these
    research credits from Computer Science Department participant pool.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But not for
  persid: S04
- desc: Yeah, so the Computer Science participle. This modeled after the one in psychology
    And So if there are, because from time to time. It's nice to actually Get People
    to try things out. So they might be user studies or they might Be some Things
    are I guess their user studies in in general terms. So you can earn one mark.
    Preach study in which you participate So the idea is in a little talk about this
    in terms of an ethical position. So don't want we want enough to say thank you,
    but not so much to say it's no longer possible. I don't really want to do this
    but Because the amount of bonus works is so high. That I can't say no. So then
    you don't have not giving free and informed consent. Because you're being coerced.
    If I say I'll give you a 75% bonus To do this. Study And might be too hard to
    say no. Anyway, so we're not, we don't have a 75% bonus So one 1% bonus per steady
    doesn't. I don't think it's two courses. So since thanks, who not Not, not it's
    not enough to Pitch to do something different. If you're really opposed to the
    idea of doing the study, then One one bonus Mark won't dissuade you are would
    encourage you to Lisa my my thinking is so it's enough to say thank you, but not
    enough to encourage Her to act of coercion. Anyway, So I'm the research participant
    pool coordinator. So if, if there's something going on. You'll see it here. If
    there's an opportunity. You'll see it here. Okay, so there's nothing listed There
    isn't going to be anything available. Okay, that makes sense. Think suddenly turn
    their microphone. Microphone on but didn't want it didn't mean to speak to the
    whole group.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Hardly mark the attendance.
  persid: S08
- desc: Goes through that next day so I'm going to Share a password with you. I think
    we'll do it about midway point through each meeting. But we'll try it out. Next
    day And then we'll just do it from then on. Okay, so there's like a Code to use
    that all put in the chat. And then To have a window and For you to enter your
    attendance. Okay. So this isn't a new way for me to do it. I've heard great things.
    This is a This is a great way to do it. Yeah, so we'll see we'll work it out.
    Okay, so I've got a couple of videos in mind. That like he's looking at for next
    day. So I'm just gonna One of the one from Damon horowitz's TEDx talk called My
    headphones. You're telling me when it loses my connection its connection to my
    phone. It doesn't tell me when we gained it so it just hear about it being lost.
    Anyway, So I think it's called Covered a moral operating system. So I'll put the
    link in the transcript from today's Chat. And The other one is from the Hour of
    Code. Anyone heard about the Hour of Code. Well, There was, there was Computer
    Science Education Week. Well, they still is. Yes. It goes on. During or it scheduled
    to coincide with a week that Contains grasshoppers birthday. You will know who
    Grace Hopper is She Person behind Kobo I could ask anyone know what cobalt is
    Common business oriented language. And she's also the person who popularized The
    phrase computer bug. By finding a moth amongst vacuum tubes. And I believe she
    also popularized It's easier to get forgiveness than permission. And there's a
    she do, she was on Letterman in the 80s. I think that hasn't been taken down.
    Anyway, I'll post some information about her. She came to the University of Regina
    in 1974 to give a lecture when the Department of Computer Science. Was just getting
    started. So it was a big deal. So, and we had Dave Palmer. Alumnus From our department.
    give a presentation on December 9 which is grasshoppers birthday. Anyone see that
    virtual presentation. Anyway, I have to I'll post a link to that as well. But
    anyway to get back to code.org so An hour of code. So there are a few years when
    CS education week was Getting going along. And then No and see 2011 I think or
    so. Maybe 12 The idea was to get people to do an Hour of Code. And so to support
    this. They had a couple of videos. And the videos have changed over the years.
    So I'll put a link to the current one. To a 10 minute video. The serve Well I
    study computer science. Kind of video So I'd like you to look at that one as well.
    So does anyone think we're not going to have enough topical material to talk about
    this semester. I think we will not run out of things to come from the news.
  persid: DHH
- desc: There's plenty to talk about, I think,
  persid: S05
- desc: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Maybe too much to talk about. But anyway, so we'll see
    how the idea is not to take sides. Anyway, the idea is to talk about the computer
    professionals role in this. And examine things From the perspective of What we
    can do do As current and future professionals. This aspiring professionals, where
    we can do to uphold the public good. Okay. So I think it'll be A lively semester.
    So we're not, I'm not going to ask you to do anything. Today, but we'll get the
    Get the spot for your Your, your thoughts about today's the next meeting. Or the
    just past meeting most not start that won't start that today, it will start it
    on Thursday. Okay. So any questions or concerns.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I'm Seeing A lot of discussion about proctor track in the chat. I don't know
    if there is an alternative to that or maybe a different solution for a final exam
    or something. I'm just seeing a lot of people concerned about it in chat right
    now.
  persid: S09
- desc: Thanks. Again, Discussion about it. And I'll put it. So what I'll do is I'll
    add some links to the material from the University In terms of Okay. So, hello.
    just posted the link to the video that I was going to add So this is the one Okay,
    so Concerned about proctor crack So, In general, I mentioned proctor track today
    because I mentioned proctor track because I didn't want to not mention it. But
    in terms of my My approach to the final exam. I would like your input in decide
    in developing an exam and evaluation that Is a fair assessment. Of Your learning
    over the course of the semester. Yeah. So I noticed people are sending me used
    to be called private messages. Now, Lucy updated direct message. So please don't
    write to me privately. The conversation. So if you send me a direct message that
    I'm not included inclined to include it. But if I'm summarizing the The contents
    of the chat. I wouldn't put anyone's name in it. So, So just as a Rule of thumb.
    Let's try and Keep the conversation. Public But not so public that mean we're
    not going to do this in a public forum. We have some protection are the Only people
    who can join The meeting here are those who got the invitation. And registered.
    And I think that's a bit of an oversimplification. And for some books or for someone
    who got zoom bomb blast winter. I'm a little bit more wary of Limitations of zoom
    Anyway, Time for today. So I will So we're out of time for today. And I don't
    mean to say that we're going to have a certain kind of exam. I wanted to Say if
    we're going to have a proctored exam. This is we need to use proctor track. There's
    some other options. And turn it in as Is a reasonable solution as well. So this
    is a conversation to have. Yeah, so I can Make a poll about some things Some options.
    And I'll make I'll do I'll do your courses. Feedback. For saying this generally
    in meetings so that We have a record outside of zoom There's a question about
    Polls and you're in, zoom, and then, so those are Nice, in some ways, but then
    they don't start to make them last outside of zoom For So anyway, lots of questions,
    lots of discussions to have And we're out of time. Like I Said today. So we'll
    talk about things. On Thursday. Okay. Thanks very much. See everyone on Thursday.

  persid: S04

  persid: S36
- desc: is there a group project?
  persid: S45
- desc: ^The marks distribution I think is given on UR courses, all the sections have
    the percentage assigned to it, but I'm not sure
  persid: S10
- desc: '...I wish I just had a 1-2 page accumulated summary of all the assignments...'
  persid: S15

  persid: S13

  persid: S52
- desc: yeah what is the deal with that?
  persid: S53
- desc: the others make up 100% already
  persid: S07
- desc: my guess is project itself is a group thing
  persid: S52

  persid: S13
- desc: "sorry I was late are we takingattendance\uFF1F"

  persid: S10
- desc: lol
  persid: S02
- desc: haha
  persid: S56
- desc: lol
  persid: S32

  persid: S01
- desc: "nice idea \U0001F4A1 @keegan"
  persid: S37
- desc: what do you mean keegan?
  persid: S15
- desc: We had attendance that way in CS215 and it seemed to work well
  persid: S04
- desc: lol I think that's cheating
  persid: S57
- desc: proctor track will know your on a virtual machine
  persid: S43
- desc: "do we need web cam for exam in this course\uFF1F"
  persid: S54
- desc: CS215 was a movie last semester lol
  persid: S24

  persid: S59
- desc: '...me being random, don''t mind me'

  persid: S60
- desc: assembly language
  persid: S43
- desc: and paper right?
  persid: S15
- desc: "\U0001F633"
  persid: S61
- desc: "Proctortrack probably doesn\u2019t work with VMs"
  persid: S08
- desc: So privacy concern still remains
  persid: S08
- desc: '@keegan & @Jennifer I believe their is a way to set it up with video capabilities
    but ill look into this. I'
  persid: S01
- desc: Proctortrack can still be bypassed but it is still much more effort
  persid: S46
- desc: Especially with compromise of the proctortrack last year
  persid: S08
- desc: I think we'll have lots
  persid: S13
- desc: the entire great hack or the social dilemma lol
  persid: S58
- desc: Didn't social media help cause everything?
  persid: S43
- desc: social media showed everything in the light
  persid: S15
- desc: It sure helped in spreading it
  persid: S10
- desc: started as a utopian world and it seems to dystopian
  persid: S58
- desc: I was in cs 201 last semester and my proctor track kept restarting..so my
    prof had to add me on zoom instead
  persid: S52
- desc: https://mediaspace.uregina.ca/media/Introduction+to+Online+Learning/0_1fd99ylw
  persid: S62
- desc: The department head recorded this and he covers Proctortrack (and related
    concerns) very well
  persid: S62
- desc: 'Link to video that I mentioned at the start: https://mediaspace.uregina.ca/media/Introduction+to+Online+Learning/0_1fd99ylw'
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think protrack proposes some concerns but generally the alternative is a
    much harder open book exam.
  persid: S01
- desc: ^ open book exams are ruthless
  persid: S53
- desc: One suggestion right off the bat is a term paper based on topics we've learned
  persid: S19
- desc: i.e take home essay due in a couple of days or so.
  persid: S19
- desc: Yeah I'd rather not have an open book exam for sure
  persid: S13
- desc: "I\u2019d take open book exam over use of proctortrck"
  persid: S08
- desc: rather write exam with eyes closed and hands tied than open book
  persid: S07
- desc: I would prefer marks spread between a midterm and a final rather than just
    a final
  persid: S63
- desc: lol
  persid: S29
- desc: ^^ Rhythm haha :)
  persid: S62
- desc: '@reanne same'
  persid: S43
- desc: ^^^^
  persid: S01
- desc: Time based closed exam on Zoom and UR Courses can be a good alternative
  persid: S10
- desc: People can still cheat hardcore that way. I think the term paper is a solid
    idea cause it can be vetted through turnitin
  persid: S53
- desc: If we have any options for final exam like blog writing etc. then it might
    be good!!
  persid: S64
- desc: ^agree
  persid: S10
- desc: Would Dr.Hepting be able to make a poll on URcourses to see what options we
    like?
  persid: S19
- desc: Thanks!
  persid: S19
- desc: Can we make groups by our selfs ?
