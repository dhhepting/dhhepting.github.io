Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning, everyone. doing today. See. This nicely being an old older person.
    I was able to go get my. astro Seneca shot yesterday at the drive through. very
    smoothly. And not too much worse for the worse for wear after getting the. Progress
    is being made. talking with. The keeps people. to having a. An employer perspective
    on professionalism. And so we're still i'm still working on that and know where
    three meetings left after today. But we'll. See you later. Let me. share my screen
    here. And then we can go from there. Students getting having problems logging
    into your courses is this just today. Or is it, then a persistent problem. Okay
    well. Today, only for. Doing attendance and. I mean. I know everyone's keen to
    get. Every opportunity to. get a fraction even a fraction of a mark so. Cry again
    during later on during the session. i'm still logged in I don't think that I get
    any privileges. Let me put. The chat. Sure i'll try and sign out and sign back
    in again. Consistent so. and hopefully that's. helpful to somebody. for fun let's
    try this more about this error message. That article usually they're. Clear. Article.
    Because it's got some. details. Because my miss configuration of server. server
    name or bind the end. The session can be a tricky one if you held up for your
    all your authentication once. This error, as you may not be able to log into moodle
    or fix it fix. The entries. and need to be checked change in cases where can we
    find a database table. We will configure plugins for the. plugin. So i'm quite
    impressed by this article. i'm not sure why it's still called a Stub. Okay, so,
    judging from comments last day. The idea of. Having a code, the code of ethics.
    cover. And then the mainstream was. was a positive thing in terms of defining.
    behavioral norms for competing professionals. So let's have a discussion about
    the final exam. This is a popular topic in the chat. My feeling is. exam. and
    plug style writing of. An issue. discussed in class. And people would get different
    issues, different questions. have to check on. requirements and regulations, but.
    i've heard people talk about 24 hours. Maybe we can do that longer. Of. The time
    that the question for be receiving a question. or to the time of submission. So
    the final exam is scheduled for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's scheduled for the 20th of April at 2pm.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks.
  persid: ???
- desc: So that would be the. submission time would be. On the 20th exam question
    prevailed on the 19th. You have 24 hours submitted. Oh i'll check on that and
    I can report. definitively on Thursday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Would I be okay to assume that you know we're allowed to type your answers
    as well, like like we've been doing them for all the blogs, and the assignments.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. help with legibility certainly. and don't go. turn it in. OK so. The
    details on Thursday how's that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: sounds good.
  persid: S02
- desc: For the final i'm happy to receive them. So, the reason I. Have a code of
    ethics here is. we're going to talk with electro property or intellectual works.
    A little bit, but I also thought about the. usability. That was. looking for.
    usability usability so design and implement systems that are busty and usability
    secure. listed under professional responsibilities. 2.2 point nine. understand.
    So, based on the understanding that the public good, is always the primary consideration.
    Even though the public good, is not easily defined sometimes. Each principle,
    supplemented by guidelines which provide explanations to assist to being professionals
    and understanding and applying the principle. So that would be a good. guideline
    for air understandable error messages and documentation. So that would help and
    understanding and. So, not so much jargon, but. But some explanation of the jargon
    better yet if there's no jargon at all and just plain explanations. So here's
    understanding that the public good to see paramount consideration. again. So is
    related to privacy they're competing professional should become conversant in
    the various definitions of forms of privacy to understand the rights and responsibilities
    associated with a collection use of personal information. not sure what's going
    on clicking not moving in the text. awareness and understanding of computing related
    to technologies. And the consequences. that's a good principle. We should. Be
    ambassadors for computing. And I guess thats related to see. Something in the
    chat here. that's stories from yesterday let's take a peek. So that's an interesting.
    question. here's an interesting piece an oral arguments October Oracle said that
    google's conduct left unchecked would ruin the software industry by making it
    so developers could not be rewarded for their work when others use their code.
    Google, are you vaccinate. Australia soccer industry by erecting enormous copyright
    hurdles for developers and forcing them either to reinvent the wheel. After they
    wanted to instruct the Community something okay licensing fees to the most dominant
    software companies for the right to carry out simple mundane tasks. I know there's
    something related to that in the code of ethics. finished going. Through understand.
    Understanding. The context. modifying are retiring systems. might be some features
    and they all systems that are important and rely upon. So here's The thing that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is.
  persid: ???
- desc: relevant to the supreme court case in the States. respect the work required
    to produce new ideas inventions creative works and competing artifacts. developing
    new ideas inventions creative works and computing artifacts creates value for
    society and those expend a separate should expect to gain value from their work.
    confessional should therefore credit, the creators of ideas inventions works and
    artifacts and restrict copyrights. and trade secrets license agreements and other
    methods of protecting authors works. of customer unlock recognize some exceptions
    to creators control of work are necessary for the public good. computing professional
    should not unduly opposed reasonable uses of their intellectual works efforts
    to help others by contributing time and energy to projects that help society such.
    Pardon me illustrate a positive aspect of this principle such efforts include
    free and open source software. and work put into the public domain computing professionals
    should not claim private ownership of ship of work, they are others have shared
    is it up. and share its public resources. And I cook reading of the. decision.
    It seems like. Respect for trade secrets and enter to actual property. intellectual
    work. Well, the question is. So. If we should respect copyrights pens trade secrets
    license agreements not protecting office works. So. What. mechanisms are appropriate
    for acknowledging the work of others. This is enough to be cited as Yasser. So
    copyrights. discussed in this case, what about patents. So why don't we take 10
    minutes to do a breakout room discussion about. This one point, this principle
    1.5. as it relates to the Supreme Court case ruling that we just examined. Any
    ideas. That you'd like to share.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay yeah well, I think, for, like us, we really discussed like like. To like
    make a more informed decision, we would like to like know what code they kind
    of use like like from what i've read and understood was. Oracle sued Google over
    code that was under free years which. it's free years. Which is really silly to
    me that they bother like like it seems more like nowadays people don't understand
    what free uses and stuff like that.
  persid: S03
- desc: Now. be widely used the same time. shouldn't be acknowledged. And Oracle being
    credited with. With the code.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: S03
- desc: Go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And there was just a couple things I want my group discussed. first thing
    is part of the issue regarding court cases like this is that, in order to know
    where the line for copyrights and the legality is drawn you need to have a decent
    level of knowledge regarding the subject. and also the other thing is isn't android
    the operating system that's google's being sued over isn't that based on Linux,
    which is already open source software.
  persid: S04
- desc: well. Today, for Java Java language application interface that goes directly
    to my son. And it was later acquired by Oracle so Google actually paid turn around
    30 to $50 billion for the rights to. use that Java application interface to develop
    android much later on Oracle acquired son. So, then, the conflict, our eyes. like
    Google continue their us. without paying over a cold and Google flame that they
    already paid son door it not narrow purse of ciao.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah. This is a big was a big company until it stopped being. Until it's bought
    out by Oracle and. disappeared. How many people remember sun Microsystems.
  persid: DHH
- desc: All I know is that they developed the challenge and great your end.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah. yeah their computers as well. what's the connection between minecraft
    sun Microsystems.
  persid: DHH
- desc: minecraft is written in Java and so you have to install the Java runtime environment
    to use minecraft.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay. Okay, so copyright. yeah. There are some details about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It.
  persid: ???
- desc: mechanisms to. To honor intellectual work. That are complicated but. Should
    we have. The idea of protections for different. works. So i'm not sure that she
    is as a whole, operates in an open source concept, because. Software patents are.
    are an important. piece, for some people. In terms of. opens so programming languages.
    being open source, so they. Have uniformity, but then we also have to make sure
    that there's. consistency and transparency. standards. c++. is maybe. seen as
    a language that. Growing to be off, not all things necessarily many things to
    many people. At a time here any final thoughts. We can we'll continue this. next
    day. Okay, so everyone have a good day take care stay well and we'll see you on
    Thursday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What time are your office hours. Sorry at 233 3330 Okay, thank you.
  persid: S06
- desc: And then 1230 to 230 tomorrow.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you very much.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah you're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: bye.

  persid: S17
- desc: Yes, I just checked right now
  persid: S13
- desc: Mine just started
  persid: S18
- desc: it ususally happens for about 5-10 mins ive seen the same problem before and
    it got fixed soon
  persid: S19
- desc: it was working fine until right before this class
  persid: S17
- desc: just started
  persid: S09
- desc: I have no problem
  persid: S20
- desc: Tried both my laptop and my phone
  persid: S13
- desc: I can't get in at all
  persid: S09
- desc: mine seems to be working
  persid: S21
- desc: I have issues with the webmail
  persid: S14
- desc: ask Zuckerberg or bezos
  persid: S05
- desc: I was already in so it is working
  persid: S22
- desc: or maybe proctortrack
  persid: S05
- desc: yes, they will make sure you give em more data....
  persid: S13
- desc: I cant log in to the ur courses
  persid: S23
- desc: I was logged in and it kicked me out
  persid: S09
- desc: :(
  persid: S09
- desc: can you try sign out and sign back in
  persid: S09

  persid: S13
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S29
- desc: you're welcome, a lot of us were having trouble as well
  persid: S13
- desc: Is anyone know how final exam is going to be ? Like the pattern of the exam!
  persid: S30
- desc: He hasn't talked about it yet Shubh.
  persid: S07
- desc: perhaps essay writing, idk
  persid: S13
- desc: "i have been asking this question last 2 classes\U0001F602\U0001F602"
  persid: S05
- desc: I see I think will wait probably we still have some timw
  persid: S30
- desc: time**
  persid: S30
- desc: "yes please!\U0001F60D\U0001F60D"
  persid: S05
- desc: how much time would be there for submission?
  persid: S31
- desc: 20th April, 2 to 5
  persid: S17
- desc: So we will have 3hours?
  persid: S32
- desc: So the exam will start on april 19 at 5pm?
  persid: S13
- desc: and when will be the question available ?
  persid: S05
- desc: 24 hours later?
  persid: S13
- desc: Sounds good to me
  persid: S18
- desc: Sounds good!
  persid: S17
- desc: Yes Thank you
  persid: S30
- desc: So we will have to just write one blog like the class assignments?
  persid: S32
- desc: I like this idea for the final
  persid: S33
- desc: yes Brandon, that is what we were doing all semester as well.
  persid: S13
- desc: Oh yeah, I'm just saying that it is a really good alternative.
  persid: S33
- desc: awesome
  persid: S05
- desc: https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/05/tech/google-oracle-supreme-court-ruling/index.html
  persid: S18
- desc: Kind of related in the aspect of reusing code for something it was intended
    for.
  persid: S18
- desc: why was it 6-2?
  persid: S08
- desc: '?'
  persid: S13
- desc: There are 9 justices
  persid: S08
- desc: 8 maids a milking...
  persid: S13
- desc: 7 swans a swimming...
  persid: S13
- desc: I would assume one didn't vote
  persid: S21
- desc: Honestly not even sure, cnn is probably not the best reference article, just
    thought it was interesting and somewhat related to the course.
  persid: S18
- desc: Oh it is but why didn't Amy Coney Barrett participate
  persid: S08
- desc: Here is a worse scandal
  persid: S13
- desc: https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/matt-gaetz-defends-lone-no-vote-on-anti-human-trafficking-bill/ar-BB1f8CTW
  persid: S13
- desc: In my opinion that would depend on economic profit
  persid: S08
- desc: If they use your work and make money you should be paid
  persid: S08
- desc: It would also greatly reduce reusability to counter ^
  persid: S18
- desc: or at the very least credited
  persid: S13
- desc: mayhaps have some royalty program give a cent for each use of a program...
  persid: S13
- desc: 'breakout rooms: ACM code of ethics 1.5 and google v. oracle'
  persid: DHH
- desc: it was pretty straight forward, ask, credit and pay other people's material
  persid: S13
- desc: used*
  persid: S13
- desc: Another case of sue for da monies
  persid: S13
- desc: "I don\u2019t think it can be so simple considering this started in 2010 (I\
    \ think it was anyways)"
  persid: S29
- desc: Oracle is a big company, they can keep the fight longer than others
  persid: S13
- desc: Well is the problem that being credit, or is it the use of it since i could
    not understand which one is being used
  persid: S03
- desc: It was uniquely written java code right?
  persid: S13
- desc: Ohh okay I understand
  persid: S04
- desc: Ohhhh, that's interesting Yashvir
  persid: S07
- desc: me
  persid: S14
- desc: Ive seen a couple of their servers
  persid: S04
- desc: can someone send me the attendance code please
  persid: S34
- desc: Because of Minecraft I do haha
  persid: S06
- desc: Also I swore java was open source lol, guess I learned something today
  persid: S04
- desc: Microsoft bought out Mojang who makes Minecraft hhaha
  persid: S08
- desc: '"Corporate Engines" The book, the movie'
  persid: S13
- desc: eh128p
  persid: S22
- desc: JAVA language and its APIs are two different thing. the case is over APIs
    not java
  persid: S05
- desc: As I mentioned in the breakout rooms overall I have challenges with this concept,
    as I think copyrighting and intellectual property really puts a chokehold on creativity
    and disallows smaller companies to innovate.
  persid: S07
- desc: Gotcha. I know very little about java, thanks for the clarification
  persid: S04
- desc: Also CS as a whole generally operates on an open-source concept, where people
    share ideas and knowledge.
  persid: S07
- desc: We shouldn't have to resort to rampant copyrighting if people are willing
    to credit and share with each other their code to an extent
  persid: S13
- desc: '@dayne the problem with not protecting peoples intellectual property is that
    if theres no protections there no reason to innovate because then you just waste
    time and money with no potential reward'
  persid: S08
- desc: I couldn't imagine a world where you had to pay for every snippet of code
    you need.
  persid: S07
- desc: Oh I fully agree that people need credit and to be paid.
  persid: S07
- desc: Same basic blocks of code are open, yes. But not entire algorithms
  persid: S22
- desc: It can be very limiting when used improperly
  persid: S29
- desc: I also am aware that I don't fully understand the context here. To me this
    seems like a petty argument between two giant corps. I would be more interested
    to see how this conversation would go down among smaller devs.
  persid: S07
- desc: Yeah agreed
  persid: S08
- desc: Coding languages should be open source in order to have uniformity
  persid: S05
- desc: the battle between Apple and Epic helped smaller app developers not needing
    to pay 30% in profits which is nice
  persid: S13
- desc: Again, want to point out here how much you need to know about programming
    in order to even understand the case
  persid: S04
- desc: Also some developers come up with new ideas on how to implement old algorithms..
    creating new marketplaces and what not.
  persid: S22
- desc: yes awesome point Dr. Hapting about transparency. Totally agreed
  persid: S05
- desc: Thank you Professor, see you all on thursday
  persid: S04
- desc: Thank you, have a nice day!
  persid: S17
- desc: Thanks, have a nice day
  persid: S21
