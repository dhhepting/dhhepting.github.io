- desc: Good morning. You a link I wasn't keeping a close eye on the clock here. So
    I apologize for starting up a couple of minutes late. How's everyone doing today.
    Inspired by Eli policies video about Paris. Video about Social online spaces.
    I've been working on. Little see the opportunity for some improvements in the
    online space for the course. That I've created Yes, I'm going to get to the password
    for your attendance. Concerned people those attendance. So let's deal with that
    first so So, Let me just share that with you, first of all, Share your password
    with you. posted it in the chat. And let me know if anyone has. Problems with
    it. Finding the attendance activity. Screen.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor is today. The first day where we're taking attendance.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Have a question.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Um, it's the password going to be for like every session or it changes.
  persid: S03
- desc: No, I'm Gonna Be generated randomly each time.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S03
- desc: Will need to go through this I don't want to make it a big deal that A colleague
    suggested that having just a few minutes have it open for just a few minutes.
    Now, not for the whole session. But then I'm not sure how to How to handle that
    through smoothly. And I'm not trying to make this
  persid: DHH
- desc: Punitive
  persid: ???
- desc: Could you Maybe have like a time link on your courses that opens with the
    password. That just might be easier than posting it in chat or something.
  persid: S04
- desc: I'm not sure about that. I said, I think it has something to do with I guess
    I'm not eager to spend a few hours trying to experiment with your courses about
    something that isn't, it isn't. Isn't going to be
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, no worries.
  persid: S04
- desc: What's the word. I don't know. So the thing is, I have to create all these
    Semester I begin with A very positive outlook on what I'm going to be able to
    set up a new our courses. And then it My enthusiasm fades, a little bit, not for
    the course, not for dealing with all you wonderful students But Finding the right
    now are Getting your courses to do What I think is reasonable. Anyway, that's
    a long Long story with not much To do with the class. So I will try it out. So
    my feeling is We'll keep the Keep the attendance period, the same for the whole
    class and then I'll just post the password. Each time Okay, we'll see how it works.
    trouble finding this place. My screen there, record your meetings. Can I look
    at report with you on screen with me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yep.
  persid: ???
- desc: I'm curious if I can use it set myself up as a student. Okay, so here's the
    view that you get as a student look familiar, that says, Submit attendance.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Here.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I find that interesting. Who is who's going to log in and record themselves
    as absent. anyone understand the situation for that one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe work for classes of smaller capacity, like maybe like 30 students
  persid: ???
- desc: Capacity classes. Was like, if it just model capacity class maybe the professor
    would be able to keep track of each and every student, but in our class, for example,
    it's 150 students. It wouldn't make sense to have the apps and option.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because there's no way you'd be able to drag each and every student
  persid: ???
- desc: Yeah, no, I just meant. I don't think students are going to, I could I could
    record people as absent. If I'm taking attendance. But I'm I'm just saying students
    to give students the option to record themselves as absent after they login connectivity
    is kind of funny. I thought Oh, here I am, I'm absent today. Anyway, It's just
    funny to me sitting here. And I sense. It's not funny to anybody out there unless
    I see a lot of Check the chat. See if I have any Anyone else thinks it's funny.
    Okay. Oh, there we go. Thanks. Will do for attendance in some form. We'll see
    how it goes. Let me switch to the class. Okay. So I did have the syllabus across
    yesterday, but then I realized it didn't have the link your courses running to
    it. So here's a PDF From my website. The dates are correct and the links are working
    to So there'll be Talking about assignments. The first assignment first individual
    assignment would be Do on Thursday, February 11 in three weeks. That's to write
    A blog post. And I have a description. I just, I just need to get it. Turned on
    again. Sorry. I'll do that. Today I I planted it today or possibly tomorrow morning.
    Topics. Yeah. 123459 Units. Knowledge areas. So the SP is Knowledge. Area, and
    then the social context, for example, is the knowledge area. Click there then
    we see Learning outcomes. So you can pick whatever Pick something from this list
    of My Mac Book is having Some issues have crashed on me yesterday. And then I
    call I tried to put a call to support and they gave him my phone number and settle
    kairos in two minutes and I didn't hear from them. And that was completely unexpected
    for Apple. Expected to hear some kind of Response but We'll try it again next
    week. So anyway, write a blog post and I'm going to have a sound of a sample.
    Ready for you. Are included with the description and I'll send a note when that
    comes up. So there's these three assignments. So there's a blog post about A topic
    of your choosing from this list of topics. Or From this list of knowledge areas.
    And our knowledge unit. You can find one that's connected To the topic here. I
    want correct myself again. So we'll just say topic, pick a topic from this Collection
    here on the web page. And then we have A project that can be a research paper.
    Can be done in groups, small groups of your choosing. Okay, so sorry, I thought
    I turned off direct messaging. Okay. So majority have a question, would like to
    rate. So, It's not about the videos per se. It's not about Can include the videos.
    Idea is to write a response. Following the meeting and see if I can change that
    wording a bit better. It just happened. So here we're talking about meeting for
    So for meeting for what's the most important thing you learned from this meeting.
    Like that could be something That that you include in your response. If there's
    a concept from the meeting that was marred. It was difficult for you to understand
    What was it What would you like to know more about Something you encountered thats
    related to the past meeting. So meeting for if there's a link or the story that
    Came up Filter. Topical thing. These days, And so is this discussion about How
    to improve social networking platforms in The kind of responsibility. So speaking
    about your courses. I think for me to get the desired effect from From this meetings
    for my need to make them make a forum for each meeting. And so the idea is for
    you to Post things Until you have until midnight as a day before the next meeting.
    So for today's meeting you could post a response. Until midnight of Monday. Well,
    practically midnight. So to make sure it's Monday. Is one minute to midnight.
    On Monday. Okay, so I gave you a option to say your understanding of the purpose
    of computing That could be a one of you. It could be your response. Yeah, so I'm
    not looking for specific right answer I'm looking For things that came out of
    The meeting. You're able to really send me direct messages.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Dr happening. If we If we wrote about those two videos that you linked under
    meeting three, is that OK. Enough for engagement or
  persid: S04
- desc: Yeah, so that's fine. I'm not asking for a full summary of the videos. I Everyone's
    concerned about marks. I'm not sure how to make this clear. Okay. So just somebody
    say I reset the chat to send to everybody. So I said stop sending direct messages.
    Because the person who is sending me direct messages. Now, is no longer in the
    meeting. I sent that I tried to sit return to stop sending direct messages to
    that person and then zoom told me, they're not in the meeting anymore. So I'm
    just sending it to blanket to everybody. Because even though I'm selecting Participants
    can Chat with everyone publicly It's not stopping direct messages. And I would
    like to make sure that comments, get out to everybody. And I put a smiley face
    at the end so Just to set the pro not to make it too. Too much For someone just
    send me a direct message like this. Yes. So don't do that. So I don't know what
    Zoom is good for in this case because it says I'm able to give the impression
    I can set something to to not allow them, but they still keep coming. So please
    be aware that you're Huh. Anyway, okay, so
  persid: DHH
- desc: It's
  persid: ???
- desc: almost halfway into class here. So let's try and progress a little bit So
    I, I put those two videos in to the Into the meeting. Summary from last day. So
    really, Date of birth, they don't post deal with filter bubbles. But the second
    one is certainly An important topic.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry, you said that there's videos for today, but they weren't. Where were
    they
  persid: S05
- desc: There at the end of the last day summary.
  persid: DHH
- desc: In the future, is that where those are going to go. Are they going to be under
    the plan for today, like they were in for the week two meetings are they going
    to be in one place over the other, they can kind of be moving around.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yeah, so that was my comments at the beginning about rethinking how I'm organizing
    things online. I was thinking that Instead of having to different places for things
    And I will Restructure things so that I'm just Making notes about meetings in
    one place. So if I look over here. Came up here. When you look at a data. So there
    you have the last day can be a summary. Show this summary shown as a summary,
    but the plan for today can show that this is an outline I'm Kind of in the middle
    here. strat and trying to take the feedback from last semester. To make things
    more transparent and to Make things More accessible. So I was going to be consistent
    with this. Maybe I could knit call this next meeting. Instead of a subject here
    sort of a topic there. I could see next meeting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, it just makes more sense to me for have like the plan for next meeting
    before where we can go to, like, get ready for the next meeting. So we have the
    videos there as well as the topics will be discussing Versus having that in the
    summary for the previous day because I see the summary, the previous day more
    of a What, what do we talked about last class for writing up the summaries. You
    go into it. Look at the notes and get refresh on it doesn't make a lot of sense
    to have the next week's classes and the previous day's stuff as much
  persid: S05
- desc: Sure. Okay. Here. New client. Up screen. saw someone raise your hand, Jennifer.
    I didn't mean to scare you away. Part two Okay, so here, let me in Poland, I'll
    share it. So about 5050 Certainly more than 50% didn't see it. Okay, so What I'll
    do then is I will not Put next meeting stuff into the summary of the previous
    meeting, but I'll put it into the plan. For the next day. Okay. Please stop sending
    direct messages. In chat. Okay. Thanks. So just, it seems like the setting in
    zoom to disallow, it doesn't work. And I would just rather not have the conversation
    directed at me. Okay. Okay, so let me take some time to Start a breakout room
    here breakout rooms for us. So because I'm not doing registration for meetings
    and not everybody is Using their year Jana dresses. I have a feeling it's going
    to be difficult to do a breakout groups. So what I'd like to you to think about
    is I'm going to put you together with See Many Around five other people Maybe
    See what options. I can do. But anyway, so it just like you to spend some time
    to discuss amongst yourselves. What is The purpose of competing for you. And does
    that Require moral framework to support it. Makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, that sounds about right. That makes sense to me.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay. Alright, so here we go into our random breakout rooms. actually create
    Will create breakout rooms. Okay, so you're gonna be put into a breakout room
    and then And then about 10 minutes call Bring us back and then we can Discuss
    so we Discuss what came up And Go from there. Okay, so here we go. Any questions,
    I see a couple people coming out of breakout rooms. Daniel row hand. You should.
    For those of you who have come out of the room. I don't need to reassign it to
    the room, but you can Join Should be able to join on your own. Discussions about,
    well, you can ask what the discussion is when you're in the room. All right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Hi Dr have 10 looks like no one in my breakout room is just talking at all.
  persid: S07
- desc: Which breaker where you're in
  persid: DHH
- desc: A Dean one eight
  persid: S07
- desc: Well, there's somebody in the room normal I'm not sure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: I'm just Ready to close the rooms. Now, so we'll talk about somebody Pick
    up Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because there were a couple people are there in my room and then just like
    no one was just talking no one at their minds on our video nothing
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: All right. So we'll talk about that. I'm just going to close the rooms now.
    Okay. Sounds good. Thank you, sir. You're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It wasn't bad.
  persid: S08
- desc: It wasn't bad. Okay, so Let's see, for breakout rooms that we have Video on
    and microphones on We're dealing with five or six people. I think That can be
    reasonable. reasonable expectation So you don't need microphones on For the For
    the main meeting room me main meeting room, but we can To encourage chat. And
    to encourage discussion so cameras. Cameras on all without microphones are Welcome
    for the main meeting room but As you say cameras on and microphones on for the
    breakout room. That's the expectation, so that People don't Sit there and Wonder
    what you're supposed to be doing, and nobody's talking and nobody see seeing each
    other. So I heard about one or two groups that Had problems that were or were
    there were other people in the group, but no one was doing anything. Anyone has
    some experiences.
  persid: DHH
- desc: breakout rooms eyes. I think it was fine.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay. So I think we're not going to keep the same breakout rooms so I'm glad
    you had a good discussion. Anything that
  persid: DHH
- desc: Came up, you want to share
  persid: ???
- desc: We kind of just talked about why we got into programming and kind of where
    we're going. Where we plan on going in the future and classes that we're taking
    this semester and just getting to know our classmates, things like that.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay. Good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Um, yeah, I find it a good experience we. It was a little bit awkward at the
    start, but a managed to make a Google Doc and write down some some thought points
    about those two videos. Sounds good.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay. Good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah we I forget what group we're in, but we talked about what like what we
    like to do with coding kind of projects we've worked on experiences we've had
    with the moral compass and programming and such.
  persid: S10
- desc: Okay. Good to know.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The bias in the data systems and data sets that we have right now, which Question
    is about the model system and how it will eventually have the same biases. If
    we use the same old data sets.
  persid: S11
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: That's certainly an issue that if you think that Computer systems are going
    to magically save us from our Our biases. It's a nice thought that, you know,
    if we do it by machine then Things are going to Get better because machines are
    cold and calculating But on the other hand, we forget that it's people who tell
    the computers what to do. And so It's become an issue with Bias in Recommendation
    systems. So that we see that this Is a danger for for not aware of it. We don't
    May have intention to Deal with it. And when in encountered That one biases encountered
    That the virus will be transferred into the systems. That will be Perpetuating
    our own
  persid: DHH
- desc: One thing we discussed in our group is how um you know in terms of many professions.
    There's like Sort of an accountability council that you have to join whether your
    physician you have like the College of Physicians and stuff like that. But with
    with Technology, there isn't something like that you can opt to join it, but it's
    not something that you're just part of and part of that is just due to the fact
    that, you know, Basically the the barrier to entry is a lot lower. When it comes
    to technology, anybody can do it. So you can be self taught you can be You can
    go through school. You can get a certificate and so That would be difficult to
    implement. Like a regulation system that you have to join right from them from
    where you are.
  persid: S12
- desc: Yeah, that's right. And so in Canada. We have the Canadian information processing
    society. And then the information services professional This designation that
    some people have There's an interesting issue in Canada because Engineering on
    Claims idea software engineering and they have a PNG. And this is This has not
    been handled well for the last Several decades, I think, and I don't know if it's
    going to be handled well in the future either. The so there are competing designations
    that aren't required And so we'll have someone from kips come and talk to us a
    Bit later in the semester.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Another interesting thing about that when we can say like, it is not confined
    to just one field. You can use computing and all sorts of fields from biology
    to like physics statistics so
  persid: S13
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks.
  persid: ???
- desc: Yeah so computing is ubiquitous. And that makes it even harder to to regulate
    We don't see ads say that, you know, we need somebody with a ISP or a PNG designation
    to write code for us. It's like, can you do this. Well, sure. I can do that and
    then You know the manual read Or you're looking to stack overflow or something.
    As you go through and Anyway, I see that we're past our meeting time today. So
    I encourage you to Keep these discussions going and And for Tuesday. We'll look
    at both of those Eli Pariser videos. And I'll make them appear in the plan for
    Tuesday. As well as have Yeah, so then the assignment stuff will will appear in
    your courses and also to know when that does
  persid: DHH
- desc: So,
  persid: S14
- desc: Okay, so thank you for today. And Have a good weekend and I'll see you on
    Tuesday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A doctor happening.
  persid: S15
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So the filter couples video do you want us to watch this on our own homework
    or will be we will we be watching those in class together.
  persid: S15
- desc: So the idea would be to watch them at a time. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you.
  persid: S15
- desc: You're welcome. One more question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If we've already discussed the filter bubble video and the other video in
    the last discussion, what should we discuss in this next upcoming Post

  persid: S49
- desc: majority of all have a question that, what to write in meeting 3 about the
    new videos filter bubble or old ones code star and moral operating system?
  persid: S50
- desc: Would it be possible to include a small assignment description and the due
    dates on the syllabus?
  persid: S51
- desc: I think it was the summary of all our ideas about the videos
  persid: S19
- desc: from moral frameworks, to what is computing, etc
  persid: S19
- desc: I think we had to write about our understanding of the purpose of computing.
  persid: S52
- desc: You're just supposed to comment on the discussions/topics of the last meeting
  persid: S40
- desc: Ok, so it is just the discussion of that meeting not the videos posted. I
    got it. thanks.
  persid: S50
- desc: I thought it was understanding of purpose of computing
  persid: S53
- desc: me too
  persid: S54
- desc: Yeah, that's what I thought too - only "your understanding of purpose of computing"
  persid: S30
- desc: We discussed that during class, y'all. It's a valid topic. He's just ensuring
    you're interacting with our class discussions and taking in the information.
  persid: S12
- desc: so we can discuss things brought up in the links?
  persid: S16
- desc: ^ i.e those two TED Talks.
