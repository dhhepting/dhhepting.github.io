Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. Apparently it's minus 50 with wind chill today. I remember.
    When I was. Maybe it as an undergraduate or before going to. High School or public
    school. hearing on the radio in the morning, that exposed flesh would freeze and
    less than 30 seconds. I don't hear those kinds of warnings of anymore, although
    it certainly fit for a day like today. We also used to hear that. there's wind
    chill. To be minus 100. So now I realized that they changed the wind chill scale,
    so that they don't get. minus 100 values. And I would tell people that voted at
    minus 100 which when children that. They just wouldn't accept that minus 50 I
    guess that's more reasonable I. Sure, maybe first me get attendance kind of the
    way. My car wouldn't start this morning I started last night. should be good,
    at least until the morning. And then I had to spend. I spent a few minutes outside
    trying to get what I thought was the cover of the block heater receptacle. Because
    I didn't have to plug it in as a fairly new car. And plug it in before. So trying
    to figure out how to get the car plugged in. And then. Going back to the manual.
    So I was hoping to find. And an illustration of. How to operate cover or what
    I think is cover. And it's just some text about plugging it in and. More indication
    of whether you're skeptical is so. This is maybe like a Microsoft manual as well.
    So it's good to say that maybe. Maybe it's the Microsoft people who are writing
    the. The Ford manuals. Owners manuals. It just seems like. When I go to look for
    things in that book. it's not designed for me to find an answer it's. yeah. yeah
    the card on a blue screen of death, maybe in the future of the group, but dashboard
    of death. Considering that. Mercedes one to be to be talked about having me. screen.
    anyway. Think everything's. frozen here going slower in my computer's too close
    to the outside wall here. Somebody sent me a direct message you can. Go and select
    everyone again. there's the password in the chat. Simon ready for the break. I
    couldn't agree with you. A little bit. share my screen, I guess, I didn't. sorry
    about that. meeting today so 10 before the break. And then we'll be 16 afterwards
    so we're not. we're about 40% the way through. To 50. Almost. I didn't publish
    this. Time. I realized it. didn't get published. in a timely fashion so. I apologize
    for that. Anyone here, but so a few things I want to go through, and then. We
    can, some of you have referenced Kristen Harris videos. Has anyone seen him in
    a social dilemma. Okay. yeah. or. doing a reaction on your window would be fine
    too. Anyone. How many people have heard about. i'm not a cat. said enough to give
    you the.
  persid: DHH
- desc: story.
  persid: ???
- desc: Apparently, is taken over the Internet, over the past. Two days ago, I think.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Love about that video to is in the top left corner, is the warning saying
    it's illegal to record it but somebody couldn't miss the opportunity to record.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah risking six months jail time.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: contents like that.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah. Anyway, it's a short video so i'm gonna. i'm gonna play it, so this
    is the link to CBC kids news I thought that was interesting. Some some news is
    there's a fit for kids to watch.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I just saw this.
  persid: S04
- desc: Apparently us using the system's 10 year old. laptop. Now it seems to be zoom.
    i'm not aware of any zoom clients have kitty filters available. Have any have
    you gotten. A CAP filter. For zoom. Anyway, here is the video. had indicated,
    maybe the theme, the theme for today could be brand new problems question mark.
    server and was very happy, this is a light moment to share. Their wisdom Nice
    that it could be shared so quickly. And there's nothing. it's not anyone's expense.
    That we get from this. fact that we can. We can share things so quickly. In the
    modern days. Is that a brand new problem or. well. it's not. A brand new problem
    in. maliciously but it's a brand new opportunity as well, I guess. that's. that's
    part of the. CT use the catchphrase for the course that's part of the risk and
    reward of living in the information society, these days. rewards. To carry it
    on that theme is that we can. The tool, the tools that we use are very flexible.
    in the sense that we can decide what what to do and. We can take an active role
    in designing things. meet our needs and our situations you don't have to. Look,
    for off the shelf systems. We don't have to do things the way that. The software.
    The software indicates, it should be done so. So, first of all responses to meetings.
    engagement with meetings. what's on the screen now is. Is a summary. Of the comments
    or the. Responses I received from from you in. The engagement of meeting forum
    for meeting. eight. But there's a great variability in their responses and getting.
    In terms of length and contents of some. You know i've talked about, not so much
    a summary as. A key key points. This is what i've written here. that's what I
    reference for in the last question so response to the most recent meeting that
    can include one or more, the following. The most important thing you learned from
    the meeting the concept from the past meeting that was most difficult for you
    understand what you would like to know more about. something you encountered that
    is related to the past meeting. Is that. Could this description being more clear.
    Would it be better to say. pick one of these. because some of the. Lessons responses
    for the meeting eight went up to about five or 600 words. So I haven't when I
    included the responses to pass meetings in. The page here. or here I didn't do
    everything exactly. I didn't quote everything. But with 100 and some people in
    the class is this list. This helpful, or should it be. summarize further. Having.
    100 words for the response. That helps to clarify things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah i'd be fine with that I think the only issue i'm having is there any
    way, we could get some sort of a feedback for the responses, because i'm not really
    sure if it's exactly what you want, or not, if that makes sense.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah so. When i'm grading them. I can only great with a mark I can't leave
    a comment with him. So I would say what I would like is one of these things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well it's most important, like most of the chat agrees with 140 character
    word count or something like that.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah okay 140 characters. And it's more more substantially reduced than I
    would like so it's like reading a tweet about the meeting. 140 words is maybe
    a bit longer. So here's a bit of trivia do you know how. The link I think tech
    an. SMS message length is 160 characters. Anyone know how that link was determined.
    Is that they're.
  persid: DHH
- desc: paying for the towers, or something like that.
  persid: S02
- desc: Was the story, I heard was that the fellow who designed, it was he looked
    at a collection of postcards and he kind of the letters were in the postcard messages.
    And he decided that hundred and 60 was. He founded 160 years ago about the average.
    So I looked at the length of the. Responses to meeting eight and I noticed that
    they were. The median was about 100. So I thought that might be. A good length.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I feel it was inspired by the. SMS thing the more than 140 characters would
    split into two different SMS is so they just kept kept it so that it wouldn't
    split them into two.
  persid: S07
- desc: So I think the SMS is 160 isn't it twitter's 140 or was 140. To begin with.
    So they can't 20 characters for their own. own housekeeping so on so forth. yeah
    you can have more than one message put together, but I guess it's the question
    of. what's a reasonable amount what's the reasonable size for a unit, so that
    you don't have to. break them into more than one. here. Waiting for me. Okay.
    To look at the history of. These different standards and just to understand. relates
    to that quote we looked at from Steve Jobs, you know when you realize that. Everything
    that around around us was designed by people who were no smarter than us. You
    know, then we can change things so. pattern 60 characters was. nobody's walking
    around with their phone. They might be talking to my son and video chat. I get
    motion sickness to talk to him because he's always moving around. anyway. i'll
    put a word count limit on the. Okay, so we're counted as one thing we can do.
    And what about the instructions here. So that's one thing to consider, then we
    show you what i've. done here with. The transcript that I posted in on to your
    courses in the vtt file. So here, I have. So what I did was I consolidated I took
    out the timestamps. And I changed people's. Names I gave them identifiers. So
    when a student one. Until those names are this is to replace the names to protect
    the innocent. And, here is my identifier D H h. And what I did was I. took all
    the messages and into the block. I can can say that all messages from the same
    speaker. In a row so. So there's a different speaker here. stops and then I start
    again, this is actually me, but it was identified as me. Better. So when I was
    thinking of. summarizing the transcript. just going through the vtt file. Was
    was. very tedious so this way. It makes a little more. reasonable to read. So.
    Unless the audio I didn't do the the chat transcript, but I could do the chat
    transcript in the same way. Just provided as a standalone not trying to synchronize
    it with. The timestamps. So maybe maybe the audio and the chat transcripts are.
    interesting and useful to have. on their own, and then I can. Take this and make
    the summary out of it. So what i'm going to suggest is that we have. breakout
    rooms. To discuss. pretend minutes and then we'll come back together and talk
    about things. That seem all right is that. Clear. Well we're supposed to discuss.
    The way things are set up. So we have not, this is from the chat so we haven't.
    talked about a minimum well minimum would be zero I guess. Your words you wouldn't
    have to do them. Over time, but having a maximum of 100 words. And we can so.
    Okay, so TIM. I don't know i'm not sure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Then.
  persid: ???
- desc: Because there were have the ability to be flexible in the class in the design
    of the class. And we have these different things available to us. and want to
    make sure I want to do my best to make sure that we're. valuing your feedback
    about. The way things are going the way things are being. Here we're using this
    technology. And the information that we have and the opportunities. With the web
    and so forth, and audio transcripts and. so on and so forth, to. make this the
    best. make the best use them to support our. Efforts to think critically about
    computing. So that's the reason why taking 10 Minutes it. Has a 40% mark. Of the
    class meetings. anyway. So i'd like you. In your groups to think about. What could
    be improved or clarified about what i'm asking you to do for engagement. To reading
    your responses to the meetings. And then. All the records are all the things are
    laid out on the meetings page. This is a summary of responses, a good. thing to
    do, I kind of have an. meeting a. summary of responses. And the summary of what
    was discussed in the outline. and so on and so forth, I guess. what's there that's
    not. working for you and what's not there, that would be nice to have. Okay, anyway.
    Here we go. 10 minutes turn now we'll get the act together.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hi Professor. I was in breakout room 11 but I had to change my privacy settings
    to use my microphone so you can can you throw me back in that room.
  persid: S08
- desc: sure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S08
- desc: Jennifer Jennifer. Jennifer okay. Coming back. Any. New thoughts to share,
    about. About. Engagement the responses to the engagement for meetings. engagement
    with meetings.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So i'm happy with them that seems clear to me.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think our group is pretty unanimous and the fact that you've gone above
    and beyond honestly in making this class accessible, I feel like you've done so
    much work and. It doesn't you know, like I think it's it's all great.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: One thing make it easier for you um and it might also be more helpful for
    us is, if you just for instead of summarizing all the different responses. That
    seems like a lot of effort for you, I think what might be a better idea is just
    choose a favorites response that you wanted to highlight and us to think about
    and just posted anonymously and choose that one we can read, one for each class
    sort of thing.
  persid: S05
- desc: Maybe I can it's fairly straightforward to do the. Do the list of them. So
    I can I can do, the list of them. And then just we'll just talk about one of them.
    So okay. In the chat there's a comment about having more about hdi design concepts.
    This isn't really the hdi class where we talk more about that, which is 428. But
    the same time we're going to talk a bit more about. hdi stuff. In terms of empathy
    and. So on so we'll do a bit more. But if you're interested in hdi then i'd encourage
    you to look at 428 so well. Okay. Anything else.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Could you maybe just expand on like where we're at in the Semester like where
    we're how far into the textbook we should be and. Like 40% so is that, like. chapters
    like 124 chapters 123.
  persid: S06
- desc: So we're not falling. Reference book so closely. From 2008. feels like a long
    time ago now. I wouldn't want to do that. Say we're looking at the social context.
    And some hdi concepts. yeah so it's not required for the textbook but I gave you
    a link to the blown to bits book. A reference. So I understood the question anyway.
    The topics in this in the calendar description. we're going to be guided by current
    events as well. and see where our discussion takes us. But the idea is to touch
    on these different things. Captain crunch. So. We can talk about what the exam
    is going to look like. Okay. Just reading the comment about. That Captain crunch.
    A few. A few meetings ago I had a link from. CBC ideas about. The philosophy of
    science, Professor who is talking about. trust. You know, so it says it's not
    even. That we debate things. In society with debating. strenuously and passionately.
    That, at some point in time. When people are at the point of saying okay. Well,
    I don't accept your your your set of facts i'm going to leave my own set of facts.
    and continue on so at that point that's where were the real problems so i'm I
    want to be careful about. Saying everyone's personal opinions and so on. TV. there's
    a connection. So you can have personal opinion that supported by facts Mitch.
    agreed upon facts situation. You can have opinions, based on. fabrications which
    are. Not agreed upon his fact. So then it's about how do we make. How do we make
    arguments about that. and What are what are some pitfalls of logical arguments.
    That you might get into and then is it. Is it is our only job to analyze the information
    we have, or do we have to apply judgment as well. take on those things right after
    the break. So. was done last last offering is last winter. For the final exam
    was to. was to have a blog kind of post. kind of blog style at SA. an essay like
    the take home question like the blog entries. That was. So I had a few topics
    and people will get them around them, and they have a certain amount of time to
    write about them. So that that seemed to work. As. A file is an exam format. As
    a kind of an extended exam format. That would. strike a happy medium, I think,
    between scheduling a particular exam at a particular time. anyway. So we can continue
    to discuss that. Alright, thanks for your replies we're out of time today. right
    on the nose I guess. So I have an office hour today at 233 30. Right. now know
    from three surgeries. You know, when I have and it's on the website i'll be there.
    And if i'm not there it's rated to. Start i'll be there right away. Okay anything
    else so. And i'll. wish everyone a great break and. Stay warm and stay well and.
    we'll see you on the 23rd. Okay. bye everyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, thanks, very much have a good break.

  persid: S06
- desc: I'm a philosophy minor so sorry if my musings are long, it's just who I am
    as a person.
  persid: S09
- desc: These all look like solid topics for the blog. Thanks for posting this.
  persid: S13
- desc: That's less than a tweet!
  persid: S09
- desc: jk
  persid: S09
- desc: A clarified word count would be good
  persid: S22
- desc: I like that. Make it 140 characters, to force only the most important concepts.
    Just like a tweet
  persid: S12
- desc: '"Me, We" Mohammad Ali best philosopher fight me'
  persid: S14
- desc: Id be good with keeping it short too
  persid: S05
- desc: I'm fine with short but that seems really short
  persid: S17
- desc: Given I've never bothered with twitter so I may just not be used to it
  persid: S17
- desc: what should be the length of blog1?
  persid: S25
- desc: 900 words
  persid: S20
- desc: likely has to do with bits
  persid: S09
- desc: Something like the size that gets piunged to the tower?
  persid: S17
- desc: omg lol wow
  persid: S09
- desc: Because it used to be 140, but when they switched to 7-bit encoding were able
    to squeeze in an extra 20 chars in the same 140 bytes
  persid: S12
- desc: I wrote 2 paragraphs lol, my bad
  persid: S05
- desc: 160 chars * 7 bits = 1120. 140*8 = 1120
  persid: S12
- desc: so how much should we write for engagements
  persid: S25
- desc: SMS is 160 chars, but uses 140 bytes
  persid: S12
- desc: reddit is 40,000
  persid: S14
- desc: reddit it is
  persid: S03
- desc: Twitter is now 280 chars
  persid: S13
