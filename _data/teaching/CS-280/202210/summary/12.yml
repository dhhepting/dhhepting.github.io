  persid: S02
- desc: So good morning. So this is the last meeting will have. Completely online
    I guess so after the break next week and then. The following Tuesday march 1 we'll.
    we'll see some of you and classroom 125. And then. We hope, hope that part goes
    well. so happy Tuesday. I know it's Thursday. First. your attendance. Sharing
    screen. Here we go. Okay, so there's the attendance password. Now these things,
    open and separate windows. Okay, so upcoming events tomorrow at. project proposal.
    And if you're working with a group for your project. It would be nice if you can.
    indicate the group before you submit the projects we can get that setup. So there's
    a request for a sample proposal or two. I didn't i'm not quite finished with that.
    So. i'll work on doing that, just after class. And i'll send a note about it.
    Any other questions about. The project proposal. i'll take that as a no. I have
    office hours between. 10 and noon today, and again 23233. And there are a couple.
    I get so what at least one email this morning, so. If you want to ask me questions
    by email that's Okay, too. If you use the link on your courses. To send me email.
    It has a. Regular. It puts a subject create a subject of CS to email contact which
    helps me. Find emails from you. Can as the project proposal need to be an APA
    format. So. I think we talked about MLA. Is APA. So i'm not. terribly familiar
    with the ins and outs of each of them. So it's I would say it's not. I don't have
    a particular requirement. For particular format. So I would say. use an accepted.
    If you're used to using APA or MLA. You can go ahead and do that. So. don't switch.
    So to switch from one pager and one or two pages, but. pick one and be consistent
    with the way your formatting the document. I would like to tell you there's an
    acm. style guide but. My I haven't looked to see if one's materialized. Let me
    look right now. Last time I looked. Because there was not a prescribed format
    for everybody, because different. special interest groups within the Association
    for computing machinery. adopt different conventions so. So i'm Please see that
    there's some kind of. kind of. discussion with acm format is more of a consistent
    thing. Let me just. share this. share that search with you. Anyway, that's, not
    to say that you need to. figure out. How these links apply to you writing a proposal.
    So. use. The format you're most comfortable with that's. and use it consistently.
    Okay. let's see my right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have a question so for our project proposal we have to do recession and
    we just have to write ECHO by top reason I did not do any recession, I just wrote
    director.
  persid: S03
- desc: well. So the proposal is indicating what you plan to do. So you can you can
    indicate. The research that's part of as part of your plan. But i'm. But I wonder
    if there's a way to do a bit of research to. kind of convince yourself that. This
    is the topic and then deliverable you've chosen our. You. enough material to do
    the project on that make sense, so. So you don't need to have a number of references
    in your proposal but. I think it might be wise to. convince yourself there's enough.
    material to do the project. So it makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay. So I just. Following up the other thing we talked about. what's the
    project was to website Assessment group. assignment. So did I believe that I sent
    out an email to everyone, about that. I think it's here. So. I made, I made the
    list of groups publicly accessible. or not publicly accessible, they still. Within
    our password protected, you are courses area. That i've indicated the group membership.
    And so, based on comments I received after the meeting. I am open to. Changing
    groups around. So let me first. So. If you're going to create a new group. It
    should be was either four or five people in it. And you should tell me the. two
    groups that you're in. Then. Tell me the the Web groups and each of the members
    of your new proposed group so i'll create a new group and. remove you from the
    other groups. seem okay. Yes, Sir okay so. Here is the. list of groups I hope.
    drumroll please. So i've removed student numbers from the list so it's just. it's
    just names and email addresses. And partway through doing this. I thought of an
    easier way for me to do it. i'm just going to start naming them Alphabetically.
    So. Anyway, what I did, to create the groups, as I took. The classroom groups
    in this put them into. Each classroom group. Come becomes or became to web groups.
    So. The details of the group name here, so there are 12 classroom groups and now
    they're 24 web groups. So. Anyway, I think i've said so too much about that already.
    Not. Like i've revealed something that I just talked enough about it so. Find
    out. If you have a group in mind. find all the group members. In your current
    web groups. So i'll create a new web group for you and then delete people from.
    Their existing web groups. So i'm i'm open to doing that. Okay, and then, if some
    if some groups end up being smaller than four or five then i'll. do some. realignment.
    Maybe let's try and. let's aim for March 1 or meeting back after the break. Not
    that will do it in the meeting but let's say the march 1 is the. Is the day that
    will. aim for having any changes to the group's. finalized. Okay. Okay, so. Let
    me. me add a note here. To my message. Okay. Okay, so. There i've tried. So replied
    to this thread in the discussion, if you want to request a new group. So if you're
    totally fine with the group's you're you were put in is there anything you need
    to do. know. So the one caveat, I guess is just to see whether everyone in your
    group feels the same way. So this. So if you have a group of five maybe you're
    fine with it, maybe there's one person who's not fine with it and the. They leave
    your group. So that's your concern, but if. i'm just say there may be an opportunity
    to communicate with groups. beforehand to. Before well. Communication amongst
    groups is a good thing, I think. It helps to limit surprises, and I think perhaps
    that's a way to say it. So there's also a question about. return to class in person,
    so if you're in. If you're in the face to face section 01 F, I believe, is called.
    An idea ideally. also see you in person on march 1. That being said. I think there's.
    there's that there's a way. I don't have an issue with people who are in the face
    to face section. Who are. Joining the meetings. Via zoom. After march 1 very beginning
    march 1. The thing that I. am trying to get some more clarity about is the final
    exam and. What options, there are for that so. So we'll talk about the final.
    Once you come back. So I at this moment i'm not quite sure. So visual. Tell me
    more about what your belief is about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I, I think that it should be the same for both the sections, however, it is,
    if it is off line than offline for both online and online for both the sections
    of that. it's the same process for all the students and since people are not comfortable
    being offline then it could be online for both.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thanks for clarifying your comment. And that's my thinking as well. i'm just
    going to explore the logistics of it more and requirements, so I don't want to.
    tell you something now and. find out that it's not. it's not possible. So. I agree
    that it would be nice ideally we'd have the same. final exam seven and valuation.
    for everyone so look the same.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just like we got to the final In both cases, if, like if you have decided
    to be offline or online, would you be able to make it just like an open book exam
    like just like writing an essay or something like that better writing project,
    instead of just going and can be a closed book.
  persid: S06
- desc: Well, what i'm leaning towards is. Having both kinds of questions so. writing.
    Something is server take home. question, but then also doing. And maybe having
    say a 24 hour limiter. For the take home style question and then. There would
    be. A more traditional. exam or you answer questions. In a very much shorter time
    frame say two hours. So I invite your input about. Creating an exam that's going
    to be a fair assessment of your learning today. Well, of your learning over the
    Semester. Okay, and i'm not trying to end conversation about it. But I don't have
    much more to offer. At this point. Okay, so there's a question about the project
    proposal so just. One member of the group submitting as. As well as preferred.
    So if you know your issue. you've got your group set up. If you communicated by
    posting to that other discussion. thread. Then. We get your group set up beforehand
    so. It just goes more smoothly. If you're not able to finalize things. ahead of
    time. Just make sure that the proposal you. The document you you submit the one
    member of your groups events as everybody's. Your vagina email ID. The part of
    your you returning email address that comes before the at sign. You before the
    you regina.ca. Then we'll. we'll create it during the marketing process. Okay.
    I was doing this on my phone. And I said, some of these things look interesting.
    So let me recreate. let's do is compare a comparison of manitoba. Two weeks. And
    we can select here. new cases and deaths. coven. So, here it is first in sketch.
    So. So we're get we're supposed to gather another report today. So see whether
    that. What range of dates that covers. It feel like this slow approach here is
    something like. Well, not not the approach but. Without without data there's no
    problem. No data no problem. yeah. So. Is it is there a role for. Computer professionals
    to play in this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, computer professionals would. be in charge of collecting data, or at
    least organizes presenting it. and distributed it, I suppose.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah so. So. The phrase transparency comes to mind the phrase, the term that.
    The word transparency comes to mind. So, in terms of the presentation of the data
    that comes on the Google dashboard. Or, however, this. This is described. So.
    Transparency in it. Is I found this is a good description transparency it's not.
    an ethical. principle on its own. You know. But it can be it can support ethical
    behavior so. Pro ethical. So in this case. Somebody looks at this. agent says
    well. it's gotten a lot better and substantial. So. Is that a. Is that a reasonable.
    reading of this data. These displays. So how could this display be improved. Any
    ideas.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It could have some kind of information about why it's reading zero. Like after
    this date numbers are no longer being reported.
  persid: S08
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Or the graph could just end. So you can always go back, but you can't go forward,
    because that's invalid data.
  persid: S08
- desc: yeah. So there's. no indication. there's no data. And i'm not sure what's
    going to have services supposedly our second weekly report today. So, will they
    report. For the sick, for the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth 10th 11th and 12th. and 13th.
    We give daily totals for the week the past. or will they have a single. spike
    on one day. or. So don't expect it to be up. Up to today well it's not gonna.
    I suspect it's not going to be. reported up to the 16th up to, including the 16.
    Maybe maybe to the 13th saw i'm not sure. So what are some ways that we can. So
    we could stop the graph maybe use a dotted line and add to the legend that it's
    not reported. Okay, so Cory what. He said, a new article.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah so the weekly update last Thursday on the 10th. didn't. didn't go up
    to the ninth so. i'm not sure whether the weekly update for today will go up to
    the 16th. Or how it will be presented. So we'll see. So this is not. Venture government.
    is doing. What it's doing and. That decision has been made. So i'm talking now
    about. How do we. reflect. The data being reported from saskatchewan. And in display
    How does go, how should Google approach this. So. Look at this display. It doesn't
    seem to. At first glance, you think Oh well, after February 5. Sorry February
    6. There weren't any more new cases.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah it would make sense if the days without any data we're just creating
    out and then like a little pop up saying like no available data. That would make
    it the lumber clear.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So if if we're designed the web page. And the code to go with it. Then there's
    a freakin the computer professionals. So that that's. The responsibility, they
    have to. easily interpret.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I guess are misleading data like this can actually increase the number of
    cases. Like even more because, like there might be many people who might get reluctant
    to follow the rules of covert 19 because they might feel like yeah the pieces
    are very much. You know, like negligible in Regina or like in in saskatoon saskatchewan
    so they might actually stop wearing masks or you're not like keeping safe, so
    this might also increase the number of cases.
  persid: S10
- desc: Well there's still some rules. Until the end of the month. So on the 14% vaccination.
    was discontinued vaccination or negative test result was discontinued and on.
    Every 28, as I understand it, the indoor masking requirement will. will go away
    also. So. see what happens if we do more locations to this statistics. So this
    is. Nothing seems to match. But it's not clear where this. Okay, so let's see
    him. i'm. yeah. So i'm just going to say that. When there was a study that was.
    presented. done by the Professor from U of T. About excess deaths. There was a
    comment made that just got from reporting, to a certain database lagging behind.
    So I was going to guess that the hundred and. 662 came from that database. But
    now it's not their new. So i'm not sure if it was a matter of. So maybe another
    responsibility for. The computer professionals dealing with this kind of displays
    to make sure. So issues about refreshing the page. The dashboard so here's a link
    to the dashboard i'm just curious. If it's still available. So it wasn't clear
    whether the dashboard was. not going away or just not being updated. So I think
    that it's not going to be. updated for public consumption. So. I put a few links
    here. For your. review. And we'll discuss them after the break. So here's the
    Wikipedia link to. A page that describes the recipient claim rights and liberty
    rates. So those things. We can take as a rate. Without. affecting anyone else,
    and those things that we. Take us rates which depend on the behavior of other
    people. So another way to think about that maybe is rights and responsibilities.
    So I gave you this. link, this is a different link to the same material, I believe.
    suffering. So Steve mcconnell's talk about. judgment in software engineering.
    So we'll have a different presentation. Because. So of interest us as maybe what's.
    up to the end of topic 21. Years a couple of Ted videos. So some people mentioned
    the social dilemma documentary from netflix last year, the year before. So Kristen
    Harris is somebody involved in that. And I mentioned Douglas rushkoff Douglas
    rushkoff. I believe. You said program or be programmed. Anyway, this is Douglas
    rushkoff you did a Ted talk as well. Okay, so. Hope i've left you with some food
    for thought over the break but not so much that you're not going to enjoy. Family
    day and. A bit of a. break from classes and. All that good stuff. Okay, so have
    a good break everyone stay well. Take care. we'll see you on march 1 if not before.
    Okay.
