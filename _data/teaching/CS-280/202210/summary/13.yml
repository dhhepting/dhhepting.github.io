Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: hey.
  persid: S00
- desc: i'm sorry but we can't hear you.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay that's encouraged. Now you can see how my shirt appears on. Small window.
    Okay, good thing I did a bit of a test, yesterday I could have tested some more
    things I would have. So next day i'll be here and have zoom logged in before.
    The first. anyway. So welcome back. To campus who's been here before, like. Okay,
    I know that's a question that I can ask because some people have said Ben Ben
    the campus yet. But I was thinking about this semester this. week that some of
    you start on campus some February 7. Okay. Good so. Share screen. So I can Double
    Click on the share on that screen. I can Double Click the start of shares shared
    screens I can't Double Click to start a meeting. So in that respect. The interfaces
    and so he named you talked about being respectful human frailties and so forth
    right. sure. i'm not sure why. didn't get the date. So here's our attendance screen.
    here's the password. So. For those of you on zoom. You can interact with interacted.
    During our remote period. and Those of you in class, you cannot i'd say can also
    use zoom. You can put your hand up and ask questions and we can have discussion
    here as well. So maybe you can even see this little bit if i'm. You can see it
    on zoom as well. But i'll take pictures of the of the boards that I write out
    and share them with you as media. was my writing for the back row, is it legible.
    I will try and keep it legible. legible handwriting isn't one of my strong suits
    perhaps. But with a marker on a whiteboard I do Okay, I think. So project proposals
    are being marked. So a few of them haven't been submitted. But I think on there
    were four. So less than 10 I think it's three or four at this point so if you
    haven't been able to submit them yet. To so soon you. So there's a penalty That
    applies, but still. getting up to 2.5 marks is better than zero. Are you. Remote
    students are you able to fall along what i'm saying.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S00
- desc: Well microphones even work. Thank you. Okay, so the next thing is then. So
    about the blog entry. studio audience.
  persid: DHH
- desc: They can't see you know.
  persid: S00
- desc: that's right. Oh right. Okay i'll stop writing on that board I just wrote
    wrote what I said there about. Okay. seems like that reflection is not helping.
    If you have a bigger screen on. Your computer. turn down the audience lights there's
    less. glare. But being. first thing in the morning might. not going to play music.
    smiling inevitable sense of humor I guess. Okay, so there's a question about.
    just going to suggest that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is the duty of the blog on march 4 or the seven.
  persid: S01
- desc: Presently it's the fourth or just discussing about making it the seven. The
    seven seventh be okay anyone offended by making the due date Monday, instead of
    Friday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: S03
- desc: problem because there's one person.
  persid: DHH
- desc: here.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, I don't think so let me go through that. So. You just want to check
    about your your feelings towards march seven be okay with that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: I didn't want to. Because the when you put your anyway. Okay, so update that.
    Okay, then in terms of citations. You can follow MLA or APA. Just do it consistently.
    Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So yeah let's think about the blog like, as you said before, like we are still
    allowed to write some of our own opinions and make it find a first person at some
    point isn't it.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah so. So. I don't think those two things are exclusive mutually exclusive
    right. So you should have your opinions. with support from. Reliable online sources.
    So it's not a matter of saying. I believe this, this is my opinion. And it's my
    opinion and I don't have to justify it. that's not what we're trying to do here.
    So when you're. Making your personal connection to the topic you say this is what
    some. You can illustrate your personal connection to the topic. And connected
    with reliable online sources. Does that make sense. Yes. So I think it's fine
    to write in the first person. So. yeah, so I think. it's it's not a. Safe I can
    be on camera. it's not a civil matter whether people should write in first person
    or third person. or predict different kinds of. writing so I would say, because
    of blog is like. Is it is by nature and more personal style of writing. I think
    it's fine to write in the first person. When I look at. Academic papers or PCs
    that are written by students. I would, I would. counsel you to write in the third
    person at that point but. There that's. Where is that was the generally accepted.
    style of writing in the past it's not so universally accepted anymore. So I I.
    I have fun this for writing the third person when you're writing about. Your writing
    more objectively about a topic. So. I wouldn't discourage you from doing that
    i'm not trying to discount the advice you got from your English classes. The blogs,
    are a little bit different. So. there's that and then. Well, I guess there's that.
    So that makes sense. Okay, thank you send us her summarizing things in the chat.
    So these. shoes that are. kiss your. They interacted with the grippy floor. I.
    I have had in the past, some unfortunate encounters between my face and the ground.
    on ice so. singular. anyway. Okay, let me. Go to our. Let me switch my role to
    a student. is still okay. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S06
- desc: All right, thanks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just regarding to the project proposal, you said, the marks are being the
    proposal i'll be more because I cannot see my Marshall nope vs.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. they're being marked they're not mark it's not it's. it's not past tense
    so you'll. you'll know i'll send a notification when the marks are released. Okay.
    Our sales marciel is that okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep no that's Okay, thank you okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: All right, so. Okay. So. submit your blog entries html either uploaded as
    a file or paste as online text. So. So if you go to your individual student blog,
    then you get a net you get your own personal area, so this is my personal entry.
    hello, this is. very nice countertop. The renovations in here look pretty good,
    I think. i'm not sure when they were done actually but. Over the past two years,
    I guess. So this is. can make that a heading.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir, do you want us to write like my title in words and then and then write
    with a colon versus just supposed to write what our title is.
  persid: S05
- desc: So i'm trying to illustrate. The html editor in your courses.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And, Sir, like, I actually started working on my blog on the on the individual
    section like individual part where we're supposed to edited so if we if we do
    it they're like edited there can you just copy and pasted in the. In the main
    part.
  persid: S05
- desc: OK.
  persid: ???
- desc: And i'm going to do that with them.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This.
  persid: ???
- desc: So question of style. Whether it's good to have a hyperlink. On this URL or
    whether it's better that write it out. and make it accessible so i'm just my choice
    here is to illustrate the idea of. Having a different. Having the link with some
    text point to. The web address. Now. What happened there. So this. Is the target
    equals blank. specification specifications and create a link. Okay, so that's
    not. He won't stop just there but. If I did this correctly. Well, somebody is
    already visited my blog i'm. So you can see, this is html is generated. sure.
    Okay. I think I thought there was a. link to a sample but i'll check that. you're
    welcome. Well i'm suffering from windows here, I think. they're. Since i've. had
    the right to now let's put it back in its raw html know. Okay. All right. Any
    questions or concerns. i'll see whether I can. I don't want to put the video up
    but i'll see if I can. edit that. Have a little example little piece of the video
    where we did the editing okay. So the other thing I want to mention about this,
    so you get sort of the the short version of the menu you first click there, but
    if you go up the top left. You get more options here. And then. The angle brackets
    of the slash between them that gives you the code view. Okay. Okay, so. Before
    we. Do our quote. Let me go back to my regular role. And it'll change the date
    on the assignment in your courses anyway here. Okay, so I guess, I should also
    demonstrate. How I can make a submission with. So the data is correct. due date
    is correct okay. Okay, so I can add my submission. And the same thing. So that's
    using the online text. Do the submission. So. I wanted to let you know about a
    talk coming up. On march 16. From an alumnus. and a friend of mine. Is a university
    Berta. So it's a little bit about him. As a texture. Anyway, so he's gonna be
    talking about artificial intelligence and precision health. So i'm familiar with.
    The adjective precision in terms with health or i've also heard with agriculture
    and some other things. So it's, I guess, broadly speaking, it's about. Using it
    advanced computing artificial intelligence to bring precision. to healthcare and
    to agriculture and to other endeavors that are. Somewhat augmenting the these.
    pursuits of people with computing technology in a very general sense, so. He was
    working in the states for about 10 years he was at the Mayo clinic and then a
    cancer Center in. in Florida. And he came back in. and Just for the end of the
    year last year edmonton. So he did his bachelor's and master's degrees here and
    then he did his PhD at Western. So I think it'd be a very interesting talk about
    how computing can be applied to healthcare. And i'll have a link on to an event
    on Facebook later today. So that will be at 7pm on on March the seventh March.
    march 16 so two weeks from tomorrow. Part of the computer science alumni and friends.
    lecture series. So I. And I wanted to. Just 15 minutes left so. So here's an article
    that's on CBC news today. as well. I thought it was interesting because it's not
    the title of the article. that's that's the URL so the Charter governor general
    disinformation civic awareness. And then the title is what many convert protesters
    got wrong about constitutional rights in the governor general. So there's a line
    here. So here, it says in legal terms. The protection. Okay i'll paraphrase here
    a little bit in legal terms, the freedoms and rights laid out in the Charter and
    not absolute he's the most popular analogy one person's freedom to swing their
    arms around ends at the tip of another person's nose. So. it's not just a matter
    of. individual rights and freedoms. it's also about responsibilities and. it's
    another responsibilities to to one another as well. So i'm on this page and we
    have this. log box here. So, on some websites. Yes, you see the ability to edit
    your cookie preferences. But this is not that so. Please know the cookies are
    required to operate enhance our services, as well as for advertising purposes,
    we value your privacy, if you are not comfortable with us using this information,
    please review your settings for continuing your visit. So that sounds promising
    doesn't it. who thinks that sounds promising. who's willing to go click on that
    link i'm going to click on a link for us. How to manage your cookies. Baby sees
    of cookies blocking and browser blocking types of cookies. cookies blockers and
    browser controls. here's a list of the cookies used by CDC okay let's check that
    out. we're about halfway through not looks like. So that's quite a few cookies.
    From our more information on how to control the cookies in your browser you'll
    find more here. So we're using Google chrome. So, what was the promise when we
    clicked on. That link. yeah it seems to indicate there was. The promise of reviewing
    my settings for the cookies. Now it's not here anymore.
  persid: DHH
- desc: let's try.
  persid: ???
- desc: anyway. there's no information here about how I can. Like and set. My preference
    her only strictly. necessary or functional cookies. anyway. i'll let you. pick
    that up if there's a way to. make choices on the website, the CBC. Because, to
    me it. It sets up the promise is something that doesn't this page doesn't deliver.
    So next day we'll. we'll talk some more about things going on the news about disinformation
    and. role that we can. That information technology plays in that. And will also
    work on doing a. breakout session. So i'm curious. If we have so for breakout
    can we do a hybrid session. If you can. We can do the breakout rooms and in zoom.
    But if there are group members, you have. In the in our face to face class. Jen
    can manage it to have. Half in person and half remote. I think that that will
    take on that challenge so. it's interesting, I guess, if you don't know each other
    people in your group. Then you might have people in different locations in the
    classroom being in the same breakout room and. And maybe that's a good thing,
    anyway. So the other thing I said about groups was. That we should handle the
    the groups for the Web assignment by today. So if you have. If you have preferences.
    For group members, the way the way I created those groups was the I divided the
    class work groups too. So, because of the classroom groups were between eight
    and 10 people. Then the Web groups. I made two groups of four or five out of the
    one class work group. So if you have. preferences. For who you'd like to have
    in a group with you. Post a note like i've described. see where. That is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A start after we have requested for the groups like can we start working with
    that group or like do we need to wait for your like you know acceptance or something.
    mean like your approval.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah so. i'm just going to apply the information that he's you give me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay yeah that makes sense Thank you so much.
  persid: S05
- desc: So I would appreciate. If you list the groups that people are in. Because,
    then I can create a new group and then remove people from the other groups. So
    the goal of this process is to get your. DVD some input into the formation of
    groups, but ultimately. going to end up with 24 groups of four or five people.
    So if you give me a group of four or five. And you could specify. The groups.
    The web groups you're in presently that would help me. So, with a group of four
    or five. i'll just create that group. and make the deletions elsewhere. And if
    I end up with. a bunch of small groups i'll put them together. So it makes sense.
    So if you find with your group, you can be fine with your group, it may change
    a little bit. But will. So. A way to the end of today to get any feedback about
    groups in reply to this post. And then before next meeting i'll make up all reform
    the Web groups, and then we can start on. On that assignment okay. And we're out
    of time. So, thank you very much for today. And we'll see you on Thursday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: See you Thursday, sir.
  persid: S07
- desc: hey. Take care everyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have a good.
  persid: S05
- desc: Day thanks.
