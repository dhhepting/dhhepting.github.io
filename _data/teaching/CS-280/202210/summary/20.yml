Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Okay. morning everyone. Happy Thursday everybody. I remember, so this for
    the first time, Canada qualified for the World Cup, so that happens every four
    years. That was 36 years ago I remember. And so. Now they're in the top on top
    position in the qualifying group and so these are the last three games. Of the
    qualifying so they will tonight, they can. they're guaranteed a spot in the World
    Cup so. that's that's big news. And the. star. We seem to be the star player,
    I mean there are many players have done well, but one of them is will be sitting
    out because of my own car diagnosis from Kobe. Okay, so take a minute to. Simon
    stuff. Okay, so just to be clear. Just not starting a cake choose one from this
    list choose differently than other people, you know in class if your name is on
    the list. The list below. means you shared your blog energy with the class. So
    the original intent was one critiques two to three weeks three. Is 143 on the
    list critiques one. So if you haven't. If he started a critique on a different
    blog than what I think. Is the next one that's fine. proceed with it. And if you
    didn't submit it to the class blog. it's just you can pick one from the list.
    So. This, to me, is a lot. better solution than mailing. blogs. That you didn't
    share. Other students. So it's good so we're only in critiquing blogs that are
    in the public space, not in the public space in the class space in your courses.
    So. I think that's clear. Anyone not clear. This is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: web page. Before death and like. The MAC users familiar with the spinning
    beach ball. Sir, like the blue screen of death on PC. anyway. So we'll get started
    out today. it's great to have. So project proposals, so I expect. Those you re
    submitted a proposal okay marks posted today. But I also sent a note with the
    general feedback, but the proposals so. keep working on your proposals. But that
    feedback and I and not people getting your projects was that general feedback
    in mind. Okay. So the questions so there's two parts, the critique. So your evaluation
    to blog entry, according to the rubric. For the blog entry assignment. So that's
    where. The questions come from. Where the headings come from so. You can think
    of the first part is saying. This is how i'm how I would mark. assign a great
    blog entry, based on the rubric we have. For the blog entry. And then. In the
    critique. You just generally talking about. Whether how well the argument was
    made. I should uptake.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Why.
  persid: ???
- desc: anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm just like for the website assessment you want this to answer the questions
    and that said, or do you want us like to play like a paragraph or like a little
    mini essay.
  persid: S02
- desc: about the website assignment in a second again. So this is the rubric for
    the critique so what mark for using this for marks one of the marks is for evaluating
    according to the rubric So how are you in market. And then marks for doing a critique
    of. So what I did in my sample is. I. provided an outline. So the outline. could
    be expanded upon. could be written. more thoroughly. that's your question soundness.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So we can really see the stuff songwriting towards the end in the zoom.
  persid: S03
- desc: and it's i'm not doing anything that's not. In the assignment description.
    But i'll i'll talk about it. where's mine. I can see what.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It looks like.
  persid: ???
- desc: So format concerned the questions listed in the assignment region, the main
    groups sections on the website. So for. The assignment I I did a number of the
    one through eight. And then. The five questions which I didn't number. This is
    content valuable to you, is it up to date. Is it accessible i'm paraphrasing a
    little bit here, but I mean the questions in the assignment. Is the content usable.
    is in the right location. So those are the questions to answer, but each of the.
    Groups numbered one through eight above. So in addition to going through for each
    of the sections. include a summary.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For.
  persid: ???
- desc: Your impressions of. The whole website. So I would say. To make things clearer,
    you can. use these questions as headings, as you go through each section of the
    website. Each of the site each of the main link areas. That like. make it a little
    bit more easy to. fill in the details. Okay. So welcome any questions. or concerns.
    Yes. So i'm suggesting. Including. The questions is sub headings in the report.
    To make it more. More clear. So Marshall had a question about. Just answering
    the questions or. Writing some paragraphs creature, the main sections of the main
    links. So I don't want to discourage you from summarizing each of the sections
    in the main links. I was just suggesting. In addition to list the questions as.
    A way to. Help organizing material. and You could. summarize. What you what you
    found for this particular sections, following your answers to the questions. I
    don't want to be too prescriptive and. How, you should wrap this up, but. I wanted
    to give you a little bit. More. structure to help you get organized. Okay. Is
    a story on CBC and some other outlets. Oh i'll share with you soon as I get my
    latest computer problems, so that. So in round numbers I think it's a little bit
    higher than this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The 20%.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. Somebody saying. Even even if 20% of your staff doesn't quit immediately.
    it's quite something to think about 20% one in five people in the office really
    resenting the fact, they have to be in the office. What would that would do from
    around. So i'd like to. Take. Time to have a discussion about. What you see the
    future is and how. Our technology. The risks and rewards of. i've been working
    violence. Okay, so. i'm going to. So some breakout rooms. Up to sex. And you can
    choose your own rules. So if you're in. If you're in person and you'd like.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To come.
  persid: ???
- desc: To discuss with people in class that's fine. Otherwise, if you're in groups
    one or seven. Go to breakout Room one. two and eight three and. nine four and
    five and 11 and six and 12 good together. Okay. Not to discourage you from speaking.
    It sound like a microphone turned on there. Okay here's the breakout rooms so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???

- desc: Okay, so how we wrap up discussions next minute and then we'll get together
    in a bit longer. yeah The thing is. yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To.see that.Just.
  persid: ???
- desc: minus four. Get back together and. So anything come up anything you'd like
    to share with the whole class yeah find the overall hybrid this isn't a bad idea,
    so say for like a single parents should have to raise a child, so that they could
    stay at home and also take care of the kid at the same time, but that was so.
    Good lose kind of some work with that. But i'd say that. By having a hybrid you
    can lose a lot of. Essential time that could be due to distractions found at home,
    rather than being in an office space, which will have less distractions like thank.
    between work and home life. becomes more blurred you know we kind of have this.
    And you're online you're kind of still. kind of way you can still go to work because
    you're just at home, so, even if you were in person and then Now you can just
    be hybrid. If you're saying what is going to be the boundary of your boss Oh,
    I can code or even like coughs being like okay well, you could actually just take
    a break today or should you just keep working out. yeah. So the classes. Over
    the. main thing is to not be contagious. or spread germs to people when you come
    in contact with. But on the other hand, it's still not acknowledging need to rest
    and. recuperate. OK so. Now, another point we discuss about was people if people
    choose to work in person, they still have to be sort of online is their co workers
    working from home. Even the Office, you have to take zoom calls and team calls
    and you are sort of on a computer or day rather than actually being that the getting
    the actual in person experience now. So maybe in that case, if there's. A group
    in the office and they agreed to come into work on one particular day a week or
    something like that. That late. In that regard.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You wrote. Work home boundaries blurred, but it also does help achieve a better
    work life balance, I think.
  persid: S04
- desc: I agree that's. Did you say that the hybrid worker engine is better for work
    life balance.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah yeah.
  persid: S04
- desc: Is once you're in the office, maybe.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The boss.
  persid: S05
- desc: wants you to stick around and do something. it's hard to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have people that struggle with anxiety and depression. tend to self isolate
    and without being forced to go into work area where they're socializing with people
    might social might solve isolate even more could lead to higher levels of depression
    and suicide.
  persid: S05
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: More comments.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: S05
- desc: No, no it's time thanks for speaking up. So introverted people, maybe happy
    to be remote but. They may overtime lose connection with. With the Group of the
    office or friends in general yeah other work.
  persid: DHH
- desc: In my partner came up with was the possibility of saving with.
  persid: S03
- desc: Transportation like of gas, instead of having to drive to the office.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yet.
  persid: ???
- desc: So around the budget. Environmental angle to this because there's still a
    climate emergency going on. There they were just going on. Yes, I go like the
    transportation savings healthy play, but for the company they might have more
    costs if you have people working for all, and you now need to provide them with
    computer are in that if you need a certain level, and they need a certain level
    data that. The company's infrastructure budget might be greatly increased. So
    this was an. I came to face to face but yesterday I was explaining. In class before
    I got connected to zoom that. Yes, let me do this attendance I said don't do it
    after the fact. So it's a 24th today. So there is our password those you can see
    it open chat as well. So the experience. Yesterday, so we're doing the computer
    science students seminars, we have the first one plan for yesterday and I got
    into the room and I went through my checklist that i've. got down pat here, for
    example, so I thought I was going to be just fine with in setup but. It turned
    out that zoom is not a very. Happy it's not happy playing with other parts of
    the infrastructure. So the recommendation is to restart the computer in the classroom
    before again just to make sure there's nothing. hanging around it shouldn't be.
    So now i've learned to do that and that's what I did this morning. But anything
    there's a lot of a lot of issues in terms of. And I wonder about to support the
    amount of time and effort and hours and costs and. mean. What kind of contracted
    is assumed that they have the storage requirements. And the staff to do make sure
    that zoom is working properly for the institution. So there's lots of aspects
    that are that are. are important to consider. Any other comments from zoom or
    the class here. So Kenya. I know we're.
  persid: DHH
- desc: mostly talking about hybrid work but um one great advantage that we. Especially
    have specifically in Regina here is the opportunity to work remotely for bigger
    companies in bigger cities which it greatly increased wages and different things
    like that, like obviously it isn't really related to the hybrid is more remote.
    But, specifically in the computer science industry, I don't know if anybody has
    looked online recently, but there are lots of opportunities for remote positions
    at great companies in large cities for developers in other areas of computer science.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay, thanks that's. Important that started telecommunication. Meeting. So
    maybe it's made telecommuting. More more acceptable. So one thing I wanted to
    mention about zoom in class is when I did the breakout rooms. So there are something
    like let's use around numbers, the 60 students online. Now. Then getting the pictures,
    I thought I did. But. Of 6020. weren't didn't join a breakout or. So it was interesting
    to know some of the six groups, a couple of them had zero people in the one had
    13. So it was interesting. So not that i'm. Trying to keep tabs on people. But
    that's another way that we could keep tabs on people, because they have a. footprint,
    so you may login to the class. And then go do something else so it's hard to know
    whether you're actually there, but then. When there's an interactive element.
    And you miss the chance to go to the breakout room. that's the that sticks out
    a little bit online. So i'm not trying to. i'm not trying to create a discussion
    about how to work around that problem. So, it appears that you're well. The more
    than more than we have a footprint can be tracked and. or or efforts in our output.
    monitored. So that possibility exists, I think. So I see we're out of time. So
    let's continue this discussion in class on Tuesday, have a good weekend. And i'll
    get my links to share today online soon and. So you can respond again. thanks
    again everyone, thank you. Take care buddy have a good weekend.
