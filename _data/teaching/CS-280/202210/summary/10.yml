Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Anything exciting.
  persid: ???
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: Oh, what did you say anything exciting.
  persid: S02
- desc: Anything exciting happen. Since Tuesday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: knows waiting for the exciting to happen here huh.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. yeah the weather. The weather is nice usually. But the weather's Nice
    and i'm concerned. about this happening and being February, instead of the middle
    of March.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah it's going to be an icebox outside soon it's already rained so much any
    ice or any Raina freezes going to be an ice rink yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: So. So I guess. If some days when i'm not so. delightfully determined. I can.
    we're not looking for. Positive and staying positive trying to stay positive.
    And I think. pandemic is such a. Immediate. issue and there's so much. resistance.
    That, then I wonder. How. we're going to deal with the climate emergency. The
    way that needs to be. addressed. But anyway. that's that's enough for for that.
    And I was reading an article about the snow they've had. To make in Beijing, for
    the Winter Olympics, because. It typically doesn't snow in Beijing. In the areas
    where they're running through Winter Olympics. And there is an estimate that there
    will, that they will have us, I believe, by the end of the Games 1.5 trillion
    liters of water to make snow. It seems like a lot doesn't it. Well, anyway. i'm.
    I apologize for. Introducing a somber mood and. well. I think we have to think
    about these things. But not let it not let them paralyze us from taking action
    and. Making positive contributions. To our world in our society.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I I read that as well and it said that the the entire or two users about
    9000 billion what or liters of water per year and that's more than that so it's
    just crazy.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah. Okay. So why don't we start with attendance. After login. Okay, here
    we go. Meeting on February 10. wow. That was quick with some of those quicker.
    Okay, so there's the password for attendance. yeah so talk about the project in
    a minute. So I want to mention. Since i'm. I guess the contact person for equity
    diversity and inclusion department. I wanted to mention that there's a talk coming
    up tomorrow afternoon. importance of clear visibility of stem. or in stem. I thought
    I copied it from the message. Anyway, so stem science, technology engineering
    and math. Is everyone familiar with that acronym. Okay. comes up one of my favorite
    movies. So. i'm. Here, let me actually. give you the link for. Sure it's a zoom.
    presentation. Okay, so there. You. All the details. And that you register, so
    you have to register, but it's free and. This is the third seminar in the series.
  persid: DHH
- desc: what's this seminar for.
  persid: S05
- desc: So. it's really. The title of the talk is the importance of clear visibility
    of stem. So. we'll talk about equity diversity and inclusion. and So it falls
    under that. The heading. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor, can I ask you a question about that sure, so a little controversial
    maybe. But do you think that is more important than the most capable person for
    the job.
  persid: S06
- desc: If I could. I could add something. Sure um so like where I work and, like
    usually in like in high school that kind of thing being like a visible minority
    in a category. I find that when there are like policies in place to you know,
    encourage a certain group of people, whether it be ethnicity or or. or sexual
    orientation that kind of thing. And when you encourage it, it kind of creates
    this. Air stigma around that group, because now, when you do get to a position
    people ask whether or not you got there because of this policy, or because of
    your actual merits, and I find it does more harm than good, usually, when there
    are policies in place to do that.
  persid: S07
- desc: And that the opposite is also true, I know. My aunt and uncle they. When they
    were searching for jobs when they first came to Canada they had. Very a lot of
    difficulty just because there was a lot of silent racism again some people wouldn't
    hire them because of their fat strong accent, and they. So. policies such as this
    can help them get their foot in the door and get jobs when, otherwise they can
    be blocks or held back from these positions. And the people who often say things
    such as Oh, they didn't really deserve it. Oh, maybe there's someone else who's
    better. are often missing the point that a lot of these people. With have struggled.
    To get these positions due to. system it's just somatic racism in the first place,
    so these are working to counteract that it's not perfect or ideal but. If it was
    prefer deal we wouldn't need these policies in the first place.
  persid: S08
- desc: I agree with hunter.
  persid: S09
- desc: So.
  persid: S06
- desc: back to the importance of visibility instead.
  persid: S09
- desc: A lot of times these like quotas of, say, like a visibility of minorities
    and arrest may not even taken seriously like sometimes when companies are posting
    their staff like. With these part of these minorities, they were only like one
    or two and the rest of them are like part of this of the cysts or the the other
    race then they're never like actually part of the minorities done much they just
    do the bare minimum, so they can meet the quota.
  persid: S10
- desc: Oh yeah just to keep up the image.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, which encourages images, instead of marriage.
  persid: S07
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S11
- desc: same with all of the companies and then not. well. provide the spirit of the
    law or going through the word of loss, they can do the bare minimum, instead of
    trying to achieve the spirit of the law, which is. Something that I believe should
    be punished and or law should be more strict on trying to enforce our should be.
    Like.
  persid: S08
- desc: there's a recent issue with. Biden seeing is going to elect a female judge
    that is black or judges black was, but a lot of people, a lot of like. People
    in the black community are saying that I wouldn't want to become a judge from
    Biden just because you would start to question yourself to it was because of your
    skills are just because they just want REP representation so even when it comes
    down to it, it's a good thing, but. it's we should be at a point in our world
    where we don't need these things, or it shouldn't be so openly. put out there
    you have to have a quota to meet because, once you start putting like terms on
    people. Everything falls apart.
  persid: S10
- desc: Well then, there should be something put in place at the base level. or like
    at the education level where there's a certain I hate the word quota for this,
    but because I can't think of anything else. there's a quota to meet for certain
    ethnicities and groups and sexual orientations that. They need to pass a certain
    amount in school, and then the deciding factor shouldn't be well, are you a part
    of that minority to get hired or not. Because there's enough in the field that
    would saturate it instead of all there's barely anybody in the field is pick the
    only one that's you know of the LGBT part part of me that, with the other minorities
    right.
  persid: S02
- desc: A little true. Ideally, everything will be based on merit and not race or
    ethnicity and gender preferences, but there's a lot of silent racism it's. Companies
    are often they won't say that because your. Your skin color you're. Just sexual
    preferences, but it's still a fact that. it's so much harder for someone to get
    a job if there. are different experts to see if they have an accent if they don't
    pronounce things of that nature and so policies such as this are. Important to
    get people in the workforce to get them up there, and if it's not it's not perfect,
    but once people get into those positions. Those policies slowly become less needed
    because well if the people hiring you are black Hispanic from the Philippines
    if they're gay or bisexual or. of everything like that, then you don't need those
    policies, because the people hiring you. have already in that group so policies
    such as this, I believe, are working towards a ideal scenario scenario where.
    They are no longer needed. And that's one of the reasons why I consider them to
    be important they're working towards. not be needed anymore.
  persid: S08
- desc: Discrimination is never was a way to fight discrimination right.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S07
- desc: I feel like there's a fundamental issue with how interview process goes like
    for like, if you want to enter a music school, they have to do blind auditions
    because of how much discrimination is there, so I feel like they should try to
    find a way to implement that approach in the workforce. client interviews.
  persid: S10
- desc: And I believe that's actually been done a little bit, I think it was Australia,
    but there's definitely some larger corporations that have done completely blind
    resumes and interviews you pretty much take off all of your identifying information.
    I don't know if they give you a number or exactly how it's done. But essentially
    you take off anything that could be used to identify you your background and they
    proceed with all the interviews and hiring decisions based on that.
  persid: S12
- desc: um one thing i'd like to add, is, if you think about it, statistically to
    like let's say a certain population of minority is 10% of the general population.
    Then you have everyone else, and then there's a quota for 20% of the workforce
    to be of that minority status or what you get is just statistically those people
    aren't going to be as good because they're over represented in their population
    basis right. it's and then that creates a negative stereotype around those people
    and then people just assume that they're there because of this quota. it's just
    this artistic statistically just not going to happen type of thing.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah Okay, so I appreciate the discussion thanks everybody for for sharing
    some views there. So I think. To me that's interesting. We got into this discussion
    of. coders and. merit. And affirmative action I guess. From the title of a talk.
    So I agree, I mean for me, the importance of. equity diversity and inclusion initiatives.
    is about making. In our case. The population of computer scientists look like.
    The population in the world around us. And not. Making it so much as. and forcing
    it but. Recognizing the biases that exist against that. Are the barriers that
    exist. to having the population of computer scientists. be representative of.
    Demographics in the world. So. There, maybe. I don't want to say this. gender
    equity so. apparent, the number of women. In computing. Is is. Much. Different
    than the number of women to. number of women in society. So there have been many
    years of. Understand trying to understand why. Women aren't encouraged to take
    up computer science or computing fields. Where they don't feel welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is it welcome are interested.
  persid: S06
- desc: Welcome not interested. A lot of women are interested in studying, but they
    might not be welcomed into that you.
  persid: S09
- desc: Are you sure. Because like, if you look at the statistics and universities,
    women are not signing up for stem.
  persid: S06
- desc: Well it's not just stem I think. I think other science fields have much better
    representation I. haven't looked at the numbers for a while, but.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What would make you feel unwelcome in computer science.
  persid: S13
- desc: I don't know that computer science, especially but. my sister my mom would
    often tell her that maybe she didn't go for such a hard degree or such a. Few
    as well now my mom's actually priests access so there's a lot and family members
    teachers friends. Last small things can put them back in family situations or
    social situations and things like that can really. drag people down prevent them
    from getting into. colleges jobs everything like that it's. Teachers can sometimes
    be racist other students other people in the. job market it's. All a bunch of
    small things that add up to drag people down over time and I see it, a lot with
    my sister. But it happens to everyone.
  persid: S08
- desc: What I think is the main reason women, women don't go in the stem fields is
    they knew that they know that even if somehow they. managed to get their foot
    in the door, it is difficult to climb up the the hierarchy in a corporate structure
    than any. field that they want to, because of the deep rooted Treaty are key and
    the 50 year old CEOs and their senior managers who might think that women don't
    have what it takes.
  persid: S11
- desc: So that's the term patriarchal mindset you in right.
  persid: S14
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: I mean tech is one of the most open industries basically on terms of being
    open minded and and open to new ideas and new people, and so I don't know if that's
    necessarily.
  persid: S07
- desc: The basis for. For that statement.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For tech being super open. yeah I mean generally tech is like a younger industry
    it's not as developed as a lot of other ones um I mean the field is pretty much
    like the majority of it is 30 years old. And so it's kind of hard to have a 50
    year old CEO and the average age of your company is something around 25 or something
    like that, I believe. i'm not sure the average age of. Computer the computer science
    industry, but most CEOs and most companies have a super short life form, especially
    in the startup industry. And, and you don't get that kind of deep rooted hard
    to climb the corporate ladder type of thing.
  persid: S07
- desc: Well, I think there's a lot there in those comments that we can think about
    and discuss. and get more detail but. So what one example comes to mind and. You
    won't have heard about this. This isn't this is. related. Somewhat tangentially
    to our discussion here. In the 80s, I live. There were the these sites. Which.
    we're. which run inhabitable because of chemical. Chemicals left through industrial
    production, and so one of the. Sorry, one or more of the most. Polluted sites
    were related to. Integrated circuit manufacturing. So, on the one hand. You think
    about tech, you know the clean rooms really put together these circuits. as being
    very clean and. You know we're not dealing with. we're not getting our hands dirty
    but, in reality, the chemicals that were being used and we're being disposed of
    in those facilities. Are some of the most dangerous around. So I think. In technology
    there's an example, there is a tendency to think that. That. That everything's
    great is doing no harm. That the underlying that may be a. On the surface and
    when we dig a bit deeper than we see that. It isn't as. pleasant as. We first
    thought. That makes sense, did I manage to connect those ideas. Anyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It makes sense, I understand.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: I think it's about. So when we're talking about say women in computing. One
    example is grace hopper. Has anyone heard of grace hopper before.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I haven't. No okay.
  persid: S11
- desc: She retired she passed away oh I don't I can't remember off hand. But she
    was behind the development of cobo some of you may not have heard of cobo before.
    Common business oriented language so is a high level length, one of the first
    High Level languages. For computer programming. And she was also maybe more famously.
    associated with. Can. Computer bugs having found a boss in one of the vacuum tubes.
    ENIAC think that was the name of machine it. At Harvard was it. You can fact check
    my details here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: feel like mark one.
  persid: S14
- desc: Okay. So. she's connected to the. phrase computer bug and also. Well, another
    good one, I think, is. easier to ask forgiveness than get permission. Has anyone
    heard that phrase before a version of that. yep yeah so that. So those are some
    other. claims to fame she gave a talk at the University of Regina in November
    of 1974 when the computer science department here was just starting out. So that
    was about the year we had some of our first graduates from the Program. Which.
    we celebrated the department's 50th birthday. We had an event during computer
    science, education week. Which. computer science, education week is an international.
    Observance but officially it's from the States and the week is selected to include.
    grasshoppers birthday. So there's another connection. To grace hopper. She did
    a appearance on letterman in 19 8085, or so I think that's still on YouTube oh
    fine i'll see if I can find a link and i'll post it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Think i'm not a great example of women in computing is Lisa Su.
  persid: S15
- desc: Su or.
  persid: ???
- desc: Su Su.
  persid: S15
- desc: amd.
  persid: S07
- desc: empty.
  persid: S15
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: i'm not immediately familiar with that names that our end okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So. Basically, in planning back before 2017 amd is like an afterthought, and
    so Sue she stepped up as CEO and drove amd too closely compete with Intel and
    even. Like beat Enzo in a couple of like pockets and such. Look at him the stock
    price, you see, like a huge bump since 2017.
  persid: S15
- desc: i'm professor, just like to as like a lot of the, for example, a lot of the
    things that hunter cited where. they're not necessarily systemic. issues, I mean
    most if not all, of like the policy related things that kept certain groups of
    people from being able to join a certain workforce are pretty much illegal. I
    can't really think of a single.
  persid: S07
- desc: Legal doesn't mean it doesn't happen.
  persid: S10
- desc: Right so you're saying that it's basically people's mindsets that are preventing
    certain minorities from joining certain workforces.
  persid: S07
- desc: Right definitely yeah definitely.
  persid: S10
- desc: So I. I don't really see how putting a policy in have a quota would necessarily
    help change people's mind.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah that's what I said yeah.
  persid: S10
- desc: hey so let's be careful about. quarters. Because I think that has.
  persid: DHH
- desc: negative connotations.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well, even like having let's say. A program in place to encourage certain
    groups of people to join a certain industry right The problem here is changing
    people's minds, which just takes time, I mean even like hunter said his mom might
    be sexist right but he's not necessarily sexist and that just comes with time.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: Part of it is acknowledging. The current situation, to say that. There aren't
    any problems with the way things are present. and say, well, we don't need to
    fix anything we need to focus on marriage. And marriage. is often defined or has
    often been defined by people. who have received the most privilege in the system.
    So Caucasian males. represented. disproportionately I would say, and now i'm not.
    Let me make that less definitive I am going to guess that Caucasian males are.
    often placed in positions where. They can evaluate merit. They have a louder voice
    and talking about evaluating merit. So. I think the opportunity. is to invite
    more people. To consider these fields. So that. We have. The population of students
    studying computer science. getting more representative of. The population in Canada,
    for example.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What if the demographic of the people of Canada aren't interested in computer
    science.
  persid: S16
- desc: well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I feel like saying that is kind of like me collecting, from the point.
  persid: S15
- desc: what's the point, then, but i'm missing.
  persid: S16
- desc: That. i'm not sure sometimes the demographic might not support it, but even
    looking and seeing that there is another person who's off your skin color who's
    your gender who else. Who is part of the LGBT community makes you think Okay,
    yes, I am not alone and that there are people that we are still making progress.
    And we aren't just stuck in the fact that his life to his ability, as well as
    women's visibility matters in stem because the amount of shift that my sister
    faces on a daily basis as a computer scientist is no joke.
  persid: S09
- desc: I mean, people should find different ways to identify with other people rather
    than skin color. mean can you.
  persid: S16
- desc: bring up some examples. Maybe.
  persid: S07
- desc: You should. read it and defining ourselves with our jobs are our skin colors
    or anything at all, we are all human they take clay, why do it individually ourselves
    with our work, or why have that perception right.
  persid: S14
- desc: Exactly exactly but people who interview a sentence did not think that right
    they don't think that we're all.
  persid: S09
- desc: of us have you been.
  persid: S16
- desc: asking me.
  persid: S09
- desc: Because you're talking about yeah.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah because this bias that's known. But a legitimate fox based on this.
  persid: S09
- desc: Could you say any of those.
  persid: S07
- desc: I know my my and talk often talk about well, I was doing the pro core program
    this semester, and I asked my aunt who works in a company. For. advice for interviewing
    and she would tell me a bunch of stories of. Well, she actually works as an interviewer
    at your company, a lot of the time so she told me last stories about summer co
    workers were. slate discovery in often small ways, but. Large ways as well and.
    it's. Never, how do I put this it's. it's called was the word silent racism it's
    they just people sometimes just don't think. Well they're racist they don't think
    that someone who has an accent or different skin color is can do as good a job,
    as someone who was the same as them it's. doesn't have to be a. Massive and they
    might might not think they're capable, but they just think someone more like them
    will be better and so they'll pass up opportunities for someone else it's. I use
    the word systemic racism before and I was kind of used it wrong it's not the system
    it's just. there's enough people who work in these industries and who are the
    either employers or interviewers and they just have preconceived notions that.
    block or hold back other people from getting jobs or opportunities that other
    people. Such as white males would normally have easy access to.
  persid: S08
- desc: You know okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm not not trying to discourage any conversation about this, and maybe we
    can. continue this. Well i'm not trying to put an end to it, but I just want to
    get to a couple other things today. So one thing. One thing that struck me when
    I looked at Lisa Sue. And I think you can see my screen. is being shared.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You betcha.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah so people also asked is Lisa soon good seo. Is LUSA Sue a boy. What is
    loose the Su salary Lisa Sue a doctor.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't think we can see any of those questions, but we can just see the Google
    page.
  persid: S07
- desc: If you look down halfway through his pages.
  persid: S02
- desc: Malta all. The people i'm sorry.
  persid: S07
- desc: No worries no worries.
  persid: S02
- desc: So. Well okay. i'm not going to follow the links there. But it's interesting
    the kind of conversation that happens on Google. Google search. and I wanted to
    show a couple of links for Google search. Based on yesterday's discussion about
    controversial topics. So let me go ahead and. Look at that first or. Look at those
    as well. But before we get to the end of our time, so we can have some discussion
    about this, so the project proposal. I said to be do at men on Monday at midnight,
    or one minute before midnight. And I said originally that. We can make that be.
    The 18th so a week from tomorrow, just before the break. If you want to do that.
    So i'm open to to making that change to the project proposal. due date.
  persid: DHH
- desc: wasn't in originally after the break.
  persid: S02
- desc: No, the blog entry was. After the.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Mobile.
  persid: ???
- desc: So the project proposal is to on a thing now or 14. i'm.
  persid: S17
- desc: i'm willing to make it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I definitely want to create a team.
  persid: S02
- desc: Anyone. opposed to the team.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm good with the team.
  persid: S08
- desc: I just started easier to. I think i've logged in here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Good.
  persid: S15
- desc: I will make that change right now. So our discussion today that might be.
    The basis for an interesting project for some. For some people. Okay. So I don't
    know why again blue on the Gray background it's very hard to read. This do February
    18. And while I have everyone here. I want to show you. In the discussion forum.
    I have a post. or i'm encouraging you to tell me your group before you submit.
    So that just make it easier for marking. For dividing up. Projects so. The way
    I did it originally so that everyone belongs to the project group was to put everybody
    into their own group. So. When I. When I first created project groups everybody
    was by themselves so. You can absolutely do the project on your own. But you so
    you'll be in your project group by yourself. So the project groups are mechanism,
    the new our courses, so that we can treat. All the projects. The same way, whether
    they're done by individuals or in small groups. So if you can, if you're going
    to work in a group, if you can. send me a reply to this. And you just need to
    say. The email addresses and you don't need to put the at your vagina.ca. Just
    the ID the proceeds the outside.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Anyone everyone in that group needs to reply or only one person is.
  persid: S15
- desc: Just just one person. we're clock can needs to reply.
  persid: DHH
- desc: All right.
  persid: S15
- desc: So what i'll do then. What I or the markers will do is then the people who
    are indicated being in a group. So instead of everybody, having their own groups
    i'll put will put them into one group. And then remove the other ones. So if you
    have students in groups ABC and D. And they want to work together. Then i'll put
    all for students in group a and then remove groups B, C and D. So that makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep.
  persid: S15
- desc: yep that makes up.
  persid: S02
- desc: So if you can do it before.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You submit.
  persid: ???
- desc: The just. serve. I think make things run a bit more smoothly. But failing
    that, just make sure you indicate your group members on your proposal document.
    Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Do the students will do the project individually have to reply to this form
    or no.
  persid: S05
- desc: No, so if you're doing it individually you're. You don't need to reply. it's
    just if you want to work with somebody i'm encouraging you to. indicate that sooner
    so. it's just so. What I. It will be easier to distribute to allocate. Proposals
    for marketing. If I if we have the group's. Set up correctly before we do the
    allocation. Because there's two markers and if for students are working together,
    and the way the allocate marks. or work for marking. To the students get in are
    assigned to one marker and the other two are assigned to the other marker. Then.
    there's another layer of communication that has to happen. So better if. Before
    there's your sign for marking. I know what your project groups are, and then I
    can just assign.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Was it for people who, by the way.
  persid: S02
- desc: up to four i'm don't have. You don't have to have for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just just double checking Thank you okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah you're welcome. Okay, so change the date on my website as well. So. Going
    back to our discussion about. Google search so. At the bottom of the search results
    there's a link to how search works. And Google says their mission is to organize
    the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. GU used
    to say, they would do no evil, but they've dropped that. That was a long time
    ago. So they described their approach. again. Let me just. Look at. The headings
    here over the years, the web and world have changed Google search has evolved
    and improved, but our approach remains the same. continuously map the web and
    other sources to connect you to the most relevant helpful information. So the
    question is. Who gets to decide what's the most relevant and helpful information.
    We present results in a variety of ways, based on what's most helpful for the
    type of information you're looking for. Again, so there's the idea of most helpful
    and. Evaluating that or operationalize using what that means. All the while keeping
    your personal information, private and secure. So they have a movie. Which is
    not short. trillions of questions, no easy answers. Okay, and then they have different.
    I think these are different blog posts. or articles. I think it was under features.
    I had the link, on the other, page and. just go back there. So our featured snippets
    are chosen. snippets come from web search listings and google's algorithms determine.
    Whether patrons make a good featured snippet to highlight for a specific search
    request. Your feedback helps us to improve our search algorithms and the quality
    of search results. And then. here's the policy for featured snippets. To ensure
    featured snippets are helpful experience for everyone, you have systems in place
    to prevent showing those that are in violation of Google search. Google searches
    overall policies or these policies for search features. So, then, the number of
    specific. categories which. Specific. To specific policies, so if it's dangerous
    content deceptive practices harassing content a full content manipulated media
    medical content sexually explicit content terrorist content, violence and Gore
    vulgar language and profanity. features snippets also have. I would say that should
    be have. Since that's plural. featured snippets have this additional features
    specific policies applicable contradicting consensus on public interest topics.
    featured snippets of a public interest content, including many civic medical scientific
    and historical issues should not contradict well established or expert consensus
    support. These policies, not only apply these pardon me these policies only apply
    to what can appear as a search as a featured snippet they didn't apply to web
    search listings because those to be removed. So. That seemed like. We anyone comforted
    by. The policies. Is articulated here. Any any feelings about that as.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, I don't think I could design a more ethical search snippet. thing.
  persid: S13
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: well.
  persid: ???
- desc: So, so I think the issue is. If they certainly say the right things, but the
    question is how do they implement them. that's my question anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can I make a quick comment.
  persid: S06
- desc: sure.
  persid: ???
- desc: So it's not exactly related, but it is kind of. way back in the like the presidential
    election 2020. During the democratic primaries when there's candidate named tulsi
    gathered and she became the number one searched person on Google. When they had
    their one debate and Google deleted her from searches and you could not find her
    you'd have to go through several pages to find something about her when searching
    up her name after that debate.
  persid: S06
- desc: huh i'm. I remember the name but I don't remember that incident.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I remember hearing about her being like the number one search candidate,
    but I don't remember hearing about the video obviously because they they removed
    it from search wouldn't have heard about.
  persid: S07
- desc: So we're talking about medical content so let's see what. So the rule for
    medical content is we don't allow content that contradicts or runs contrary to
    scientific or medical consensus and evidence based best practices. So, again that's
    a good statement. yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I believe, with a tootsie gabbert situation, it was they suspended her ad
    account because she said something that Google didn't like I don't believe it
    was through her Google searches.
  persid: S07
- desc: will have to do bit more. i'll look into that. For next meeting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: button to articles on it on posted.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay. Okay. Okay, so let me go back to. So there's also a link to overall
    content policies for Google search. These policies apply to content surface anywhere
    within Google search, which includes web results were results or web pages images
    videos news content or other material that Google finds from across the web. child
    exploitation imagery material highly personal information spam. webmaster and
    site owner requests. and legal requests so. We get back to the same. list here.
    So there's the. there's the snippet that I showed about. minimizing risks of contracting
    and transmitting coven. desert. sent me. Medical content. guideline or the. Or
    the contradiction consensus on public interest topics. Here, let me see if I can
    do a. Quick poll here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: As we.
  persid: ???
- desc: get ready to go on our way here. I did that quite quickly here so i'll try
    again. There we go, so you can. answer that on your way out. And we thank you
    for today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, on that note, have a good weekend.
  persid: S02
- desc: thanks you too. Take care.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You as well.
  persid: S02
- desc: is to have some. upbeat music to play us out for the weekend. Okay, take care,
    everyone see you on Tuesday. and proposal is due on Friday next week so. spread
    the word. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: thanks again for Professor a couple of questions would I people to wait until
    one left after class pesky.
  persid: S07
- desc: sure.
  persid: ???
- desc: about the reading that you asked us to do for from blown to bits like. Are
    we just supposed to like read through the chapter just for our personal reference
    or something.
  persid: S18
- desc: well. I didn't expect the longest the discussion that we had. About EPI. My
    intent is. is to tie in some of the things. That i'm asking you about. it's not
    just. To make you read things. For your own benefit, I mean I think it's a nice
    book. So I will try harder to make more solid connections with with material that
    I asked you to look at. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah so so I was looking into the chapter like I just started off reading
    the chapter, but like I was kind of confused about like how much of the details
    are we supposed to remember, or like stuff like that, because, like.
  persid: S18
- desc: So. What I want to say. i'd like to say something like. The things that we
    talked about in class. And we reference in class and discuss in class are the
    things. That we that we will. The foundation for our evaluation, like the final
    exam and so forth. Okay, so. So i'm not give you a specific answer to say that
    we should focus on. Section one or.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just have a question regarding to the blog, is it possible, if you can extend
    the date sense if you extend the date for the project proposal they'll be like,
    and so, probably, you know be like will have 10 days to work on the blog entry
    yeah.
  persid: S05
- desc: we'll talk about the date for the blog entry next time okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you have a good weekend.
  persid: S05
- desc: But i'm not opposed to it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: really appreciate you Thank you you're welcome.
  persid: S05
- desc: So Mohammed. So I don't have a specific answer for you, but the chapter four
    chapter.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I see.
  persid: S18
- desc: so well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S18
- desc: So. The connections, you can make. As you look at. That reference that resource
    book. And look at other things in the web, think about how they connect to our
    discussions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That make sense yeah because I mean look first of all like, as I was reading
    through the chapter like for us. Most of the parts are just talking about like
    how, in the previous times how. stops were connected and how Internet was used
    for like now in the classes we're mostly discussing about how modern Internet
    or like how Google searches are working, you know, like stuff like that the ethical
    part so yeah I just got kind of confused so yeah.
  persid: S18
- desc: OK so anyway, like I said i'll. Work on making stronger connections with.
    The resource material I indicate to you to look at okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you so much, I hope you have a good rest of the day yeah.
  persid: S18
- desc: shoot to see.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You bye.
  persid: S18
- desc: bye.
  persid: ???
- desc: On search, so I guess. Maybe.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah I was gonna say to have officers attendance.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh it's a 10 okay. I can join the. zoom call there if it's a. it's better.
  persid: S07
- desc: We are you comfortable just talking now or.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I am yeah um so I just had a couple of questions on the proposal because I
    was a little confused arm, so our topic it just has to be related to computer
    science or. Because I was like reading the project proposal on on your website
    and it's. Like it says here that there's a list of topics, but then you could
    choose a topic that's new to you do we have to choose from that like list of learning
    outcomes.
  persid: S07
- desc: well. So, so the list come from 2013 so they're in the process of being updated
    by the. by the Association for computing machinery.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Right and when. It goes for four page so.
  persid: S07
- desc: Oh well. No one told me that. I had fixed. Any links and I son. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because i'm still because there's i'm like does it have to be a research paper
    or book review or could it be like a YouTube video.
  persid: S07
- desc: Know it's there's a number of options there. And given a bit of detail about
    a book review.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay um.
  persid: S07
- desc: And so picture yourself as a competing professional. So the idea of. Discussing.
    Your roadmap some role models for you as. As you can into computing it's another
    one, I said, you could write some code. there's a number of different options
    there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So i'm one of the topics my partner we're talking about was. The Pegasus spyware
    some done by a company in Israel. And then we're going to talk about the ethics
    of our governments, by not kind of spyware and using it basically with taxpayer
    dollars, whether or not they should be allowed to or whether or not should be
    illegal, like that kind of thing is that a topic that would work for this project.
  persid: S07
- desc: sure.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay. Okay um. And so doing that in let's say a form of. Of a podcast or video
    would be fine as well. yeah okay good ah, I just wanted to make sure before we
    typed up the proposal and that kind of thing. So I appreciate appreciate it.
  persid: S07
- desc: Oh you're very welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have a good rest of your day.
  persid: S07
- desc: thanks you too. Take care.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor.
  persid: S19
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah it's a non purpose or actually I received the mail from conan week regarding
    the six sections which and. She told me that, like if it's Okay, for you like
    if the Professor accepts like then like we thought officially changing the subject,
    and that should be fine like she told the gift Professor is okay, with it, then
    that should be fine that was me.
  persid: S19
- desc: yeah so that's what I was indicating to you as well. And not so many words.
    So. The only. The only issue is about how the exam. will be given. But. So. we'll
    have that conversation in the next well. I would say in March will discuss those
    issues.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh yeah sure Professor.
  persid: S19
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So thank you so much.
  persid: S19
- desc: yeah you're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Take care.
  persid: ???
- desc: anyone else left she still wants to talk to me.

  persid: S26
- desc: nobody is born racist, its only learned through time
  persid: S02
- desc: very true. I feel as long as interviews are handled by humans there will always
    be bias(racism). If the interview process can be streamlined by an artificial
    intelligence or something similar, then there may be equality.
  persid: S27
- desc: An artificial intelligence is as good as the person who wrote it.
  persid: S28
- desc: That also depends on the algorithm though. AI could still produce many issues
  persid: S24
- desc: For a merit based system, whose standard of merit should be tolerated?? Because
    people have different levels of education from different institutions.
  persid: S14
- desc: ^
  persid: S06
- desc: but even then it depends how the ai is programmed and they are programmed
    y humans
  persid: S10
- desc: In my view it is humans that change the way of thinking and not an AI machine.
    It all starts with us
