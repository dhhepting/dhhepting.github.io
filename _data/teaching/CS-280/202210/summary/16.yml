Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: hear you.
  persid: S00
- desc: better now.
  persid: ???
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S00
- desc: Oh. So let's do our attendance first human issues. Okay. After some setbacks
    and got my checklist and i've turned on the audio didn't work, but I turned it
    on. The thought is I guess i'll see them doing a little bit better if my checklist
    that share screen yes. Thank you. So I have. If you had submitted a blog entry
    before. edition of the fourth thing that line or. Anyway, so I reverted them to
    draft So if you would like to make changes, you can. and If you forget to hit
    submit again. don't do it afterwards. Because. We can see your draft submissions.
    So if you say today's afterwards do oh I forgot to submit it and click submit
    those can be marked two days late. So. Okay, so that makes sense. Can everybody
    see their copy the comments for their project proposal, yes, so it's your final
    thought you don't have to do anything. that's right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We can resubmit.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah I was just gonna. I was going to take a picture of this and then right
    there on the next board. let's go through it right away. Those two things right
    now. Okay, so I should. Do this like that are ready. Go worse. The selected. submission
    to draft status. OK. So this should do it for everybody. still working. change
    anything here, but if I can i'll make a note here. sure that makes. Okay, so there
    we have. The updated. course webpage So if you have any problems. Let me know
    but should be clear they're. sort of talking about human interfaces so. How he
    mean is this interface. Would you say. Any concerns you have about it, watching
    me interact with it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's relatively straightforward.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah so. don Norman said, the two biggest two most important things in designer.
    discover ability and understanding. So things are are. fairly well fairly easy
    to discover. It may not behave as well as just as i'd like and it may be hard
    to find out, I can confirm my understanding of what the different controls will
    do. But. it's all there. The issue that I have is maybe. There are things that
    the interface could do. Like when i'm setting dates. If I have, if I have available
    from and until if I said. The first date. For today and I don't want to have the
    due date is yesterday. You know so maybe the second date could start after the
    first one. Things like that. So there's. That. interaction. between schools. This.
    keystroke level model is a way to. get a. analyze the interface in terms of how
    long it will take to perform tasks. Thanks. Thanks for sharing that I. was in
    the habit of sharing it once for Class if required. Sentences so everything gets.
    i'm. Time so keystroke eating a key is a certain amount of time. Moving between
    the keyboard and the mouse certain amount of time playing the mouse a certain
    amount of time. and mental effort to decide what to do as a certain amount of
    time as well. So fastest things to do in the interface or. Using the keyboard.
    So whenever you're switching to the keyboard and a mouse currently that's really
    adding a lot of time. So what I want to say people. consider that. alright. Things.
    that's accessible for people who do things infrequently so they don't have to
    remember commands and. You don't have to remember the the more efficient ways
    to use the keyboard to complete different tasks. So it can provide a low barrier
    of entry. But then I. can also think about the. it's the ceiling. not have a low
    ceiling. So that means that, as people get more familiar, they can do things more
    quickly and efficiently. Is computer professionals, that we have to consider say
    i'm designing software that. is really considered the making things easy or efficient.
    or satisfying for the user.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's.
  persid: ???
- desc: My choice, the software works. I don't need to worry about the bells and whistles
    it's hard for me to write 300 people use. That argument before. it's a badge of
    honor to install. This version of Linux or something else right. is enough to
    say that. I wrote the code for the. does everything it's was asked to do. I don't
    need to be concerned about healthy how well, people are satisfied with the interface.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You like by making it accessible, I think that adheres people from wanting
    to use it and that there's someone else for to kind of the same program but it's
    easier to use.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah, so I think the idea of. usability is the question of accessibility.
    So if we say we provide this capability and software, but it's very hard to to
    use effectively than our, is it really being provided. Not in a practical sense
    so as computer professionals need to take the responsibility to. So we're acknowledging
    we understand the impact that our software. Has on society and so. We need to.
    Think about people being able to. access. functionality in a meaningful way. there's
    a comment in the chat I see. So pressing tab doesn't make a tab character. It
    doesn't. Think on windows it's. done something other than in depth. So i'm not
    sure. If it's just. it's everything on windows are. If that's a particularly you,
    our courses problem or whether it's the larger issue of how the tab key works
    and for text input. And know if you have other experience with that. Okay. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Would it be possible for you to shift the camera towards your life right because,
    like we can see the. Sure last part of the second.
  persid: S03
- desc: Much better.
  persid: S04
- desc: So do you think so, do you think the. website is an example of that interface
    design. So. Any thoughts about that in your experience so. we're talking about
    the website assignment. So i'm not asking you to. Do this kind of analysis for
    keystrokes and long it takes to do different things. In the assignment but. Just
    to look at the content and see whether you can find. If the content, the content
    available on the website is thing Earth is valuable to you, and you can access
    it in a way that that makes sense to you. So my concern with the old website.
    Is that it's not responsive design. And it isn't. that's that's a big thing. yeah
    yeah it's a website was not as intuitive as needed information was much less than
    it is now so any new student going to do, return at see would have to go through.
    different options for us to find out what he is what he wants her to actually
    see what programs artists, the university offering. As affected, right now, where
    there is a clear option of programs where you can go select the field, you want.
    So that's. So, in case. it's not see in the. So I was the whiteboard looking at
    the back of the room so okay or not so much. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So as a web page and feel comfortable about how the access to information
    you watch, so if it would have the homepage can I find the programs or study,
    can I find the contact information that I want to use. So I suspect that there
    are many parts of the web page of the University of the giant that. haven't gone
    through a careful consideration. What information do you want to what what integration
    to students or do people visiting the website want to find. And how can we organize
    it so that people can discover what's the integration that we have available for
    them. Not a single Grad studies, but I was trying to find some information about
    some of the rules that they have for. for students and. it's. it's not it's not
    necessarily very easy to find. it's like they have. You know, maybe it's people,
    some people might consider it a feature instead of a bug that. Some information
    is not. not easy to locate. sort of like that it's a badge of honor if you find
    out information or how to apply for an award so. let's say you want to make an
    application or something. or make a change or. Do something together find the
    right person so part of. The test is for you to find the right person to get in
    touch with. So we were talking about the coven 19 data for saskatchewan so. i'm
    in the process of suggesting, I made a pull request on the repository. to update
    the data all share the link with ocean sure, along with the two that was kind
    of waiting to see how. It was going to be accepted or not. So in the meeting,
    so I found. Data from the from the public health agency of Canada. which is close
    to the data that I. know is I had an iPhone mistake on what's on the date and
    the data that is on the john is on the github repository for the sketch from so
    i'm hoping to. Look favorably upon my suggestions. it's not. So. In our case it's.
    Providing. Sorry zoom people. So in the in the case of. You know, say, we have
    the repository on github but then, if it's not clear how to make how to submit
    changes. it's not other things aren't very clear. That it's up to the user. To
    piece things together. And so. Dedicated people who are going to make her going
    to take that on. that's, not that this they understand that. requirement. But
    it doesn't. doesn't necessarily. encourage people to look at the data. there's
    a there's an encourage people to become familiar with it and understand how it's
    set up. So it's not necessarily providing meaningful access to the. data. But
    at the same time you're not going to be at the point of. Getting do start out
    without doing everything correctly or in the best possible way. So there's a process,
    maybe. know so. If we continue the. Free make something available that's a good
    thing, but we can always keep in mind how to make it more accessible. How we how
    we can provide a better interface. And so, that means. clarifying structure. and
    processes and so on, so we understand the tasks that people want to complete.
    So what I find in your courses, for example, is. Going back to your courses. Setting
    up groups. that's an interface I don't want to pull well because I could show
    you the interface. To. So here all the groups. That are set up. In class. I want
    to change it. Already. Then, save those changes. Then, if I want to add remove
    users. there's too many users to list here. It says. Let me add myself. workers.
    So I said, well, I really didn't add hunter all right on that border myself in
    this. I have to scroll down to get to the point where I can see the buttons. So
    i'm also trying to click on these names here right that doesn't do anything. Until
    I. get to the screen with Adam abusers. example. Long example I apologize for
    that. This home screen of the new website. Because other places let's see. So
    science doesn't anything what future students. This future students mentioned
    there that needs to be a big thing that they come to the webpage. As their information
    about. To.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Be.
  persid: ???
- desc: So you want to be a student of view of our How does that. How do you get there.
    anyway. So we're out of time for today. So any questions or concerns.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, so Sir for the website assessment, you are asking us to comment on this
    website or, like the previous website of the university.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well i'm really talking about. computer science web page. Is that clear.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, sir.
  persid: S03
- desc: To this, but i'm not asking and focus on. The University of Regina web page
    we just want you to focus on the new computer science web page and it's not brand
    new but it's within the last couple of years. Anyway, I resolved to not get stuck
    on Tuesday so i'll be here and where to go and play very. So we'll have a. Good
    meeting. We had a bad meeting today but. Anyway, thank you very much for coming
    and sticking around. Waiting for me to arrive and have a great weekend and we'll
    see you Tuesday. And i'll be around if you need. Thanks take care, everyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So you'll still be available at your office hour to the right. yeah okay Thank
    you, Sir, see you bye bye.
  persid: S03
- desc: I wanted to ask you if it is if you're the. meeting for tomorrow around three
    or four do sure never be doing to send an email or because I cannot make it into
    the opposite ours, because I have either classes are work at both the time so
    i'm just so nervous.

Zoom-Chat-Transcript:
- desc: can you hear me?
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'no'
  persid: S04
- desc: 'No'
  persid: S05
- desc: better?
  persid: DHH
- desc: are you talking?
  persid: S04
- desc: we can hear you now
  persid: S06

- desc: Blog entry submissions received have been reverted to draft (so you can make
    changes)
  persid: S07
- desc: I don't believe mine has been reverted to a draft, it's not showing anywhere
    I can edit my submission.
  persid: S08
- desc: It is fine to leave it as a draft, but if you hit submit after the due date
    it will appear to be late
  persid: S07
- desc: Dr. Hepting is going to check if the blog entry submissions have been reverted
  persid: S07
- desc: For the project proposal, if you would like to improve your grade based on
    feedback received, you have until March 14 at 11:59pm
  persid: S07
- desc: The submissions should be reverted now, please check
  persid: S07
- desc: Works for me!
  persid: S08
- desc: code for attendance?
  persid: S09

  persid: S06
- desc: "Dr. Hepting is currently discussing whether the UR Courses interface is humane,\
    \ from an instructor\u2019s point of view"
  persid: S07
- desc: can you move the camera a bit right?
  persid: S10
- desc: The time to switch between keyboard and mouse is significant. This is something
    to consider when building an interface
  persid: S07
- desc: Are human interfaces an ethical requirement?
  persid: S07
- desc: I noticed that the text box on UR Courses that are used in larger text inputs
    are horrible when writing code, as pressing tab will cause the page to scroll
    to the bottom instead of making an indent
  persid: S04
- desc: do you think old uregina.ca is an example of bad interface design?
  persid: S10
- desc: "it\u2019s not looking good in mobile device"
  persid: S10
- desc: yes very possible, there's certain ways to organize information that suits
    how the human brain works and looks first
  persid: S11
