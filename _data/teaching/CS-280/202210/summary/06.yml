Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: morning. morning glad to hear. Your voice.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thursday morning, you know.
  persid: S01
- desc: what's up for Thursday morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just peachy. This peachy.
  persid: S01
- desc: well.
  persid: ???
- desc: What could be better than that. Okay well. 68 here today 67 students. So I.
    redid the group's a little bit, so I. I tried to keep them. keep them set up as
    much as possible the way they were initially but I had to move people a few people
    around, so now we have 12 groups. Three was 10. And nine with nine. So at one
    plus 30 that's 111 So there we go. Matthew been works out. On Thursday mornings
    so. there's a little bit hard to figure out. Because well it looked like we had
    126 people in class, but then I realized that. People who had switch sections.
    Were store in. Both both the face to face and remote group so. Once once I realized
    that. Then the numbers made sense so. Okay. So. let's do our attendance. So the
    question about which groups, I was talking about. So yes, there the groups for
    class work so for the wiki and for breakout rooms, that we do during our meetings.
    So it if you find yourself, not in. A group perfect made a mistake or. Let me
    know. Okay, oh let's try. Okay, so here's a breakdown of the assignments and we'll
    talk about the first two. So the group website assignment. group website assessment
    haven't. posted yet. Okay that's sorted out. cool we'll talk on Tuesday. Okay,
    so. So we talked about the due date for the project proposal. And I said. 14th,
    which is the Monday, but we could. extend it to the Friday, so I would like to
    get it in before the reading week break. So I think i've updated all the links
    and so so on for these. So this gives you a chance to do something. A little bit
    different on your own or in a small group. to explore. Some of the class ideas.
    So that a bit more detail here and I could improve the formatting a bit still.
    didn't be research paper book review in here i've given a little bit of information
    about. How to approach a book review. could be writing a Wikipedia article. Creating
    a new one or adding to an existing one. create and promote some online content,
    like a video or podcast. picture yourself as a competing professional. So what
    I have in mind there is. For you, to identify and discuss role models for your
    life is competing fashionable. Choose three. Competing professional role models.
    or professionals, I guess. From the present or past and right. right to vote,
    each one include a picture of possible. reflect on how they inspire you to switch
    to the code of ethics codes of ethics. Including the cm code of ethics and professional
    conduct. chat link there. That we are we're examining in class. So if you're working
    on an open source another idea might be to talk about your involvement in an open
    source project. We may like to write some code to test, an idea thats related
    to class. Okay, I left I moved the description of the deliverables up. To the
    description section, so I forgot to remove that. to choose so organize your proposal
    in terms of the topic you're going to deal with. And the list of topics is just
    next. Two assignments on the list here. This is a generic form of the. Of the
    link. So it'll be redirected to the same place. So my goal with doing these kinds
    of links is to. always have. To not have to change the links in your courses,
    but every time they have a new course offering, then the script will locate the
    rate. The current information and the current offering. So topic deliverable.
    and rationale tentative plan. So there's a breakdown of the five marks. for that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Excuse me, sir. hmm so Sir about the project proposal, as you said, like it
    can be a podcast or something like that. yeah so you want us to have both the
    three computing professionals and our topic that we want to discuss about.
  persid: S03
- desc: know.
  persid: ???
- desc: Then.
  persid: S03
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: This was a list of. So there's a here's a bit more traditional book review.
    And then here's a bit more information about what it means to picture yourself
    as good puting professional. But you can pick one of. These ideas or do your own
    variation on it. So i'm. i'm suggesting some potential. Project deliverables for
    you. But list isn't exhaustive. So you can decide whether you're going to work
    by yourself, or with a small group and then, if you're. going. Then, then choosing
    a deliverable that's appropriate for. either of those situations. That interests,
    you and so forth. So the idea is to get you thinking about. How you're going to
    tackle this. And then the time after the break. Until the. until the last synthesis
    doing last day of class the final deliverable. So, working from the break onwards
    to. To create to realize your project. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah so so so if we choose to do our like. A group one, then we can we can
    like discuss about a recent topic isn't it like a recent news that we want to
    write about and then is it.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. it's you can choose a topic thats related to class.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah So yes, a timely. Topics it's in the news is a good choice yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah answer about the about the. Popper project proposal does it have to be
    like 900 to 1000 words or it should be just a normal. summary of.
  persid: S03
- desc: So I think you you're conflating. Two project proposal and the blog entry.
  persid: DHH
- desc: same thing here we're just kind of get a bit confused between the project
    proposal, the project and the blue light is it okay to write them as articles
    or essays or. Where are you referring to the project, thank you, we have to write
    for the project like a video or presentation, or something like that or a different
    thing.
  persid: S04
- desc: So the blog entry. is writing. Between and the goal, the target length of
    that is 900 to 1000 words. So the project. What you choose to. Created the end
    of the Semester, by the end of the Semester. Could could be something as written.
    But it could also be some other things like a. Like a video. podcast different
    different things. So the proposal for the project. is written, and I said, one
    or two pages for that. But if you're not if you're doing a video then. Then it
    isn't it, it does you're not creating. you're not creating a document or a certain
    length and so forth. So it makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah so basically for a blog entry or project, we can just like write an article
    for a certain topic or certain event that's happening thats related to the. last
    topic and for the project deliverable we can like do a like a broadcast or video
    or like a presentation talking about a certain events that's happening, and that
    that events that are related to the topics of the class right.
  persid: S04
- desc: In general, yes, so um I just want to clarify that. you're not you're not
    necessarily writing the same thing for the blog and for the project. I would say.
    The project. gives you maybe a bit more freedom to explore. topics that are of
    interest to you, so you know if you would rather write some code. and talk about
    it. technical issues and. So on then, then you're able to do that. Am I helping
    to clarify things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: answer about the project like if we are working in a group, like the project
    proposal and. Final project both will have the theme. submission for all the group
    members isn't it.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah you just have to submit one coffee.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: I have a question yeah.
  persid: S05
- desc: So wait, I just want to get things right, so you have two sections right,
    we have to book review are the Wikipedia Aldo code writing code or something yeah
    so we just have to be one item all these topics you guys just what.
  persid: S06
- desc: you're selecting one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: swan Ray before.
  persid: S06
- desc: You made choose something that's not on the list.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I was gonna ask you to go in and do a 3pm nation and explain something
    like that. brand on it. No, no, I mean three of the three gun nation video something
    like that.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: You see, you can double guys and you can do videos right.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But if i'm doing it to edm nation videos So what is going to be the blog entry
    if i'm ready, no, no, I need to describe the video out in my blog entry before
    I actually create the videos I don't understand.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So there's a project.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Opposing What about.
  persid: S06
- desc: Is there's a project that has a proposal. And then, that the Semester you
    deliver what you've proposed. So the project can be individually done, individually
    or in a group. So the project is the project. it's separate I mean you want to
    you're going to deal with a topic related to class. And under topics here. I have
    a list of. These different knowledge units about social context analytical tools
    professional ethics, intellectual property, privacy and civil liberties professional
    communication. foundations of human computer interaction.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So we have to relate it to do one of these topics, so my question is, I have
    to do the proposing, and I have to do a blog entry and after some adult project
    right. sure that a book entry is you know, two days is February and find out projects.
    If you at the end of the Semester. So the blog entries does this is a lack of
    discretion of the projects are you i'm doing a video.
  persid: S06
- desc: know your blog entry it's a completely separate thing so don't mix the blog
    with the project to project separate thing and you'll submit a proposal for that
    and your blog entries it's completely separate activity. So you can write your
    blog on anything related to the class. Like to the topics related to the class
    yeah.
  persid: S07
- desc: You can pick. unrelated topics. For the blog entry and. For the project. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You have the blog critique, as do next week on, you have our courses.
  persid: S08
- desc: Do I.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah. Well yeah on your courses February to second.
  persid: S05
- desc: should be march 21. So i'll fix it right now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And so what is the critique about like is it more like we're commenting on
    others works or something.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yes. I think I have it here. yeah okay so on. My webpage it's got the correct
    date 21st of March. So. i'm asking. i'm asking you. and encouraging you to post
    your blogs in the class blog area. Now let me go back to that. So there's a. there's
    a class blog. that's available to everyone to read so i'm encouraging you to post
    your blog entry there. And so. When you. say your blog entry number three. So,
    then you would critique the next one in the the next entry in the blog. So i've
    created. This link the individual student blog. As a place where you can. edit
    your blog entry and when it's complete you can copy it over to the the class blog.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, Sir individual student log is where we submit our work, initially, and
    then after that be copy and paste it in class blog.
  persid: S03
- desc: So then, individual student blog is where you can work on it. where you can
    rate the rated in html. And so. I just remind people, please don't send me direct
    messages because. Then i'm going to be only replying to you. So resubmit the blog
    under the blog entry. And posted in the class blog. that's what i'm encouraging
    yes so. If you have. If you're opposed. To posting your work in the class blog
    for others to see. Then we can make. You can. have your document to create for
    the blog entry. made available to. Somebody someone else in the class to critique
    it so. and trying to create a. risk. To be respectful of people's wishes so. They
    don't want to. share their ideas with the entire class. Then. we'll do it on a
    student by student basis.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um when we post our blog on the class blog the we choose any of the blog there
    to critique it. Or do we have like an order.
  persid: S09
- desc: So i've said. In the assignment. critique the blog entries that immediately
    follows your own blog entry. Okay. fixed date and. well. I guess we've lost somebody
    else. From yesterday so there's 110. registered in the class now so. fix up that.
    That. group list. So i've had. discord service for classes before. and I think
    it's maybe. easier for me to leave that to you. come up. Sorry, I better do this
    now, before it cause more problems later. Okay, so regarding groups. So i'll i'll
    handle making the groups for the group website assessment, you can make your own
    groups of up to four for the project. If you want. That makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It does, thank you.
  persid: S10
- desc: you're welcome my pleasure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So if you notice things about your courses or have questions about them, so
    I just want to highlight that there's a participation discussions. where you can
    report bugs in your courses. Or, in my own website or make suggestions. about
    things. That will contribute to our discussions. So the wiki is also there. for
    you to. and resources or. or links that contribute to class. So I want to revisit
    the article about. The dilemma in bioethics well whether. vaccine status should
    impact triage decision decisions. So. So for the for medical professionals. Prior
    behavior does not influence. A person's. treatment. that's been a long held principle.
    But now. Because resources are becoming so stretched. there's more. discussion
    about. The responsibilities of people. to balance the rates. So, the reason I
    brought up that article wasn't so that we can. discuss what. What doctors should
    do. In this case. We I want to just have a discussion about. What. What ethical.
    framework should we as computer professionals have when we're. Designing algorithms.
    That can have. Serious impacts on society.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's really hard to design an algorithm to be unbiased when it comes to anything.
    Like medical or professional like that.
  persid: S01
- desc: So. algorithms become biased, because the people who write them have biases.
    that's one way to look at it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What about measure any when you feel the feudal system. If that data is a
    flu virus it's like all you can do definitive date and you feel Michelle any where
    he is with the data right, so this data and sometimes they i'm usually bias, to
    hear about read about stuff like that.
  persid: S06
- desc: Right, so it depends on training data. So, in the sense that, when we. Train
    an algorithm with historical data, maybe that's a way to. look into the mirror.
    or on so we get a fresh perspective on the biases that we have.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah cuz training an algorithm with the history is this going to be extremely
    biased and racist.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah. So if if we can't. write an algorithm without bias. What what are some
    workarounds that are possible.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You can reach out to the open source community and have multiple editors and
    readers kind of looking on it on your code and see if it can be edited in any
    way to get rid of opinions and biases.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But companies want to make their proprietary algorithms available to open
    source community.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah but also what if you don't know how to code.
  persid: S11
- desc: yeah so there's some interesting ideas there right, so we have the idea that.
    algorithms and code or trades. deserve intellectual property protection. may be
    treated. As trade secrets are proprietary so you don't want to let the world know
    just. Just what we have. That that's powering our you know Facebook and Google
    don't want. To be too clearable. How their ranking pages and how their algorithms
    work. To target advertisements and so on, because that's part of the business.
    Is there way to add transparency. To the process. Without compromising. The secret
    nature.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Of.
  persid: ???
- desc: Of these.
  persid: DHH
- desc: of some of these algorithms.
  persid: ???
- desc: Maybe maybe office of the privacy Commissioner or higher authority i'm stepping
    to review. And then the confidentiality of those algorithms will be retained as
    well, I think.
  persid: S07
- desc: That that'll be a good. idea is. that we, as the government have any idea
    about technology, you know from all those hearing they seem to be you know lacking
    in that.
  persid: S12
- desc: So what about a situation whereby Facebook invest a lot of money into controlling
    for sublimation on a platform in countries like us, but in developing countries,
    they invest less money into. Controlling for us Informations so they invest less
    in developing countries, but because of the attack to get a lot from countries
    like the US or Canada they invest a lot to control us information so any biases
    in your system.
  persid: S06
- desc: Well, they say they do anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To me.
  persid: ???
- desc: it's not as a clear that they're doing everything they could be doing. And
    the larger question is. What kind of framework allows them to. be the profitable
    companies. And also responsible corporate citizens. because some of the some decisions
    that are left to the companies now maybe are not best left to those companies.
    didn't mean to. enter our discussion there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like, something that would help would be updating our digital laws from 1990
    to present day.
  persid: S13
- desc: um.
  persid: DHH
- desc: copyright laws and everything that are. dictating certain things are not up
    to date with current technology.
  persid: S13
- desc: yeah we should definitely just start there.
  persid: S01
- desc: I got I was reading about that define that the government is not really off
    to deal with the technology has given me now society like there's not a lot of
    law guiding artificial intelligence machine learning all this stuff. I know because
    we are really the commands really backwards in system fully integrate technology
    and beyond, we lost so people are easily able to get away with it is stuff like
    this.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay. So if you have. You have a link. For that article. Please feel welcome
    to share it. Okay. yeah so. it's difficult to say. it's difficult to create. A
    legal framework for things which are still developing. And certainly in the United
    States there won't be as much. There will be very little support for. doing things
    to which. curtail the the behavior of the free market, so to speak. Now, whether
    the ideas of the free market. are working. As described present is another thing
    I mean to talk about. The importance of. marketplace in. As an engine for innovation
    but. it's not necessarily. Working just as well as. it's claimed to be, I think.
    Okay, so. There are. There are lots of areas where.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Our question was since i'm like who's talking about technology let's talk
    about them up, who add tags the tags that are created because there's not a lot
    of laws guiding down. There now using that to steal a lot of cars and people just
    put a tag on your car and you can track your cat right. Somebody that isn't a
    situation by the government is not keeping up with technology, because now really
    considering the risk of sending teams down is going into the society because they
    never mentioned in love loss.
  persid: S06
- desc: Sure, the cat apple tags.
  persid: DHH
- desc: are getting dives yet you can put on your form to track your pop your properties
    yeah, I think, at least those. Right now, those are used to steal cars in this
    room, are they using those for a lot of costly to put on your car to track your
    car to I will you pack your card he still he got these individually.
  persid: S06
- desc: To justin.
  persid: DHH
- desc: National posts.
  persid: S13
- desc: Should do fine air tag based and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: contract, so please they using those now for car jack's.
  persid: S06
- desc: they're using it for stocking as well.
  persid: S13
- desc: stocking so we see we're not implementing a lot of laws and we're letting
    things go go away without even fundamental laws of government able to keep track
    and catch up with technologies. I smoothing.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay. I was not aware of that, thank you for sharing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What a modern, the case of the time I don't think the intention was for it,
    we use this week, I think it was malicious people that took advantage of the original
    purpose of the. Of the technology, so I don't i'm not entirely sure there's a
    particular law, you could put it in this case, to prevent malicious people from
    doing that.
  persid: S14
- desc: And I. Know technologies creator with the idea of who bad anything bad to
    happen, the way is usually created with a good idea behind it, but like this disease
    gonna understand is that people are going to use it wrong with Facebook was not
    created to use. To promote crack but the people are going to use it to promote
    these all these good path of creating. Economic bodies also utilize for the wrong
    populists.
  persid: S06
- desc: So this is the same thing, like as government needs to have new laws, then
    people also need to have a moral operating system, I guess. As it comes down to
    individual choices right like some people can use it for malicious intent, while
    others use it for what it's meant to be used for like there's no really a way
    how you can stop people from misusing things are misusing technology right.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah so. So that's the line that. You know it's in the states, there has been
    a line that. For many years guns don't kill people people kill people. So. Facebook
    doesn't. It doesn't itself. set out to do things but. It provides the means for
    people to do them and it doesn't help on Facebook. For example. As a financial
    interest in that's different it's arguably different than the societal interest
    in. In. In keeping. Well, in providing. A communications platform I guess that
    would be the way to say it. So I want to go back. To the idea of when we have
    our source code. And being reviewed by. Many eyes let's say. I think it's also
    important in this day and age. to recognize the value of diversity in the workplace.
    So that we don't just have many eyes. that belong to the same segment of society.
    Looking at things because that's. That. That may uncover issues in the code. But
    it won't necessarily uncover. Issues related to bias. So the more. That we have
    people. It as computing professionals who are. representative of society as a
    whole, so the demographic. So our. Creative computing professionals matches the
    demographic makeup of our society. Then we have. A very good chance. To reduce
    or make. make visible different biases that exists in our code. Then there's still
    the issue of. Being. As computing professionals. How do we make decisions about.
    what's right and what's wrong. there's an acm ethics Twitter account that I see
    on the. On the acm ethics page that. just visited let's go back there. So how
    do we decide. How to behave as computing professionals. And I just wanted to i'm
    doing a search for public. On the page for the cm code of ethics and professional
    conduct. Just. I should mention that the acm stands for the association for computing
    machinery. it's not the Association of computing machinery. And it was. started.
    Think. I have to look at today. They had their 60th anniversary fairly recently.
    So the preamble, the code of ethics says competing professionals actions change
    the world to act responsibly, they should reflect upon the wider impacts of the
    work consistently supporting the public good. what's the public good. let's look.
    here. Based on the understanding that the public good, is always the primary consideration.
    understanding that the public good, is is the paramount consideration. Computer
    professionals are encouraged to actively contribute to society by engaging and
    pro bono or volunteer work that benefits the public good. Both custom in law recognizes
    some exceptions to a creative control of a work are necessary for the public good.
    Access computing and communication resources only when authorized or when compelled
    for the public good. computing professional should not access and others computer
    system software or gain of thunder reasonable belief that such an action would
    be authorized or a compelling belief that it's consistent with the public good.
    sure that the public good, is a central concern of during all professional computing
    work. The public good, should always be an explicit consideration when evaluating
    tasks associated with. With all those. Every aspect. Okay, so so. If public good.
    it's about the well being society. How do we define well being a society. So,
    so a few years ago in this class I asked. A question about. Public good or public
    interest and. And the student report are asked for. A definition on an exam and.
    The students said i'm a member of the public. And if it's good for me then it's
    in the public good. Do you accept you think that's a good way to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: thing that then mark Zuckerberg is a member of a public so whenever it's good
    for him good photo public.
  persid: S12
- desc: yeah that is one question I have is like who is public when we say the public
    good, who is public which group are we referring to, because obviously there will
    be groups when you refer to public.
  persid: S15
- desc: Yes, exactly I don't believe that. meeting with them.
  persid: S16
- desc: Go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah, I just wanted to say that. I don't think that should that should be
    the that is the correct definition because different people have different kind
    of it kind of interests. And they may not always align with each other.
  persid: S16
- desc: I guess here the public actually refers to the group of you know, like. group
    of people in our society, who, for whom actually all these are being made.
  persid: S03
- desc: it's like the common interest. For majority of people, I guess.

- desc: well. i'm not suggesting that we try and nail it down the last few minutes
    of class as well, in fact, are one minute over. But I think that's. that's an
    important. bit. To to think about is just how do we define the public good. So
    that we two people can say i'm acting in the public good. But if they have two
    different definitions of public good. Then they might. Not, be it might be working
    at odds with each other well claiming to both be. holding the public good in the
    highest regard. So I have a couple videos for next day. And with that i'll say
    goodbye, and thank you very much for today. And we'll see you on Tuesday, have
    a good weekend.
