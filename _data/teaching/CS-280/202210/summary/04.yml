- desc: Good morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: morning.
  persid: S02
- desc: morning.
  persid: S03
- desc: Good morning, good morning everyone. Still. let's see no one no one's frozen
    up over or night. it's pretty cold out there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: there's a modern heating going against.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah and our ability to. Say inside so it's a it's a positive. With our ritual
    meetings that we can avoid. exposure. To the elements on days like today. I remember
    when I was young, growing up in Regina. here on the radio in the morning, I say
    things like exposed flash freezing less than 30 seconds. And they would say winchell
    is minus 100. they've sensory calibrated winch and we don't get numbers like that
    anymore. And no one would, if I depending on who I talked to they don't believe
    me when I say that. How many of you, believe me. Okay, so i've asked questions
    of people. Of the administration of the department head Dean, and the. floor about
    what's going to happen. With some of the issues so, for example. If if the labs
    in the library are going to be open for computer use if you're if you have one
    class in person stuff starting. Some of your classes start on February 7 in person
    and you're on campus can you. connect to your other classes on campus remotely.
    Can you connect remotely to your other classes. there's an art returning until
    March 1. Using resources at the university. So that was one question I asked,
    and the other one is about. So the flexibility between. Remote in face to face
    section. So I haven't heard back from them, but what i've done is. i've had some
    choice calls. well. they're not they're called choices in your courses, but there
    another way to say apple. So hear me. share my screen and then i'll show you done.
    Okay, so should be sharing now. So let me say first of all happy Thursday. I guess,
    we should maybe let's do our attendance first. see if this link works okay. Now,
    of course. It says there's more information or this error but likely there's not.
    it's my experience when it says. let's actually go and look for this air see if
    there's more information about it. Well, actually it's got a little bit of information.
    So just go. The meeting section and attendance there. Okay, so. Put. The password
    into the chat. Okay. This is gonna work. Okay, so this is our, these are the activities
    for today. So there's a few extra ones, so I have. These polls that are open.
    I believe from. Okay, so yeah i've done the iPhone or android one. From so maybe
    you've seen it. Already. started all of these at 8am. Availability so. The iPhone
    or android. is open from eight o'clock and then it's going to close at nine o'clock.
    So if you want to vote. Okay. Good that you've done them. But i'm not sure that
    everybody's done them. So they're all listed here. So I want to just comment on
    the fact that the return to in person, oh. there's two of them. So there i've
    done separate ones for the are in the F sections. And then I also have. A question
    when are you happy with your rf section. So i'm just. Okay um. So I know that
    seeing groups is difficult in your courses. and that's explained to me as a feature,
    not a bug. But I think it's still an open. Okay, so. This is set up as a hybrid
    class, and so there are two sections of the class one. The our section 01 are.
    Is. going to happen remotely. Whether or not. Or, regardless of when we return
    the in person learning. And the 01 F is the face to face section or mask the mask
    section. Then. When we return to face to face or in person learning. Then that
    section will be meeting in classroom 125. So the way things will go after we return
    to in person learning. Is. The people in the our section will. Be on zoom the
    people in the F section will be in the classroom and we'll have zoom running and
    we'll be doing. coordination. Between the classroom and the online. section between
    the classroom section and the online section. And will be lots of fun. yeah, so
    I would agree that our is remote an F is and. F is for face. face to face. It
    does. So why does that. explanation makes sense any further questions. Okay. So,
    like I said I haven't received any responses to my question so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And where are we able to see it I can't see it on my your courses i'm in the
    are, though, so I don't know.
  persid: S05
- desc: No, so this is. If you go to the calendar. yeah so they're listed under participation.
    that's that's where they occur. and In your courses, but. that's why I think this
    is kind of a neat. view here the calendar. For the day. And you select. Here,
    let me. what's that URL to in the chat. So. It says the view we're using the view
    module. Of calendar. To look at it, day by day and the time is a number of seconds.
    Since January 1 1970. The corresponds to today's date. And then the course ideas
    are the instance of our. Okay. So are those activities, this is duplicate says,
    I wanted them it's listed as duplicate. That return to in person. And I. So when
    you registered in the class you're been assigned to one of two groups. Based on
    the section you're registered in so. that's either 01 are for remote or zero and
    F. For the face to face. or the one the section that will need in. in person,
    when in person during resumes. So I restricted them. So you need to be in one
    of those two groups to do that choice. And so I can. seem to me the easiest way
    to let everybody. express their choice. But also easily identify who's in turn
    mode and who's in the in person section. Okay. So I thought at first you wouldn't
    see both of them in your student view but then after I set it up, I realized.
    That they appear. But you can't you can't access the one. For the Group. Which
    you're not a Member so you'll see both of them there, but only one of the reactions.
    In your view. So let me explain. about the question of whether you're happy with
    your section of to at. So. If you're in the remote section. Are you happy to remain
    remote for the whole for the rest of the Semester. Given our experience today,
    and then, if you're in the face to face section. Are you happy with. Coming back
    to campus. On February 7 of March 1. As a start date. So I was gonna say. I was
    talking about what this is a hybrid section so. Those distinctions are between
    the two sections are more rigid than if it were a high FLEX. As i've come to understand.
    I guess my mental model of the class was more like a high FLEX. So i'm. So in
    our information about. about this return to. face to face or in person learning.
    So the decision, the decisions will be locked in. By the end of this week by the
    end of tomorrow and then. There will be a week. If you if you're. So then, in
    general, students can make a choice with whether they want to remain in the class.
    or. have the option to drop it. drop a class they're not come. for which the arrangements,
    then. Are not to their liking anyway. So I don't want to make that. More. complicated
    than needs to be. and i'm just wondering about. classroom capacity and if. And
    if there might be some people who would rather remain revoked. who are in the
    face to face section.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I had a quick question.
  persid: S06
- desc: sure.
  persid: ???
- desc: So the timings for face to face and remote classes are will be the same correct
    from 830 to 939 4545 then hot if we go to face to face and how will the online
    class be conducted.
  persid: S06
- desc: Instead of conducted from a spare room in my house. Or that instead of me
    being. In the spare room in my house i'll be in front of the class in classroom
    125 and so we're running. Half the students will be. The people in the remote
    section will be. On zoom and the people on the face to face section. will be.
    In the classroom. So. there'll be a little bit of coordination. But we'll we'll
    make it work. Does that make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S06
- desc: So. send us is. provided a definition for hybrid and high FLEX. So i'm aware
    of the definition so. I guess. The question that I had for administration was.
    If if we're giving. people the opportunity to drop a class once the new arrangements
    for in person learning are established. With students have the same opportunity
    to can make a switch between. The our section and the F section so going from
    art effort from after are. They want to do that. So. The way things. That went
    that are you happy with your section rf. Is. not binding and i'm not sure that
    I can do anything about it but it's just a bit of information for me. i'm not
    i'm not suggesting that I have a special dispensation to. To do something that.
    It seems like I shouldn't be able to do I don't want to give you that impression.
    Am I making things more clear or more convoluted. Any questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um I have a question um can face to get in person people remain in remote
    learning.
  persid: S08
- desc: So. i'm exploring the possibility, whether that can be done informally or
    formally. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Formally.
  persid: S08
- desc: or.
  persid: DHH
- desc: informally, or do we have to register to yourself self service to do that.
    yeah.
  persid: S08
- desc: So i'm asking that question. So i'm not sure whether. i'm hoping that we can
    do that either informally or formally so by formally will be making a request.
    To make a change to your registration, through your self serve. And informally
    would be. Not using self serve but. making sure that we get to the. well. I don't
    want to say how how I could do it. Exactly I don't want to make a promise about
    that, but my hope is that, one way or the other, we be able to accommodate everybody.
    If that makes sense. Because. The integration was about students who aren't happy
    with the way the classes. Coming returning to in person learning. That seemed
    to be the case, where it was an in person class. and So there's either either
    attended in person, when in person resumes or you decided not to continue with
    the class. In our case, where there's where it's a hybrid class. It seems to me
    like there could be a little a little bit of flexibility for students who want
    to make changes and i'm trying to understand. If that's possible. Whether that
    can be done in the system or whether. can do something with the way that we've
    managed the class. ourselves so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir, if I could add something like I feel like a lot of us when we signed
    up for classes oma chrome wasn't really a thing, yet. yeah um and then it started
    spreading and and now we're going back to in person, but then regional public
    schools is closing. Everything and they're moving everything online, and so, how
    long is it until the university decides all Alma crumbs too serious we're going
    to move back online again. that's that's kind of my concern.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah. Well, I don't have a crystal ball. Some Regina public, I think. is going
    on the high schools are going online for the week before finals. So I don't know
    that there. that's my understanding of it anyway. So certainly they'll concerns.
    I would say. So. So i'm just looking through the chat. So the first comment about
    putting a camera for me well i'm putting a camera in front of me now but i'm.
    i'm sitting at a table. With my face very close to my laptop now it's closer I
    feel like that's a sesame street thing. And I was thinking of sesame street thing
    close. near far anyway. Sorry for. That D side by. Side track. Because I thought
    sesame street because you were talking about elmo and sorry last day.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Excuse me, Sir, do you choose. So, so you do choose to be in person or in
    class. Do you have a choice, or do we.
  persid: S09
- desc: OK, so the way it's going to happen.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry.
  persid: S09
- desc: Is.
  persid: ???
- desc: sore. The plan is for everybody, everything to be back on in person. Everything
    that was designated is in person. When you registered for the classes. is going.
    To be in classrooms at the university starting march 1 so the beginning of starting
    the beginning of March, which is a Tuesday so we're meeting on march 1.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh good Thank you mark.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay, so if you've registered for the remote section. Not nothing changes.
    If you're in the face to face section. Then, the decision is over, the question
    is, would you prefer starting on February seven or March 1. And I understand.
    We may not have peaked. we're behind Ontario and their own tears talking about
    their Alma cron wave peaking. By the end of this month, so we're probably a little
    bit behind that. But I don't know. i'm not involved in that decision process the
    university so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S09
- desc: So. I guess we'll just say, is, I just wanted to explain the different. polls
    that I had on your courses this morning. So. I want to address your concerns.
    and Make sure that we have the best experience possible in the class. for everybody.
    Just one second. just a minute, please and. About that so. This is a code related
    story about. vehicle maintenance because. there's a couple weeks ago where I arranged
    to have my car taken in for some warranty work. And they said, well, we. It was
    a week before they could look at it and then last three to call it, and said it'll
    be another week before they can look at it again because staff shortages so. it's
    about today or Thursday and I said teaching. So we left the key in the mailbox.
    And in the time it was in saying in the mailbox it got so cold that the car wouldn't
    start. But situation resolved. anyway. Okay, so then attendance went over the.
    Activities so. let's see we have. 83 students in the zoom room. At present. So
    I believe we have 111 active so in the class. So if you know people who aren't
    online. During our discussion here, let them know about the opportunity until
    noon to provide some. impact. feedback. To the decision about where we're going
    we're going to manage. The in person section of. Our class. Okay, so. iPhone or
    android poll is closed now so let's go to that and. Oh don't even have to open
    it. So we have 39 plus 31. Excuse me. 70 responses which is pretty good. Then
    they're fairly equally split. So the question from the video. was not well, there
    are a few questions, but maybe this one. was about. me the decision making process,
    I guess. So it's, not to say that i've. The position never was his iPhone better
    or worse than an android phone. phone running the android operating system. But
    how do we decide. So we. damon or which talks about crowdsourcing decisions well
    that's how it started was this warm up question. So how do we make more. Complicated
    decisions. I guess. Like whether we should. Whether we should. Look at the data
    on somebody's phone. or. leave them alone and that. depends on. The reason why
    I want to collect the data. Is it because we want to make sure that. The person
    is not a security threat. it's not doing something. Bad with his phone. Do you
    want to make sure that. Things are as convenient as possible. For the person.
    So. We do. Look at the data and we make. judgments about what they'd like to see
    next and. and so on. or in that example. We started talking about the other day.
    Is it. Do we want to collect data. Because of. We want to better understand. The
    progression of the coven. covariance and during the pandemic. amen you have a
    quick, you know your hand up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor.
  persid: ???
- desc: Could we.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe talk about what the project is going to be seeing it's 25% just seems
    kinda kind of creepy that it is looming there and we don't know what it's about
    could you offer. insight into that.
  persid: S04
- desc: So. we'll talk about all the assignments, and the project on Tuesday okay.
    I will have everything laid out for Tuesday and we'll talk about it and answer
    all your questions okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S04
- desc: Thank. Thank you for that reminder to mention that. I think they say the same
    thing. Let me go and. And 20 5075 100 now. That might be last offering syllabus
    that says 35 did you have a question or comment again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I know sorry I just forgot to take my head.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Fair enough. So I put a note on the syllabus I uploaded here here's the file
    that I uploaded last day and I added that the syllabus link above also works so.
    let's check that out. Okay, the exam dates right. Now so. Okay. um. I didn't even
    realize that was a direct message. So, again i'd asked. To avoid sending me direct
    messages. Because, then it puts me in mode to respond to you directly, instead
    of. Reading into the chat. Okay, so. Then. So I guess i'ma. Talk about the responses
    for a minute or the mechanism to do responses so. it's it's online text so. don't
    hit a return. In the middle of your response because that'll close it. So I wasn't
    sure then some students asked me to reopen it or allow them to. To re enter their
    response, so I found that I could delete. an incomplete response. So maybe the
    the way to do it is. let's look at what options, I have. let's try response. To
    today's meeting. Okay, so it says to login. name but i'm not sharing that information.
    So I. I was hoping there's gonna be something about editing. But that doesn't
    appear to be if I allow multiple submissions. that's going. to throw a wrench
    into my. Accounting of. who's writing them and so on. So I would say if you're
    doing a response. and You encounter problems. doesn't get recorded properly. You
    can ask me to do to delete what you have. And then you can. resubmit. Another
    version. Does that make sense. So I I tried that with one student last day and
    it worked and. I apologize that there might be a few there were probably a few
    more students who. sent me the same kind of request and. I didn't see them all
    until. After the fact.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Their response to the meetings is just based is marked based off of whether
    or not you complete it right.
  persid: S10
- desc: Yes, so I would.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, Professor for last class I wasn't able to access the section that had
    the. responses to the messages. Selling keeps changing in the in the layout i'm
    not sure what but, like a bunch of stuff keeps glitch and out like that, like
    the attendance, I believe, last time as well.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah so I have to investigate that problem because it started when I mistakenly
    activate a second attendance activity. So it seems like, then the number. The
    idea for the attendance has changed, so I have to update my. strange. that's that's
    the only. Only scripture that I had only adjective that I have for to behavior.
    So that's the attendance. Changing. So I am dead well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: professors today's is today's topic Cobra effect on computing is that is that
    right here.
  persid: S04
- desc: Well, it was about. I didn't think we were going to talk the whole. Well it's.
    I thought, our course administration stuff was going to not take so long. or course
    administration discussion. So. So I had. Put a theme for today of social media.
    Thinking about our experience with the whiteboard on Tuesday. For example, and.
    Some other examples.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry, I didn't quite catch your answer, there is there a response to the
    meetings just mark purely based off of whether or not you complete it.
  persid: S10
- desc: So. Yes. with one exception, if you just. write. A couple words that aren't.
    related to the meeting. I I would. So i'm recording to marks for each response.
    So if you do something, reasonable and your response. That you get the two marks.
    And if you write something that's not reasonable, I mean it's just. doesn't fit.
    it's just something to say you've done it. Then. i'll give one mark for that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So it makes sense.
  persid: ???
- desc: So if you do it you'll get some marks. But if you do it. In the spirit, it
    was intended, then you get two marks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That makes sense, thank you. you're welcome.
  persid: S10
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. I break up question, the other day, I think, from last Thursday about.
    computing and. and climate change so. I guess some comments i'd like to make about
    that. Some comments i'd like to make them all that are that I was not trying to.
    Not searching for particular answers. I was trying to promote discussion about
    these issues. And I wasn't. necessarily suggesting that there was. causal links
    between computing and climate change. or computing and coven. I found it interesting
    that some people are. The way. The questions been parsed. Maybe. Thinking about.
    Trying trying to figure out what was the right answer that I was looking for.
    So. This the spirit in which I posed the question was. Looking at the scope of
    computing in the world. So do computer scientists have. An opportunity to contribute.
    To a pandemic response. Are there ways to help. Ensure that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We.
  persid: ???
- desc: We have as few more deaths as possible. as possible from the pandemic. And
    then, in terms of climate change. I wasn't thinking about. Whether computing is
    causing climate change. The manufacturer chips or. Other things like that. You
    know, but is there a way that we can provide maybe deal with providing actionable
    information to the citizens. So they can. They can understand the impact of their
    choices. and Transparency around the processes by which are making decisions.
    So it's, not to say that computing. doesn't have. A footprint. That needs to be.
    considered more thoughtfully. I think, because. You know, for example, blockchain
    technology is. Being is being hailed as a great thing, and it has some benefits.
    But the proof of work. idea is really making blockchain. deployments. Big consumers
    of energy. So we can't. So I thinking back.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And remember.
  persid: ???
- desc: Professor there's a theorem switching the proof of stake, which is a lot better
    for the environment. doesn't yeah mers much processing power.
  persid: S04
- desc: Electricity yeah I was gonna say and there's. The proof of stake. Is an idea.
    So. So that's a good point, thank you, if you have a link to that that's. That
    story. or. happy if you would share that. I was just using an example, I mean.
    We can't stop doing everything. But the first step is mood to be mindful and.
    Considering the impacts. Of what we're doing. The impact of what we're doing.
    The impacts on the environment and. And the larger. Larger. Thank you for a few
    adjectives. mean So what we do isn't. doesn't, it is not without consequences,
    so we just want to be aware of the consequences and. Here is a term we want to
    be as. equally effective as possible. supposed. Efficient. All give you a reference
    for that. After afterwards. Okay. So there was a question last day about participation,
    so what I propose to do for participation. Is. to collect some data. about your
    comments. In zoom. So that's and to help me do that that's why i've asked i've
    asked you to do to name yourself, so that your your Regina email ID is part of
    your name, so I i'm not sharing out to anybody. But it helps me keep track of.
    Your engagement. Within the zoom meetings so that's one thing attendance is another
    thing. The wiki is another thing. And I. am probably going to miss one or two.
    If i'm just going to name them off like that, but what I propose to do is to take.
    Some data from your courses or from other sources. Like. i'm keeping track of
    the zoom stuff myself. In so. get a. An indication of the. People who are most
    active. So get a number for each of these different areas of participation. And
    then i'll drop. The lowest one. and come up with a number. So you don't have to
    be active and all them. To get a very good score for participation. So we can.
    discuss that again on Tuesday or online. And we're two minutes short of our. End
    of meeting today. So is that. A good place to stop so I listed a few things for
    you to look at so there's a couple of videos. So two videos by the same. person
    eli palette para SER. looks like he's wearing the same shirt and both. that's
    coincidental. And then i'm asking you to look at the first chapter and that blown
    to bits book it's online. let's see we bring up. So each chapter has different
    manner, so it goes from. cl. So i'll put that link and. into the meeting. I just.
    Have a chapter indicated, but i'll give you the link to the PDF as well. Anyway,
    thank you for today. Take care stay well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Excuse me, sir.
  persid: S11
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So sorry about the. The chapter like it's kinda like 20 pages, would you want
    us to read the entire chapter or like. A part of it.
  persid: S11
- desc: i'll ask you, you can look at the whole thing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have a good weekend hope you get your car back soon.
  persid: S12
- desc: or in me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That have a good weekend hope you get your car back soon.
  persid: S12
- desc: Oh, thank you very much. thanks you too. i'm going to post, the link to the
    chapter rate. i'm going to make the text clickable. In a in a few seconds here
    once I get this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: See.
  persid: ???
- desc: Do it. From a local copy. Yes. Yes, Chapter one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S13

  persid: S12
- desc: ur self service
  persid: S08
- desc: thank you, ill go look
  persid: S12
- desc: Shows on UR Self-Serve when you registered for the class
  persid: S13
- desc: Is R hybrid?
  persid: S27
- desc: perfect, found it thanks peeps!
  persid: S12
- desc: Can you quickly define R and F?
  persid: S28

  persid: S08

- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S28
- desc: Thanks
  persid: S28

  persid: S08

  persid: S30
- desc: under participation
  persid: S31
- desc: so we don't need to answer for "Return to In-Person" if we have registered
    remote ?

  persid: DHH
- desc: you can see in choices also
  persid: S33
- desc: in activites
  persid: S33
- desc: Why are those activities listed as duplicates?
  persid: S13
- desc: Okay that makes sense to me
  persid: S13
- desc: Hybrid means people have to stick to their section and be exclusively remote
    or in-person. Hyflex means people can switch between remote or in-person throughout
    the semester.
  persid: S22
- desc: can in person people remain in remote learning?
  persid: S08
- desc: "so they put an camera in front of you?\U0001F600"
  persid: S34

    attend both in a sense?
  persid: S35
- desc: "If you wanted to formally, would a poll online on Mondays and Wednesdays\
    \ if they\u2019re coming to class."
  persid: S05
- desc: because the class in remote is full in urselfservice, so I was wondering if
    we can do it informally
  persid: S08
- desc: depends how many people get covid after classes open up again lol
  persid: S36
- desc: I'm more worried about paying for a parking pass to have it wasted
  persid: S37
- desc: 'true'
