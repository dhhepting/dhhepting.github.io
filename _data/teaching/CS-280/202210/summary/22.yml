- desc: Good morning. Anyone notice the aurora borealis last night. What else. Our
    page here. Okay, so let's do our attendance. cynicism here today. So. If there's
    something going on in the chat. For me. So. This link to the document that I was.
    referencing yesterday. Look at I think there's some interesting. well. So maybe
    i'll just do a little dramatic reading from started Chapter two here. So anything,
    it may not be that dramatic but i'll try. So in 2006. I walked into my first computer
    science class at Simon fraser university, that was a few months before Steve Jobs
    announced the first iPhone. But my my classmates and, soon to be friends belief
    that digital robot technology is going to change the world and for the better,
    because already sacred. notions of boundless progress right on by the lakes unless
    hackers coders mostly young and middle class men with passions for computing filled
    our thoughts and conversations on problematically, that is, they ran questions
    and taking for granted. I felt destined for the road lifestyle.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: Of the tech entrepreneur who finds not only wealth and prestige to code, but
    a deep sense of purpose of fulfillment. solution that with a technocratic dogma
    said and slowly over the years of my undergrad degree. The more I learned about
    computer science, the less I was ready to leave it was truly capable of solving
    the world's problems charging for graduating job placement for a dolphin life
    with software mega corp. For the pill some of the Silicon Valley veneer off my
    earlier fantasies of certain texts access and the allure of coding is a dream
    job be traded stuff for a bait and switch scheme on my second job as a developer,
    in the summer of 2014 this time for a rapidly growing startup. That summer I clocked
    a lot of unpaid over time. Which this company CEO indirectly justified by insisting
    that the online shopping experiences we were creating were actually a gift to
    humanity. But unpaid Labor was a Labor of love he argued by implication, we should
    be proud of the 510 sometimes even 20 extra hours you devoted each week to the
    happiness of online consumers. And i'll just read the last paragraph here from
    introduction that second chapter, it was no accident, I became and chatted with
    tech seemingly overnight and that event of years to break free of its spell in
    the study of how computer science students become computer scientists. samantha
    ressler and found that CS Education represents reality in ways and enable it to
    be managed and manipulated by computation, in other words. But those are skills
    and knowledge of computation CS education and her words initiate students into
    a Community endowed with the mystical power of programming computer science abstraction.
    turning them into computer programmers and scientists that often understand themselves
    as with his wizards proficient in the power of magic the power and magic reprogramming.
    And this starts the moment they walk into a classroom access yes class. Future
    as an audio book. Okay, so. i'm curious. Oh, that description. fits with your
    experiences. One thing I want to mention before I forget that to 30 Today is the
    last in the. LGBT Q to s. Plus. In stem seminar series so. Okay. So we have one
    vote for. using computers to solve problems. that's a powerful. motivator motivated
    yes. Well i'm paraphrasing a little bit here but. So the idea that we can use
    computers to solve problems. can be a powerful motivator for. The fact that we
    should. Consider. Our unpaid over time. As a gift to humanity, so people can.
    shop online or do something else online that. They were perfectly happy not doing
    before. This may be a stretch. So my feeling is. That maybe maybe things aren't
    quite as. For people who become a bit jaded perhaps I you tell me. So, before
    I came back to China, I worked for a startup for a year and beth. And that was
    that was 2000. And we have a office downtown. I did my PhD at Simon fraser and.
    This company had an office downtown. downtown Vancouver. I want to say how that's
    not that's right. And then we move to a. Different place which was on. Say that.
    I can picture the place. That was very much the time when. People were doing initial
    public offerings and. Getting. stock options and so on, so. I would say it was
    less than senses.
  persid: DHH
- desc: doing the.
  persid: ???
- desc: writing a gift to humanity. Doing I like shopping but. The idea that. This
    is a exciting. Time to be involved in technology.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: May, maybe. It was worth. The risk of. Putting in the extra time get some.
    Big rewards. unpaid Labor.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It was.
  persid: ???
- desc: The possibility of personal rewards and doing something that was going to
    be. very, very big. anyone else, like to. make a comment to vote. studied computer
    science. So remember from the beginning of the semester we did I gave you. there's
    a code star video. From code org. and So the guy behind co.org. was a background
    and Microsoft had he partovi. He said, you know whether you want to make a lot
    of money or changed change the world baby I think that's the emphasis he had first
    was. First, was the mind. Respect mossville. So there. there's that aspect to
    it, then another woman, I don't remember her name. So she understood that software
    is about helping people. Yes. I like to actually program being able to do something
    and then see an outcome, and like see if something works like I like the feeling
    of accomplishment into that more than I had coming into the university like oh.
    I just liked the actual part of the work. Any comments on zoom. Creative aspects.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A good.
  persid: ???
- desc: writer.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For me, I was in a different field as well and that field like if you don't
    pursue higher education, you will not be able to get a like a decent job or like.
    A good paint job, while in computer science if I get the degree and I get like
    an internship, and so I can work like it wherever I want easily. Like, even if
    I have like basic knowledge or not a lot of experiences, I can still get jobs
    in computer science also like non computer science there's so many mega huge plenty
    of jobs that are on demand. and also the flexibility, like, for example, if i'm
    in saskatchewan I can actually get a job in USA and i'll still be like sitting
    in my room and doing my job. Without any issues, why like on different fields,
    for example, bio chemistry chemistry, you have to be in life, you have to relocate,
    you have to go. To a different location one computer science there's no suggesting
    like that. and computer science is pretty good for people who likes to work like
    individually or even sometimes there's fields in computer science that you've
    been on. Both as a team, but they still kind of contribute both like you can work
    in it, individually or in a group and you study be happy with it.
  persid: S02
- desc: So those are maybe. more pragmatic reasons. Studying computer science, but
    there's certainly important as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I find that when I joined the computer science department that I found that
    I enjoyed. Like a i'm perfectly fine sitting there for hours typing away a code
    that doesn't work, but the accomplishment at the end of a code that finally works,
    the way that I wanted it to seems to bring quite a large amount of joy to me.
  persid: S03
- desc: So I realize i'm out of camera range here but i'll take a picture so i'm writing
    joy. And then in parentheses beauty enjoy computing. So that's the name of. Advanced
    placement computer science course from Berkeley. Maybe. source for joy is having
    elegant solutions. problems. So one large example that comes to mind this the
    unicode system. Video. So. ascii with which you're. familiar in computer systems.
    Is. Great for North American English. And it does a lot with seven bets doesn't
    even use the bets. So. So seven bids gives us to to the 720 characters. But the
    world is more than North American English. So. There are different standards.
    different ways to use an 820 characters. To character so. We can use a computer.
    Well, we have to know which standard we're using so that we don't. end up the
    strange characters when we. have new state aid that through one set of characters
    but the computer thanks for using the different one. And then we get shapes like.
    that's one that pops up, but there are lots of other ones I p. So unicode. In
    30 is 32 bits. using all the 32 that's represented here. So there are ways to
    encode the four bit four Bytes of unicode into. more compact forms. So you can
    have a this Nice and that's a very popular. way of representing text her web pages
    because. If we're using North American English characters. We can keep using ask.
    For need more characters like. Back solving. Car vous francais. Then we can use
    two bites to do that. And so you CAFE. let's represent. unicode characters in
    one to four Bytes. So we can save a lot, and we can. Make use of. That. extend
    that. Anyway, so seems like. A very nice to me. Okay. Any other comments about.
    about the opportunities for the. importance of computer science and society today.
    fleeting. responsibilities that we have is computer science or or computer professionals.
    zeoli responsibility to. Create elegant solutions. Can people see the whiteboard.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay. Any thoughts about responsibilities. Great. harm. The credit goes for
    doctors medical doctors. last day of March. April 1. So. Any plans for practical
    jokes yes. need to do before noon, I think that's. Right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: About. Well, we didn't talk about doctrine discovery searches using that as
    an entry. programming languages, talking about this. Is. programming. And happens
    in lots of other areas doesn't it's not just specific to computer science. My
    train of thought kind of jumped the tracks here sorry. So i'm just. Intellectual
    property. So. Dealing with. Think about. The solutions that come from Ai approaches.
    They going to be. Are they going to be protected and who and who's protection,
    who would benefit that protection would be the programmers who wrote the API I
    mean would it be the API. itself self. assigned to. Someone. Let me, maybe need
    to revisit the way we think about intellectual property in terms of writing. In
    terms of algorithms and so forth. So just a little bit. So, leaving aside my tangent
    this one I have on the board does that make sense. Questions or comments. Okay.
    Why don't we. Stop that there oh. Oh welcome some online discussion, if there
    is any. So I set up. Your course for you to. rate your group members ranking.
    So you can give me some feedback about. Your group work. And if everybody can
    contribute equally, then I would encourage you to express that to me. Otherwise
    it's difficult to. match. tried to clarify some questions. First me to the discussion
    forum last night. So, was that post helpful. If you have questions that remain
    after looking at that post. You can let me know. I would encourage you to reply
    to the post, so that we can keep that discussion in one place. Some marks. i'm
    not sure. If that's visible to you, yet, but i'll hope to get the rest of them
    done today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So for the expiration heading. Where we just supposed to be describing the
    general like what each part of the web page covers so, for example, the people
    section covers the various professors, that you have are kind of thing. Or what
    what are you looking for, specifically with that.
  persid: S05
- desc: So. The kind i'm thinking for the kind of content that you find under that
    mean like. So under the whole. confined. General informational department, maybe
    that's an. overstatement or simplification, but. What are the kinds of things
    to find organized under that. mean like. For each of those main ranks that I didn't
    make it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: So example about people. Is it helpful to Greg inbound the way the scrolling
    down. as well. that's not a standard way to do it. So I tell you for thinking
    what explorations one of the things you find under the name like and then. Content
    testing is about. You as. A student who's taking a computer science class at least.
    Even if you're not a computer science major. You have a. vested interest in. Finding
    and using the website so. What are the kinds of questions you have that you'd
    like to have answered by. One of the questions you can ask. And then the observations.
    The related to the things to find. My way to find. Some inspiration on my professional
    people. Give me what I want to find. So, then, the observations leads recommendations.
    You can say. It might be better if things around or something like that does that
    make sense. That makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think so.
  persid: S05
- desc: Sir sorry.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, so when my group and I were discussing of all the. assessment, like the
    website assessment we were kind of confused about. what to expect from the research
    and the graduate students, because we are undergrad and we don't really have that
    much idea about the research and the and the graduate so we don't know what to
    expect So how should we look into those websites.
  persid: S06
- desc: gen con now okay. So as an undergraduate student, you might. Know it's i'm
    not saying this is the right answer, but you might be curious about. What kind
    what what is research what kinds of research are done in the department. What
    does it mean to be a graduate student. Compared to an undergraduate student. See
    you might. As undergraduate students be looking for some. Some introduction to
    graduate studies. That make sense. So i'm not saying that there's no right or
    wrong questions to ask. Because your. computer science, either in justice one
    class or it's a few little study. The questions you have. Are there any questions
    for you. That make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah that does Thank you, Sir.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So just for one minute late here I realized just one comment about the final
    exam. So. If we wanted to do a time Chris on your courses, we would need to have
    everyone agree. The face to face section to do that. And I know. When to deal
    with that. hurdle. So the exam will be take home. period, and then we can talk
    about details about that next week. I hope that's good news. Again, like I said.
    That exam is an. Evaluation of our. Discussion discussions and our. explorations
    of semester. i'm not trying to. do anything nefarious just. stopped. Excuse me,
    getting stuck in my mouth. Thank you very much.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hello, Professor. Yes, oh so I was here the whole time but I couldn't get
    the attendance Kenny, and now it's closed Kenny opening for me.
  persid: S07
- desc: Sure, oh. So much another 15 minutes so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Much.
  persid: S07
- desc: Thank you very much thank you you're welcome take care, have a great day,
    see you. See you have an April. don't be too hard on people tomorrow thanks. Take
    care.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Excuse me, Professor. exam is 25% right.
  persid: S08
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But we need to pass the exam in order to pass the course. Yes, okay okay.
  persid: S08
- desc: So. let's just to make sure that you. To encourage you to take it seriously.
    i'm not trying to fail anybody in class. With that rule but just to make sure
    that. You say well. Are you got. A 70% based on the 7075 marks that are allocated
    before the exam. So i'm not gonna do anything for the final. You Sir see my perspective.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I got it.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay, so it's not I don't mean. To be a cause for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: concern.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, thank you.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay you're welcome. Okay. Students are coming in, for the next class so i'll
    say goodbye. And i'll be back in my office hours later today. Okay, thanks again
    bye.
