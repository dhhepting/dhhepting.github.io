Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Okay well. I think i've got through my checklist here. today. Oh.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's good.
  persid: ???
- desc: So the Canadian side won the game on Sunday, so now they officially going
    to the World Cup. And we'll see how they do their. bit of good news. The Oscars
    and Sunday night. yeah so that was my second question. see it live, did you hear
    about it. Did you hear about it. So. One thing in here, I think, is krista coming.
    Chris rock also was. Things that came up. discussion. So. what's the benefit.
    of our social media connections. In this case. transparency. So I said, maybe
    transparency, transparency is easier to provide or achieve because of the easy
    access to the rafi from the event. yeah. wasn't stage, because this is. This is
    a no publicity is bad publicity. And certainly people are talking about the Oscars
    more more than they may have been otherwise. So there's. A link to it but. there's
    a comment by the associate. counsel for the N double a CP in the States and made
    a comment about. The impacts of the violence. shown live on international television.
    And and kind of normalized or. yeah normalized. will have far reaching impact,
    so we won't be yet begin to understand. So I think there's some deeper issues
    here, other than just. Who is in the right or wrong. backup reminder. anyway.
    So I might ask if. Our social media. and other computer based communication technologies,
    provided provide us more tools to have. Better conversations and better. and better
    conversations about these important issues. So there's Twitter. 140 characters
    are guess now it's 280 characters. Meaningful conversations about. Important issues.
    These technologies. social media help us get. Under here more, but under represented.
    sessions and voices on issues.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: Our social media good at. singling out. or focusing on. important comments,
    so that they can.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't think so usually.
  persid: ???
- desc: On time but usually just the most.
  persid: DHH
- desc: what's the word.
  persid: ???
- desc: charged topics, the most reactive or. Once they get the people talk about.
    Controversial yes it's not necessarily the most important. it's the one that people
    argue. and talk about both not the. best. or most. So I said I found the comment
    from the Council of the naacp the one I mentioned about the violence and impacts
    of. It. be understood, for a long time. So I read that in the CBC news story.
    So, on the one hand, we have. All the people making comments about the issue.
    And then journalists have a role to curate. This presentation that discussion.
    Because i'm not sure that I would have found that comment, otherwise I try to
    avoid going to Twitter directly. I think this is a good example of how Curry operation
    can be used productively to. highlights people's opinions and how they are viewing
    it. So. sources have. are just. Repeating things. They encounter but they're applying
    judgment and analysis to the pieces they include. tweets and new stories they're
    all nicely formatted because. that's part of twitter's branding to make sure that.
    You know it's three Twitter. Any.
  persid: DHH
- desc: tweets from people who.
  persid: ???
- desc: You don't know all but they are or.
  persid: DHH
- desc: two.comments of people there's no.
  persid: ???
- desc: Chapter forever they're saying. depends on which do scientists do this because
    the CDC and I. trust them usually an idea, please say that the example of just.
    Using people's reactions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'd like a story or.
  persid: ???
- desc: More information yeah yeah. Okay, show me that we can use sources in different
    ways. say something is popular because it has a lot of retreats or comments or
    likes or. understanding that those aren't necessarily. Very good metrics to us.
    Because there aren't any. controls that we have on those kinds of. things about
    the mechanisms that we can use to collect them. So that made me think of also
    on Sunday night they had these. User polls, were the top five most. Popular movies,
    according to fans and they are voted online, and so they didn't have. Those controls.
    Now right. This is example I use my wife and she. She wasn't so sure about it
    so i'll lay it out for you and see whether. see what whether it's. So often. The
    Canadian Football League they have. The websites around the rough riders they
    have Poles. For who are the best players are some some things like that and usually.
    The saskatchewan. player gets the most votes. Regardless of what the question
    is. it's going to come out the people working in the polar couldn't take the rough
    riders answer so that's the local professional sports team in the province. In
    the city and. So. The guys, regardless of what the reality is the polls are going
    to say one thing. And so, regardless of what the reality is when you're talking
    about. Where the most part of the movies. it's going to depend on who's answering
    the call. Now is that. That circuitous journey and up, and the reason in a meaningful
    place. You get my point I was trying to wait. Okay, one person got my point. Is
    is that a general issue with any sort of statistics, like if you put a spotlight
    all. The people who are going to get the for all always from eastern people like.
    people to vote on a. 40% of the people go to work first websites, people who have
    you know you're always. that's a problem with any type of statistics, you have
    to be. Careful with who's taken yeah so when you put things online. we're not
    actively. Choosing the sample of people. yeah just. For. tweets for people who.
    don't think it should be encouraged, even by popular Germans. Please let me see,
    let me see if this is the author of these are now that makes the source high in.
    It does not make it relatable enough or the patients who. make their image being
    somewhat of a particular CBS NBC endorsing. The information that information it,
    it may have all about. So. Yes. The empty bullet point here. I made a comment.
    Right. I didn't format it properly said knock on whatever resolve my computer
    problems so. On Thursday. You saw me having. Some problems i've had problems with
    the past few days, so I upgraded to MAC os 12.3 from 11 point something. and In
    the process, I broke my website. But I think i've. worked at all the problems
    now. So. The things that. I will. Get marks posted today. That I promised on Thursday.
    Like comment about. Using the general feedback that I posted before you resubmit
    it the project proposal. still holds. Now, in terms of writing up the Web assessment.
    I don't know what else. Are there any particular questions about that. So try.
    thing I wanted to highlight in the news I supposed to do attendance. or I forget.
    Opinion piece. On CBC website this morning or last night. Talking about. delegation
    visiting the Pope and talking about. are seeking an apology from. The Church about
    in relation to residential schools in Canada. So creeping in here is about sprouting
    the doctrine of discovery. Which is a. was used to say that people colonizing
    North America. And Africa can have to. respect. The people who are already living
    here. So, how does that relate to computer science so. The master's. thesis. And
    a masters of arts thesis. Learning computer science was hard and learning computer
    science is harder. So in the. In the abstract for for that document and i'll adjust
    this to. include the link I just. didn't get it sorted out in time. They. So,
    in order to succeed, is it in a computer science, education and computer science
    Students must learn how to translate reality, the code algorithms and other computational
    practices. That seem reasonable it's a saying you can agree with. So the rest
    of the abstract. samantha breslin refers to these processes and practices as rendering
    technical a term which also encompasses all computational processes and practices
    shape. Reality material perceptual ways technical renderings create computation
    of worlds that enabled computer scientists and CS students to frame the world
    in terms of problems and solutions that are computation solvable. Or, this is
    only possible by reducing our reading the social, cultural, political, economic
    and historical aspects in reality. And one CS students learn how to render technical
    to becomes very difficult to think in ways that are the full complexity of reality.
    ethnography. Inside of my experience in learning to take around the boundaries
    constructed by processes of rendering technical my narrative revolves around the
    work shop political intervention I organized and facilitate. With friends and
    colleagues in tech to begin a conversation with the social, political challenges
    facing us as technologists. The workshop with Stephen my jury to from non critical
    CS students to computer programmer and computing computer programming educator.
    becoming increasingly skeptical of Silicon Valley dog went to graduate student
    wishing to commit and contribute to the difficult anonymous and work of undoing
    the social hierarchy and the interlocking oppressions produced by the relations
    of settler colonialism. That descriptions of the path, I have walked and of my
    experiences. Trying to invite other technologies to learn family to be to my learning
    can offer insights for academic and activists educators interested in education
    for social change. So we are rendered technical. it's just a matter of how do
    we go about doing things. How questions, instead of why questions. Talk about
    divide and conquer approach to solving the problem. Is that. neutral language.
    If we think about our phrasing that kind of. That kind of approach. So is there
    a. particular perspective. But is. This a divide and conquer approach is that
    a neutral. praising the idea. or. Does it come from. A particular. As a result
    from particular way of viewing things particular history that we've. gone through.
    And we've all gone through maybe we have different perspectives on that we have
    always been on the. On the more. On the side with more positive outcomes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It seems like a pretty true praised me validates.
  persid: ???
- desc: Even if it doesn't serve something else it's a general statement say two.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Things one time focus on one thing first.
  persid: ???
- desc: Full. Okay. So we found some people who said I really have a problem with.
    That language. Someone has a problem with this language. CS is not for you. So
    there's two parts, their. computer science is not for you. And I don't understand
    your perspective computer science is not for you, but I understand your perspective.
    Okay, so. that's. that's a reasonable comment, why should we change. To peace
    2% of the population. might be 2% but it might also be 20%. So i'm not sure how
    much. I guess the question is if there's one person who. might like to study computer
    science, but doesn't find it. Welcoming for them is that. Is that a person is
    that person's perspective, not to be wandering could be. A million people if if
    we're excluding a piece of the population. Is it in. Are we serving that discipline
    of computer science, or are we just serving the discipline. And so the other,
    the comment of a 98% so well with the 98%. Really suffer. Are we doing things
    to. make them uncomfortable. By including the 2%. So I mean I appreciate perspective
    that. That, I think, maybe the way the way the comments frame. It maybe that's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This.Is an official.
  persid: ???
- desc: I guess i'm just saying. That maybe. Change is difficult or changing perspective
    is difficult. But there might be more opportunities. that come with a change that
    would. The word seeing beforehand. So i'd rather try and look at the glass is
    half full, instead of half empty, so to speak. Not thinking about computer science
    as a discipline or. Do we have to maintain the status quo or. bar honor traditions.
    Free look at. The problems that we have in world. And we say that maybe. can think
    of an example of open source software, you know, they say, the more people involved
    in. Working on the problem, the. more quickly they'll become will find a solution.
    And that's just not for open source stuff and in many places cases where we like
    to get as many people working on a problem as possible. So if we think that people
    with different perspectives than ours. My lead us to a solution to the big problems
    that we have. Just from a selfish point of view. wouldn't it be nice to engage
    as many different ideas as possible so that we come to a solution to the problems.
    Alright, so another comment and chat. So we can fix this by saying divide and
    solve instead of divide and conquer. So that reminds me of the phrase. This property
    to kill to kill two birds with one stone. And then that there was an effort to
    change that into say free two birds with one seed. So we can rephrase. The ideas.
    And then, where do we draw the line and word what is reasonable to trigger someone's.
    So, again. So that gives us back to our first topic of discussion. Well, what
    can a comedian say that's not going to get slapped in front of. A worldwide audience.
    And still. Not. And still add value to the conversation about it. So can soft
    I know who said. Okay. Keegan. Anyway, the hand up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah, so it is kicking in, in my opinion, I don't think a comedian should
    ever be smacked in it publicly in front of the world visits the comedian's job
    to play on these lines, no matter like. I think there's been far worse said jokes
    by comedians that hasn't resulted in this, but there's like it's the job of the
    comedian to to entertain people and whether the joke was too far, not should not
    result in in the way it did.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah so and then let economy is it's not about. me interviewing somebody.
    Someone thought it was okay to resort to violence.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Exactly.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah so.
  persid: S02
- desc: So we can be responsible for other people thinking do. I guess, we can think
    about. Oh well, we can do offer songs that promotes the values you'd like to see
    in the world. So sometimes tough conversations need to be had. Sometimes bad jokes
    need to be told I guess. So you can see how. Going on live there, sorry. cheat.
    yeah thanks Keegan and corey. So we're almost at a time here so. i'll post some
    more information there and we can have it will take up this discussion again on
    Thursday and we'll. Talk about the final exam on Thursday as well. get some information
    and. we'll go from there okay. anything to wrap up anything. communicate before
    we go for the day.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor Would I be able to talk to you after class a couple things that
    I asked you.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah so i'll stick around in the zoom as a sticker talk to me right away,
    after class, then I have office hours 10 to noon. To three to 330. as well, so
    you can find me on zoom then. Okay, thanks, very much for today. Welcome
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have a good one.
  persid: S04
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so now it's time class questions. While we're still here, otherwise
    come and see me and then. After I get my coffee for the morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep so Professor just wanted to talk about my absence, last week I didn't
    attend the class either on Tuesday or Thursday, they also didn't do the meeting
    response I got coven.
  persid: S03
- desc: And i've just made here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that the whole week and I just got better just recently this this weekend.
  persid: S03
- desc: that's good to hear so you're not. Not suffering any long term effects it
    there, you know of yet.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Not that I know, though. My breathing has gotten kind of. Like i'd say restrict
    like I haven't I haven't gone for a run or anything like that, but. Like i've
    been kind of short of breath more than usual. So hopefully that's not a long term
    thing just a being sick type of thing. yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay, so a couple attendances here and there. Oh.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just wanted to see if it would affect my mark type of thing. I should have
    I should have told you at the time but, honestly, I was.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah. Okay. it's not a big impact. But i'll try and keep in mind if you want
    to send me a note though you helped me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you, Professor. Good rest your day.
  persid: S03
- desc: thanks you too, take care. Okay, so the rest of the other questions, please
    come and see me after 10. In my zoom office or. But that's easier way. anyway.
    Okay, thanks again take care bye.

  persid: S12

  persid: S13
- desc: chris had it coming
  persid: S14
- desc: Have you uploaded the marks for the proposal re-submissions yet??
  persid: S08
- desc: Am i late for attendence
  persid: S15
- desc: 'no'
  persid: S16
- desc: you wont convince me that it wasn't staged. the Oscar ratings are so bad they
    needed people to talk about them. this has worked and now people are talking about
    the Oscars for the first time in a decade
  persid: S17
- desc: No, because all the controversial issues all social media are very biased
    to one side and will ban those that oppose
  persid: S17
- desc: best examples are the vaccine, trans issues, and political ones like the hunter
    biden laptop scandal in the US that had even media companies locked out of their
    accounts for reporting on which has now been confirmed to be true
  persid: S17
- desc: Can you move the camera a little bit over? I cant read the entire comment
  persid: S09
- desc: I found the comment from the counsel at the NAACP from reading CBC news story.
    Is this an endorsement for curation?
  persid: S18
- desc: "That\u2019s what is says"
  persid: S18
- desc: Could anyone share the attendence please?
  persid: S19
- desc: Attendance password has not been posted yet.
  persid: S20
- desc: 'The opposite of curation: including tweets (nicely formatted) from people
    whose authority is unknown or unchallenged -> unless specifically framed as a
    popular reaction'
  persid: S18
- desc: Are you gonna talk about the web assessment assignment and the date of posting
    the marks for project proposal and blog entry?
  persid: S20
- desc: Are there any particular questions you have about the web assessment?
  persid: S18
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S14
- desc: why should we change the language or practices to appease 2% of the population?
  persid: S17
- desc: so why potentially make the 98% suffer or change for the 2%
  persid: S17
- desc: I'm going to take 2 stances on this
  persid: S07
- desc: the problem isn't that a comedian said something that triggered someone its
    that that someone thought it was ok to resort to violence
  persid: S17
