- desc: Good morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: morning.
  persid: ???
- desc: So twice in a row now i've gone into the ground room.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey I did that yesterday. Also what's happening.
  persid: S03
- desc: what's happening just in general or.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah what's happening in DR happening, you know.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay. Well, so happy Thursday for. One thing, first of all, for I forget.
    and Canada is one step closer to qualifying for the World Cup in Qatar.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What we are.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. we're in the octagon so I. and i'm a bit new to. The ins and outs of the
    World Cup qualifying system, but so in our. area that goes. It covers the Americas,
    basically, I guess. So, as the first round. That decided eight teams and now.
    we're in amongst the teams were. Which is called the octagon. We play each team
    twice home and home. And so the matches are done in groups of three I think so
    there's four windows. And we just completed a third of the fourth one third of
    fourth for windows. And so far we're on top of the standings in the octagon was
    25 points so you get three points for a win. 1.4 hundred and zero points for a
    loss, but. So we would be the United States, the other day. Thank. You build a
    beat El Salvador last night so. I remember when Canada first qualified for the
    World Cup back in 1986 and I thought that was. exciting. And I didn't expect that
    it would be. 30 close to 40 years before they might qualify again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But.
  persid: ???
- desc: it's not done yet, but. So the top three finishers. In this octagon will advance
    to Qatar. And the fourth place team. has to play a playoff with another region.
    And so, as I understand it, Canada can finish no lower than fourth now. So. Keep
    winning then. get one or two more wins anyway, then you have a lock on one of
    the top three spots. But. Not not to put the cart before the horse, so to speak.
    So those it's good news. Something to. Somebody doesn't have quite as much. Well,
    something with good vibes instead of other kinds of vibes a lots of stories in
    the news are giving off I guess. anyone else have something to mention.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I got one for us.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'll see your likened the fight between intel's Z ons and andy's epic processors
    like a knife fight and a phone booth.
  persid: S03
- desc: that's quite as quite a vivid picture.
  persid: DHH
- desc: All right.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. Do you want to. Post, the link to that story in the chat.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I already did. Okay, great.
  persid: S03
- desc: Alright, so. let's do our attendance. share my screen. Sorry. That was a link
    I posted into our meeting plan. And I didn't copy.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I got it.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah thanks. I had copied and just pressing the command V to paste it, as
    you said that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No worries.
  persid: S03
- desc: And can be done. So I didn't set up an activity. Yet for. Assessing. The covert
    data. or searching for resources so that we might. have some clarity for ourselves
    about. The efficacy of vaccines and so forth. And I did find. So we can maybe
    discuss a little bit today. So I did find a Twitter thread. written by Dr Alex
    long who's. Sometimes on the news that he's a physician at the general hospital,
    I think. And so. we'll just put that up here. So. we're here we go. So I don't
    know if this thread is. A common feature and Twitter. So I. i've given up on Twitter
    some years ago. and partly because. I did not. True, for me, I don't I didn't
    understand and maybe I wouldn't still understand the intricacies of the mental
    model that's. The basis for the service. Because I was on Twitter some you a few
    years ago let's see. Maybe five. Maybe it was 2014 I had an event, I want to promote.
    It did a video, and I was tweeting to everybody. Well, details of the event in
    the video. But then I had my. Account locked because I was flagged for spamming.
    And the reason I was that doing that was because. I was thinking of. So my my
    mental model, the way I thought about service was. It being like email, so I would.
    I was sending essentially the same tweet but I was addressing the different people.
    Including different. ideas on the. we're sending it to different are mentioning
    different. Twitter handles with each tweet. So this got me into trouble quite
    quickly. And I begged and pleaded that I said I really want to get the news out
    about this event was happening that day and. So eventually I got reinstated but.
    For me that's not the. i've just decided to leave it alone I don't know what what
    experience you've had with Twitter. Okay, to encourage. Some discussion here and
    that's. All. Do you like Twitter. say what you think. So i'm doing alternatives
    here So what do you think of Twitter using a lot and I like it use it event and
    it's okay. tried. Okay. So I have a ball ready here. About Twitter. So i'm giving
    you four. choices. or i've written rose sort of outlined what the choices and
    then, if none of those four fit your experience he can write other so i'll start
    the whiteboard You can write in the chat or type on the whiteboard if you'd like
    to add your. And they're feeling about Twitter. So I turned off names for annotations
    on the whiteboard if you want to. To get a few more. seconds of it gets replies.
    Okay, well, we had some pretty good participation so and. Okay. So is that VI
    VI peace. Or is that a w I can't. it's a little bit hard I think that's to these.
    Let me go back. Right. So anyway. I want to. engage a little bit about Twitter
    here because I want to mention. interfaces. So the end of them is firstly. Put
    a school Grad. And then slash one. And then here's slash to. slash 3456789 and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: 1112 1314 1516 1718 1920 2122 2324.
  persid: ???
- desc: And then the last one is 25 but it's not number is 25 just says end. So 240
    characters a message. Times 25 messages, so that. let's see. It seems to me like
    6000 characters. are available in this forum. So is it easy to. To get from the
    start. To the end. And what happens if we. get a. get a tweet one of the tweets
    from a metal can we. get to the. front of the threads. and read all the way through
    or. Is that. difficult to do. So it's been the clements passage and posted a bunch
    of times in the chat. bunch of times by me and a bunch by other people so. So
    I don't have the link here, so another thing in the news. Because this is from
    last week or last weekend there was an arrest of somebody. was making. Making
    guns from 3D printed parts.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This is actually happened a few times and back when the 3D participants came
    out somebody printed a gun, not just in the state, but I think in Canada.
  persid: S03
- desc: well. There was. Like I don't have the person's name off the top my head,
    but he was he was formerly the head of Defense distributed. The company in the
    States. that's interested in promoting a different. Their own version of. public
    interest. yeah so it's not new. But from the pictures in the story and i'll post,
    the link. The story. It looks like they're good more advanced than what was first
    3D printed guns. and Then what they've looked like a few years ago. The one that
    made the news some years ago, was a single shot gun. So you could put one bullet
    in it and. And discharge it. All.
  persid: DHH
- desc: we're just posting more links to other articles, also involving 3D printed
    guns. That just you know better, the chatters.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah, so I think one's about to sketch from the same story that i'm referring
    to. So in talking about the public interest. As a general concept that maybe we
    think. It doesn't need to be defined, because they're already. Has a sense of
    it. But in this case. So the people at Defense distributed were. Originally. actively
    promoting a different. idea of public interest and it's common. So that's why
    I think it's important to. To think critically about statements like well what
    is people say well it's not it's in the public interest or it's not in the public
    interest, what do we mean when we say that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry So can I get you just to repeat that question I kind of missed out on
    the last part of that.
  persid: S03
- desc: well. I suggested. That. You know people talking with the public interest
    in a vague way because. Maybe it's easier to deal with, if you don't define it
    to carefully.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, definitely because ignorance is bliss.
  persid: S03
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I I was associated with a startup company in Vancouver some years ago and
    they talked about their intellectual property plant portfolio. Which is very impressive
    but. The they had submitted a number of patent applications. But they had not
    yet got point of. adjudication so. They could say. They had all this intellectual
    property. But it was only an application form and hadn't been tested. By the patent.
    By the Patent Office or patent offices different countries. So this is a little
    bit the same idea. You can talk about public interest. And if we don't. Define
    too closely, then you know we can define we can continue on. And everybody can
    talk about it. and Everyone be happy that they're talking about public interest,
    even though they might have really different ideas about what that is in practice.
    Does that makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Definitely.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. it's a question about. Reading the that reference book The blown to bits
    second edition. And some other things. So. it's a. Long to this book is, it is
    a good. good thing to. Introduce many aspects of what we're talking about in class.
    But also links on the web. That I find. And that you, you may find so. As we find.
    links to the things that are happening. In the news each day. are presently you
    know. Our contemporary with our class here. Then we can collect, we can share
    them. In class and we can evaluate them. as well. So I know that's not necessarily.
    A common you'd like me to say. reads these pages for this topic and. There will
    be a question on the final exam. So my goal for the class is to. encourage you
    to think critically about what's going on. In a world today, and how. And how
    our reliance on computers in our information society creates both risks and rewards.
    And how do we. As computer professionals or future computer professionals. Think
    about these challenges. How should we behave. What what is ethical behavior for
    us. And for other professionals.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's such a hard thing to even think about answering right, because how
    many variables you got to think about how many different laws and things you got
    to think about inviting not only laws, but the. ideas of people and how they.
  persid: S03
- desc: Can.
  persid: ???
- desc: Think of themselves and how they should be treated and everything to you have
    to take into account.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah. So I think there's lots of issues. That, I think it's also. Say it's.
    in society, when software so many things are dependent on computer technology.
    That it's incumbent upon. The computer professionals. So that means. The people
    who write code. and manage information technology systems. For them to have conversations
    about. The impact of their work. And the. And the kinds of principles that can
    guide the behavior so that. Are you said, this is the use of technology in the
    world it's. is held to a high standard I guess. So. The questions may be difficult.
    They think we can come to an answer, we can work through answers. And I think
    that conversation is important. And it may not be that we have. We come up with
    the best answer to begin with.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: ???
- desc: But we can come up with an answer and refine it over time. As we get more
    data as we. get more understanding of the impacts. Of the choices we make. So
    it makes sense. Okay, so I was flipping through back to here because I put a couple
    video links here in last week's. Show there's one from don Norman and one from
    David Kelly. So. I have a few laws here. Are proposed laws they're not really.
    laws like. Was and during the physical world, for example, but. So they proposed
    by there's. Three interfaces. proposed by Jeff raskin who's one of the designers
    of the apple MacIntosh back in 1984 we did some other things as well, so he wrote
    a book called the human interface, which is a nice. what's a nice book to read.
    Anyway, he said. So talking about the human interface, he said, the dinner and
    interfaces you may, if it is responsive to human needs, and considering of human
    frailties. So then, here are the two laws and he. mentioned. A computer should
    not harm your work or through an action allow your work to come to harm. So that's
    similar to. asimov's three was. and rights. And a second law that he proposes
    a computer shall not waste your time or require you to do want. You to do more
    work than a strictly necessary. So I would sit. Why didn't get it. Has anyone
    heard about flight for a one. This is, many years ago. We crashed into the Everglades.
    in Florida.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I can't say i've heard of it, Sir okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. There, there are other video and we used to it was an episode of made
    a which was show produced in Canada. But this is a bit more of a concise. it's
    not a reenactment but it's a description of what happened, so the title is how
    a broken $5 ball costs this message into crash in Miami.
  persid: DHH
- desc: say a $5 bald.
  persid: S03
- desc: So the story was basically. The there's a. Clear night, but there is no moon,
    so it was very dark. And pilots were. preparing to bring the flight into Miami.
    And they put the landing gear down. But there was no way to confirm. The bulb
    on the in the cockpit that in that said yes, the landing gear is down. was burnt
    out so they didn't know whether it was burnt out or whether the landing gear wasn't
    down. So. They had set. relatively new autopilot system into. and set up the autopilot.
    And then. The pilot the copilot work. very hard to get the light bulb. Out of
    to change the light bulb in the control panel. see if that was the reason, so
    they couldn't get it out and even sent. The flight engineer i've moved his his
    title down below the deck to see whether he could see the. front, the landing
    gear down on the nose. and It was so dark and there were no lights. available
    for him to. To see whether the gear was down he couldn't report positively or
    negatively about the gear status, so you went back up to the cockpit. And they
    were continuing to work with a light bulb and then. What happened was in there
    working to change the light bulb they inadvertently shut off the autopilot. And
    because they were so engaged in. The light bulb for the landing gear they didn't
    hear the warnings. Until there was a very loud warning that they were below 1000
    feet, I think, maybe 500 feet.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It kicks another thousand yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. At that point he heard it. and It took them some some time to understand
    that the autopilot had gone off because it's a very dark night out and so that
    it's very hard to see what was going on. So, by the time they realize. That they
    were had shut off the iPod and they were. few hundred feet above the Everglades
    it was too late to to correct. To make any corrections in the plane crash there.
    So. My connection of late for one with. A computer should not waste your time
    or require you to do more to do more work than a strictly necessary. Is that.
    The system. The amount of work strictly necessary for pilots flying. A commercial
    airliner. Is not just to sit there. and make sure the lights Come on, when they're
    supposed to and. Everything else they need to be engaged. In that in what's going
    on with the. With the airplane at all times. So. From an ethical perspective.
    The amount of work that strictly necessary this theme relates to the amount required.
    To keep someone engaged. In the details of the. Of the flight. In this case. What
    do you think about that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Man looking at pictures of this plane crash or this incident, I am surprised
    that 60 plus people actually lived through this out of 167 people.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well, I guess. Maybe the water. made it a bit more soft landing than it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: would have otherwise been crushed on dry land.
  persid: S03
- desc: Nobody was in the swamp.
  persid: DHH
- desc: All Okay, I see what you're saying yeah the pictures don't make it David any
    texture like that. So total of 75 people survived out of hundred and 6367 were
    passengers and 10 hour flight attendants yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: So they're also been some stories about, because this is an l 1011. o'clock
    EVAL 1011 which is kind of interesting design it's kind of. The third engine and
    the tail. They sell which parts from from the crash, and they use them another
    all 10th 11th and. There were some reports of ghost sightings. On those planes
    that got some spare parts. So that that's not the topic of our discussion today.
    But, so this is not maybe so different than your reports of what happened when
    those Boeing 737 max's. crashed. in the sense that. Well, in this flag for one
    example was. The crew may be relying too much on the. idea of the. flight control
    system or the automatic pilot. But in the 737 Max it was the pilot. Trying to
    actively disengaged. Some software that was. Making the wrong. interpreted. Interpretation
    of data that was fed in from. One one of the sensors on the plane. So they were
    both. Examples of. The interaction between people in computers. And they're likely
    some others as well. So there are a couple other examples, maybe i'll just mention
    those. One One example is with the Apollo 13 flight. Where the accident. occurred
    on the way to the moon. And the success. It was success successful flight because.
    The astronauts are able to make it back to earth, but they didn't. get to complete
    the Lunar landing. And the interface issue there was. The carbon monoxide. scrubbers
    in the command module and the Lunar lander. So they both had systems. They worked
    fine on their own, but the filters were not interchangeable between the two, so
    when. It became necessary to spend. extra time with more people. In the spacecraft
    they needed more capacity. to clean the air. And they found that they knew they
    had enough filters, but. They couldn't use all the filters in. In the command
    module where they were located. So. The people on the ground, had to develop a
    strat. A method based on what. materials they had on board. and involve duct tape.
    that's maybe no surprise. But the idea of. So they were able to create a system
    or. A method for. Attaching. or using. All the filters they had. And the question
    for design. it's maybe. Related to how do we deal with. How do we. flag something
    where we have two different. We have a square filter and around filter. And is
    that an important difference and. You know, because sometimes we might be in a
    situation where we need to put the square. filter in the round hole or vice versa.
    And the third Another example is a third 25 has anyone heard of that yeah. Okay.
    So therapy 25 was a radio therapy. machine. It was built. It was marketed by the
    Atomic Energy Canada limited. believe in the 70s, or 80s, there was a partnership
    with a French firm. And there were some models that preceded this one with the
    preceding models. Out of mechanical interlock system. That would prevent. lethal
    dose is being given to. The patient so. So the development of the software began.
    On the models that had the mechanical interlock. And the. Implementation of the
    designers and implementation of the software system. understood that their software
    is working correctly on those earlier models, but in fact. The software. Is not.
    Working perfectly in all cases, but the mechanically interlocks prevented. overdoses
    of radiation to the patients. So. When the. came around and they remove mechanical
    interlocks. With the. False understanding that the software was correct. And there
    were a number of deaths. related to the system. And so. arts. So there are a number
    of issues with the design of the software. And the test.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: So, for example, buffer overflows were part of the issue. So we weren't tested.
    testing to make sure the data conform to expectations, so they weren't. coding
    defensively per se. So in that case it was. The people behind before they released
    the third 25. They. saw what they wanted to see in the performance of the machine.
    And they didn't. They didn't independently verify the correctness of the software,
    so there has been a lot of positive recommendations to come out of that. But Those
    are some of the big examples where interfaces. And then, important. been important
    in the life and death situation. life and death situation. stick with that. Okay,
    so I don't want to start a. breakout room. With six minutes left. But let's. Go
    back to the whiteboard here. So i'll put this question to you how would you like
    to. activity. what's up Kevin see that all right. kind of hidden on my screen.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I can see it fairly good.
  persid: S04
- desc: makes sense, so I could say we could do something like code vaccine triage
    like we did a search before. And maybe do that search on never platforms like
    being in Google and it kausea. clients and duck duck go. Maybe those five. Where
    do we. Take a question. And then search results and then. We analyze whether or
    not those results are. helpful were reliable or the quality sources. So you can
    either and i've turned on anonymous annotation if you want to type on to the whiteboard
    or. or draw. or. Type into the chat window.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Are we putting this just in the chat in here or on the wiki.
  persid: S03
- desc: singing of chatting now, so I can set it up. In your courses. But if it's
    if anyone has any thoughts. leave them now because we're out of time. So. If there
    are people like to put things in the chat now as you leave. that's fine. And I
    will. put up an activity. For I guess for over the weekend. by noon today. Anyway,
    thank you for today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just have a question can you answer this question as a meeting response
    or.
  persid: S05
- desc: well. i'd rather you didn't. Well, you can but i'd also like. Your feedback
    more quickly than midnight today. So if. If you can answer it. now and then. use
    that answers. say the same kind of thing in your response that would be a fine.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you.
  persid: S05
- desc: can say, maybe what I, like most like to know more about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: His.
  persid: ???
- desc: so on and so forth.
  persid: DHH
- desc: All related to happen and have a good weekend.
  persid: S03
- desc: thanks you too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just had a question regarding to the project proposal is there, like a specific
    format that you want to just introduce like our project and the project proposal
    for like you have to write an essay for the project proposal.
  persid: S05
- desc: So i'm just looking for a pair some some paragraphs one or two pages with
    those headings that i've indicated.
  persid: DHH
- desc: sounds good, and then, basically, can I use like the same headings in the
    project or should be something different. If I write another introduction in the
    project proposal, can I just use the same. Paragraph in the project.
  persid: S05
- desc: well. yeah I guess you might have a little bit of overlap, but I wouldn't
    think you would use the same text verbatim because you want, you will have developed
    it further, by the time you submit your project sounds good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S05
- desc: So. See how. i'm not sure offhand whether. Those headings are appropriate
    for the deliverable. So, I guess, I would say, maybe see how things work out as
    you during your research behind. And we can talk more about that. As we get closer
    to. So. I would say, focus on the proposal part now. and across an expiration
    to come to it. Once you get an idea of what more. And more firm idea what you're
    doing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK.
  persid: ???
- desc: For the proposed for the project deliverable.
  persid: DHH
- desc: sounds good Thank you so much, I have a good day after.
  persid: S05
- desc: thanks you too.
  persid: ???
- desc: Yes, i'm.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry, Sir, I do put the attendance the password for the attendance and when
    I tried to put it is now it didn't along, but I was present.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah okay. Second here. Thanks why fix it right now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay. If any of you are still left. we'll see you on Tuesday, have a good
    weekend take care. Yes, i'm.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry, Sir, I, how can I might marked my attendance.
  persid: S06
- desc: fix this year.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I didn't see it sorry you go.
  persid: S06
- desc: No, no, I have to change it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You.
  persid: S06
- desc: know. A couple minutes. Thanks everyone bye Thank you, Sir.
