  persid: DHH
- desc: pretty good certain yourself.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah all right, thank you. I was just a feeling a bit under the weather yesterday
    but i'm good today. I have a dentist appointment later this morning, so. Why,
    how could I not be excited about that. So. What speaking of my appointment I won't
    be available for office hours this morning. But if you have questions send me
    an email. And week I will be available this afternoon. But not sure what time
    i'll be back after my appointment, which is around 10. anyway. Broken something
    here to fix later. i'm having some computer problems. Here so last couple of days
    so. It hasn't helped me out. Okay, so can you see my screen now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S02
- desc: Thanks very much I appreciate. The use of your microphones. Okay So here we
    are. And I said I was going to get everything sorted out for today and i'm not
    quite there yet, but. So this is. The page for our current semester. and So i've
    made a lot of changes over the break. According to some suggestions from. and
    discussions in the. CS 428 class. So now, I have the current time. And the next
    meeting is in progress, here we are so that's what the highlighted link is. Let
    me. show you what happens. And the meeting page from yesterday, so now that they've
    added everything. So earlier today, that was a welcome on. On Tuesday, so here's
    a screenshot. Of. of our breakout question on the whiteboard. So in this semester
    will use the whiteboard to encourage. Another way for to participate by. anonymously
    annotating whiteboards and we'll save those and share them. So then here's an
    audio transcript. from Tuesday. and let's see me go back down to the responses
    so. In here is here, their responses. God about atheism. So these can be. raw
    material for comments in the wiki.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And then.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I have two factor authentication setup for your courses now so. There we
    go so here's the wiki from the first day I think it went. off to a good start.
    So. As we go through the Semester will figure out. better ways to do to use it.
    Okay, so let's go to today's meeting page then. So this will be published. i'll
    go and fix this right after class. So that appears on the on CS public website.
    So. going through the administration on our agenda. so happy Thursday everybody.
    it's the 13th of January, but. it's not Friday the 13th so that's. that's some
    good news I guess. For those who have a particular superstition. Okay, so let's
    do the attendance. i'm sure. Another thing to fix so. If you happen to notice
    things. If I if I noticed them and point them out you don't have to. also mentioned
    them, but if there are things that I haven't come across that need to be updated,
    please. Please post it. send me an email or make a post to the forum. Okay So
    here we are, for the 13th. And here's our password i'm going to put that into
    the chat right now. Okay. let's see whether this link works, so this is what's
    going on for today in class. So the attendance we just did. And you can go and
    do that. And then. there's after class the respond to meeting to opens and open
    till. One minute to midnight today. And then tomorrow morning i'll. Post them
    on the meeting webpage so. It will be available for. inclusion and or. As inspiration
    for entries in the wiki page. OK, and then, so the upcoming events it's similar
    but it just it's, not just for today. So, as I said, thanks to classwork group
    one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For.
  persid: ???
- desc: Taking on editing on the wiki page for our first meeting. So I think it's
    off to a good start. and Today we'll ask classwork group to to do that. So can
    everyone find their. classroom group great group. So let me just go to them.
  persid: DHH
- desc: See.
  persid: ???
- desc: So here's the page with the group. listing so there's 12 groups. So the idea
    is that every. Group will. take the lead on to. Two meetings. and Also use these
    groups to. To. to break out in that's not very good English let's see. we'll use
    these groups. To start to organize into breakout rooms so i'm going to do breakouts
    will be 12 rooms. And if you're in group one you go into group one or Room one.
    If you're in group 10 you go into room 10 and not surprisingly, I hope, if you're
    in group 12 and you go into room 12. Okay. and Anyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Little songs and make sense to me. Good.
  persid: S01
- desc: glad to hear. and If you're not reading are in charge of editing for the wiki
    page for for the particular meeting you can still go in and. and your group and
    some summaries from your discussion. In the breakout room. That would be welcome.
    So I asked you to do. And we just review asked in terms of zooming. So I said
    that I should ask you to rename yourselves I didn't really myself yet. So, on
    your rectangle and zoom. Or you see your name. there's dot dot dot and then you
    can. Choose rename from there. And so i'm asking you to change to the name you'd
    like to be called. And then parentheses. Which you're here your vagina. email
    ID. So, not the whole. Address but your account. Your ID i'm the hope that's clear
    so. So my email is http ti n G D. At you regina.ca so. Having. The name you prefer
    to be called helps me out in class when i'm calling on people. And it helps keep
    track of your participation. So, for example. So in the transcripts. i've. Put
    Esther for. To introduce. Or to indicate. different speakers. One of. The people
    who participate. who spoke. last meeting. And so. So i'm taking. The information
    as its displayed in zoom. And then i'm keeping track of the ideas but i'm not
    sharing them with the world. So this will help me. If you do your your vagina.
    ID in parentheses in your name. and helps me keep track of participation or the
    Semester. just see my right. Okay. So I want to. share some quotations that I
    think are. Relevant or. So this is a little a little bit about. Well, let me just
    read them. So this is from JC or lick lick lick glider. Who was head of. Defense
    advanced research projects agency in the early 60s. So he said, in short, it seems
    worthwhile to avoid argument with other enthusiasts for artificial intelligence
    by conceding dominance in the distant future. Of. Sarah ratio celebration two
    machines alone. There will never be a fairly long interim during which the main
    intellectual advances will be made by men and computers working together in intimate
    association. So just a reminder that this was written in 1960. A multiple multi
    disciplinary study group examining future research and development problems of
    the United States air force. estimated that it would be before developments in
    artificial intelligence, make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking
    of or problem solving of military significance that would leave say five years
    to development computer symbiosis and 15 years to use it. The 15 maybe 10 or 500
    for those years should be intellectually, the most creative and exciting in the
    history of mankind. So. The image that comes to mind. When. computers are able
    to do. If computers are able to do handle problems and military significance in
    the 80s. I think of terminator movies and skynet. So I know they keep. The first
    terminator movie came out, ladies, I think. So they've done some recently and.
    My head to start her and I haven't seen last one. anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't think you really have to see the last one it's all right.
  persid: S04
- desc: you've done it for me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Very good, oh speaking of other movies that. Have. Maybe too many installments
    they see there's a new matrix movie coming out. Anyway, or next, so this is from
    by a quote from john muir who's the founder of Sierra club, I believe. So he said
    when we try to pick out anything but it's how we find a hitch to everything else
    in the universe. So, to me, this is a comment about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The.
  persid: ???
- desc: pitfalls around obstruction and commodification. And these are certainly things
    that we do in computer science. We don't call it commodification but abstraction
    is an important. thing that we do. So this next one is David foster wallace who's.
    A famous American author who's no longer with us here did a commencement speech,
    and this was. This was part of that. So he said, there are these two young fish
    swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming other way, not at
    them and says warning boys how's the water. And the two young fish swim on for
    a bit and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes what the
    hell is water. So I apologize for my. language. There for so early in the morning.
    So to me this is relevant. To our course here because. There are all these things
    around us that. We don't. And to distinguish. But they're essential for. Our.
    continued existence like air and water. So. In the Semester. i'll ask you to critically
    examine. Some of the assumptions. That we have about. any number of things. I
    think this is last know. So here's one from Steve Jobs. said when you grew up
    he tend to get told the way thing with. me try that again when you grew up you
    tend to get told the world is the way it is and you're just your life and your
    life is just to live your life. Inside the world try not to bash into the walls
    too much try to have a nice family have fun save a little money. that's a very
    limited life life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact everything
    around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than
    you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things
    the way. They say build your own things that other people can use once you learn
    that you'll never be the same again. So again, the theme of. Thinking critically
    about what's. what's. around us and whether or not. You can improve it and. And
    we, we can be empowered to do things. So there's a couple more but. I think along
    in the same vein. So. In. And there's a couple thoughts about. Their responses
    to the meeting. And there's a couple people. identified themselves and their responses
    so. My. My feeling. So I don't believe you can see them in your courses. After
    they're submitted. When i'm taking them and. posting them. To the website to my
    public website. So i'd encourage you to not. not identify yourself in your responses.
    I can figure out who. Like I can match up people's responses to. I know who wrote
    things but i'm again not sharing that. As I posted on the website. So i'll try
    and. catch. Any attempts and he slips about an identifying yourself yourselves.
    and remove them. But asked you to be mindful of that as well. So i've. included
    some wiki documentation. here. there's. A few rather unhelpful I found them to
    be rather and helpful. things in the student guides for your courses. Right, I
    thought of all the general information. This is maybe the best one. So it shows
    about adding more pages. Thank you see a little bit more. context for the wiki
    stuff. I hope. So there was an interesting discussion of risks and rewards. So
    I. So these are the kinds of. things that we can put together in. In the wiki
    page. So we'll keep editing over the. semester. So there's a couple of interesting
    things about information society. So. Remember, a few years ago, we talked also
    about the new economy. And I think both of these things relate to the importance
    of data and computing. power. In terms of everyday everyday life. We can. explore.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The.
  persid: ???
- desc: meaning. different facets and nuances of information society ideas over the
    Semester. So that anyone see the article at the end of the end of December. About
    Amazon alexa giving dangerous suggestions. For a challenge that a. young girl
    could.
  persid: DHH
- desc: attempt.
  persid: ???
- desc: It was a penny challenge.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have not heard of this.
  persid: S05
- desc: I heard about it, I think it was. She told the child to touch a penny to the
    exposed prongs of a phone charger plugged into the wall.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah well. I guess, they were doing some. I have a link somewhere i'll add
    it. Families doing some activities on a day, where they are stuck inside of those
    cold and. miserable outside and so on and so forth. And the child asked alexa
    for a challenge. Oh here's something I found on the Internet. yeah and it's. Take
    having a plug that's not fully inserted into the outlet and then putting a penny
    across the progress. Of the plug. which could. be very dangerous so. So there's.
    So i'll post the. link here. Hello. So I encourage you to. Keep an eye out. For
    things in the news that are relevant to class. So I mentioned the tweet from the
    sketch and health authority. So here's the screen I captured I think it was on
    Friday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Reading beyond the headline is probably the most important.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah. So at least make an effort to scroll through the whole thing. For you
    can. share it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'd say, knowing the source is actually really important there. Because without
    knowing the source it's all.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah. it's important to know the source. And it's important. To to be vigilant
    about things that look like a trusted source, but aren't you know, like when we
    get phishing attempts. In the email. And you think this looks really convincing.
    Oh, but very few key words is spelt wrong. or. It sent from an address in Russia
    or India, or who knows where. So, knowing. Knowing the sources is a. This is not
    a strict not all as a straightforward task. So in checking the date. I notice
    on Google, for example. I wonder about some of their results because they come
    up as. mean there are some things that. That are fairly all the come up as current.
    And so, making the date more prominent. would be a valuable thing, I think. But
    Google is a private company. Well they're an advertising company really. And they
    need to. keep making obscene profits. they're not interested they're not always
    interested in. doing the thing that's best for society. And i'm not just talking
    about Google, I mean there are lots of other companies. So. Anyway, to get back
    to this tweet. So these five items. are an important. basis for evaluating information
    that we find on the web. So. we'll keep this conversation going. Over the Semester.
    and
  persid: DHH
- desc: going off of the headline since we're on the topic of comedy do you think
    that will transition to offline this semester, or could it just be online throughout.
  persid: S08
- desc: I. Not. not in a position I don't. sorry to say.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, I was just curious.
  persid: S08
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: I know I was looking forward to. seeing some of you in class every day. Because
    we were scheduled to be in class to 125 which is I checked it out at the end of.
    Last year, and. it's very nicely newly renovated. and Two years of zoom meetings.
    Is me me may be enough. But it's not just. So. My individual needs. To be in front
    of the classroom. And interacting with you in a face to face way or a mask mask
    way. are important, but they need to also be weighed against. needs of society.
    So that's another topic will be. Discussing over the Semester. anyway. So. As
    far as I understand. we're at least two weeks online. And then it will be reevaluated
    I haven't heard. About. what's going to happen after the two weeks or if it's
    going to be extended, a little bit or a lot or.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well i'll find out together, I expect. fairly soon.
  persid: DHH
- desc: After I just had a small quick question. yeah so Sir, in general, like when
    we start going through the chapters are you going to have like lecture slides
    or PD I mean powerpoints for your lectures in general.
  persid: S09
- desc: So. So. I will. Post material so we're not going to have. A textbook per se
    here. So. In this meeting, so I have posted things to do for next meeting, so
    if you can look at. Look at these two videos. i'm not a huge fan of PowerPoint.
    For some things. So my preferred way to do things is. To have this record of what
    we're what we're going to discuss and. An after original we have discussed and
    done in the meeting. So. My view of. The class isn't about this is what we're,
    this is what. You should absorb from from me talking. i'm. i'm wanting to engage
    you in. Discussions and critical evaluation of different things that are. beef.
    Before us during the Semester and. In this period of time we're living in. So
    it's not just to say. That you're. it's just a free for all and it doesn't matter
    whatever opinion. You have. is fine. So opinions are. A good start. But you need
    to support your your position. and We. Okay, so let me start. That again. On a
    different track. So there's lots of issues. that we need to consider. about how
    computing impact society and how as future computer professionals. What our role
    is. In in shaping the use of computing in society. So. My approach is to. provide.
    resources and support. For those discussions. Through the meeting pages. To material
    on my website. And in your courses. So sometimes the resources will be pdfs. Maybe
    even the occasional PowerPoint. But there'll be things for you to go through.
    In preparation for our next. Our next meeting, and then we'll we can discuss it.
    As a group, and. and go from there. So I know that sounds okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I mean sorry about, though, like like I mean of all the chapters like we're
    just going to discuss like this, like without any you know.
  persid: S09
- desc: So. there's not. An official text. there's not a textbook. So there's no.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm gonna post pdfs about the lecture on the euro courses.
  persid: S10
- desc: Not in so many words no. So my intention is to. To post all the resources.
    We need. To facilitate discussion. Okay. So. Looking at the chat. So, as this
    class was scheduled. it's meant there are actually two sections of the class you
    either registered in. Oh 01 F or 01. All right, I think. So the idea was to have.
    Students would be. Coming to university and meeting classroom 125. At 830 to 945
    on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. So the people who. Are in their remote section.
    would join in, to our class discussions. He is zoom. So, given the situation situation
    with AMI crime. We. saw that so this year we delayed the start of the Semester
    one meeting, instead of meeting on the Sixth. We met on the 11th as our first
    class meeting. and will be. Online at least next week as well. After that. or
    in time for the 24th. There will be decision whether or not. The online or the
    remote only delivery of the class will continue for some time, or whether. we'll
    move to the hybrid. This part of part of our class getting together. in person,
    and the other. Part continuing. to join in via zoom. So you you. If you check.
    Your your registration usually either C. 01 effort 01 are. As a section for the
    class. So it's either or and when you wouldn't be in both. Okay. Yes, so. The
    syllabus will be up by the end of this week and i'll send a note. To the news
    forum to let you know when. I have everything updated Okay, I apologize.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. Shall we try a breakout room. i'm going to. I like that spirit of the
    comment in the. In the chat.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So sorry in the breakout rooms, we are mostly supposed to just discuss about
    our own opinions and not about what we're learning isn't it.
  persid: S09
- desc: And then just that seems like an awkward. The economy that you're creating
    there. So. i'm asking you to engage with the question. is based on your. Learning.
    To date, to this point in your life. Because that that will influence your positions.
    And when you're presenting your own position. and want to encourage you to. be
    strong, provide a strong foundation or basis for your. Your positions. Okay, so.
    i'm i'm interested in getting. You to think about. Issues related to class. that
    are connected to. Here on experience. Okay, so. you're able to annotate on the
    whiteboard screen. If you like and. i'm going to let you share screens. And we'll
    do a breakout room. For not too long because we're. getting close to the end of
    class but. start the discussion anyway. So i'm going to let you choose your room,
    based on what we discussed earlier. Okay, here we go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: breakout rooms by based on our group.
  persid: S11
- desc: yeah so. If you look at the.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I know my group is.
  persid: S11
- desc: yeah so. i'm asking you to. choose the room number that corresponds to your
    classwork group number. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thanks.
  persid: S11
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hi Sir I didn't have the option to go to the auction.

- desc: mishra. Okay. cuz you're. I looked up your email or ID and it didn't come
    up on that list.
