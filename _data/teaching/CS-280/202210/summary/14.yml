Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Sure it's a little more friendly for zoom. Let me continue our questions.
    Okay, I feel that one a bit more smoothly today, then. On Tuesday I was my volume.
    icon I think it is yeah okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm excuse me, Professor. Black marker instead because it's really hard to
    see.
  persid: S01
- desc: The blue one is OK, though.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think if you just said, can you adjust the camera and pointed upwards more.
  persid: S02
- desc: Oh, I see okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because it's also just the glare on this whiteboard. yeah like we can't even
    see that I think it says to see us to at.
  persid: S02
- desc: I was trying to do function first.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's better.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. So one nice thing about marches it's laid out. At 830 in the morning.
    Alright, so. I wanted to. be a bit more detail about. That event I mentioned.
    it's coming up in just less than two weeks now. that's a good point, thank you.
    So Ross is a friend of mine from undergraduate and master's program so I finished
    my bachelor's with ibs in 88. And my masters in 91 year before I went on to. Other
    things. So he's just been named the. Number make sure I get it all right, you
    know. it's just been named at the end of last year was named the Alberta health
    services chair and Ai and health. professions department of medicine and dentistry
    and an adjunct professor in the department of computer science at the University
    of Alberta he's a fellow with the Alberta machine intelligence Institute and senior
    program director of artificial intelligence adoption, with a ch hs. So you can
    read more things there. Yes. Sure let's try that. And i'm feeling less than less
    comfortable doing Facebook stuff. It took me. It felt like an hour, but didn't
    take that long to change the picture to get this picture for for the cover of
    the event. And it just it just doesn't seem like. It seems like I don't know.
    I don't want to say i'm getting old any older. Unless. Maybe Facebook, how many
    people. are big Facebook users, compared to what instagram and snapchat. So what's
    your preferred platform to us. Yes. instagram yeah. I have an account on instagram
    but that's. I haven't got much further than that. tell you about my Twitter story.
    So this was. In 2000 2014 I think we did an event or. We had a Canadian competing
    at compete Canadian competing education Day and it did a video, and we had a few
    things going on, so I want to share this information, with people. And i'm. Much
    more comfortable sending emails to people where i'm comfortable I was comfortable
    that it's, I guess, I still. So I tried to apply that. model of how to use Twitter.
    The model of using email to using Twitter and within a few hours, I had my account
    blocked. Because I was sending the same messages to. I was trying to address messages
    to individual people. But it just showed up as. New sending spam to everyone and,
    unlike account was blocked. And I pleaded with them that I was. doing it doing
    this event for the day and then they reinstated and after that surely after that
    I decided. That maybe I didn't need to use Twitter. anyway. So I mean that that
    goes back to our discussion about do you mean interfaces and. Okay, so there's
    the event i'm encourage you to come by if you're interested in artificial intelligence.
    or. interested in healthcare. So there's a link here to register for the zoom
    event zoom meeting. soon as well. Okay, so then go back to our class. So i've
    created. A formative feedback questionnaire it's open after today meeting and
    we'll close it Monday and then night. that's just for my benefit. You can give
    me a sense of a few questions about your impressions in the class so far, and
    maybe we can do some. make some tweaks in the last month in the last 10 meetings.
    So its formative because it's still an opportunity to change. And i'll let you
    do the same thing at the end of the Semester for a seminar of. Feedback as well.
    So that should be in the calendar, I think it is yeah. here's here it is they're
    in the calendar, so you should see it under upcoming events. So let's do attendance.
    Alright, so there's that. So we've done the Web groups. Now this. just going to
    show it to you briefly. Because I haven't added I haven't created a version without
    student numbers in. So now you're in groups from A to zed X so there's 24 groups
    like I promised. So I took your input on group membership. And then I. tried to
    make a few changes as possible to the restaurant, but I had to do a little bit
    of juggling. To get groups of four or five. So i'll post, the link without the
    email without the student numbers.
  persid: DHH
- desc: In it.
  persid: S03
- desc: But then we.
  persid: DHH
- desc: See.
  persid: ???
- desc: So now. groups are here. Alright, so. If you go to the group discussion forum.
    You can send messages to your group members here because you'll see. The group
    here and in the last. Okay. So I thought about editing the video that we that
    we have the demonstration, I did in class on Tuesday. I didn't get around to this
    group thing was a little bit more. time consuming than I thought. But instead
    of editing it i'll i'll post a link to the video from. from Tuesday, so you can
    see, and. well. If I can reasonably edit it, I will but otherwise i'll try and
    give you the time where that section up here it's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: about the Web group list like web assessment like, are we not assigned to
    the groups that we selected.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes, you are.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Where can we find that list.
  persid: S05
- desc: So I will later today take out the student numbers and post a list, but you
    can, if you go to this page. Here, with a web. Web. Within group discussion forum.
    You click on separate groups web this drop down. You will see your group here.
    Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You start updating the transcript on after meeting on your website, now the
    last meeting that SS transparent this meeting 10 on February.
  persid: S01
- desc: Really. I thought I was better I didn't think. Well, I will fix that sorry.
    I just had in my I didn't check it, but I thought that I was up to date. Well,
    not from yesterday, not from tuesday's meeting but. But before the break I thought
    I was. doing well. Okay, so speaking of other things that I thought about doing.
    There was a comment from a student who asked whether instead of the seven, you
    could have the assignment during the nine the blog entry assignment. Is that better
    still i'm not going to make it any later than that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A nice of March.
  persid: S01
- desc: or in me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: There you saying blog entry will be moved a nice much.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah so instead of Monday, it will be due on a Wednesday the night.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah that sounds good.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah I greatly appreciate that.
  persid: S06
- desc: So. You can have until Friday at one minute to midnight. Though there'll be
    a 10% penalty. So. You can, if you want to have a little bit extra time. You can
    do that, but. there's a bit of a cost there okay. Okay. And I will also post the
    pictures of the board. And i've taken. What else okay. This is my exercise for
    the day. No that's not quite true it's part of my workout routine. that's a little
    bit too generous. Anyway, going from my office on third, fourth college west to
    this room and in the classroom building. And just having to be in different places
    at different times. It seems like a workout. And I always find that to the. idea
    that you can't just pop in somewhere on your computer. You have to actually be
    somewhere physically. But that's, not to say that i'm. Not happy to be here. anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So just to confirm like will you still have like a zoom meeting or no.
  persid: S07
- desc: I didn't quite hear me turn off turn up your. What about the zoom meeting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The restart have to come to the zoom meeting or do you have to come to the
    live to the campus physically to meet you for the office hours.
  persid: S07
- desc: No it's. zoom meeting is fine for office hours. So something's coming I had
    to deal with something this morning, so the two hours, I have from 10 to noon.
    So regarding blog assignment.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, Sir, are you like going to have an office hour from 10 to 12 tomorrow.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes, so i'm moving today's. office time. Do the same time tomorrow instead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Do to for office hours they're going to sit stay the same.
  persid: S05
- desc: it's not to the 4230 to 330.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh sorry sorry is that officers to the thing. yeah oh.
  persid: S05
- desc: So before the break we talked about. Whether we should but submit your turn
    it in report and discuss your turn in report or simply answer some questions about
    each of your sources. So. i'm. leaning towards answering questions. Okay, so i'm
    just. Basically. Oh. Well formalize our discussion from before the break about
    that. update the assignment should reflect up. sure. it's a good question. So
    my feeling is the maybe because they're submitting html it would be. A good thing
    to include it in your. html file. Okay, so two things will do with that is so,
    the questions to answer what each of your sources. And then, a sample of how we
    might do that. Okay. I don't promise the video, but maybe i'll get one done. about
    that. Okay. My pleasure any other questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So basically use it you'll be like how to sample or how to submit the information
    or we will ask the right questions to answer about my sources as well.
  persid: S07
- desc: So. i'm thinking about so I I believe I have a sample they're already have
    a blog entry, so what i'll do is i'll. use that example. To illustrate how I might
    submit. extra information my answers to the questions what each of the sources
    that they have. In that. sample blog entry so. i'll show you a more complete example
    of a blog entry what I think might be appropriate for a blog entry. With the added
    information about the sources. I answer your question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, thank you.
  persid: S07
- desc: Welcome Anything else. i'll try and look at the camera. I feel like send this
    might think i'm staring at here but i'm actually looking at the camera. See you
    soon. All right. So I feel like i've indicated a number of sources already. I
    think I said to the four. But i'll check that. Okay yeah so it's about the project
    proposal. So the proposal. Is what you're proposing something they're going to
    do. And then we're going to realize the proposal with a deliverable of the by
    the end of the Semester. So it's different from the blog entry so. So the blog
    entry is an idea as the intent is for you to. write something. For the web. Whether
    or not it actually gets onto the Web it's up to you. But it will be within your
    courses anyway. So that's. A writing assignment. Related to current topics and.
    Things that are currently of interest in the world. With some. Details so i'm
    trying to give you enough some structure to work with. And so there's there's
    the blog entries that's the writing assignment that's that and then the project
    is the ability for you to you could write something again, you could do you could
    research, a topic. You could write a Wikipedia article, you can, but you. So the
    idea is by yourself, or with a group of people. You can explore topics of interest
    you in a form that's not necessarily writing it could be producing a video. It
    could be doing a number of different things. So, the reason I did the project
    proposal is to encourage you to think about this before. The due date. Anyone
    ever. leave things to the due date with even without. Even though you may have
    had the best of intentions. So i'm trying to. support you, by having a proposed
    proposal do beforehand, so that you can do some thinking about what you're going
    to create for the in the project. So both things are related to. Our discussions
    and there are themes in class but they're different. Okay, that makes sense. Okay,
    thanks send us. Any other things. Okay. Okay. picture here. So I thought we would
    try a breakout discussion today and see how. The class groups work. Our class
    work groups. Work now that we're some of a certain person and some of us are in
    line and. So I want you to say we're talking about she made interfaces and I just
    want you to think about or be mindful of the role of technology in facilitating
    this. hybrid kind of discussion. So I just. My handwriting is nuggets to janice
    to say handwriting I was my scribbling on the word is it okay. In terms of legibility
    in the back. Okay. So maybe that's sort of the background question and think about
    them to discuss. So that would be my mom calling but it's not. that's neither
    here nor there. Okay, so. The topic i'd like for us to discuss is. So here, this
    is what i'm thinking. For discussion today. see if it makes sense or enough to
    work with anyway What role can technology play in combating disinformation. Do
    we need to even worry about it. I mean the review is an individual to. understand
    that this is click bait. and ignore it. For example. So, if it is something to
    worry about whose responsibility is it do we need to take this on. We need to
    do our own work to. To combat the desert this information, we find where do we
    rely on the government or some other platforms to do it. So that makes sense as
    a. Discussion topic. Okay, so. i'm going to start breakout rooms. Well breakout
    rooms. options. Well participants to choose your. that's a new one. i'm gonna
    make it be stuck in the breakout room. Once you start. So I feel like that wasn't
    complete successful. Because everybody's been assigned to rooms, let me. yeah
    I saw I saw that PIC that. Okay i'm going to close this and try again. So zoom
    is something that. that's a nice way to say that says isn't the interfaces and
    quite as you mean, as I would like to be. So one thing that happens okay. see
    if I can do this again. breakout rooms options. Okay, so I think that's the best
    I can do for that. So. Why, I wonder, is it gives me the option to let people.
    do things. When. This has already happened. It seems to me that people choose
    their own room. There we go. Okay now we're at the end of class time not just
    kidding. Yes. yeah I think so, and then. And then, if you're if you know people
    in your breakout room. Do any of you know each other. Okay. little bit okay well.
    If you are in the same group. In class here, so you can sit. closer together.
    Well, not not uncomfortably close. But I think start out with zoom if you can
    that would be fine. Okay, so. Should I go through. let's see. Last the cursor
    there. Anyone hearing in class work group number one. room to. grow group to.
    group three. there's one person group three Okay, and the others. Okay group to.
    Group for. Okay, one person group five. group six. Okay, so. No pressure for you
    to be shy people talking. It should go talk to one another. don't don't feel self
    conscious, this is. it's easy for me to say. group 7890 okay there's two people
    in group 910. Hello 1112. Okay, so. So the two of you in group nine you can. See
    how that works as well to. talk in person. Okay, so let's take 10 minutes let's
    well let's try try for between seven and 10 minutes and. So if you're able to
    join your breakout room and zoom as well. And we'll see if we can have a bit of
    a discussion. A bit of a hybrid discussion. And we'll come back at the end for
    a couple minutes. Okay, so i'm turning on well. Yes. well. So i'm fine with doing
    that for but try it out for five minutes. Five minutes or so. thanks for that
    suggestion i'm. Okay. I think we're getting closer to the end of class and I had
    intended. Well, I have to cause. So, was that a good discussion. was a good discussion.
    yeah no that's all right. So I invite you to be back. Well, it seems like a long
    time. So who can write. You want to contribute to the wiki about our breakout
    discussion would be nice. and Okay. Now everyone. Anyway, so we're out of time
    for today, people in zoom. Thanks for joining us and people in class thanks for
    playing along. So we. have some ideas about doing discussions in class. we'll
    talk about them more on Tuesday, so the idea would be if you have some something
    you'd like to. share with the class let's put it in the wiki and or in online
    forums. And I just want to say thank you very much for today. And I have my list
    of things to do take care of today. And remember my office availability from 10
    to noon today is move until 10 to noon tomorrow. And with that have a great weekend
    and we'll talk to you on Tuesday.

  persid: S17
- desc: Alright.  I just wanted to make sure.  That makes sense.
  persid: S17
- desc: Is project proposal part of project deliverable and is blog entry different
    from project deliverable?
  persid: S15
- desc: 'Yes'
  persid: S18
- desc: The proposal is what you want to do (the plan), the deliverable is what you
    actually do (the project). The blog entry and project are separate.
  persid: S14
- desc: That makes sense thx!!!^^
  persid: S15
- desc: The blog entry is a writing assignment on current events related to class.

    meant for you to explore a topic that interests you that is related to the class.
