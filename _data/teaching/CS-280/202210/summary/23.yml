Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Before we. get started today. Sure, only one person. yeah just one. In each
    group. Summer hosted. And all gets more. Vision test, yes I failed. At JP. rock.
    towards being the Semester talked about. Climate change is a computing problem.
    Say that climate change is resolved. By.
  persid: DHH
- desc: computers.
  persid: ???
- desc: But is there. A role. For computer professionals to play. In addressing. The
    climate emergency. Maybe. it's it's too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Hot sufficiently.
  persid: ???
- desc: It doesn't indicate emergency USA is there a role.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For.
  persid: S02
- desc: me to be more definite.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and say.
  persid: S02
- desc: What is. In three years. So I was looking for comments from the chat and.
    seems like. Get. stuck here. So I believe the assignment description gives you
    a word count if you're writing a document. So that's the answer to the question
    in the chat. made a comment earlier today and some grades have been posted others
    will be forthcoming. Okay. So. This question clear. We have a discussion about
    that. Okay, so. say. That. So, as you begin. To understand, with more clarity.
    what's going on. messages are becoming more clear, but not to say they weren't
    problems over the past me not so long ago. So in the 70s. There was part of a.
    Pilot cooling. So that as. We understand that one CD after you've had. Some of
    the hardest years on record and. Say that. Producing accurate predictions or modeling.
    and making that accessible. contribution for computer professionals. discussion.
    I just want to say that. it's got to. Design software is which are friendly and
    reduce the emissions that we are having. A car car carbon dioxide emissions from.
  persid: DHH
- desc: From.
  persid: ???
- desc: Other time devices, etc, we do, but rather than professional. Decisions are
    the. initiative should be tainted by higher qualities, because they would be much
    more effective in reducing. in reducing the damage that we are passing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks.
  persid: ???
- desc: positive and proactive approach. Or is there a way for us. to design.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it's important for us as computer professionals i'm coming from more
    of a geological perspective, taking a class in geology and we had a discussion
    about climate change. When we talk about climate change, we need to focus more
    on the timescales, because its climate has been changing shifting from glaciation
    to de icing and all. it's happening, and when we say glaciers are melting they
    have been melting from not from like last 10 or 20 years but they've been melting
    from last 1500 200 1500 to 2000 years ago, or more than that. So I think. Our
    duty as computer professionals is more to focus on the data, the scientific data
    that accurate data that that's collected through research, rather than following
    the hoax news for the climate change. I think that's more important for us to
    make sure accurate information is being presented out.
  persid: S03
- desc: So. that's that's more. That we can. Take on it's something. that's definitely.
    give in, or we do not speak. You heard this phrase that information wants to be
    free. or something like that. Less. Last quote. Recording this i'm paraphrasing
    yet. Was was to be free. So this is nice. Stewart brand. So wants to be free,
    in the sense that it's easier to disseminate information. Share file. Something.
    But on the other hand. Information also expensive because soluble. So the intellectual
    property behind. Say coronavirus 19 vaccines or any number of other things, certain
    aspects of the Amazon shop store platform. Valuable things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Are.
  persid: ???
- desc: The systems that which you're working are designed to. Be as soon as value.
    heard about five star link building data. 10 burners leave. here with me. zoom.
    yeah so. Documents words. When data. You put it onto the Web in some format, so
    the word document or excel spreadsheet. Then they give us one star. let's say
    one star for on the web, maybe it's a PDF file. Working with csv files. Who knows
    what a csv file it's. yeah. So. There wasn't a standard to begin with, but standards
    have. come along to support. CSP offering the CSP class. format. format, you know
    the good open data format like this to ensure out. sort of subscription framework.
    descriptions. So, on five stars. So five star when data. Is data landed a non
    proprietary format that uses. That describes relationships, creating. Data elements.
    Using you are fewer eyes. You know, former source indicators for everything. And
    we also linked. to other concepts using that format to get. To get to the weather
    data. So. it's a scheme to represent the openness of data. So up to three stars
    then we're talking about making it open and then.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If.
  persid: ???
- desc: We have a data source to gets four or five stars. Then we're linking it. with
    other with other collections of data, so the data that's wiki data, for example.
    up. lots of other sources of. data that we can refer. boy he made interfaces.
    So can we talk about your name, in a sense. text file like CS comma separated
    values but it's easy, but maybe understanding the data that's stored there is
    not so easy. notes. I think that was a stone pain for my shoe that I flicked just
    the right way that. They may be attributed to much to my. yeah. We talked about
    the Corbett at. Johns Hopkins University. What kind of formats you think that
    date, is it. So just because we have a date on the web doesn't mean that it's
    accessible. it's not. So if we understand what data is and where it comes from
    and how it compares to other similar data so we're comparing apples to apples,
    for example. These are. Important ways. So if we have and we have. tasks in mind.
    People you know accomplish. So the the whole discussion of the semantic web and
    printed on the bed in. machine readable formats, so if we need name things with
    URLs and. links to other websites for more context that's helpful for people to
    get in more information. And so, and it's also helpful for. Software to understand
    the deal it's on the web and to follow those links and suck. automatically programs.
    So the current state of the art. In this in data needs to also dress usability.
    question about. Is there a way to represent data. So that we can have informed
    debates. And we can agree on. The serious nature of the task ahead of us. can
    still disagree about the best way to handle it. We have solid data that we can
    agree on. And that's maybe a good first step. So there's this thinking about another.
    issue of data. and misinformation. So we might not at this point, we might not
    all agree on. Change the climate. well. there's maybe a contribution they can
    make us looking at. platforms that. reside on computer systems in computer networks.
    creations of computer professionals or programmers. And look and see what. We
    can do to. restore trust in institutions. and ideas that are so regularly under
    attack. So. make sense, so what is the single most important contribution you
    can make to society as a computer professional. So how many of you have thought
    about that question in some form or the other, or another. As you began your studies
    in computer science, or you thought computer science was a ways that you could
    make a car, make a difference in the world. So that's. Our tree so. How many of
    you are thinking about becoming an acm or kips Member as a starting point in your
    journey. So for the link on a boat some information for kips. An acm as well.
    nice to have an acm student chapter yeah. undergraduate. I was just yesterday.
    Suddenly the summer. So maybe we can. start that again. Okay. So one comment frank
    Amir. So, increasing the quality around us. So sometimes that's expresses the.
    versace and inclusion. Diversity equity and inclusion. I think. The in the credits
    are. For most people. Anything else comes to mind. Okay well we're almost at a
    time. So people and there. and Thursday we'll talk about things, in general terms
    of what we've done over the Semester. That sound like a plan. office hour or so
    after I get my. line to get my coffee right away and. see me in person or on zoom,
    if you like. Saying. Thank you everyone. Have a good day take care and see you
    on Thursday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hello, Professor.
  persid: S04
- desc: hi.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just have one question like in this final project so like how many pages
    can like approximately 1012.
  persid: S04
- desc: So. They said in class there's if you're writing something there's a. ballpark
    for the. The target for the fake we're account, let me just access it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because I was just confused about the approximately words or PhD. What is
    a minimum or maximum page limit. So I can start working on it so.
  persid: S04
- desc: Sure there's some comment about page or cat.
  persid: DHH
- desc: or because I didn't find in this like in particular section right below so
    I thought I should ask me for that thing. In the blog limit, I saw that there
    was. 902,000 yeah.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah. Let me check in my office and join me in my APP. Is our.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To them, just going forward.
  persid: S04
- desc: hey can you send me an email.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That would be.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay, and i'll do that this morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah perfect no worries Thank you yeah. bye.
  persid: S04
- desc: bye.

  persid: DHH
- desc: Do anybody know how many pages report we have to submit?
  persid: S04
- desc: final report?
  persid: S04
- desc: for the web assessment?
  persid: S05
- desc: for the final report submission.
  persid: S04
- desc: Project Deliverable
  persid: S04
- desc: did he share the password yet?
  persid: S06
- desc: xutjte
  persid: S07
- desc: 'Apr 5: xutjte'
  persid: S08
- desc: So for the last 50 some years we have had climate crisis after climate crisis
    and we have been wrong every single time so find it difficult to believe that
    this time is the time we are correct
  persid: S09
- desc: as for what role can be played by comp pros
  persid: S09
- desc: maybe accurate modeling software or at least more accurate
  persid: S09
- desc: They could play a role in developing new technologies that help shift away
    from a dependence on fossil fuels
  persid: S10
- desc: I think the more politicians get involved in anything the more political it
    becomes and the less science based it becomes
  persid: S09
- desc: I have not heard of that
  persid: S11
- desc: Me neither
  persid: S12
- desc: Inventor of the web
  persid: S03
- desc: I am kinda confused, what are the stars about?
  persid: S13
- desc: the rating of the data, the cost or value
  persid: S06
- desc: the more stars the more value and cost
  persid: S06
- desc: oh thanks sir
  persid: S13
- desc: Attendence password?
  persid: S14

  persid: S07

  persid: S02
- desc: thanks
  persid: S14
- desc: shaping the world where there is more equality
  persid: S06
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S03
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S15
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S16
- desc: Thank you!
  persid: S12
