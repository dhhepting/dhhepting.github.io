Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: morning good morning.
  persid: ???
- desc: Good.
  persid: S02
- desc: morning.
  persid: ???
- desc: how's everyone doing today. You don't have to come up with a single answer
    for that sleepy. don't have to reach a consensus. yeah so we'll talk about the
    syllabus. And i'll show it to you. But I. had an issue getting it transferred
    to my site so it's on my. My laptop. Okay. Okay, let me. show you the syllabus
    first. Okay, here we go. So it's winter 2022 you see that all right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay. So. Our meetings are via zoom. And in person. So we're going to talk
    about that in a minute is anyone heard from. That I return to in person learning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can you hear me.
  persid: S04
- desc: hear me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: you hear me.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: my sister works at the university at the FCC in their order not to come back
    until February 7 and she was assuming that the students were going to get the
    same treatment that's all i've heard.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah okay well we'll talk about in a minute, so we had a discussion of this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yesterday.
  persid: ???
- desc: So that's right. Maybe we just talked about right now. So there's the option
    to come back on February 7. Which is a Monday. So that would be two weeks before
    the break. So. We would have the eighth and the 10th and the 15th through the
    17th in person. or partly in person and then. So let's see. yeah so we're off.
    or reading which. means we're not meeting in the 22nd of 24th. And then, our next
    day would be march 1. So the plan is for everybody to come back on march 1. And
    that's a Tuesday. So it's the beginning of the month of March. So indicated by
    March 1. So that that makes it simpler for residents people moving back to the
    residents. So the question for you today and what is. not going to make a final
    decision today. Well, we can talk about it and then we'll talk about it again
    on Thursday. So this doesn't this wouldn't affect. People in the road section.
    So it's primarily as a face to face section. be affected by this. So let me create
    a Pole, for this. Did you get a chance to see the watch the video say suggested.
    i'll stay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay. So let you. express your thoughts about that. In Nepal. So there's still
    12 people. Who haven't answered. Nine people now. just give it a few more seconds.
    So, are there any questions about details. So a question. i'm going to find an
    answer to for myself is. If there are people in the face to face section. who
    want to. want to stay remote. Is that. Is that possible to switch sections or.
    Some just logistical issues like that. Because, so we will be back on march 1.
    that's the impression that. There will be people, I will be there for sure on
    march 1. And so that. was our preliminary poll here. or sure seems to be. The
    one that has the most support. But if. Again, like I said, if you have questions.
    Post them to the forum.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So I have a question for you. Sure, so it's a lot better for me if all my
    classes go back to the in person at the exact same time, rather than having an
    online class and then. In person class 10 minutes later and need to be at the
    school So my question is. Are computers available at the school right now I can
    I go to the library or is that closed.
  persid: S05
- desc: that's a good question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You can go to the library i've done it before.
  persid: S06
- desc: All right.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah and i'm just. I took that, as a general. Availability of computing labs
    question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And I second thing is just a suggestion, it might make sense to allow people
    to stay online if they want to, because you you you do offer both online and in
    person.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah. I think that's not going to be an issue but. I just want to make sure
    that i'm not saying one thing and then the end of the Semester and there's problems.
    So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's totally fair thanks. you're welcome.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay, so that was a good start to our discussion and if questions come up.
    before Thursday. we'll discuss it on Thursday and i'll try and get some more information
    and. we'll go from there. Okay. So my offices in college West. I used to be able
    to say that it was an alphabetical section of the computer science department,
    because all the ages were alpha ties, but that's not the case anymore. But it's
    easy. To find the Alpha store. So my thought for office times is. To run a hybrid.
    Once we're back to in person meetings i'll have my zoom room for office open,
    as well as my office door. And so, if you're on campus you can come and see me
    or if you're not on campus you can zoom me. So the website is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Where can I find this syllabus.
  persid: S07
- desc: So my is going to be on the website. soon. I had some technical difficulties.
    My.
  persid: DHH
- desc: upload it to us.
  persid: S07
- desc: sure. i'll do that right now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Right, thank you.
  persid: S07
- desc: Just locked in. let's see. Did the trick.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You, of course.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay. So I have a reference. So the first blown to bits book first came out
    in 2008. and fairly recently a second edition was published so. it's available
    online, you can buy the book. But it's available chapter by chapter. At this link.
    So let me just click on the show. web page. I thought I had this link to it. Anyway,
    Sir, the chapters. So you can download the whole thing. Or you can look at the
    individual chapters. Anyway, um. So, according to the syllabus. i've laid out
    the course. In your courses. Like the syllabus so responses to meetings. will
    be 10 marks. participation will be 10 marks. Individual assignments will be 30
    marks so that's 50. projects will be 25. And the final exam will be 25 so it makes
    100. So. I i'm the participant pool coordinator for computer science. I started
    the participant pool. Some years ago. Has anyone ever heard of. participant pool
    maybe in psychology or another computer science classes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have not.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay well so it's basically like the one in psychology. So it's a way to encourage
    your participation in departmental research. So at different times, people will.
    Researchers will have. need to go through. To do some user studies or. do some.
    Tests with users. So primarily user studies are are the things that we're dealing
    with in computer science. So if. If there are opportunities. to earn a research
    credit. i'll list them in the section of your courses, with the information. So
    you can. Put if if there are say three studies, you can participate in two of
    them up to them. and earn credits. For your participation, so if you persuade
    one study you get one bonus mark to participate in two studies, then you get two
    bonus marks. So you can. Get at most 2% towards anyone class, so if we had 33
    studies this semester that hasn't happened for a long time, but if there were
    then you could. participate in studies and get two bonus marks for this class
    and say, and if there's another class in the participant pool. You could apply
    you could get the third bonus smart. and apply it to your other class. So. The
    reason. it's. One bonus smart per study and not say 10 or 15 or 20 or 50. Is that
    it's enough to say thank you, we appreciate your engagement with research going
    on in the department. But it's not so much. to dissuade you. or. To encourage
    you to participate when you're not selling. With a little voice in your head is
    saying I don't want to do this. So we're not. reward isn't a coercive. amount.
    No it's not so much that you can't refuse to do it. Because that. that's an ethical
    issue. When we're doing user studies. We want to make sure that we have free and
    informed consent from people. So if people are not course, then the results we
    get are going to be better. and
  persid: DHH
- desc: let's see.
  persid: ???
- desc: Can you push it. Can let's. Do the hand okay well i'm good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: answer. Yes, so are you going to like upload some links, or some references
    under the search credit section there sorry the research create fiction whenever
    there's a new.
  persid: S08
- desc: If there are any issues, I will put them there and we'll talk about some I
    thought, introduce them to you, so there may not be, but if there are, they will
    appear and this under this topic.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I see. Okay, because yeah because there, I went to that website that someone
    gave a link to but like I couldn't actually find any our recent you know both
    that are up.
  persid: S08
- desc: I don't. understand the. The website you're talking about. Anyway, there aren't
    there aren't as of yet any research opportunities. That would qualify for this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Normally we get emails from this year's department to like I get emails from
    them for various research opportunities when they're available at the last day
    remember there was, I think, Dr homers research on virtual reality or vr experience.
    So you must get emails as well. From CS department about the research opportunities.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah. OK. So the participation. mark will be based on attendance and I know
    we have to do that still. Your. participation. In. Class meetings and so. What
    I asked. So you seen. The transcripts that come up so. The footprint of your.
    engage or your participation that's evidence by the. Your appearance in the transcripts
    that's another factor. The wiki.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So I understand that there's a variety of things that this is based on I was
    wondering if we get a more concrete definition of it. Like there must be some
    kind of metrics that you're using like participated 150 times over the course
    of the Semester, you know. i'm just wondering so it's not like totally subjective
    as to whether or not I know whether or not I participated.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay. I understand that so. I will answer that. More fully online or prepare
    response. and put it into our class materials this week okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S05
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S10
- desc: you're welcome. Okay. Alright, so let's go back to. Okay, so i'm going to
    the attendance page. No, I don't know where.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think the issue might be obvious, you have two different attendance tabs
    online those in attendance in. The meetings, which is where we've done our pastor
    tenants, and then in the participation you put the record your meeting attendance
    but there's nothing there, so if you go to just the meetings. Have.
  persid: S11
- desc: Sure Okay, but.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This one should be.
  persid: ???
- desc: I don't know why. I didn't change the link from the other day so. Anyway,
    thanks for pointing that out. One of the peculiarities of moodle. Okay. So. let's
    have a discussion about the videos today. suggested for your last day. What did
    you think of the Ted talk about. Moral the moral need for a moral operating system.
    Does that video stand up pretty well and it's from a few years ago. Yes, vomit.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I actually forgot to like remove the raise hand but like. I also talked about
    the moral operating system, the video that we watched. Like it was a really nice
    video when I started watching it initially I was kind of confused because he was
    talking the other way around like you know he at first. proved the other side
    wrong and then he stated what we should actually do in order to think ethically
    you know so at first i'm the. Guy he was talking about how we should look at math
    and numbers in order to make decisions in our regular regular life, for example,
    if we should actually. Go and research about what others are doing, and then you
    know and then see the statistics and and then work on our data, and then the license
    to make our. Information technology better you know, but like after he he imposed
    that side of the. argument he actually mentioned that every single human being
    has their own right and and has their own privacy, so we should not intervene
    in others, others life and give them their own privacy and not thinking about
    business all the time, you know I guess.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay. So I didn't I didn't get that he was taking a position so much as. It
    was illustrating the impacts of these choices, you make and designing systems.
    Let me. Let me see if I can do something here. To make this easier. So if you.
    Put a mark on your iPhone or android. how's that for. A poll. So, based on your
    your preference so. Right, so the discussion was about crowdsourcing decisions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: got a couple android. So people are using the chat.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh, there we are right on the board.
  persid: S12
- desc: There should be like a pencil icon at least i'm on mobile, so I see.
  persid: S13
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And then you could annotate. it's probably different on desktop.
  persid: S13
- desc: i'm going to say. It may also. be able to do. reactions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For those of you who are searching for a pencil on a desktop if you see the
    green bar saying you are viewing this thing screen by besides though there's an
    option called view options click on it click on annotate and you find the fence
    in there.
  persid: S14
- desc: yeah Thank you. I noticed that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can you do the tally for android as well.
  persid: S14
- desc: looks really hard to read here.
  persid: S13
- desc: I could be just simply too cold.
  persid: S10
- desc: So i'm i'll consider this a success so i'm going to do. i'll do a set up a
    question or pole or a choice in your courses. to capture this information. I am
    pleased that. we're getting. Although i'm not sure the person doing the check
    marks. If it's one person or many people doing the same checkmark. So this isn't.
    This isn't. Statistically valid 19 times 23 is here, but. Okay. I. certainly appreciate.
    All those. I was laughing because. The apple comment cutter. overlaid with the
    android comment. yeah So these are. These are sensitive issues aren't they I mean
    people. have strong feelings about. The. choice of. choice of operating system.
    Yes, pooja.
  persid: DHH
- desc: sorry about that.
  persid: S14
- desc: that's fine. So I. I got some news a couple of these links are from me watching
    weekend update and surname live. So interesting about. Sure, the choice between
    android and iPhone. Google is claiming that apple is. Bullying android users.
    Because they're using different colored. If you if you're sending a plain text
    message I don't think it's just android. that's. that's where the bulk of text
    messages come from. So if you use I message. And you're a cool kid quote unquote,
    then you get a blue background. And if you're using. The standard standard. SMS.
    client than your peers a green background. So I thought that was. An interesting.
    connection with the daemon haurwitz video. So the other one. Like a fun year.
    This the elmo. elmo is viral feud with Rocco the rock. So I didn't realize that
    was a video from 2004. that's making the rounds, as I saw that Allah was tweeting
    recently. To. to lower the temperature on the on the feud. Anyone familiar with.
    Anyone. Other. Exposure to the. I was looking at the chat. And i'm not sure. we're.
    not sure about the thread in the chat anyway. So the other one related to damon
    Horwitz video. Is it there's. A call from some MPs Members of Parliament for comments
    Community pro. The public health agency of canada's use of mobile data. So they.
    They had been collecting data. To support some of their modeling for coven 19.
    And it wasn't clear that this was being done. Until they asked to do it for a
    longer period. Okay, let me clear the. Okay. So it's interesting about. The whiteboard
    annotation so I. encountered this. As a way to encourage participation. In a.
    In a in a seminar and I attended last semester. Yes, so. So we're not. yeah so.
    The choice is doing a poll in. In zoom. or. doing a choice, and you are courses.
    So i'll set up. A choice. yeah it looks good doesn't it. But i'm not sure whether
    it's the same person well it's a few people. If the check marks are from the same
    person or a few or. So let's think of the trade offs with this approach. So we've
    generated a lot of. discussion. A lot of participation. But the risk is. We can
    say. Oh no. We can say that the classes split 5050 on this issue. But we can't
    make any. yeah I can't make any. Any claims those statistics. So whoa like I said
    we'll try some other things. And maybe we will agree that. The zoom Paul is the
    best way to go. i'm. I like the idea of using your courses because there's persistence.
    it's easy to have. The data persist over the Semester. Within the trade off. Well
    okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah. So I saved the screen. And i'll. i'll try and make sure that there's
    nothing. or try and read through the comments to make sure that i'm not. Sharing
    something that. I shouldn't. So that this is. And, just like that it's gone. Well,
    we just encountered here was. very similar to the issues we see on social media
    platform is when. When the discussion. becomes sidetracked. And there's so much
    going on that it's hard to. it's hard to critically analyze and. reflect on things.
    When we don't know, for example. Whether there are really. lots of people making
    individual thought. marks on the screen. or with just a couple people clicking
    the checkmark. So there's certainly some issues about. what's. what's really going
    on and is this. Encouraging freedom of expression or. Is it distracting us. From
    the important conversations that we need to have a society. So in the video David
    Horowitz ask you know, should we collect this that guy's data. We didn't. So should
    we collect his data collector data or let them be. And then. Well, but what kind
    of data were collecting and for what purpose. Is it because we want to improve
    their user experience. make things. more convenient for them, or are we suspicious
    that they might be up to no good. And then, who decides. When people have up to
    no good. there's lots of issues dorcas.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh yeah I don't know you're actually asking questions you answer, but I feel
    like the side of someone is up to no good with the data, you should compare it,
    you should compare it to the laws already in place in the land in the country.
  persid: S15
- desc: yeah so. that's a good comment. But then. What if we're. Moving so. If the
    technology that we're using is moving ahead more equipped is advancing more quickly
    than the laws. That can. That should be there to. define the appropriate behavior
    and what's permissible and not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, I feel like some things won't change, no matter like how fast the universe
    moves in computing like when it comes to like. Sexual cybercrime like pedophiles
    and stuff like that I feel like stuff like that will never change, and the only
    way, you can track down those people is by looking at their computer data and
    what they download.
  persid: S15
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I feel like. you're missing the point of like encryption encryption basically
    prevents whatever laws, you have from mattering because you know, like I like
    a criminal or. pedophile or whatever can can download as much as they want and
    then just encrypt it know like whatever laws, you have you can't break the laws
    of encryption unless you have like a quantum computer or something.
  persid: S16
- desc: yeah so there's issue of. Looking at. The data, but then there's also. Looking
    at metadata. Around the transfers, you know if people are communicating with a
    certain other computer and that certain or the computer is known to be a file
    server. For. Content that's not appropriate that's that's not legal. So. there's
    there's some room in. To pursue to pursue the activities in that way. finished
    one. You have your hand up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh yeah I think someone just mentioned that I was just about to say that privacy
    should be considered and monitoring people's data as well, we might know what
    up what personal information as possible between two between two people and privacy
    should be consistent, sir.
  persid: S10
- desc: Okay. dorcas.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, but I feel like the privacy that people are asking for it doesn't even
    exist because, once you use social media and the rest your data is already being
    sold to companies for advertising, so do you really think the government will
    care about keeping your privacy and data.
  persid: S15
- desc: showing you social media.
  persid: S16
- desc: yeah. So. lots of good discussion going on here. So I would say, generally,
    things are perhaps a bit more nuanced than. What we've touched on, so far, today,
    but we'll. we'll work on getting into some of those subtleties over the Semester.
    yeah okay so. we're kind of at the end of our day today. So with that all say
    goodbye, and thank you very much for your engagement today. And i'll. Work on
    answers to your to the questions that came up and if there are more questions
    because i've got office hours from 10 to noon. And again from. 233 30 this afternoon.
    No dentist appointment, this year, this today. I survived my appointment on Thursday.
    Anyway, so I hope you have a great third Tuesday. And Wednesday and we'll see
    you on Thursday take care, everyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks take care.
  persid: S13
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have a great day.
  persid: S10
- desc: Good day.
  persid: S17
- desc: Excuse me Prof. yeah so the link for the office hour is the same one.
  persid: S08
- desc: it's not the same zoom room no. into a different.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So so where can we get the link for the office hour to.
  persid: S08
- desc: send you our courses.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The only link that I could see is the zoom meeting link.
  persid: S08
- desc: know this, if you go up to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: zoom office link you mean. Yes, okay okay so you'll be there from 10. yeah
    okay Thank you so much, Sir, I hope you have a good rest.
  persid: S08
- desc: you're welcome thanks take care.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just have a question regarding to the participation so who will cause like
    equations and the participation pools and it's similar to the one that we you
    post in the response to meeting.
  persid: S18
- desc: yeah it's more detail.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To participation.
  persid: ???
- desc: For sure Okay, thank you.

  persid: S27
- desc: just answer not sure then
  persid: S28
- desc: What if we selected remote learning? still we need to go in-person?
  persid: S02
- desc: wasn't the second option hybrid, remote?
  persid: S14
- desc: I believe remote students would still be remote
  persid: S29
