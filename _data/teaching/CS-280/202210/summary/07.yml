Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good morning. I really got into a room and I thought. Ruse everybody, and
    then I realized, I went to the wrong room. So here, I am in the correct room.
    I think. So winter is not over yet, is it. Happy Tuesday the first day of February.
    So let me just get our attendance stuff on the way first. Okay. Now you beat me
    to it. Somebody sent me a direct message, so I had to. I had to reset that first.
    So there's a comment about or question about project proposal so. yeah I have
    cleaned up the group so we're in some of you may have noticed earlier, that there
    are a lot of empty groups in the class which were copied over from last offering
    so clean those up so that. The effect of that is that. there. There aren't any
    project groups set up presently. So, if you remember, I said, you can do either
    the. The project with a small group. up to four or do it individually. So what
    i'll do. Is i'll create a. Project groups or ever put everybody in their own project
    groups. And then, when you. If you decide to do it in a. larger than a group of
    one. When you when we receive your proposals. Indicating the members of your group.
    Then we'll adjust your project group so you only have one project group to deal
    with. Yes. So another direct message so. I don't. I don't know how it is. With
    your zoom interface for doing chats but. If you can try and keep it. So too, a.
    message everybody that would be a help. So, yes you're free to choose your own
    groups. So you can either do the project by yourself, or do it in a small group.
    A small group that you create yourselves. But what I will do in the meantime is
    create a project project groups. and put everybody in their own group. So the
    people doing them individually or. Local have will keep their group of one. And
    then the people who are wanting to work together, when you specify when you submit
    your proposal. will adjust the group memberships so that instead of, say, there
    are four people in the group that you're. Forming for the project. Then, instead
    of each of those four people each having their own group, there will be one group
    for them that contains the four of you. Does that make sense. Okay, so. can do
    it right now actually. let's. See you can see. The interface to deal with this
    in your courses. or moodle. So it's interesting. Well, maybe interesting is too
    strong a word. And I realized. That with the switching of sections. There are
    people now in both the 01 F group and zero, and our group. So when I thought there
    were. 127. Students just by looking at these two, then I realized that. there's
    some people in both lists. So the groups aren't. maintained based on registrations
    they're only set up once. So. we're not going to deal with anything that requires
    the these groups anymore. So it's just an observation so. i'm going to auto create
    groups. So the at symbol create groups with names containing letters. The hash
    symbol used to be create groups of numbers so let's do letters that's okay. everybody's
    in their own group. Everyone is sending me direct messages today in chat. Okay,
    so i'm not going to. i'm not going to reply in the chat to the questions. But
    let me read them make sure that okay. Let me get through the administrative stuff
    here first so can we do individual projects, yes. The groups try the class wiki
    stay the same right, yes, these are the class where groups. So doesn't have to
    be about a book you don't have to do a book review for the project that's one
    option that I presented. So I think if you were if you were. talking with a documentary
    or. Some other. i'm not going to try to enumerate everything, but if if you have
    an idea that you'd like to work. On with your project. And you'd like to discuss
    it with me, we can do that an office hours or. or an email or. Online somehow
    we can communicate and resolve some of those issues. Okay. So. mercy fields is
    can we talk about any topics related to privacy and civil rights, which is spying
    on surveillance. That seems quite reasonable. So. Let me not get too far into
    that right now. Okay, let me finish doing the group thing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: hey Mr happening yes. I came over fist was mentioned last class or not, because
    they're going to be any return to in class, for your class.
  persid: S02
- desc: So. You can call me Darrell that's fine you know darryl or Dr happening is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Fine.
  persid: ???
- desc: or like I said in zoom. vector happening, but. Anyway, sorry. So we decided
    in our class discussion. and Then we'll return on march 1 so if you're in the
    01 F section. will be coming back on march first.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And i'm guessing goal and out what classroom that will be in closer to march
    1. well.
  persid: S02
- desc: As I recall, is classroom 125.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay cool Thank you.
  persid: S02
- desc: So it's. it's newly renovated it's got nice seats and lots of technology in
    there. So. It should should be nice, so we have fewer people now in the face to
    face section. But.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I was signed up for the face to face and I didn't bother to change amaze will
    go to the in person rather meet you. Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah so it's. i'm feeling i'm feeling. i'm eager to return to face to face
    meetings and i'm also anxious to turn to face to face meetings, because. Things
    are still. still happening. yeah they're definitely yeah. anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I haven't even been to the university yet so it's going to be an experience
    in itself. Everything so far has been done on zoom.
  persid: S02
- desc: Oh. So you're in your second year.
  persid: DHH
- desc: first year. first year.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well, can it can also then if you're in your second year and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah cuz I could have started at the beginning of covert to technically yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: i'm in my second year of into the university.
  persid: S03
- desc: But there's probably quite a few of us here that aren't a are having been
    to the university at all, yet.
  persid: S02
- desc: As interesting oh.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And so.
  persid: ???
- desc: With a notice to the people who are online. They may not actually be in Regina.
    So it's. there's a lots of. There are lots of rewards to being online in terms
    of. Being able to manage. participation from. From almost any location.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That.
  persid: ???
- desc: means right because. Like a lot of us, maybe work or maybe. Like because I
    work full time and having everything online is very convenient for me, but you
    don't get the niceties that come with you know going to the university or the
    experience of going to it's about.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. So it's. it's easier to be. disconnected I think. or just. Just to be.
    are not fully connected anyway, I mean. And so, this is a risk we can point out
    to that uh. it's apparent there's maybe the the risks to mental health. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You don't have the same stimulus for interaction with people who don't that
    social connection we actually get from being with people as a lot less nowadays
    and ends up bringing on more depression or anxiety, for example. yeah so.
  persid: S02
- desc: I just wanted to say that there are resources for suit for you. And for me
    because it's i'm not immune to this either. So, so if you're. Having. issues and
    you want to have someone to discuss it with. You can talk to me but they're also
    mental health professionals available. Mental health resources for you. And I.
    I will post those. alright. So let me get back to making the project groups. So
    i'm saying everyone who's enrolled as a student. So i'm not. i'm not going to
    take them from a grouping that exists already. Okay, so we can. Okay, so this
    should do the trick let's do a preview. Okay, so that looks good. where's the
    button to. submit okay. OK, so now, the question of project. groups which are
    members of the pride the grouping project. So now if you're working individually,
    you can go ahead and submit. Your proposal. So that that technical hurdle is removed.
    So I would say, when you list for those of you who are doing a project in a group,
    if you list your group members. and include. everyone's you Regina. ID like for
    me that would be http ti n G D Epping D. If you include that that would be the
    most straightforward way to. be arranged the project groups.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor were you supposed to find this, you have our courses ID.
  persid: S04
- desc: So. it's your. it's the email. address. Before the at sign.
  persid: DHH
- desc: into three letters and writing right. At time thing.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, thank you.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay, so there we go that's one thing sorted out. Now I want to go over the.
    Results from our. filter bubble test activity. So I wrote a little Python script
    to. To processing here. Everyone see that's shared screen now with this list to
    search engines.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You betcha.
  persid: S02
- desc: Thank you for that enthusiasm at 830 in the morning well it's nine o'clock
    now so. You get gets a little bit easier, as far as i'm concerned.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So be fair, this is my evenings I worked all night so. Good morning and good
    evening it's all the same.
  persid: S02
- desc: Right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's based on.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: So what I did was. If any of you familiar with Python. I made a dictionary,
    and then I went through the. spreadsheet which contains the search engine result
    search engine used. And the three URLs to harass to provide. So, then, I use the
    answers as keys in the dictionary so every time, so the first time. An answer
    was given. A store to one for that key so. And then, for each subsequent time
    that same answer was given a increment account. So we have lots of. Different
    variations on Google. So the thing about. Having all these google's. So the Google
    that appears at the top of the list. seems to be. The Google search engine. But
    Google chrome. is less clear because that's a web browser. So this might be in.
    Maybe an example of them. The fish is not knowing. The meaning of water. right
    because. we're on our laptops or computers or desktops or phones. And we're looking
    things up. But. When we do a search. or researching in the browser or researching.
    With. I was searching by pointing the browser add another. website that provides
    the search engine capabilities. That makes sense. So there's a little duck duck
    go. So those are the three search engines that are talked about. How many beings
    okay so three duck duck goes, I think we had about a five responses so. Thank
    you for your participation. 455 duck duck goes. And this last line one with the
    region searching disabled. So that's an interesting capability, because if you
    disable the searching then that's another.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think I might have missed doing this, you can add another one to duck duck
    go. Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: um. So it's not an assignment. So if you if you missed out there'll be other
    chances to do things. And I just. Like I said it for noon yesterday originally
    so that I have a bit of time to. Review things. So I. pushed it back to four.
    Anyway, so if you have a chance if you notice them, you have a chance to do them
    that's great but. it's not going to negatively affect your. you're standing in
    class, so I don't wanna. I don't want to make it about. Adding. Just thinking
    about checking completing activities, but then. i'd rather have you think about
    what's going on and have some fun. With this and. i'll stop rambling. So what
    I can. I didn't think about doing this before. But another way for me to present
    the results would be to. Look at the search engine. So Google duck duck go bang.
    Those are. Three well established search engines. Is anyone heard of client before.
    Right. So client is from the. So another thing that I noticed. So that does go
    has the here, let me. Go to my web browser we can look at the pages for each of
    them. Okay, so this is what Google search looks like.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If you're trying to show something currently we still see your terminal.
  persid: S02
- desc: Right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: ???
- desc: problem.
  persid: S02
- desc: So this is what the Google home screen looks like. So what I noticed. it's
    available on being compared to Google is. A way to deal with. dates. To. Can narrow
    the search. To the past week. Okay, so that CBC news story appeared in the number
    two position. But i'm looking for. So that's without. Turning on location. So
    we can turn on Canada. Then. Then the cnbc article comes up here and number four
    position. yeah that's right so. three. The third organic search results. One is
    not paid for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm Professor i'm pretty sure duck duck go um I can't remember there was also.
    The one search engine where it plants trees, they both actually get their search
    queries from Google and bing. So Google and bing are the only people that actually
    do search results because of the amount of data that they need to get and what
    Dr go does is they pay Google for the results, but they don't give any data to
    Google for the results.
  persid: S04
- desc: when's the last time you read something about that because duck duck go has
    actually.
  persid: S02
- desc: switch and they they might be being, I think, Dr Koh might be being and then
    the other, it was yeah. Eco SIA is is with Google, then.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay yeah cuz I I think duck duck go switched in.
  persid: S02
- desc: Right.
  persid: S04
- desc: They did dead. yeah ya know they fully corey and and deliver all of their
    information now.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S04
- desc: So that's. that's an interesting topic for. investigation. Just how. much
    difference is possible if we're only using. One or two sources, even though we
    have different trends. To facilitate the search. it's a bit like. browsers because
    there's own I think there's only. Two main. engines for browsers there's chromium
    and. And the firefox which is mozilla i'm not sure what the name. don't quote
    me on that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just like to update that i'm actually wrong, it was another engine I quickly
    looked it up it's not duck duck go if they have a hybrid engine now, instead of
    just pure farm.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: because, from what I remember reading was i'm like they tried to do it themselves,
    but the amount of data that they need in order to have web crawlers on every single
    website to. have them ranking in a in a search query the only two companies that
    can afford to do anything like that is Microsoft and Google, from what I remember.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah okay. So thanks for the clarification, the firefox engine is named gecko
    not. mozilla.
  persid: DHH
- desc: mozilla is the parent company of.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah that's right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ???
- desc: Let me. Come back to the Google one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You think amazon's ever going to get started up in it, seeing as they have
    so much power now.
  persid: S02
- desc: When they already control pretty much 30% of all web hosting.
  persid: S04
- desc: Exactly, so why wouldn't they be able to host it with that much data right
    i'm surprised, they haven't jumped into that yet if they don't already provide
    a back end for somebody else.
  persid: S02
- desc: Like it would be another big situation, though, people are way to use to Google.
  persid: S04
- desc: But what if they provide the back end to somebody that is already hosting
    in known for that isn't you know, a big.
  persid: S02
- desc: All Amazon does really as host a web services they don't. Like. The way Google
    ranks your results, is it has these trackers that every single time you use Google
    to click on a link it puts a tracker on that website, in order to see how many
    times it gets used in order to rank it in Google, so that happens yeah web crawlers
    and that happens, through. multiple uses of Google and Google has over. When was
    it when did it come out like 2005 so we've had all that head start to develop
    that much data which Amazon, we need to start from scratch. So no. i'm.
  persid: S04
- desc: You make a very good point it is something that it's not easy to just start
    and get into you can't just all of a sudden, be a big player without having big
    player data already there, I agree.
  persid: S02
- desc: And there's also. Not everyone is going to Google or bing to do web searches
    they they may do web searching they may do searches within. websites. as well,
    so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But once the cookies placed and it's tracking from the first click doesn't
    matter how many links you go deeper you.
  persid: S02
- desc: Know like the Web crawlers they'll go on the website and they'll check stuff
    like how many times, a term is mentioned in that website, or how many websites
    link to that website as like a reference.
  persid: S04
- desc: And so yeah but the. Mr happening here was talking about. When you actually
    use Google or chrome. anytime you click on a link it's already implanted cookie
    or tracker to see how far and how much and how often and what you're looking at
    to bring all that data back to Google to analyze and see and kind of provide better
    results to.
  persid: S02
- desc: Do you know they're actually getting rid of that they're going to start doing
    more of what they do on like mobile. So, right now, they need cookies which track
    you all over the web and they get saved on your computer. But other competitors
    use cookies so what google's going to start doing is using a unique identifier,
    because almost everyone has a Google account. And so you'll have like a like a
    Google ID essentially that follows you around the Internet and that's how they're
    going to get their data, instead of cookies they're going to totally get rid of
    cookies off Google chrome.
  persid: S04
- desc: So if you use. Like incognito mode, for example. It technically none of your
    like browsing history or cookies or site data they're they're not saved on on
    your device. So.
  persid: S05
- desc: they're not saved on your device but they're still collect like if you use
    incognito it's still. filter by everyone.
  persid: S04
- desc: not collected there they're not saved anywhere they're just analyze.
  persid: S02
- desc: But not saved on your computer but.
  persid: S04
- desc: No, no. can't find your incognito browsing history on your Google account
    it's not there.
  persid: S02
- desc: You can but. Why wouldn't they just state that data for themselves.
  persid: S04
- desc: fair but if they do actually do what their privacy policy states and not go
    directly against it, then they technically don't store that data.
  persid: S02
- desc: Privacy policy I don't think it's a legally binding document, so I don't think
    they really. have a history of doing stuff like that. I wouldn't trust it too
    much, if you do value privacy don't think it got me those way to get around it.
  persid: S04
- desc: Oh, I don't think it is a way of getting around it, I agree, but i'm just
    saying that. Privacy policy is still a binding contract and you can take that
    to court it's something that is law abiding. yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: thanks for the.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And yeah leave. Your ISP conceal that because they just see packets that's
    all they care about.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, so let me get back to our. search engine. pages so i'm back on Google.
    and Nothing. that's that's interesting clicking on tools changes the line below
    the. The header there. It is available, but how many people. filtering based on
    date. is available, how many people. realize. You could bring that up by clicking
    on tools. What happens if we. choose another locale. So this is client. Let me
    go back to Canada. um okay. So that CBC article is there again. So let me before
    we get. To the end of our meeting here, let me go through some of the results.
    Go back to this. So. In this case, i've combined. All three or else. So if URL
    appears in any of those in the first, second or third positions. i'm counting
    it the same way. So the most. The one that occurs, the most. Is from the CDC in
    the United States vaccines coburn 19 considerations. But 6060 times that appear.
    And then. De sh.ca.gov. I want to say, the US Department of Homeland. that's wrong
    way around. But it's a California. State Government website here. And then. That
    was almost. As a frequently occurring 58. And then the CBC news. result. And then,
    then they start taking a. Quite a drop off. So those first three and then. Another
    the CDC. And then. There are two versions. Of the same CBC website web story.
    The same. Numbers here. trinity health.org edmonton ctv. National review. down
    here. There are a couple. APP state.edu. bubble point test. So there were, I noticed
    a couple searches done on filter bubble test instead of covert vaccine triage.
    And then I also noticed here there's. These aren't. These are bread crumbs from
    the search. From the result page and not the URL. So. I will do. Another breakdown
    based on search engine. not put that online. So. Anything catch your attention
    in the news over the weekend, since our last meeting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Does this gatlin is going to go mask lists after February 4 or whatever.
  persid: S02
- desc: And, seeing that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: eskimo was talking about how he's going to remove the band after February
    for throwing out the band, the implementation of masks and requirements.
  persid: S02
- desc: yep saskatchewan is dropping off.
  persid: S06
- desc: Also, when a Scott mode announced this they didn't have the medical doctor
    that's always with him I can't remember his name. They later interviewed him like
    two hours later and he's like i'm. At we'll see we'll see about this and then.
    Basically, nothing happened, he was never put on the news again after that. He
    wasn't agreeing with Scott. A few, if I can find you a set date.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. So I looked last night and. What I heard was he was looking to remove
    the. vaccine passport. As soon as possible. yeah so. there's lots of. Lots of
    conway stuff going on. But to focus on. Your most. pronouncements over the weekend.
    He made a claim. That vaccination does not help transmission is not reduced transmission
    of the virus.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah my apologies, it was a vaccine mandate on masks I got a link here wasn't.
    Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: Thanks. So what i'd like to. discuss with you is how do we evaluate. The statement
    that vaccine vaccinations don't. Help us transmission of on the Crown. crown.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Considering there's no active testing on people that are vaccinated it's really
    hard to officially say real numbers on it.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: There are there been breakthrough infections, but there's also. severely limited
    testing and there's no. mechanism for the government to track rapid antigen tests.
  persid: DHH
- desc: there's also nothing built into the vaccine itself but prevents you from transmitting
    it, the only thing about seeing was supposed to do is prevent you from getting
    the serious illness and life threatening parts of covert.
  persid: S02
- desc: That is entirely incorrect. At the beginning, they said you don't catch it
    you don't transmit it you don't nothing, it is the end of covert is what they
    claimed that was what I was supposed to do. we'll.
  persid: S07
- desc: Find out the beginning, but they are quickly followed up with always no way
    entirely just there to help you not die.
  persid: S02
- desc: Definitely not quick. The gentle retreat over time to now over the past year.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah the unfortunate thing with the general public when they don't necessarily
    have a whole lot experience science is they don't realize that sometimes things
    change like. You don't have all the information right away, sometimes it can be
    a little bit Gray, and so. You know they modify. What they say over time, based
    on the science, you know.
  persid: S08
- desc: and If everyone around the world had been able to be vaccinated. Good two
    shots of. Pfizer or Madonna or astra zenica or. move Those are the three big ones
    that i'm aware of.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Amazon Johnson yes that's right Johnson Johnson the single shot of Johnson
    and Johnson.
  persid: S06
- desc: Had vaccine nation been possible. immediately when when they were developed
    and approved for emergencies and parts of the world. There would have been much
    less opportunity for a variance of concern like delta and AMI cron. To develop.
    and refer, so the finding is that the vaccines are less effective. With a new
    variants but at the same time. So. diverse. Originally it was 95% effectiveness
    against infection now it's lower around 70% I believe. But I. I will have to check
    the numbers.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But how do you prove the numbers when they don't actively test the people
    who are vaccinated.
  persid: S07
