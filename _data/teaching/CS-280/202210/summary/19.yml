Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: All right, for the camera new and zoom.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, sir.
  persid: S01
- desc: testing. Maybe I don't need to add on for this size. person, but anyway. Here
    we go. So, generally, I, like my my macbook air very much but. It gave me a lot
    of problems over the weekend. So I went I finally upgraded. To Monterey. MAC os
    12 point. Point three so latest version. So, usually i'm skeptical. upgrade before
    information services tells me that the still build print and so forth, but. I
    just. needed to do something for my computer and that seems to be helping a bit.
    Although it's not quite as doesn't seem to be working just as soon as i'd like
    it yet. Anyway, so that put me behind on. The blood critique promises that I made
    on Thursday. That was we'll talk about that briefly here. Today I think i've got
    audio sharing screen. turn on the projector. Anything missing. class. Okay, so
    this should be a sample for teeth. that's Another thing I noticed after upgrading
    Microsoft word which I don't like. So my favorite, but it will do. It will print
    will make a PDF copy from the. Word document, so I had to. Take a screenshot.
    that's why it's such a poor resolution but gets you the ideas there. So as soon
    as two parts evaluating according to the rubric for a blog entry so there's four
    criteria there. And then. Okay, for a critique this is sort of an outline. You
    can add some more detail but that's the general form of what i'm. Looking for
    for critique so. Tell me how tell us or explain. evaluate the blog entry, according
    to the rubric for blog entries and then top of. What was written.
  persid: DHH
- desc: inside.Like to do attendance.
  persid: ???
- desc: thanks for the reminder said in the chat. Okay, thanks. Okay, so. So some
    of you may have. interpreted the layout of the blog entries in the class blog.
    and come to a different result and I can't because. This to me they weren't necessarily
    clearly in chronological order. But, so I left and I. find your order for. 43
    blog entries that were in the past blog. So. If you if you didn't share your blog
    entry with the class blog. one. If you have like we don't have. A blog that you
    looked at already. picked one from this list. And in communication with somebody
    else trying to think differently from the other people in class. And if your name
    is on the list. But I am Australian before was going from if you're in. First
    position. And you look at the person in the second position here at the end is
    less than 43rd entry then you're lucky, the first one. If you haven't already.
    Take to a blog entry look at. That make sense. So early. we're not sharing people's
    work we don't want to have the work shared. It still gives you the opportunity
    to critique. To look at other examples and. Okay, so that's what's on there and
    I set the due date for. A week from Monday, a week from yesterday. So let's look
    further mission behind that. Okay, so here's our attendance. question the chat
    saying our law marks, based on the critique. Now this 16 marks for the blog or
    not based on the key to receive. And then fats. it's not so much about giving
    feedback to the author as getting experience. Thinking about. ideas. critiquing
    someone else's work. yeah. works to. So. let's see comments from our seal so i'll
    try and address that. Or else we'll start the conversation on that. And then.
    A little bit later. So the. assignment. is to think about. How well the website
    supports you in. answering questions you might have. So, as the content valuable
    if you think of the questions you'd like to answer. you've got you think you should
    be able to answer from a web page. Can you do that, or is there something missing.
    sense. So for the final. there's a question in the chat asked me if you could
    provide a sample for the assessment. Okay, oh. That line. So before. The end of
    the Semester mentioned that it did look at the form of the feedback that was provided.
    And I think he can all see the answers now. Because it's closed.
  persid: DHH
- desc: here.yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: See you can see all the responses. So 59 so let's ask the people in class
    bye. The comments. are reasonable. There are some things which. are not easy for
    me to do and so Those are the things that. are less easy to do for me. So I keep.
    Working on them. So I know we spend a lot of time talking about assignments. we're
    also engaging in some useful discussions as well. So if you have any thoughts
    about that. i'll do this again at the end of the Semester. So they're also the
    the falcon of science student experience warm you'll receive an email about that.
    At some point. So keep an eye out for that. So i'm thinking. question. i'm not
    sure exactly is how to manage.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The.
  persid: ???
- desc: situation. If we have. The people who are registered in 01 F section. Section.
    Come to class and write. The quiz far. Sir. People here on paper. People come
    here also do it on your courses. So they're just a few technical issues that I
    have to. Get sorted out. And then i'm gonna be all right sal next class no. So
    there were two parts, so you'd have 24 hours or some length of time to do yesterday.
    And then there are also be a portion. Of the black Sir. Name design contest. that's
    a good point. Learning model iphones a tiny screen, or maybe a flip phone or something
    like that. If we're going to do it that way, would it make more sense to let people
    read. Well, so i'm just wondering if I can. If I can let people right online from
    home for the whole thing. I just want to make sure that i'm not breaking any rules.
    Right now okay so there's lots of work. Think we're pretty good. impression that
    there are rules. there's a lot of rules that don't get that for weird reasons.
    Okay well. So i'm always interested in having sounds that are fair assessment
    of our. progress during the Semester. So. Be maybe get everybody. got sides, they
    can see the board that i'm writing on that's being jacketed zoom. anyway. So that
    is so i'm just going to figure out some of these details about between the face
    to face sections of the requirements for those. and So you have questions for
    justin question questions. With answers that you like to propose for the exam.
    I would happily accept those. If you don't submit questions and answers i'm not
    going to have an exam. So that's not a way out. But. My idea is to get to involve
    you in. The discussion about what makes a fair assessment of your larynx. Okay.
    Where would those be submitted. We can do the. Question and fine. This. Online
    con dash close very close friends. This is that still makes. People understood
    oh it's not it's not Nice. At all crafted to the launch. Then. These. People who
    put. This. This was not a serious article that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: said.
  persid: ???
- desc: The people who did this had some issues. So this will be the preferred form.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Extra space.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay. yeah. Any questions or concerns. Come all things. News here Center.
    The prank videos. protections against. videos that are things that are not to
    pick reality in a certain way that's not real. How can we. Can we decide. with
    lots of things going on around us. there. Are. sources of which are hard to identify.
    How do we. maintain our footing in reality. So, again with this cookies announcement.
    i'll try yet, so let me review my settings before I continue my visit here. settings.
    that's. misleading. box, I think. So it's not. promise they're both separate cookie.
    The link good to go anywhere near a place like that. So other websites do other
    websites are compliant with the gdpr. Regulations. They let you say I like strictly
    necessary cookies are functional cookies are I mean they have is a. well established
    interface for adults. But we don't have that recording legal requirement and Canada.
    would be nice, though. So this is another one that is going to find out what is
    your initial post viral. So this is an example of how. Diplomatic unorthodox diplomatic
    move. So that having the title of the article doesn't. Even worse is that sensational
    than the article itself and then. So the intent of the tree was to retrieve the
    cannons product of diplomacy and rushes invasion of the Korean and provide transparency,
    this information being spent by the Russian mission to. Would you say this as
    a. SAS possibilities for. Deployment as a means for. and supporting our diplomatic
    efforts and policy. Just. like this. i'm gonna. i'm going to turn off microphones
    and then, if you want to. You can unmute yourself again. didn't sound like. A
    comment as much as the microphone turned on by state. or there's a question asking
    what do you mean by effects, I can send people down there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For.
  persid: ???
- desc: Their videos in this case. represent the truth are fabricated. But they're
    done in a very convincing way, so people who look at them uncritically might say.
    wow. St Louis happened there. In they may contribute to the. To the evidence that
    people refer to, and support, are there any conspiracy theories, for example.
    That makes sense in terms of an explanation. Comments for that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just like to mention, though they're not always used with a malicious intent,
    I guess, like they're using movies. To. Show like the aging of the actors and
    stuff like in Star Wars I think they use the PICs.
  persid: S03
- desc: Right so, is it a deep thing isn't a deep fake if it's. done transparently
    so say that. The. way they act actor Yang again to play. to play a role so in
    Star Wars and. Star Wars movies, are finished. So one of the actor, the actor,
    who played princess leia passed away, so I think. They had to rely on footage
    they had available but also. I think they generate a few seeing a few looks. From
    archive images to. Just one example, and then. there's a new movie on netflix
    called the Irishman, I think, with. This is done a couple years ago, I think.
    But they had. These characters who are. are getting old now so but they had a
    lot of footage where they were shown to be younger. And now it's done with computer
    graphics. So anything so it's not a thing if it's clear if we're clear about using.
    technology to simulate a. Come. The things I noticed in the news that were relevant
    to our class discussions here. I wanted to just point out a link to the problem
    that I mentioned last week. So. Firstly, came from the social, this is. written
    in the second during the Second World War, or shortly after. by German pastor.
    version Harris First they came for the Socialists I didn't speak up because I
    was not a socialist and they came from the trade unionist and I didn't speak up
    because I was not three units and they came for the Jews and did not speak up
    because I was not a Jew. And they came from me and there's no one left speak for
    me. So there are lots of different versions of that that's. Maybe a starting point,
    if you're interested in looking for. So following. The top I mentioned the idea
    of using artificial intelligence to. evaluate. logical structure and argument.
    see whether we can detect fallacies. And I realized that I had a few things. I
    found a few things but. I have to find them again. discussion because. well. Essentially,
    because of my computer problems I have again. But. So there is some work in using
    artificial intelligence to. violate fake news. Back to be free to work with us
    online set up, I can do that. So. These are. Things that seem reasonable. But
    they don't have a firm logical foundation. So there's another names for as well,
    but I think this is. Ideas so it's a fallacy of misplaced concreteness. And what
    that does. So if we have a model. That something. And we say that the model. We
    reason about the. The real thing, based on the law so we we assert we. treat the
    Bible as being a real thing. So it misplaced concreteness with the model, instead
    of actual phenomena. What seems to be a. Good one for computer scientists to be
    aware of. Since we often talk about. abstraction and. modeling a system or simplifying
    a system in terms of its. Some a few key attributes and. We try and model behavior
    based on that which we can code. And so. about an object oriented approach, for
    example. My think of things would be the printing. Think of a better example,
    or maybe not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: excited to be here. So maybe this is. The reason I brought it up is because
    we have this model. Time here so. it's a way to. Think about this place, concreteness
    if we. Think about our design system. that's being. We treat that as a real thing
    instead of. A model that we've created what's limitations Anyway, thank you very
    much for today. Thank you for those of you on zoom. Take care have a good day.
    So have office hours today. From time to time from noon to three to 330. Otherwise,
    see you on Thursday take care, have a. Great day.
