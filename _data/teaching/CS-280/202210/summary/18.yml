- desc: Okay. Anyone here come to the last night. Little biased, because my friend,
    but. I thought you did a very good job of explaining in general terms, how is
    you how they're using. Ai to help. Real progress and improving health care. Thanks.
    Just saw. So I made some promises about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: peak and.
  persid: ???
- desc: I was. Under the weather yesterday. started. today. Discussing last day. talk
    a little bit about that are, and the question is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, can you see my questions. board.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah OK so.
  persid: S02
- desc: i'll read it out. So there's the password for attendance today just through
    nine as a reminder so last day we talk asked Is it permissible for instagram to
    permit the sudden death, the invaders to be shared on its platform. So following
    with that is this action, supported by the same code of ethics. Was responsibility
    is. Is the is the erosion of trust and media and public institutions. And we as
    future. semester. Or the kind of very future computing professionals, do we have
    an obligation in this regard. To. deal with a revision of trust. But does it mean
    for us to uphold the code of ethics and what are the opportunities we have to
    act. for the public good, in this regard I guess. So your questions are coming.
    And we'll have a discussion groups and then we'll. discussion. So. example. Think
    about that. You heard of the program called eliza from the 1960s. So it was. developed
    at MIT. And the idea was that they would. use a very simple approach to. Formulating
    questions. In the style of. The therapist might ask. So didn't have any. understanding
    of. What what this person is responding. To. edit. It asked the right questions
    of the prompts encourage the person to talk. about what was happening their lives,
    and so the perfect Professor who developed this was shocked by the amount of track.
    The. conversations that people are having with this program that wasn't doing
    anything. Other than a period to understand and be an empathetic listener. You
    know, so much so that. When people are using this program you know they didn't
    want people around because they were. They entered personal details in response
    to the questions generated by the Program. Well, I guess eliza was a different
    version of the program than doctors, the one i'm talking about. That he. use the
    same by people's reaction and people's willingness. place trust in the Program.
    Instead of other people. And he stopped working in the field. of artificial intelligence
    about plants. So, possibly to that story. In your own interactions. We feel like.
    computer programs are more objective. You can trust it if the computer says it's.
    says it so more so than talk to somebody else from friends or relatives gives
    you information. Okay, so. let's take come on to talk about this sort of this
    questions give you some food for discussion. So let's. six groups Boston let's
    do that again. Class here. It can get into one group, if you like. too small.
    Not. Just.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it's.Just.Such a.Good spread.People were.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah one to go with that point does it's not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: just giving people access to people.Who are.responsible.
  persid: ???
- desc: for the greater good of the public, because.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To.Be.
  persid: ???
- desc: Very good allowed an outlet for people or outrage. To express themselves in
    this matter where.
  persid: DHH
- desc: they're.Good people.
  persid: ???
- desc: are in.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Russia, where they are in Russia or.Hearing major.Major on.
  persid: ???
- desc: Later, get smaller. People.
  persid: DHH
- desc: there.awesome.
  persid: ???
- desc: So, allowing you know. Our.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can you move a little bit out of the way, so I can get a screen cap of this
    question, please. Thank you very much.
  persid: S03
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: awesome i'm good to go Thank you so.
  persid: S03
- desc: Much. For.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.yeah.yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: First of all, let's face a little bit sense because it's. about the word find
    the pressure of the Russian Government people to change their decision and all
    people care about words that. sound like that so. Trying to affect those institutions
    and businesses puts pressure on the Russian people. For better for worse and.
    The ideas for the event that much pressure on the government for that to change
    their decisions about that I agree with decision but effectively that's the rationale,
    but I. yeah. Reliable trustworthy people may think i've done. Anything interesting
    computer rather than a person well, if you want them to test on that. Computer
    so that was the new studies found that it's right and the other people know it's
    right so. Sometimes on factual information and talking to the person is much easier
    to. kind of correct does the nail double check they'll walk it through a forest
    near they're more likely to spots sometimes they don't but consumers either yes
    or no, what there's no way to. For the computer to verify the information.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.it's super.option one.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah. Situation excited about figure it's just like prompting questions and
    but the responses in that early computer like it does that changes activates on
    the discussion questions to me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's what it's like if you were like to do and.I think, even in like the
    justice system are things.
  persid: ???
- desc: That we talked about our. biases ago but just because of our program with
    a black person had this sort of high in a way for service or vice versa, will
    be leading the higher view events or the white person, even though they have the
    same issue, so it's not it's. Only. me evening yeah learning based off of information
    if the information. is still good. This.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is that people are conditions but.
  persid: ???
- desc: Those morning. It may be with to reflect in your work.
  persid: DHH
- desc: With.
  persid: ???
- desc: Because you have a very specific problem that's like not just a general thing
    like. Even even talk to the people that are just. Like oh it's so many steps just
    not you so that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: brings us to our next question.
  persid: ???
- desc: Is from getting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: notification.
  persid: ???
- desc: So yeah. it's just it's just more aware about can use. different tools are
    errors and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Do.Some.Each.
  persid: ???
- desc: Like, for example in scrappy would be obligated to either not our agents restrictions
    or increased instructions that working is. The new situation. Responsibility trust.
  persid: DHH
- desc: responsible for.media.But.
  persid: ???
- desc: No brakes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: On instagram.to relax.
  persid: ???
- desc: Day.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You should be.
  persid: ???
- desc: it's hard to do that, though, just because this media there's. Well, they
    probably a certain message they can get. well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You can.
  persid: ???
- desc: They can market themselves to search and subscriber groups if it propagates
    certain messages, so if they're right wing media that package right big messages
    they can market themselves right when people are the same, but that said extremist
    groups.
  persid: DHH
- desc: conspiracy theory.
  persid: ???
- desc: They may not be able to market themselves as many people as possible, but
    they don't have to compete with other people, because they only have to say, a
    certain message, whether that message is true or not. Because of that, I think,
    responsibility should Government also responsibility to make sure that these companies
    are. Providing rely truthful information at their sources are. world. Where there's
    there's data from because it's long as companies have a vested interests.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Their.
  persid: ???
- desc: Economics market who they're selling their messages to to to. Say certain
    things but it's some government regulations and sub matter what. If this responsibility
    to regulate inflammation spread by social media.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This.
  persid: ???
- desc: is a possibility that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: They are strictly more.
  persid: ???
- desc: media.
  persid: DHH
- desc: means that.
  persid: ???
- desc: So, if it comes back responsibility.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To ensure.
  persid: ???
- desc: To me. Alongside the. stupid. Okay, so this is a good place to come back to
    ever get to get together. Good discussion and sound like. zoom. Good discussion
    online. Yes, I did I didn't do it. Just when I said let's get back together the
    group by when they closed. Thank you for keeping the. Google search for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: contacts.
  persid: ???
- desc: discussions. I suppose, for the first question one last date that the ritual
    first grams per second we shared on a platform. We mostly just I know. These readings
    reading these kinds of messages and. impacts people or responsible left, such
    as racism against Russia, the general. And these messages can absolutely scan.
    be associated worse. Okay. So that we should keep a high standard for communication
    online. Put your hand up, I can call on you. So. So, whose responsibility for
    keeping online or keeping the current conversations related to facts.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We.
  persid: ???
- desc: aren't sure we debated whether.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Think it's should be responsible.
  persid: ???
- desc: To at some level.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To promote truth but same time I don't want.
  persid: ???
- desc: Either one. Saying. So we make arguments. That are sound logically sound.
    So I mentioned the other day, and what a slippery slope. not always a fallacy
    to talk about the slippery slippery slope. But. It is if one thing happens, then
    the worst possible outcomes guaranteed. So it's a fallacy would think. The initial
    action is always going to lead to the worst outcome so there's no other alternatives.
    possible. So that doesn't help us to make sound arguments. across these other.
    So. we'll talk about that some more on. Tuesday Okay, so that's one. thing capture
    those ideas all right any questions from zoom. Anyone still have a keyboard connected
    and zoom. Type yes oh indeed Okay, there you go. Thank you. Any comments on here
    i'm going to erase this now. discussion. He said, with the cat the issue of trust
    be addressed by eating more artificial intelligence said not really because I
    it depends on what. is like with the situation you explain when the response didn't
    matter too much, it can help, but there are situations where people who build
    the if they have biases they're still going to show up in the air. mentioned last
    night. So I thought came to me last night with doctors. So they were using. artificial
    intelligence to understand. pathology reports. and Are to analyze. Coming out
    sort of like a Google search and these medical records. And they can answer questions
    about. Which organs are involved in. diagnosis and. What kinds of tumors where.
    This is related to cancer Center data. Oh that's good to know file server concert
    11 is down. So it could discover the structure of these reports and answering
    creation answer questions about them, so when we do the same kind of thing to
    avoid disruption. Oh. me improvising a. classroom full of students. So one application
    that that special talked about last night was. doing a bit of pre processing so
    that some of the reports that the physicians will complete could be filled in
    with some details. So that might save the physician some time hearing the reports
    and it almost might also highlight some aspects. Of the X Ray or the images might
    warrant further. Examination or maybe focus. Of the direction in which the doctor
    writing the report could focus. His or her attention. So it wouldn't it's not.
    Some flat supplanting the physician but. supporting their. Their work and. Making.
    streamlining the workflow and. allowing them to spend more time on the things
    that they've very their most qualified to do. The one that. So I think that everybody
    has been the public launch, so the ones in the public blog those are clear if
    you print something in the public blog. And you can critique the one that follows
    years. We didn't. put it in the public blog I will. fill in the rest of those
    in and assign. same blog entries to the people who aren't in the cupboard flock.
    To make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For the Blocker take that follows my blog to taking the one that was before
    me or the afternoon.
  persid: S04
- desc: I think I said after let me. Say that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: It was posted after so whether regardless of whether it appears before after
    like a kind of higher displaying. The one isn't as a timestamp later than yours,
    the next one. yeah okay thanks. Okay, and i'll get that sorted out today. knows
    which hasn't blocked to critique. Any other comments about. Our discussion here.
    Do we ask future computing professionals have another edition of the trigger the
    sort of agreed that we definitely do have an obligation, because. Growing individuals
    we might have biases that we are aware of it, but even if we are aware of that
    we should take action to correct it as soon as we get knowledge about. Thinking
    from time to time with the quote by Martin knievel after the Second World War.
    And he says First they came for. And it's been adopted different things, but.
    First they came for anchor and that that that. structure, the first again for
    one group and I wasn't involved with that group, so I didn't do anything, and
    then they came for the next group and I didn't do anything and then, finally,
    they came for me and there is a way to object. So I think that's. In terms of
    responsibilities, I think we have it's not just speaking out for. People who are.
    Like us, the ingredients that we can identify with. We have a larger responsibility
    because we don't. uphold that responsibility, then. we're we're we're not leaving
    ourselves we're not protecting ourselves, so the best way to protect ourselves
    is to protect others. Anyway, we'll continue with that on Tuesday. And i'll i'll
    get i'll deal with all my promises about the critique of the blog today so i'll
    get things online. Thank you for your attention today. thanks for the big crowd
    today in class. and have a good weekend take care. And I have office hours now
    can lose 233 30 on zoom anyway. To come to my office in person, you can do that
    as well. Okay, thanks again everyone take care.
