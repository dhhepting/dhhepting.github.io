    in zoom. morning people in class. here. little bit. your attendance. questions.
    Silence for the blog was due on Friday and then proposal to resubmit. yesterday.
    That goes smoothly. So for the. Top of the markers tomorrow and we'll figure this
    out, but. By the end of next week. So we'll say we'll. Be back next week. So remember
    the idea was if you posted your blog entry. blog. be asked to Assad to repeat
    the. One before I don't remember. yeah fall asleep. To the here, the first. One
    after. The.
  persid: DHH
- desc: First, one.
  persid: ???
- desc: Many people everybody share them in the last block, so I might have to. send
    me some files. You that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: it's looking at sin. That was pretty clear.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Actually it's not clearly visible from the camera if you if you can adjust
    a little to the right.
  persid: S02
- desc: turn up, I can try again, please.
  persid: DHH
- desc: just said that if you can move the camera to the little right, so that we
    can see on the right side.
  persid: S02
- desc: To. The blog assignments. So we talked last day of both. So, meaning, you
    can click on the submit button. But. If you don't click on submit button. Then.
    If you don't click on this button before it's due date. it's fine to. not go back
    and click on. Because drafts can be marked this can be seen in your course. So
    I got a comment or two about that. That. Really forgot a cement, and this was
    late mark late. So i'm not sure if there's a better way to. specify specified.
    method of submitting assignments, and your horses. far as I know, that's just
    the feature that your course has that it's not straightforward in that respect.
    So we'll try and. be mindful of that. and So the issue so we'll try and. don't
    want to get anyone caught in that so trying to deal with it in working so you
    don't get penalized for getting the submit button late. Anyone here. That situation
    or. Or maybe not this time, but other times you've had to click submit and didn't
    click snip. And he went back and did it and then. realized submission is mark
    late. Anyone have that happen personal experience.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah i've had that happen, a few times actually.
  persid: S03
- desc: let's read all these. years later, one day, or something you know. Some kinds
    of things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because there.
  persid: ???
- desc: are a few of you i'm sure. yeah so. My feeling is it's not a very humane and.
    So this is a couple days already. started with you. purpose and updates. So is
    that more up more developments, you heard about. So I like to take some time.
    Maybe we can do this in recovery it's. Like. A little discussion about whether.
    that's an acceptable thing for them to do. Okay, so I see some comments in the
    chat. About submission So if you want to come to my zoom office hour 310 and noon.
    I can address those look into those with you. Okay. So enough context, to have
    a discussion. Alright, so let's do. People here. So i'm going to create six breakout
    rooms today not 12 so you can. If you're in group seven to cloud, you can. And
    if you want to join in zoom. So seven and one can go together two and eight go
    together three and nine put together and four and 10 and five. And 11 and six
    and 12. me. For. So say 10 minutes from now. Okay together again so. If you're
    logged into zoom and you can. You can choose to interact with your group on zoom
    or you can. get together with students in classes, such as well. i'll leave that
    to you. Okay, so we'll get back in a few minutes for discussion was this. well.
    I used to. Do it online class. Patient starts. Honest so in every. Day. that's,
    not to say. That so. Everybody should be finished on the time. versus charter
    yeah we get that extra. Another. double check so. I. Just are you creating. So
    this is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This is the.
  persid: ???
- desc: conviction. Their services. So trying to create a.
  persid: DHH
- desc: chance to.
  persid: ???
- desc: not fight it's not exciting pictures. And I am getting me. Okay. Yes, because
    there's other sensors that will hopefully be lighter. savory side. Especially
    when load, for instance I tend to go. Even if the race itself this person that
    fateful back to me just once it gets tied up with certain. access. To them it's
    right along with the strangeness funding or the people. become your pain, no pressure
    Panel for back features evolve, it sounds okay very. General he thought he was
    being. Asked because. The way. relax. relax. Let me see. Things work so. Two things
    for me. Actually. sharp. Sorry. It should be left to. Just.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Watch.
  persid: ???
- desc: To sites. As a. manager. I tried to. cheat on his responses. Trying to. say.
    Something.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like.
  persid: ???
- desc: trying to get to say. I know the last time. I know they were. never able to
    access it via a saint out. yeah. More people will be seated message yeah. Just.
  persid: DHH
- desc: one.
  persid: ???
- desc: Specific. scenario. it's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well it's gone very quiet in here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: we've talked about.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. discussion. So as to get the question of whether. Men did a good thing
    by relaxing their filters against hate to catch hate speech. Why.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So is it basically like. According to this news post i'm reading it's it's
    basically they did it to protect people's rights to speech as an expression of
    self Defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country.
  persid: S04
- desc: used to think they did it for good or bad reasons, in that they more than
    likely just did it because a lot of people. Are despising what Russia and doing
    and they're doing it for monetary monetary gains, because a lot of people want
    to say something like this, I want to be angry with the medium if they couldn't.
  persid: S05
- desc: I also read a. read a Russian article that Russia band instagram and Facebook,
    because the allowed this. Information to go through apparently Russians are feeding
    propaganda information to the Russian populates but this could kind of enlighten
    them about what is actually going they don't call it a war didn't see military
    operation.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay, so because we're hybrid. let's try it you're in zoom raise your hand
    raise your hand icon. which you can. Get from. Oh, where did it go. reactions.
    There should be a button, either on somewhere in your screen that says reactions.
    And then you can do the raise hand.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thank you i'm going to call on the person in class here. First, and i'll get
    back to you. Get economy, plus the same thing goes failure was due to the Russian
    invasion of Ukraine and that's why they. started allowing this speech to the system,
    the brain that. Better express themselves. As well as others.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I think it's more of a marketing move because most of the time companies
    don't take a political position, but in this conflict, you see, most company.
    Trying to support Ukraine and lately Meta has been suffering a lot financially,
    so I think they're trying to make like a sharp marketing campaign, or something
    like that. interesting.
  persid: S07
- desc: sitting. let's. Say no perversities bad. They want to bolster the Russian
    case, so they. The Russians and have a reason to say that the West is out, to
    get them. Anything else come to mind. zoom. Cory. Go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm a little different from most people here seems i'm i'm more of a freedom
    of speech absolutist I think you should be able to say whatever you want, including
    the bad and then bad speech should be shut down by good speech. However, on this
    one, at the same time I don't think that calls to action calls to arming people
    should ever be allowed like direct calls for violence, I am against that always.
    And so I just I don't think that that should ever be allowed, regardless of whatever
    war situation and whatever were awful things Putin is doing, because. what's the
    best way. If you look back at the beginning of coronavirus when it was spreading
    out with China, being the root cause of it, there was a lot of hate towards the
    Chinese people and there still is because of this, and I think that. By allowing
    hatred towards Russia that will move further just on to the Russian people, whether
    they are good or bad. And not just don't think that's a good idea.
  persid: S08
- desc: yeah So there are a couple times to make there, so they were instagram is
    clear about. Still filtering.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The.
  persid: ???
- desc: Clear, but still filtering cause violence. and
  persid: DHH
- desc: slogans.
  persid: ???
- desc: corey. captured and. Just to what you were saying.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S08
- desc: anyone else any other any other thoughts about this. yeah yeah I think about
    instagram or any other social media platform our platform should not be allowed
    to do that because I believe that the primary responsibility of any platform like
    this would be to. spread information on it from an unbiased point of view. If
    there are. Threats to any any political figure, other than but the, this would
    not have been acceptable. shouldn't be similarly we can consider if there is a
    group of people who would spread here means against the Ukrainian president or
    Prime Minister this wouldn't be acceptable as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: trends.
  persid: ???
- desc: Here or. With your idea. And yeah, so I think it's complete from a business
    point of view, this data to render the nonprofit on this things is a good idea
    for them, because. Most of the initiatives are not in the favor of war, so they
    are they going to be gradients by giving them freedom of speech and most of the
    chef's can also use this so there, there are abuse it is going to be like increased
    so. Okay i'm not sure I caught all that so from so what i'm what i'm trying to
    say is linking sugar, especially used. To like status message that the readers
    so most of the brain scan to use it right because they're not in favor of more
    and most of the last chance to do that on it that they were on board so. Basically
    they're using this social media platform as to spread his message so it's like
    they were burning sugar. So, is that a little bit more, like the previous thought
    about this is kind of a marketing effort.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But considering this as a marketing tactic, there is another point to consider
    is with Russia, imposing a nationwide ban on instagram so instagram is technically
    instagram will have. 80 million plus users. who are unable to use instagram right.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah that's right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.I.
  persid: ???
- desc: don't think these companies are. Banning they're rushing usage be out of the
    goodness of their hearts they're doing it because the SWIFT bank account was closed,
    they have no way to get money out of that country.
  persid: S05
- desc: Related to this discussion. So here on the right hand side there's a summary.
    I thought I was sharing my desktop. Oh, because there's such a whiteboard. Thank
    you. So, in terms of general ethical principles we should contribute to society
    and human well being acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing.
    avoid arm be honest and trustworthy. Be fair to take and take action, not to discriminate.
    respect the work required to produce new ideas inventions creative works and computing
    artifacts respect privacy honor confidentiality. strive to achieve high quality
    in both the processes and products of professional work. maintain high standards
    of professional competence conduct an ethical practice. Know annex and respect
    existing rules pertaining to professional work. Except and provide appropriate
    professional review give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems
    and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks. For work only in areas
    of competence posture public awareness and understanding of computing related
    technologies and their consequences. Access competing and communication resources,
    only one authorized or when compelled by the public good. design and implement
    systems that are robust the usable robustly and easily secure. Ensure that the
    public good, as a central concern during all professional computing work. Or take
    QA and encourage acceptance of Bennett evaluate fulfillment of social responsibilities
    by members of the organization or group. manager personnel resources to enhance
    the quality working life. articulate apply and support policies and processes
    that reflect the principles of the code. create opportunities for members of the
    organization or group to grow and to grow as professionals. he's carried modifying
    are retiring systems recognize and take special care systems that become integrated
    into the infrastructure of society. That 3.7 is a big one isn't it. So how much
    should be. Imagine if we didn't have access. Just the thing going out. Okay. So
    I see Korea as a stand up, do you have a comment or is that from before.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Before sorry.
  persid: S08
- desc: Sorry. I think there's no issue there web page here. treat violations the
    Code as.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, see what.
  persid: ???
- desc: Oh, not too bad people iterations of the code is inconsistent with membership
    a beast in the acm. So. The principles described in the code of ethics does that
    relate to our. How can we. Look at the code of ethics and. Does it. Does it help
    us to make decisions about. Whether whether they're allowing destiny invaders.
    To be available on the platform.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So do you want to expand. sure. Considering how much of an impact that social
    media platforms can have. Society. Computer professionals needs to be aware that
    how they change these social media platforms that helped can have far reaching
    impact. This example at removing some filters for different kinds of speech. allow
    certain groups make different messages some hateful some nonsense Porsche some
    medical statements favor of one. nation or another and. This is the important
    to always be aware of it, to keep in mind and understand.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So this reminds me of another story that I heard, I think it was on CNN. This
    retired astronauts who got into a Twitter fight with. Their souls from the Russian
    Space Agency. retired astronaut seem to indicate, as I recall, you seem to indicate
    that. The American astronaut on the international space station with. Two Russian
    cosmonauts. Nina got back to us worried about. The astronaut getting home safely.
    and Russian. And not very kind words. search, which I can understand. But thinking
    about the public good. And the astronaut, the American astronaut, who started.
    conversation on Twitter. said that the international space station was this out
    or something that. was very important to maintain because no matter what's going
    on. on earth. There is still the cooperation. Of the national space station and
    we didn't want to lose that. So is the public graded. it's very much for the public
    good. synonymous with. Taking the higher ground and. So there are a couple other
    stories that I found interesting or. So there's your report about testimony related
    to the. grace you agree.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It couldn't see.
  persid: ???
- desc: The desperate. sorry about crypto currency donations to convey to convoy protests
    can still be traced there's testimony in front of committee committee reviewing
    the invocation of the emergency APP. and Talking about. Whether. People who are
    using Canadian cryptocurrency providers. can be tracked. And they can track. Funds
    from different from those walls these. was interesting I thought. So this is an
    interesting question about. Free speech. Perhaps there is this from the states.
    The assistant principal of the school is fired for reading a kids book called
    I need a new black. In here about that. So the kids like that the parents. Were
    fine with that, but the school administrator. So that was a very. serious breach
    of JET. It was a very important your example of very poor judgment on the bathroom
    the teacher and so he was asked to resign. And now he's. Trying to. figure out
    how to. defend themselves. And so, also investing in the digital digital real
    estate could pay off, but the metaverse is a highly risky uncharted landscape.
    So there's Taiwan, a restaurant owner and much at all wants to create a. Virtual
    version of his establishment and reverse.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I.
  persid: ???
- desc: heard you earlier story about celebrities buying up. Virtual real estate.
    as well, so this. seems like a little bit that was done in second life. I never
    thought much. Anyone heard of second life before. i'll see if I can find a link
    to that. And then also. A 12 year old gamer from Halifax and. A black belt in
    your coding from code dinges. is only the second one and candy do that. So. All
    those links on the web page. Any questions or concerns. So. Think about. Our computer
    professionals call to act. Guided by the cm code of ethics. will explore. Okay.
    Thank you very much for today. Both. in person and. On zoom. Have a good day take
    care and see you on Thursday. hunter Smith. Thank you very much. A long time last
    time so. it's a two years. Since college. today's. boys yeah. scheme for many,
    many years and. enjoy. The sunshine. into their once you let go to the kiska.
    Closer to my house or my God. bless Calgary. Happy hour. Thanks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Pretty.
  persid: ???
- desc: Sure, you were expecting like should be writing more I think if they. want
    you. Generally, see how well when you're critiquing. meets the rubric. So the
    rubric for the blog entry assignment. we've done a good job. constructor. The
    former too late.
