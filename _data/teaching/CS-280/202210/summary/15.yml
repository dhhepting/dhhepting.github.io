Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Listen to the morning edition on CBC. s apostrophe. I thought so. So i'm not
    quite sure why date doesn't work. On this page but. Here we are today. did everything.
    Well Okay, I guess, I didn't. it's not there. I did do some things. I must not
    have saved the file that I thought I saved. As I. pushed it all to the web. Okay,
    so. You can come down front, if you want. Anyway, so just going to mention you.
    So we've gone through. send us and hunter have gone through the project proposals
    and. Yes, there are a few issues that were found. So i'm going to post. The comments
    to you this morning. And you'll have a chance to resubmit. If you want to, if
    you would like a better mark and to address some of the concerns that have been
    identified okay. So, can you hear me okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, sir.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: project proposal. that's not straight. We said. Before. yesterday. Okay, so
    that's one thing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hi professor, we can see the full whiteboard can you adjust the camera a little
    can see what's written on the right side.
  persid: S03
- desc: sure.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah that's better thanks.
  persid: S03
- desc: you're welcome.it's.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. Much. For those of you here is that enough light to keep the help keep
    you awake. yeah Okay, and for those of you on zoom takes care of the glare a little
    bit. On the whiteboard. I was visibility there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's good.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm not sure. Anyway, sorry. So part of the things I promised last day. i've
    addressed them here. So. This is the same sentence that was here. So instead of
    identify multiple. i've suggested four to eight. To give you some guidance. I
    don't want you to feel like you have to do that many but. kind of. A ballpark
    for. Another thing I have to add tonight, thank you very much. Okay. So for people
    in zoom. i've added a number of. Sources here. Just to give you a bit more. structure
    mean if you have three. So it's all of a sudden multiple so that means at least
    you should have at least two but I encourage you to have three or four. And you
    can have well. That was a question on Thursday is that. give you enough detail.
    Anyway, it's. yeah. So the other thing. So this other sentence, so I added. This
    information. And then, it was rough what was there previously said references
    are to be included as hyperlinks in the post close to the text, and next reference,
    they should also be clearly included in playing. They should also be clearly included
    in plain text at the end of your work. Also Okay, so that was there now i've added
    this part. Also at the end of your work. answer the following questions about
    each source. So this is. to codify our discussion from before the break. So who
    is the author who's the publisher. What is the purpose or perspective. And I spelled
    that wrong. I said prescribed scripted. perspective. Which is not. Not a word
    as far as I can. Anyway, i'll fix that. But the purpose or perspective of the
    content. Is information provided by the source, timely and relevant. And then,
    how does a source compared to others so. He can address those five things. and
    the rest of this is the same. And then just. i've added a bit of detail here critical
    evaluation of online sources. So all questions answered thoroughly. or questions
    answered questions answered somewhat thoroughly few questions answer. So it gives
    you a bit of a guide for those four marks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And this is still do tomorrow right.
  persid: S04
- desc: Well okay. So I said. Okay i'm gonna raise this. I said that you could still
    submit it on Friday, with only a 10% penalty. And I kind of thinking. To myself.
    Maybe i'll just will make the due date on the 11th. So I was thinking about this
    in relation to the project proposal and. Just I did. I wanted, I wanted to have
    some time to discuss this and make sure that. Things were clear for you and finalizing
    your assignment. That same okay. So then. we'll do in two weeks 25th is the critique.
    And then the other two dates for the. The group assignment. And the project will
    be the same. well. If you have more than eight I would say that I would welcome
    you to. comment on each of them. If you decide that. Maybe there's a source that
    isn't. isn't isn't contributing to your argument, then maybe if you have. A lot
    maybe you could say well. These are the. Most important ones. That makes it, I
    mean. If you've written this now, and you have say 12. And you think well. I don't
    wanna I don't feel like I want to go back and redo things and Edit that down.
    So i'm trying to be respectful of that so i'm not saying you have to. Change the
    work you've done. Like just like he did. For the references you do include. answer
    those questions or make a comment with your answers to those questions for the
    sources. Okay yeah you're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So it just goes into effect in comments about the sources so do we have like
    to write an essay or small paragraph or what do we have to write like for. For
    the sources and what do we have to submit them because, like there is no, you
    have not mentioned like when is it due date to submit the paragraph for. Content
    sources.
  persid: S05
- desc: So. I would just like you, that so. This is. This is the new part that i've
    added here. So in the instructions their resolve is yours. They meaning your references
    should also be clearly included in plain text at the end of your work. So following.
    your reference to. A source. are calling your plain text. Following your plain
    text. Reference list at the after at the end of your blog entry. Then make comments
    about each source. that's taking of those questions. Yes. Sorry. So what did.
    I think. You just answered the question truthfully that you say it's an unknown
    author unknown publisher. But if it's. If it's difficult to identify the author
    of the publisher what does that say about. The reliability of the source. yeah
    it's a little bit. it's maybe a red flag. Maybe not bright red but. that's a bit
    of evidence that says. Maybe. Maybe this isn't the most reliable thing. So instead
    of. what's a good example, maybe, say, well, the New York Times or the Washington
    Post. Maybe it's spelled. Maybe it's. i'm trying to make up some. This isn't this
    will be fairly clear. Maybe you know, so the web, the URL. it's made up look like
    it's so agenda publication, but maybe the URL isn't. So so clear. or it's. There
    are some other ways that we might see that. Or maybe. w post.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A certain like in general, when we designed our blog we actually gave all
    the references, towards the end of the. End of the blog written as like say, for
    example, the work cited page or something so we also had hyperlinks to each of
    the. Each of the links, so I just wanted to know that do you want us to write
    our explanation or the answer to these questions on turn need those links.
  persid: S01
- desc: So. The links are in the body of your your blog entry. So, at the end i'm
    asking for plain text. listed list of your sources so they don't have to be clickable.
    But at the end and the end of your blog entry. You can list the sources you've
    used and then make comments about them there. So. Does that make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah, but if we if we are following the email a format for the work cited
    page we actually like add all the name of the author, the publisher the date of
    publication like stuff like that, so do you want us to use MLA and then also state
    those again in the in the small paragraph.
  persid: S01
- desc: So. it's not about. citation so much as So if you say. here's an article written
    by Darrell happening. And then, in your comments you said it's an article written
    by Darrell happening. that's not necessarily adding. A lot of information so.
    You might say. they're all happening who's the Department of computer science
    at the University of Regina. let's see alright.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Are we supposed to put the whole link in the body of blog posts.
  persid: S06
- desc: So you don't need to make a clickable you can put the URL. So the purpose
    of putting the plain text at the bottom is just to make clear the URLs we are
    click the what you're clicking what you're linking in inside the blog post and
    blog entry within the text you've written.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm asking him about the body of the block engine.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay, so in the body. You can just include. You can. Here, let me do an example
    here. Do it in. Service channel cooperate today. Okay. have to add more dates
    for this. Oh, we didn't do a tendency there should do that now. yeah so called
    the format i'm not. Making you sick to a particular format. I just would like
    you to make things clear. And do it consistently if you're going to do it one
    way. If you're comfortable with a certain format. use that. consistently in your
    writing. Much like today, I apologize. So some days I do better this keyboard
    you know subtle differences and keyboards. So. Inside the body, the text body
    of the entry and we can make a URL. Or can associate the URL with the text. I
    think I spelled that right. anyway. i'm not. Okay, so maybe you can see, this
    isn't going to be. The most reliable source like continue down this path, but
    this is the kind of things that. i'm not trying to make light of that i'm just
    this is my exam example of how I do it. Without finding a particular article.
    anyway. Maybe it's better to find a. I fear that my. peculiar sense of humor is
    undermining you're undermining the clarity with which i'm. Which i'm striving.
  persid: DHH
- desc: saucer on the second bullet point the link that you have is that the link
    to the newspaper directly like and not the article.
  persid: S01
- desc: So that's what I put in here. So that's the same URL that I put there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Also, is that the same link you added on both places like on the.
  persid: S01
- desc: So it's this it's the same link. hey. This is where i'm linking. So that's
    the same. Okay, so let me. So if you when you're adding them in the editor if
    you click on. open a new window then maybe that's just a little bit easier for
    people reading it. So they can have your. of your text in one tab and then the
    sources appear in other towns. that's what. Those of you who are more familiar
    with html syntax that's when you put the target. target equals blank. create a
    new tab for the link. Yes, sir. You can do that to. Like put a. Like a key. To
    the reference list and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: say.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah. Well, you don't have to hyperlink all the texts that relates to the
    source.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: You put a link the source. close to where it's. Okay, that makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If someone has like actually use the hyperlinks in the works cited section
    should they remove it, or can I just leave it like that, and and read the explanation
    underneath.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah. If you've got it set up as a hyperlink. Already that's. I don't want
    you to. feel like you have to make changes. To what you've gotten already it's
    just that a bit more information, so you consider. So you consider. The quality
    of the source. That you've been created. That makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, Sir answer about that one thing you asked how does the source, compared
    to others like what are you mostly looking for in that section.
  persid: S01
- desc: So is it representative, for example, is it representative of other sources,
    does it have similar information or is it, notably different than every. The one
    source that says yes, when the other say no, for example. You might think that
    this is the most reliable source. of several that. provide the same essentially
    the same information.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm gonna take up my.
  persid: ???
- desc: sense of humor.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And sure approximately how many words should be like right for each of the
    sources.
  persid: S01
- desc: I don't want to count words. Just answer the question. You don't have to write
    an essay about each source, but just indicate. indicate you've thought about the
    questions. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, sir.
  persid: S01
- desc: Like i'm missing my trackpad i'm. With my left hand i'm pressing of the trackpad
    on the. Other top. Okay. So. Any other administration kinds of questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Now, will you also be able to post like an example for the critique blog as
    well, and when you do, what do you mentioned something on march 25.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah so change the date for that to march 25.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, and will you be able like was like an example for the critique park
    or something like that.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes, I will. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah answer about the sources like. I know you said, like it has to be up
    like topic that's being discussed, currently, but like what if we find something
    in general that's applicable for the current situation as well from two three
    years back, is would it be like okay if we included an article or two like that
    as well.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah, so I think. Doing using it for background is appropriate. or context.
    So when I said timely irrelevant, so that would be under the relevant category.
    Okay i'm going to try and let's do a little discussion here. We find an rf I don't
    have the link to the article. I will, I will take a time during that. little bit.
    use that phrase you are some risks and rewards. Okay, so i'm going to put that
    in the chat for the Rainbow room though started this now. So i'll kind of spread
    truth, instead of misinformation online what are some risks and rewards of getting
    information online. Any ideas what how to mitigate risks and increase your awards.
    That seem like a reasonable. topic to. discuss in your groups. Okay, in zoom does
    that seem okay. just give me a thumbs up on your.
  persid: DHH
- desc: seems good.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Alright, so i'll start breakout rooms, so what we found out a lot last time
    in class was. So I know some people had laptops with earphones and so people in
    class join the zoom group. let's this. Or that component. well. Okay, so. Her
    groups on if you're in zoom go to your room with the with the class work group
    and if you're in class, you can either. If you have technology to let you join
    your zoom your classroom group on zoom you can do that. Or you can get together
    and form a couple groups here, so we give people in class the option of doing
    that those give those two options to people in class. Okay, so i'll set up the
    breakout rooms and we'll go from there. So do 10 minutes and then we'll have five
    minutes for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Right.happy.Sunday.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay. discussion. Good. Any. Any ways to. Spread truth, instead of lies online
    yeah. yeah okay so. Something to do to find fake news common highlighted. Okay.
    Any other comments from class from them from the room. How about online in zoom
    any comments. Now i'm not talking to you soon. And nobody's responding that's
    okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So something like using blockchain technology, I guess, for spreading. giving
    you access. So the reliable or only the trustworthy sources spread the information
    post information which cannot be tampered with also sources.
  persid: S03
- desc: So that still requires the. The original information to be. accurate and true.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Who decides what is true so. I think is the most important part on that one.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah. So just a small question here at the. end.
  persid: DHH
- desc: what's objective truth.
  persid: ???
- desc: And how do we know it. that's not a very big issue is that. yeah I think so,
    too, I was, I was just gonna say that that was me with my particular sense of
    humor again. So I don't want to. Leave. unsure about that so. I think we're out
    of time for today 945 yeah. Okay, so any any questions before we break for today.
    So was the example in the discussions. helpful to clarifying things for you. and
    seeing how. Our evaluation of sources that we use for information is an important
    part of being a citizen today, not just writing blog assignments, for acting and
    see us to add. Okay i'll take that as a yes and they Thank you very much for today,
    I will see you Thursday. need to get Ahold of me, you know where to find me online.
    thanks again. Thanks soon we'll see you next meeting. Yes. Your proposal, and
