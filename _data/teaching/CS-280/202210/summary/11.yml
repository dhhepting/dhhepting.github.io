- desc: Good morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: how's everyone doing today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm doing pretty good.
  persid: S02
- desc: snow again. So this. The streets around my house have frozen into various
    shapes of. problem, causing shapes very slushy and then. got very deep breaths
    and high ridges so. Lots of fun. Quote Unquote. I should. bring up our I found
    that clip from letterman. So one more meeting before their winter break. or next
    Tuesday meeting will be in March already. So here's the club for. Men okay. So.
    True watch that together.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm always down for watching a video in class.
  persid: S03
- desc: So anyway. So let's do our attendance first and then we'll talk about assignments
    and. and start from there. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, you can have on your account.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay, so there's our attendance password for today. Okay. let's. Okay, here
    we go. Maybe as a rear Admiral and was until that time the nation's oldest active
    military officer, she is also a pioneer in the computer field as well as a brilliant
    and charming woman, please welcome Admiral grace hopper.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you very much for being here have you have you ever given here, thank
    you have you ever seen this program.i'm prejudiced too late for me, I have to
    get up at five could be in office seven you get up at five to go to work and seven.Well
    it's a long ways from arlington Virginia cross the river and down through Washington,
    we used to have a boat went from the Pentagon Dan Dan navy yard, but it's a card,
    I took it away oh President.commandeered for private parties or what.was using
    too much energy Oh, I see it was a conservation making so, then you you're working
    a full day now for a private firm right yes.And corporation digitally I get that
    in there, good okay.And how long ago, did you did you leave active service there
    anyone August 21 2400 now see that it says 2400 artists to 2400 is a night midnight
    yeah was there a wild celebration at midnight, when this took place yeah.So, so
    you went to bed in the service and you woke up out of the service was something
    you learned in your first boot camp or training camp if they put you down somewhere
    with nothing to do go to sleep.I think that made the office policy for us upstairs
    do.not know grace you mentioned boot camp now when did you go through navy back
    in 4444 and what what kind of college, was it tough physically demanding.mentally
    demanding all those youngsters that came in with me and they could still memorize
    things and i'd forgotten how I see, so you.Can memorize the ordinary can derive
    the organization and the navy, I have to memorize so you were older than most
    of the other enlistees barely got in I was 3737 know what interested you about
    going into the navy at 37 to begin with.yeah there was a time when everybody in
    this country all did one thing and talk together and and you just wanted to get
    over there and fight Nazis.Well, the other thing I had to go navy, because my
    great grandfather was every reading.And if I hadn't gone in the navy probably
    would risen from my his grave and haunted me yeah so it's a tradition in your
    family yeah and then and but before that you also.college Professor yeah and you
    worked on the original computer in this country right now i'm very fortunate the
    navy or admin to the first big computer and United States mark one and Harvard.it's
    called mark one at Harvard in those days, the thing was 21 feet long a tree in
    a 3D and that was the pocket model.You can put it on a little tiny corner of a
    chip now now what how did you know so much about computers, then I didn't how
    did you first one yeah.had to learn a lot of things one day commander he came
    around to my desk and says you're going to write a book I said I can't write a
    book he said you're in the navy now.So I wrote a book, you had to write a book
    and that was outlining the entire manual of the computer yeah yeah and I process
    yeah Now I know nothing about computers and you know everything about computers
    your.they've called you everything all I can't yeah, but it is there, anybody
    who would know more Oh, I spent 70 good youngsters coming along no more, but you're
    known as the Queen of software is that right.You know that little bit about that
    that conjures an image of somebody who has a lot of tupperware parties so.I could
    give you a nanosecond OK, I see I don't even know what that is great well, you
    see, we started with milliseconds thousands of a second.And then we went to microseconds
    millions of a second, and now we talk about nanoseconds that's a billionth of
    a second but.Only told me billionth of a second and I didn't know what on earth,
    they were talking about didn't make sense to me so one day I called over to engineering
    said cut off a nanosecond send it over to me.And you can pick your color they
    come in color see I didn't realize that nanoseconds in the old days you only had
    your choice of white or Gray, I think.Know gracie I understand that this is a
    visual, that is, the maximum distance it lighter electricity can travel and a
    billionth of a second.No, no faster, no, no, no farther when an Admiral as you
    why it takes a damn long to send a message by satellite, you point out to him
    between here and the satellite there are very large number of nano.we'll be right
    back well we'll continue talking about.Welcome back to the show this is a real
    grace hopper is it rear Admiral or just Admiral were add my lower hat what.What
    is what does that term denote rear Admiral or have same as a Brigadier general
    but there's the rear apply to a is it a nautical term while his rear Admiral vice
    Admiral and finally it.So it's just where his position he or she is positioned
    on the chart and have there been any other female rear Admiral tomorrow, once
    the.head of great legs, training and the other is the head of the nurse going,
    but you were the first, no, no we're not doing right now.For five or six ahead
    of me how many years, did you have in the navy 43 and a half and and can I ask
    you how old you are now i'll be eating December in December, I think.let's let's
    take a look at this photograph tell me what this occasion was this one, I was
    promoted to Commodore and which later was renamed rear Admiral I see and President
    Reagan better all by himself.I tiptoed up to him and got up on my toes and said,
    Sir, may I may I tell you something, and he looked at me funny as all get out
    as if I was going to threaten massive i'm older than you or.laugh, you could have
    heard all the way across.i'm guessing you didn't mind at all, you probably have
    not heard that much as you.Know i'm.Taking another second here and try to explain
    to me why a nanosecond means anything, and the main reason that means something
    is is because everybody wants to answer it better answers faster.And you get him
    out of the computers, he got to make the computers faster, but this is as fast
    as those those in fact as fast as they'll go now of course.they've been talking
    about nanoseconds for several years, but now they're talking about panko seconds
    and I packer second is a thousandth of a nanosecond.Imagine talk cutting that
    is 1000 of a billion of a second yeah it's a quiet group didn't have a second
    yeah the best way to get out of wendy's mcdonald's or somewhere and get a small
    packet a pack of seconds, they have the label pepper on them, but they're.Really.nicely
    and that's it that's a good illustration, and have you had any any difficulties,
    making the transition from the all those years as a military person to civilian
    life.They should have a course and how to in civilian dressing here i've been
    wearing nice round toad flat heeled shoes and all of a sudden, they want to put
    me on spike yields and Apollo all.Around toes and there's nothing but moccasins
    yeah and then I tried to get some panty hose.And the first pair bag did the cab
    and the second pair cut man have.Both, how do you get a pair of pantyhose to fit
    well I can.tell you a little later.So navy issue pantyhose we're better than civilian
    pantyhose i've got a.shock sounds.Great awesome i'm glad that you had some time
    to come up here from Washington, and it was a pleasure to see you, congratulations
    on everything, last year we have time for a quick question is your ancestry well
    Scottish or Irish.You know i'm not certain, I think it's your hair nice I guess
    Welsh all right i'm not gonna argue with you.make a joke when I don't know I said
    serious serious questions very important okay well, what does that mean exactly
    well depends on which kind of Center your head well that's a lousy here lately.Very
    well, good, thank you very much thank you.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. Anyone know who David letterman is. That was close to the start of his
    for show on first late night show on NBC. Because I can leave it like that. i'm
    glad to hear that. Or to read that. So I believe the nanosecond demonstration
    she did when she was here in 1974 for. There is a lecture series called the master
    field. That you're serious when the Faculty of science. And so, she she's that
    that illustration, then. I thought the package of Pico seconds was interesting
    as well. anyway. So that's that's who grace hopper is. All right, that's right
    i've seen. i've seen a little bit of that new David letterman series. looks a
    little bit different now it's going to big beard. anyway. So project is due. On
    Friday, just before midnight.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You mean the project proposal right, not the actual.
  persid: S06
- desc: that's right. Okay, thank you. I was thinking about your comment about 2400.
    And I thought that was interesting. Because it's a little bit ambiguous because
    2400 is the same as zero. And I suppose, they don't use 010 hundred hours. But
    being a computer scientist you think that that would be. A preference. started
    zero because that's the first.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For us, our belief, they do us a $700.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay. I was just wondering, because the so. Zero hundred hours riemann would
    be started the next day and 2400 through the end of the current day. So It just
    seems like. To have two names for the same time. would be. That might cause some
    problems at some point but. But all. We can do, but a check on that. So once I
    will I don't have the name of this person who did it we said it, but we're talking
    his comment about whether we should start indexing raise it zero or one. This
    is from a computer science educator. You made this comment, he said, you know
    people don't agree. about starting at zero or one, so I propose, starting at point
    five. Not this person did not see if I can find that clock. So anyone have a.
    An answer to there is for the reason why we start counting at zero.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because zero is technically all for no power, whatever and then one is the
    next, which is on or power.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah so if we think of. bits. That we set them all off, then, then the number
    we get a zero. So we can. So when we say. Well, so a bit is either on or off offer
    on. And depending on every bits we get. To to the number of bits we can represent
    that many values, so if we have two beds, we can get four values. We can't get
    four values if we don't start at zero because the four values are 0123. So that
    just. seems reasonable seems eminently reasonable to start at zero because then
    otherwise we're wasting that. That slot. Okay. Anyway, little detour there but.
    So, yes pardon me project proposals due on Friday at. At the end of the day. Any
    questions or concerns about that. So notice, some people. The people who want
    to work by themselves are perfectly fine doing that. If you wanted to work with
    a group, please try and. communicate your group. Members members, the members
    of your group. To. Well, probably the easiest ways to just reply to that post
    that have in the discussion area. Some quite a few groups have done that already,
    but if you're. If you're planning to. The project with somebody else or some other
    people. Please let us know. We have that. discussion forum posts, so we can get
    things set up just make things smoother. And now we can. submit. Can we agree
    with the setup. And allow you to submit. smoothly, instead of having the group
    get set up after you submit that makes sense. So, again you're perfectly fine.
    If you're working by yourself. You don't need to worry about anything you don't
    have to submit anything or. communicate anything else. But if you're working with
    one or more people. Then please. Please communicate that before submitting now
    just make things go more smoothly in the submission process. Okay. yeah. mentions,
    because the raising pointers. raise our pointers and indexes and offset from a
    pointer yeah so. that's another way to explain it. Okay. Alright, so. I put up.
    Let me see here go back. You. Okay, so the next question is about the due date
    for the blog entry. So right now that's set to be. due at the end of the prank.
    Which doesn't seem very nice actually does. So how about any thoughts about switching
    it to Friday. let's see march forth. And then any objection to that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir, are you talking about the bug and truth.
  persid: S08
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: This one. Okay, so. Let me change that right now. Oh no sorry that's ellison.
    This month, the first day back from the break not not the end of the break. It
    still. yeah I think that looks right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So I know it says, the proposal is supposed to be one to two pages, how long
    is the project supposed to be.
  persid: S09
- desc: um. well. If you're writing something. I think I have in mind, maybe 1500
    words. But I would because you might not. I didn't wanna. I didn't want to. Put
    a hard and fast rule on it, because. If you're doing some other kind of deliverable
    then it's much harder to assess. And if you write a Wikipedia page. it's not just
    about the length of the. Of the article but there's not lots of other things.
    That go into it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is there any example, proposals that we could look at just as a reference.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay, oh. i'll give you some things oh find some examples and put them up
    today or tomorrow. Okay. sounds great.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you, Professor no. you're welcome.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay, so. What I want to also mention was about the. So I about the blog entry
    i've indicated there's four marks for, let me just go to the assignment here.
    critical evaluation of online sources. And I haven't filled in the details there
    yet so. i'd like to get your thoughts on. what's a good way what are some good
    ways what's the process we should outline. and describe for. The purposes of getting
    the four marks for the critical evaluation of online sources. So. Life, this is
    my thoughts so. Who. To reach of your sources, you could. answer a number of questions
    about them. And then the other piece would be. To. get a similarity report from
    turn it in and then have you comment. On the results on the matches that are indicated
    in the tournament similarity report. So that would mean. Submitting in two parts,
    I guess, so you'd submit. These submit. Your blog entry. and get a similarity
    report and then you comment on the similarity report.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What if I then. make a slight change in my project and handed it again and
    the similarity report is totally different.
  persid: S09
- desc: well. Okay, so this is for the blog entry. right there we're talking about.
    So i'm not sure if they would change completely if you made small changes can
    make small changes, then. i'd expect the similarity report to have small changes
    in. But I could be wrong. So i'm suggesting this is a. process to. To help us
    think critically about the the online sources of information that we have. So
    I don't. I don't. Imagine that it will be perfect, but. What i'm thinking about
    for the. comment on the similarity report is that. You acknowledge. The things
    that are coming up as matches and. have a chance to explain them and. Think about
    them. So I know that's the turn it in isn't perfect either, far from it. Because
    it could match it could create matches. To to materials that. To I guess to other
    versions of the material that you're discussing in your project or in your in
    your writing pardon me. But I would. It would match other versions of the same
    material and not go to the. The source and match the sources necessarily. So who
    talked about. Something on an acm website. which stands for, for one again what's
    ECM stand for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Association for computing machinery.
  persid: S10
- desc: yeah Association for computing machinery that's right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Personally, I would be far more interested in the actual critical evaluation
    of online sources part of it, and a lot less interested in the plagiarism aspect
    of it just because I know turn it in has extensive history of flagging weird things
    like my name the date. The fact that I had a period at the end of my sentence.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah well sometimes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. My experience that i'm referring to is that. They might have they might
    indicate as a source a website that has quoted the original source. mean so they
    don't have the primary source. they're not matching to the primary source of that.
    doesn't mean that you haven't. worked with the primary source. So i'm not trying
    to think of it as plagiarism. i'm. i'm not looking at this is defending yourself
    against plagiarism. I would rather think about it as here's an understanding of.
    This service to acknowledge and. I guess it's thinking critically about plagiarism
    checkers to our sponsor thinking critically about the results of turning in gifts
    so sometimes. They come up with some. You know if if it comes up with a. website
    that's designed for. Providing. Answers to questions answers to exam questions.
    Because of all the match there. i'd be more interested to hear. your explanation
    about. All that kind of match.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just have a question in the project, although we have to include our Francis
    as well, or just like the introduction and the conclusion and the main points.
  persid: S11
- desc: So let me look what I wrote here. So no you don't have to have. So this is
    i'm breaking down the Marks and so you don't need to have. References identified.
    See.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can though right.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah so you might have them there to you might indicator. source that. They
    make the shows that. The topic that you're choosing actively engages in a important
    issue related to class. Right, I mean there are different places where you might
    include that but. He won't be docked marks just turn not having references or
    your. it's not a marketing criterion. To have references and have references included
    in the proposal okay. That answer your question our CEO.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, thank you.
  persid: S11
- desc: you're welcome. Any more thoughts about that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir, I had a small question about the project deliverable like say, for example,
    if a team chooses to like do a podcast do you think they should like stick to
    a like you know, a duration like say, for example, half an hour or one hour like
    do set any specific duration.
  persid: S08
- desc: So off off. I wouldn't say that I wouldn't say that your podcast would need
    to be an hour or. i'm not sure what the. Common length of the podcast is but.
    If it gets if it gets to be an hour long, I would suggest that maybe it could
    benefit from some editing. But if it's five minutes long, then it could benefit
    from. Some more material. So off hand and I can say it has to be a certain length.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, so does half an hour sound better, like, for example. well.
  persid: S08
- desc: i'd say. yeah that might be a more reasonable target. If it's longer that's
    not necessarily a bad thing. So when you get closer to. completing the project,
    we can have more discussions about that. don't seem all right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, Sir truly does Thank you.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Alright, so. Thinking about the critical assessment of online sources.
  persid: DHH
- desc: How about for questions and one of the questions is something to the tune
    of. Is the source of primary source and what your rationale for choosing, it would
    be based on that idea. That would that would still address your turn it in concept,
    it would just you know, not necessarily have to deal with turn it in. yeah.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay. So oh invite. Discussion online and i'll put something up for next for
    our next meeting. We can evaluate or we can consider okay. Alright, so that those
    seem like good ideas. Okay, and then the third thing I want to mention on assignments,
    is that I have. I have the details, through the assess you mean this website so
    that's maybe not the best. The best name for an assignment but anyway. So i've
    set up groups. And the groups are somewhat random. Because they're based on the
    class work groups so. The idea is. To test some of the test the content on the
    cms web page, so I listed the links. So it seemed like a good. So this is the
    new computer science department web pages. which were converted in less than two
    years ago. That they're now part of. The new university Regina web pages. That
    have been are. So portion of them went live at the end of last year. So we talked
    about. And interfaces she made an effort is responsible, the human needs to consider
    human frailties. So. So did so, based on that quote from Jeff or ask and. To look
    at the web pages and. See. See how they they do in response to. See if they're
    helpful and. responsive to human needs. Consider human frailties so Does that
    mean so presents information away that. that's accessible for people. And doesn't.
    Do doesn't present things in a way that are difficult for people to process. So
    there's a couple articles there about testing website content. And some questions
    to ask and. I would enjoy I would appreciate your feedback about. Your impressions
    of the Department of computer science website web pages. Okay, so there are 12
    classroom groups and i've made 24 of these web groups. So I randomly divided your
    classroom group into two. And that's that. So if there are questions that come
    up about that assignment. So that's still 50 days 48 days away, I think. yeah.
    so far. we're almost. Almost seven weeks away yeah. So. The integrations there
    for your. I think i've gotten details what all the other assignments as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sir, for this assignment do we have to stick to the group that has been assigned,
    or we can make our other groups.
  persid: S08
- desc: Are kind of individually.
  persid: S11
- desc: um no i'd rather you work with the group. work was a half of your classroom
    group to achievement assigned. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And sort of like do we choose the half of the group, or like is it.
  persid: S08
- desc: i've chosen them for i've made the group's already so. Okay. So in in the
    area under assignments here just. guess I can't do that. So under the group website
    assessment there's a thing web was in group discussion forum. So that's a place
    to communicate with your groups or to start communication with your groups. I
    can put up a list. Like I did for the classroom groups, if you like. and It says
    interview some questions aren't. As appropriate for for each page as some others
    so. See you may end up with. So i'd say. No, you don't need to answer every question
    for every every particular page each particular page. So it's and so there's material
    on each. Each of those main navigation links has X extra material on it there's.
    there's some links to come that follow from that page on the left hand side, the
    left hand navigation menu or. The main navigation links are the ones that are
    along the top primarily. The page but there's additional material on the left.
    And there might be some other links on the page. So those are more like sections
    section headings. I think there are eight of them. identified there so. You can
    think about what happened. And thinking about what happens. In the Group related
    to about, for example. Under the heading of about, then you get this information,
    and this these pages. are good, because this or not so good, because of that.
    And so on so. So it's just not the pages that are linked, but let the things that
    follow up from them as well it's, not just those main links that i've given you.
    But the material they contain as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Kenny, please go over the critique of blog entries will like do we have to
    put a any blog that we see, or is there a specific one that we have to put it.
  persid: S11
- desc: So I said. So i'd like you to critique through blog and you immediately phones
    your own blog entry, so if you're posting them in the class blog. than the one
    that follows years as the one of the issues. Right, the critique of okay. make
    sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah like if i'm writing about privacy, I have to put up another blog entry,
    that is talking about privacy as well.
  persid: S11
- desc: No it's just. The one that occurs next in the. In the class blog where everybody's
    entries are posted. or most everyone's entries are posted.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you.
  persid: S11
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: ???
- desc: So sorry the critique itself has to be a PDF of one to two pages.
  persid: S08
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I mean like we have to study the other person's. blog entry and then write
    a paper on it.
  persid: S08
- desc: So i'm trying to. So I would say. Oh well, it's looking at somebody else's
    work and. making an assessment of of how well. blog entry fits the criteria laid
    out in the rubric for the blog entry. So you're giving feedback about. How well
    the other person. completed the assignment in a way okay. there's my answer, so
    that you don't have any more questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For the proposal are you more looking for bullet points or paragraphs, because
    I could actually hand you like a rough draft.
  persid: S09
- desc: So paragraphs are not a bad thing. So i'm just looking for a document that
    deals with a criteria of as the headings that i've indicated. So bullet points
    I think we're okay. The paragraphs are nice too. So I just i'd say. organize it
    according to those headings i've indicated. That would be. That would be the main
    piece of advice okay. and Writing and with bullet points is fine. Just make sure
    that. What you written as well as. you're writing complete thoughts and. known
    and shorthand don't don't take shortcuts with your writing okay. So that reminds
    me I was looking at. A Google result and I don't remember exactly what I. searched
    for but I noticed that the capitalist of popular questions. And I thought. This
    isn't. This is not very well written. And then it's a when I looked at the link
    that answered the question. The link that was referenced as an answer to the question
    the popular question. It was written properly so Google. And I think in an effort
    to. reduce the number of characters in the question, so that have. been around
    a certain. Maybe maybe that would fit better on a screen or. And it's a metric
    that. The shortened version scored better with i'm not sure exactly. What the
    result was. Poorly written. So I don't want you to. write bullet points poorly.
    And you can read bullet points well or you can write paragraphs that make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah Thank you.
  persid: S09
- desc: anyone else notice that have a Google results, sometimes I think.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh yeah I got Google homes in my house and they do it all the time.

    or not or serve as a public good.
  persid: DHH
- desc: In the rubric for the proposal you say the deliverable is imaginative. To
    what extent can research paper be viewed as imaginative, given that it's very
    traditional.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay well. I say, then the your take on the topic is it. Is. Is fresh is.
    Innovative. More so than. So I didn't know that my first answer help matters at
    all.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah that makes sense.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay. So when I say imaginative I don't mean use your imagination. To. To
    do something that's not based and. In fact. That it's it's about taking a. And
    then. Taking a perspective that. may be less exam and then. Anyway, I guess, I
    don't have more to say about that. Okay. Well, I didn't think we'd have a full
    session of questions and answers, so I hope. i've answered your questions. Well,
    and if not, we can continue. These discussions in my office are or. In the discussion
