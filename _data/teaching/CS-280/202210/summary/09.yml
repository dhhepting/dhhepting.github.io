- desc: Good morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: morning. morning morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: or enable.
  persid: S02
- desc: This kind of reminds me of the scene for this well. This is what from when
    I was 18 the Monty python's meaning of life. know the fisher and assume tank in
    a restaurant. And they saying good morning to each other. And they said all look
    harold's being eaten. So. Sorry for that tour down memory lane there for me. Anyone
    Monty Python.
  persid: DHH
- desc: fans oh yeah I love multiple.
  persid: S03
- desc: Definitely big fans yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: let's go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And now for something completely different. that's right.
  persid: S03
- desc: So how's everyone doing today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: pretty good how about you, sir.
  persid: S03
- desc: i'm pretty good. lots of things going on, last night, so. Much to build a
    hockey game and. So that was some good news ultimately. anyway. yeah. So. i've
    done a few things here. And the weather is nicer. Over the past couple days, so
    I got a bit of. Clear off my sidewalk a little bit better. A little bit easier
    when it's minus two instead of minus 22. But anyway, it's just doesn't seem right
    to have these temperatures at the beginning of February.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I was actually just talking to my partner about that we can't believe
    it's the forums, usually way way colder by now.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah it just. goes up and down like a yo you. know the only. The only security
    is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: uncertainty.
  persid: ???
- desc: Sorry go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just said, the only means we're going to get this cold snap later.
  persid: S03
- desc: well. The thing that I. I don't like about the weather is how it. It gets
    nice, but then when everything's melting, then it freezes and then everything
    becomes a sheet of ice. called for that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: to happen.
  persid: ???
- desc: anyway. But I have these new pair of shoes from. That have an extra grip.
    And so i've been more confident on ice this winter. yeah. So that that's been
    a big help and serve like. wow. That is very grippy so i'm very happy with them.
    anyway. I don't wanna. Get too far off the beaten path here. So I. Did. Some analysis
    of our activity. So it's an interesting results. Here in a second. So is that
    noon kind of an okay thing. So what. about the activity, I realized. So maybe
    maybe what i'll do in the future, when I do these things is i'll make them do
    at the end of the day, or you can contribute by the end of the day, but. I might
    just do some analysis on some earlier version of the data and present that so
    you can maybe have the best of both worlds. so to speak. Anyway, so. it's it's
    not a. Very detailed analysis they did, but some interesting results anyway. Look
    at that and second. Maybe let's do our attendance here. Okay, here we are, for
    today, so our password. For you, is. right here. into the chat. Okay. Okay, so
    let me. Show you some of those results. The activity. So I captured the comments
    and i'm I did a word cloud for them. So you can see here that. We get this html
    entity for. An apostrophe appearing a lot. So that showed up in the word cloud
    as well. So I didn't do anything. With the comments for the word cloud and except
    I copied them. From this window and I paste it into a word cloud generator. So
    I did that. So, and then here is the search engine that was most helpful. 32 said,
    Google. And then he said duck duck go. bang and six. seven. client and. three.
    Because yeah. And a couple. Some other some other choices for search engines came
    in there. So some of the some of the answers, since this was just a text form
    to. capture the data so some of the responses were. not exactly what I was expecting.
    So we got some free for answers here as well. So then. Then we got to the URL
    most helpful. So the canada.ca public health services diseases to 2019 Nova novel
    coronavirus infection prevention risks that was the one that came up the most
    often. And then, a link from the CDC. centers for disease control the state's
    got 11. American association of retired persons. case you wanted what a rp is.
    there's also a Canadian version it's called carp. So then info 2020 Howard low
    how to lower coronavirus risk I got 11 and then. Six people. singled out the health
    that Harvard EDU. And then. Who. I chuckled to myself and they said, who. The
    World Health Organization website has a cup three it's there and then. Wikipedia.
    comes up for three. And then there's a different health Canada website. Well,
    I tried to consolidate these I missed one here so there's four there's a fourth
    vote for the Wikipedia article. And then, a few others a plate came in, with one
    each. Another page on the website. University of new Hampshire. You receive California
    Davis. So the. So asked about options and so options. weren't. discussed a lot.
    But. Can you one. I wonder. Whether. presents that are. Of. Time are timely and
    the information is changing. And certainly. Google Google should. Understand that's
    the case for coven. and other search engines as well. Then, how do we. Ensure
    that we are getting the latest information that's the latest and best information.
    Because the aarp website is from. So that doesn't really talk about vaccinations.
    So let me go and. So when I was formulating this activity. The seamless. The idea
    that I was going for is is that people are. confused about things, what risks
    related to coven. And so I wanted to see what can we get some clarity my doing
    a search for them. So if I do a search right now for. Make sure that I get the
    rate. phrase here. So what I noticed, some people who said, Google is helpful.
    And he talked about the first links. So they talked about CDC how to protect yourself
    and others. But there wasn't a discussion about this material that comes up front.
    So last week, especially, it was a hot topic about. Understanding the effectiveness
    of vaccines against. to minimize my risk. Should I be vaccinated is vaccination
    and part of minimizing my risk of care of contracting and transmitting coven.
    So a common question that came up. From Google so there's. To look at this structure
    here there's a coven link here. let's open that in a separate tab. So that's just
    a search. For code 19. And then. So we get let's see what what's the dog say here.
    So I can share send feedback. So I get a choice of looking at overview news statistics
    testing symptoms variance prevention and then, are there any others treatments.
    Or the extra.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hello, Sarah we can't see your Google screen.
  persid: S05
- desc: Oh i'm sorry. Thank you. Thanks for letting me know. I thought I switch back,
    I imagine they did anyway sorry. Okay, so so come on through now. Thinking, as
    I see the box around my browser window.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, we can see it now.
  persid: S05
- desc: So anyway so here's. here's the question that I asked. And so I typed it into
    the search box and they get. Information structured this way So the first thing
    is this link is this button for covert 19. which goes to a search for covert 19
    and then, it gives me a number of tabs here. So if I was interested in prevention
    for of covert 19 my click there. So again, this is it gets us to the point of
    where I think we were looking at this last day we're public health agency of Canada
    as a public service announcement wear a mask save lives wear a mask clean your
    hands keep a safe distance. And then, if I click on more info there. To go to
    the Canada government of Canada website. Go to prevention and risks. Then coven.
    So this gives you an idea of what is needed for. masks. This is different than
    prevention and risks if I click there. So we get to a spot that's. On the government
    of Canada website, but it's not the one that I would expect. I expect to lend
    here, and this is the page, I think that was the most part, most helpful URL identified
    an activity. Well, anyway, so you're gonna mention here of vaccination. Alright,
    so. So, to me, the more info button isn't exactly following. Maybe it matches
    the poster here but wearing a mask. But it isn't yours my. My interest in prevention.
    As much as I could because it's only focuses on masks. Whereas i'd like to see.
    More information about in general, what. and minimize my risk of contracting and
    transmitting coven. So. Well, what I wanted to say here is that. So, aside from
    having prevention, information and the tab. On the search results recovered 19
    common question what are some preventative measures for coven. This comes from
    Wikipedia. And if I check. That so this about the result is a. Is a reasonable
    feature here, I think. So it gives. Some details of where it came from. and How
    my connection is to site. gives me a few other. bits of information there. But
    what it doesn't do is. Show me the context of. of where this message comes from.
    So if I do a search for that one phrase. It does come from the article. So, can
    you see it here. So it's taken, it seems to me that this could be. This leaving
    out others important. Important edit. If I look at the whole page. So several
    covert 19 vaccines have been approved and distributed various countries which
    have initiated mass vaccination campaigns. So I think we talked a little bit about
    this on Thursday didn't me. So. So I sent some feedback to Google saying. That
    I thought, leaving out other was an important. was an important change to the
    Wikipedia article, even though the only difference really is making the CAP, the
    p changing from lowercase uppercase. So. I didn't invite. Some discussion here
    about. And we will do will do greater room for this. let's. get a whiteboard up
    here. and formulate a question for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Part Sir I just had a good question.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So so previously, I went to this one session seminar with a librarian and
    she was telling us that whenever you go searching for some information, you should
    never consider Wikipedia as a trusted source because, like everyone gets access
    to edit the information in there. So, like so i'm kind of confused like should
    we consider taking information from Wikipedia but because most of the time we
    don't really know who is leaving the information there, and if even if it's like
    trustworthy or not.
  persid: S06
- desc: With Wikipedia you can pretty much check all the sources bottom. yeah sometimes
    there are like errors, where people do like change the page. maliciously but.
    yeah anywhere, though. yeah. If you look at the sources that Wikipedia has that
    of that page, you can find out whether or not that information is valid based
    on where they're getting their information from. But it is a great way to understand
    a topic.
  persid: S07
- desc: But like, as you said, like sometimes people do it for malicious purposes,
    how do we. know if.
  persid: S06
- desc: it's it's rare it's it's just at this point Wikipedia the people that are
    malicious have just basically been kicked off it was mostly in the early days
    when. There wasn't that many users but there's so many editors now to the point
    where anybody that's like just coming in with an account that has high level because
    that's essentially how you can edit high level Wikipedia pages. They they just
    get outraged by the 10 other people that do it.
  persid: S07
- desc: I agree, yes. Well edited enough that I can trust it. In most almost all cases
    looking for alternative sources to double check is a great idea it's something
    you should definitely do but usually if it's not like a PDL trusted.
  persid: S02
- desc: Well, very high school concern I guess.
  persid: S07
- desc: it's a very which concern.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Most of our teachers in high school had that concern they if you had Wikipedia
    as a reference because that's you can just reference all the references that Wikipedia
    has.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah so. The common foe Wikipedia. That I have on my webpage is an put is
    some advice for you and dealing with Wikipedia it's a great place to start looking
    for information on a topic, but it's not a great place to end up, I mean so don't
    include references to Wikipedia. But. Wikipedia I think is generally provides
    a good. introduction to a topic. And so I don't know that the problems of false
    or. misleading information Wikipedia is completely solved, but there are a number
    of editors. So there's quite a group of people who keep track of edits to. Different
    pages. and make sure that the information is. Up to their standard and if it's
    not up to their standard. They can insert different warnings, so you might have
    seen Wikipedia pages that say. This needs more citations this is too much like
    a press release i'm not. quoting the text messages verbatim. And i'll recall them
    exactly but they'll have different warnings in the text, so you can. indicate
    that you should be extra wary of of what you're reading there. So I mean another.
    Another trap for sources online is things that look like they're from an official
    organization. But. it's not quite. The name isn't quite right and so maybe they've.
    To pretend pretending to be an impartial government authority, but really they're.
    Pushing their own agenda. And it's hard to tell from the URL that. At first glance,
    it might look like it's a legitimate source, but it really isn't. So that's another
    source of misinformation. or not nestle misinformation but. So we need to be careful
    not just about Wikipedia. We need to be careful with everything that we read on
    the Internet and make sure that. We. don't just rely on one source. Whatever good
    it is. or good at appears to be. We should find multiple sources for the same
    information. that's one way to protect ourselves. This is a long question here.
    On the snippet on Google. Let me get into a little bit smaller. or not smaller
    but. So is Wikipedia trusted source so that's just a general question but, more
    particularly, should Google use Wikipedia as a source for snippets of code 19
    when the snippet on Google is different from the Wikipedia source, who should
    rest of discrepancy. So is it up to Google to say they need to correct the way
    they're. they're finding snippets on Wikipedia. Or is it should could Wikipedia
    improve the way it's. Should we should they be explaining how they get to that
    result. That makes sense for a question. Okay, so i'm going to open breakout rooms
    and. let's take 10 minutes to discuss this. Well before I do that or when i'm
    setting that up there are questions about the question on the stream, please let
    me know. Okay, so let's see in 10 minutes. Okay, so let you share your screens
    within your wiki within your breakout rooms. Okay. Okay who's left let's see.
    So, then, we. So ramp, can you tell me which room your shirt man, which what's
    your classwork group number.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah i'm in group five.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: what's your group number. Okay, let me deal with those josh.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So if you're not can you. If you're not getting an invite your group post
    your group number, you should be in and i'll sign you there. Okay anyone else
    who's still in the main room, can you post, the group number. You should be assigned
    to and i'll assign you to that room. you're not able to get there yourself. So
    it's not quite a few people in the main room. For those of you. Students, in the
    main room, can you. Join your group or. Post your group number in the chat and
    I will assign you to it. To that room. Excuse me. Okay, so we're at 10 minutes
    started, so we need to wrap up. No okay. everyone's back, I guess, all right.
    So, is that a good discussion.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, because one of the better ones.
  persid: S01
- desc: that's good okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Anyone like to share.My group.
  persid: ???
- desc: My group said that we did not trust Wikipedia as a main source mostly because
    there is so much foot traffic and to patient patrolling versus other smaller pages.
    Maybe to use it as a third source or not even a secondary. We felt that Google
    was. Responsible to. address those discrepancies and we weren't sure what the
    process was that they used us we didn't feel comfortable saying whether or not
    it was transparent.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: My group basically said the same thing, Google or Wikipedia isn't a credible
    information source just to the fact that it is possible for. malicious store fingering.
    Incorrect users to edit the page, although, even though there is a team of mods
    who are trusted, so I think yeah disavows it for being credible source. I want
    to step on Google is different from the Wikipedia source, I think it is google's
    responsibility or any search engines responsibility to. address the differences
    there should be a. way for search engines to search algorithm that checks for
    factual information. And for the final question. Is the process transparent I
    don't think it is because I don't understand the algorithms and I don't I wouldn't
    know where to look to find that information out.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um no group we talked about Wikipedia is a good source to start a topic. But
    when it when it came to Google, we thought that it was it was pretty reasonable
    for Google to use Wikipedia as a source. Because that is what most people use
    Google for is to get an initial idea about a topic, it is the most initial idea
    so someone has a question they don't really know what's going on with a topic
    they'll search it up on Google. So even if it's not as it doesn't have as much
    context or it's not as accurate, it is a great place to start. And Google just
    pull straight off of Wikipedia they say it right underneath the little snippet.
    So I feel like Wikipedia is a pretty good source for Google and it is a pretty
    good way to start understanding, a topic.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So when you said pulled directly from Wikipedia So do you think they've pulled
    directly from Wikipedia or is that. Or is the fact they've started. They excluded
    the word other from that sentence. Is that. A major issue a minor issue or no
    issue at all, people should just go to Wikipedia and read it selves.
  persid: DHH
- desc: um I mean a lot of the the snippets are used by like. Virtual assistants kind
    of thing and a lot of people ask those type of questions and they just want a
    quick answer some people will search something on their phone. And they just get
    that snippet they don't want to go through a Wikipedia page and and understand
    the whole topic, they just want a very rudimentary understanding of something.
    Okay, so when Google does that little snippet. yeah if you lose a lot of context
    might be a little missed it misinformed on the topic, but you're not really diving
    deep, so I don't think most people it's on their mind when they're searching something
    on Google like that.
  persid: S07
- desc: So if somebody said. Well, that i'm playing the devil's advocate here say
    that I said, well, I don't think vaccines work and they said well you know because
    I looked on Google. and asked about how to progress minimize my risk of contracting
    and transmitting coven and it said wear a mask and wash your hands and social
    distance, but I do those things it doesn't say I should get a you know I don't
    think. Vaccination is. A preventive measure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, from what I understand Google when it comes to controversial topics, they
    will pull from a. A different source than Wikipedia so I understand that if you
    search something about coronavirus it'll come from the CDC or the World Health
    Organization. Or, if you look up something about racism they'll pull it from the
    anti defamation League and so when it comes to controversial topics, they have
    a different policy. But that's what I understand.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay, but sorry. So this query wasn't controversial. I mean so we're talking
    about. Google, providing a snippet. editing Wikipedia by. Removing the other at
    the beginning of the sentence.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Right.
  persid: S07
- desc: Where does that fit on in the scale of things, do you think.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Again it's it's like an initial understanding of a topic if if you want more
    information, the link is right there for you to click in and get more context
    and. And if you do want to understand the topic better most people will go in
    and read more. about it than just read.
  persid: S07
- desc: The Green, I understand that, but then. Do you think it's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Reducing the grand scheme of things there's not really much they. can do in
    terms of like their algorithm. And I don't think it's that big of a problem. Okay,
    but I.
  persid: S07
- desc: Think it's a huge problem.
  persid: S09
- desc: also think it's a huge problem, but I agree with your point that it's in the
    users hands to. You know, establish what are good sources and verify their readings.
  persid: S10
- desc: well.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah so. So we're offloading things to the individual again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it's on it. will actually.
  persid: S10
- desc: To.
  persid: ???
- desc: produce. skepticism and individuals. On the schooling system to produce skepticism
    in. Young people they don't do enough of that in school, so people don't like
    they trust sources, and then you know it kind of leads you down that rabbit hole
    right now.
  persid: S10
- desc: yeah. So do you think we're thinking we're doing critical thought here in
    this class. And are we encouraging that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: thing so.
  persid: S07
- desc: Very.
  persid: S09
- desc: Sure, I found that.
  persid: S11
- desc: it's it's kind of. not giving you a lot of freedom there, so of course we're
    doing this in class Dr happening who's going to sign my final grade. So I understand
    that. So maybe you don't have free and unformed. I mean you're you're not feeling
    completely free to give me an honest answer there. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I found our using critical thinking in this class because we're not we're
    being forced to not view everything at face value or being forced to actually
    look deeper into the subjects which, in turn, is making us think more critically
    due to the extra information we're getting from this.
  persid: S11
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: And it's not like we discourage different opinions I said something people
    didn't agree, no one said anything it's not it's not like we're forced to learn,
    only one opinion. Okay.
  persid: S07
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: So there have been some there's lots of stuff going on in Ottawa, especially
    this these past few days so. It makes the discussion about. It We talked a little
    bit about the public good and what does that mean exactly. And I think. there's.
    There are competing visions of public but being advanced. So we need to think
    carefully about what that implies as well. anyway. So. here's a question that
    I. That I didn't add on to my long question already for the breakout room but.
    So do you think. The way the Google makes a snippet. Is it. If Wikipedia got some
    feedback about. How that was creating the snippet. Could Wikipedia. The editors
    make that paragraph. More more clear. That makes sense, so instead of. So let
    me go back to the.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The article here, I actually have an idea what they could do to fix that they
    could. Have a piece of code inside the web page that directs any snippets that
    are taken to be only from a certain section, or only from a like you can design
    that encode very easily for any a smart assistant to pick up.
  persid: S03
- desc: So, can you explain a bit more.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So when you're designing like a. CS website, or whatever so like Wikipedia
    or html you can have certain headers that. Direct certain requests to certain
    sections of pages, so what you could do is design a header that directs any home
    assistant or any Google assistant or any assistance in general. To a certain section
    to only snip from that way it's a it's like a border for what it can actually
    take out of that page.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay, so in one sense, I could just be an ID for the. For the block of text.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah exactly.
  persid: S03
- desc: Good design. say I had a heading out this. Beginning with a paragraph several
    covert 19 vaccines have been approved that data so bad hanging there prevention.
    and And so the link then just go to the Wikipedia page it goes went to that. That
    header with the ID. So I end up with this paragraph.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah exactly so you would direct it to a specific paragraph for a specific
    section of words.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah Okay, so I see the. input value of that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It just be very complex to edit on every page for Wikipedia can be tremendously
    expensive as well.
  persid: S03
- desc: So anyway, so if I just finished my thoughts, so I mean that's an interesting
    idea that we have named links so. We don't end up kind of just on the. In the
    middle of the ocean, so to speak, when we went to find an island and we ended
    up. So our navigation is more precise. But then i'm wondering if the snippet could
    give some feedback to Wikipedia. Or if there's a process that said that said here's
    the input text that we. use for the snippet, and this is what we came up with.
    So. That could be a metric for the Wikipedia editors to say we need to have. You
    know, we could evaluate the. Quality of the snippet Jared for a paragraph. or.
    If the snippet isn't very good. Then, how do we improve the writing of the paragraph,
    so the point I was getting at is, for example. You know, for talking about preventive
    measures. You know, we we start by describing. You know, say, the WHO. says that
    vaccination, you should get vaccinated when it's your turn that's important. that's
    a very effective tool against contracting and transmitting covert. Either preventive
    measures include. and so on and so forth. That makes sense. So I just want to.
    Before we run out of time today, I wanted to just have a quick discussion about.
    project proposal due dates. So is Monday the 14th still a good date. or. You can
    let me know if we can discuss that on Thursday. And in terms of ideas. So I heard
    about the sweet Bobby podcast. Which is about. Just here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: There it is so let me post that link in the chat. So maybe people are asking
    about reviewing things and so maybe this is an appropriate. basis for view, so
    this is a story about a catfishing. The cat phishing scam that went over a number
    of years and. So if that's of interest. Maybe instead so we could talk about the
    podcast and the issues are that arise from it. And then the other thing that we're
    just talking about today. You know, maybe focus on. How does Google come up with
    snippets and how do we. How do we. Make use of them. And then lastly. Now go.
    So Chapter four and blown to bits is about search engine so maybe that's a good
    thing to look out for our continuing discussion. anyway. So. Any questions or
    comments about that. And then say, if you have. If you decided and working in
    a group for a project. You could even. host that. To worst you post. You can.
    Oh i'll make a discussion topic of project groups, then you can reply to that.
    So that we can serve the project groups before you submit the assignment. Okay,
    any questions or concerns before we say goodbye for today.
