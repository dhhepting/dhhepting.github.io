Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: morning everyone. last day of our meetings. and glad to hear that. i'm. Sorry,
    the last semesters on Monday. sense. Anyway, you know that. Twice or good measure.
    Thinking about when can I make this available. Logistics so. that's what i'm thinking.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, I for one would like more time, if that is possible. Apparently, because
    I have a math exam right after years and usually I like studying for the two days
    prior to any math exam.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, I don't want to.
  persid: ???
- desc: Make it too long, either, I guess, we can do 72 hours. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: I looked for regulations about this, I didn't see so. We do. That. Say it's
    do when they sat and sun, does that mean. We have to finish playful like admin
    where we would start working on it, it might not know. So it will be your. Only
    one end of April. I see, so we start working on a. 17 1672 hours. Yes. Because
    the logistics of having some great class and some people right online for time
    art events. Professional. responsibilities.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor can you adjust the camera a little to the right. Thanks.
  persid: S03
- desc: So asked you first suggestions about exam questions. So so welcome those.
    let's see today's the seventh. Some say the 14th. And the end of the day. let's
    say by noon on the 14th. Okay, so. Maybe a longer one. For ones as well. But i'm
    open to suggestions for the. sys makeup of the exam. Okay, and it's worth. So
    no I can't extend the due date for the exam. Oh.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. yeah so the project, we can. discuss a little bit, but the exam is going
    to be finished at April on April 19 at noon. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, will it be a three hour time window between these three days or like can
    we work on it for three days.
  persid: S04
- desc: There will be times. Such. You won't have you won't have a three hour time
    when they do not three days. Three days to. To to write your answers.
  persid: DHH
- desc: like an open window, so we have like $70. yeah.
  persid: S05
- desc: So you will get the questions you can access the questions. On April 16 at
    noon. Language so they're open exams. That time.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thanks services covered it. caught up my pictures of the boards and. transcripts
    and. responses. so far. So I was trying to airdrop photos from my. iPhone. To
    my macbook air and. It just wasn't working so I had to get an old cable and the
    US. With the US, the old USB connector. and Do. That for law. anyway. said that
    I should. Try that out. So the only problem was that sometimes I have. Taken his
    movies. i'm not sure why I grabbed the end. Okay, so that's. My site and it's
    seems to be working. Not just in my imagination, but actually. For today's. Did
    include a couple of links here, so one is a Canadian information processing society.
    So this is the website. So I mean that another time right look at this website,
    as opposed to the computer science Department of State. That says it is too graphic.
    and none great resolution. See the magic around the letters. anyway. it's a good
    organization. There, this is the. organization for completed information technology
    professionals of Canada. So. I encourage. You to look. at them. And here's the
    Association for computing machine. To their student memberships. And there's a
    special interest groups. So renters to this class would be maybe the sig sig CAS
    special interest group and computers and society. Food guy. special interest group
    on computer human interaction. Maybe 60 SEC. like to say 60. computer science,
    education. special interest group and computer science, education. So they're
    celebrating 75 years. So 75 years it's. Not the board. So shish the 47 that's
    Nick. will say 47. So that's right from the very beginning of computing. As I
    mentioned, we had a student chapter here. Some years Nice.
  persid: DHH
- desc: See.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay extension for the project any comments about that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Two days.
  persid: ???
- desc: What do you think send us. How about in person start seeing okay. Okay anything
    else. Do that right now. OK, so the 13th of April. So tango human interfaces in
    class and then it struck me. What the in humanity and your courses or moodle interface.
    So I don't I don't want to sell protect the names of the innocent I will show
    you the screens exactly but i'll describe the problem. So for the Web assessment,
    I divided into groups of four or five. So 24 groups so two markers so I wanted
    to do well groups. REACH marker. So. So, how would you how would you think about
    approaching that problem if you if you allow. groups, the Group assignment. Just
    my master. race this. makes sense, I think I have 24 groups and i'd like to divide
    them equally between two people who are marking. So i'm not looking at your courses.
    You and be able to look at your course to see this. So just thinking about. Signing.
    markers to. associate markers with particular submissions. Doing. descent without
    thinking about how you are going to talk to people and having your courses doing
    it, how does it. Without being constrained. With a sense of what you are courses
    or moodle does. So, how would you think about an interface to do that. So question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: I don't want you to guess about where you are courses does right now I want
    you to think about what makes the most sense if you're if you were. Doing this.
    assigning markers to these group assignments. Any ideas about that. Professor
    to group individuals.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: assigned that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That group, a single.
  persid: ???
- desc: project that can be marked as. Great as the black roll back. So useful. notion
    that Simon. One assignment per group so it's not like inspiring from the group,
    we have to. So we want the market to be associated all five of those people instead
    of. Maybe splitting the Alpha group. Between markers because that wouldn't make
    sense. So even saying that I might like to say. So i'd like I think big a button
    like that it's going to be school, so I can see how many groups are going to say
    here are the markers who are going to be marking assignment. assigned the same
    number of groups to each marker. Any other thoughts. So you can say. We can figure
    out the math so that approximately. Okay. My. randomly assigning the groups. yeah
    fine taken. The lead and just have. Things. Things they're here are the set of
    features a barrel likes and here's the features that. corey likes and here's the
    you know so we're gonna. a collection of things that don't make sense to everybody,
    but I to me, there are things in moodle that seem like that's happened already.
    So. Because they have certain things. That are probably very clear to some people,
    but not to the average person I would think they're not very clear to me what
    their intent. anyway. So, even then, I would say. There you their interfaces like
    this, or see. We have. So I can just pick and choose from this list and make an
    association. So there are examples of what of interfaces that exist in your in
    moodle that can be adapted. To me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: assign a group assignment to markers The key thing is that it's a group assignment
    and so she operating on a level groups of individuals. courses and middle. drop
    down. By labels are tested for saying. So if I select one. And then I got a list
    of numbers. So. select all group members. So I got a screen stuff like i'm here
    I select the group and I get to the people in that group. But I don't I don't
    have the name of the group on that screen I select all the group members, I say
    assign them to this marker. So I do that, and this dialog box to come up and said,
    are you sure you want to do this, yes okay changing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ???
- desc: And all this is done by clicking. A year wow. there's a group. I can, maybe
    I can select the group.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Less than.
  persid: ???
- desc: just get them off the list ordered by groups. So the reason why this is important
    is so that the people, the two markers have the right names in the spreadsheet.
    So yeah we're doing for using a spreadsheet but. want to make sure that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: marks.
  persid: ???
- desc: It could be a collaborative document. Like to person have the same way to
    a document then whatever you update it say about this, but the person. yeah. To
    read the sun more complicated than. It was just focusing on the way it. is okay,
    I think I think it would be okay, if I just showed showed us. Your course interface
    for this. Is not these hadn't been marked yet so that. Okay, so here's. So i'm
    going to save your submissions. So several groups, and I can say. Look, for Saturday.
    And there are people in this group. So the idea is to select them all. And then
    was selected, then I went to assign said allocated marker. And then I have to
    click go. Go really want to do this, yes. Okay, so that's quite a few stuffs and
    I have to do that 24 times. So the other idea my strategy that I thought might
    work. Is what if I. started writing group. And I can sort by group. I can start
    by marker. I can sort by status, I can search by email address. I can search by
    name. I can assign sort by group. Like my thought would be. groups. Groups change.
    one. can organize list in that way. yeah. The same effect to be an option that.
    to distinguish between individual assignment and the assignment, so this layout
    would have just the trials or painful truths that you and then.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The lockers and just give it wonderful.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah. So it's still like to have individuals in the spreadsheet because we'd
    like to get everyone having the same good everyone had to get a mark. About that
    would be solved if if there is a column as well markers degree it's after the
    fact, and. Those recently passed would go to the. yeah. I think that's. A good
    idea to just to hide the details so where I to me what seems inhumane about this
    interface. That I do a lot of clicking. And that happens, a lot of kicking clicking
    24 times. Whereas I could imagine. You know there's some facility to say this
    group assignment people submit in groups. And only one person in the group nisha
    submitted so and the information is there. But it's not being used, and so I have
    to deal with. assigning. markers to not two groups, but two sets of individuals.
    Or, in the same group. So I think as computer professionals, we have a responsibility
    to. Think about the impact of our decisions. And people who are designed moodle
    done lots of good things, but this is an area where they haven't thought through
    to meet those where they haven't thought through the implications of the design
    and so there's definitely room for improvement. So I don't know if it's exactly
    the same as. Marking. sounds similar to what you're describing. But it's also,
    I think, also we don't need to think about. The way the ways to work around things.
    So often it's. Just you're competing it's like well people can figure out how
    to use it and it's a badge of line to figure out a user. And that's part of the
    challenge for the excitement of the whole. package. They can both be professional.
    Saying can you that that's the bars too low to say that people can figure it out.
    The idea is that continuing. To me, is. A way to augment human abilities, not
    to. make people running around in circles bang their heads against the wall. So
    that quote hey that's a good place to end. Quote I have from JCR lickliter 1960
    where he talks about the. The the time it'll take develop on human computer symbiosis
    and might be five years, it might be 500 years, but that is the most exciting
    and it's intellectually stimulating period, and I think that's where. Where we
    are now opportunity we have.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The focus.and
  persid: ???
- desc: Helping at. and furthering this that often users, a symbiotic relationship
    between people and computers. When people are using computers to achieve. Greater
    things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: Greater things will still remain in control not let it not ceding control
    computers, but. This was a symbiotic relationship. Yes, if we see control the
    computers will end up the. terminator scenario is it skynet and. gone to the well
    too many times with the movies now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ???
- desc: anyway. that's. That would not be a good way to. A good future for us.
  persid: DHH
- desc: To have like five mark five minutes there, but I just have a question the
    project deliverable rubric has four miles further completed plan so if you are
    basically writing a research paper, how do we write about the complete then part
    I do need to include like dates or timelines. And likes some things to read it
    in the proposal.
  persid: S05
- desc: it's just sort of fit say thank you to send us for that last column. So it's.
    An indication that. You follow through on your plan that's why I interpreted.
    So you had milestones in. In your plan, and so, then those milestones are realized
    in deliverable. So that make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, thank you.
  persid: S05
- desc: Any other questions or concerns.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And when you have office hours today at 232 30.
  persid: S05
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: ???
- desc: And they have them from you can commune as well. So i'll try and. keep my
    office hours next week as well. that's. Okay. Good it's been a interesting semester.
    It seems like it's been longer than three months, three months somehow we started
    in. January. But thank you for the Semester and your engagement participation
    this semester. And I hope to see you. Again future Maybe the time when won't have
    to be wearing masks. Anyway, Okay, thank you take care, everyone. Thanks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor what is a word limit of our project if we're doing individual.
  persid: S06
- desc: Sorry again here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like what is the word limit of our project. Like of project if we are doing
    individual.
  persid: S06
- desc: individually. individual project. So my comments about assigning martyrs to
    groups was just about whether it's a website assessment that group assignment.
    It wasn't about the project.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like, but it will be okay, for you right just full five pages.
  persid: S06
- desc: So remember the length.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah about the length. So.
  persid: S06
- desc: i'm sure that. Somewhere in our. conversations, but I would say about 1500
    words going to take. it's probably the appropriate length of your report.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you, thank you. Okay yeah.
  persid: S06
- desc: Changing settings to be a few more minutes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry.
  persid: ???
- desc: Sir, I just had one last quick question.
  persid: S07
- desc: sure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, those are just in case in the final exam we are like taking information
    from some out outside source do we do you want us to say those websites are those
    pages.
  persid: S07
- desc: Yes, so there'll be some. description about what's true. So yes, when you're
    writing. an essay question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: S07
- desc: You should be ready to cite some sources, I think.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That makes sense yeah Thank you so much. yeah have a good one, thanks for
    this amazing semester so.
  persid: S07
- desc: Welcome
  persid: ???
- desc: Thank you, thank you okay to say goodbye now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hello, Professor I just got one question. Sure um so I was just thinking that
    my blog entry monster not yet there, so I was thinking if everyone has caught
    the mark, so I was thinking if I got any issues from my side or not.
  persid: S08
- desc: No, I just I just had to review a couple marks, so all finished today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay number one and so thank you so much, have a great day bye.
  persid: S08
- desc: Thanks fine.
  persid: ???
- desc: will be provisioned last last question. In our final exam we have quiz as
    well as se right.
  persid: S06
- desc: Now so i'll be keiko.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You have.
  persid: ???
- desc: There won't be a time three hour part for the exam it will be. an essay question,
    plus a couple other questions, maybe. And you have from. April 16 of April 19.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay sure okay yeah and.
  persid: S06
- desc: Welcoming your suggestions for questions and answers. A fair assessment during
    the Semester. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah Thank you.
  persid: S06
- desc: you're welcome so i'm going to end this meeting and i'll be back in my zoom
    office tower shorter it's tough to go get a constant so it can be running on all
    cylinders, for your questions in my office our time okay. bye.

- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: yes !!
  persid: S09
- desc: Professor, can you please us give any advice on how we can study for the Finals?
    Thank you!
  persid: S10
- desc: It is a take-home exam that will be available on April 16 @ noon and will
    be due April 19 @ noon.  There should be enough time to prepare and write the
    exam within that timeframe without having to study a lot in advance.
  persid: S11
- desc: Will we have 72 hours to work on it? Or will it be any 3 hours between the
    72 hour time window??
  persid: S04
- desc: The exam will become available at April 16 @ noon and you must submit it by
    April 19 @ noon. So, you have 72 hours to work on it.
  persid: S11
- desc: "If you are wish to study beforehand for the exam, take a look at the topics\
    \ on the board (they are all things we\u2019ve discussed)"
  persid: S11
- desc: what will be the format of the final? a URCourses quiz? or an essay we have
    to submit?
  persid: S05
- desc: I would like to know Fianl project Deliverable information. Can you give me
    some example or format?
  persid: S12
- desc: The format of the final is a take-home exam, so there will be some writing
    questions (a few short ones and a couple of long ones).
  persid: S11
- desc: also, can you please consider to extend the due date?
  persid: S09
- desc: meeting code?
  persid: S13
- desc: at8fsk
  persid: S10
- desc: Dr. Hepting is still open to suggestions for the type of questions on the
    exam.
  persid: S11
- desc: The final must be due at the time it is with no extensions due to University
    regulations. The due date of the project can be discussed if anyone has concerns.
  persid: S11
- desc: For the project deliverable, it is directly related to your project proposal.
    In your project proposal, you would have chosen a topic and a way to present it
    (the deliverable). This can be a research paper, podcast, video, etc. So, the
    project deliverable is you putting your proposal into action. I hope that makes
    sense
  persid: S11
- desc: Is it possible we can have a day extension for the project deliverable?
  persid: S14
- desc: two days would be great
  persid: S15
- desc: that will be great
  persid: S14
- desc: I'm good with anything.
  persid: S01
- desc: "Ya sure that\u2019s good"
  persid: S16
- desc: sounds good
  persid: S17
- desc: Two day extension for the project deliverable is given, so it will be due
    April 13 at 11:59pm
  persid: S11
- desc: attendance?
  persid: S18
- desc: at8fsk
  persid: S10
- desc: The Project Deliverable Rubric has 4 marks for the Completed Plan. If we are
    writing a research paper, how do we write about "Completed Plan" part? Do we need
    to include dates and timelines like we did in the proposal? It would be great
    if you can talk about this.
  persid: S03
- desc: Can you please provide sample of Project Deliverable?
  persid: S19
- desc: I'm going to guess - you must select all of the individuals of all of the
    groups for each marker.
  persid: S01
- desc: you mean randomly assign the groups?
  persid: S14
- desc: I think doing something like this is handy and could be extremely useful.
    However adding too many niche options to something can also end up making it needlessly
    more complicated due to too many options
  persid: S20
- desc: could you show us on urcourses how it looks?
  persid: S15
- desc: why don't use do all the markings in a spreadsheet then upload it later?
  persid: S14
- desc: Another option would have been - assign all students to one marker then reassign
    12 of them to the other marker.
  persid: S01
- desc: '*12 groups'
  persid: S01
- desc: That's the same problem when we have to did all the markings in cs100, the
    list couldn't be sorted by Lab section. We had to generate a spreadsheet, marked
    on it, and import the file later
  persid: S14
- desc: "\u2018We do not want robots out to get us\u2019 - Dr. Hepting"
  persid: S11
- desc: I had a quick question
  persid: S07
- desc: Thank you everyone for a great semester and good luck on finals!
  persid: S11
- desc: will we have a quiz as well?
  persid: S07
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S14
- desc: Thank you!!
  persid: S21
- desc: Thank you!
  persid: S22
- desc: No, just the take home dinal
  persid: S11
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S03
- desc: or just writing question?
  persid: S07
- desc: thank you Dr. Hepting!
  persid: S15
- desc: Thank you!
  persid: S01
- desc: Thank you
  persid: S23
- desc: Thank you !
  persid: S24
- desc: Thank you Sundus for keep us informed
  persid: S14
