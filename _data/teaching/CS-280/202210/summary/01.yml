- desc: morning morning everyone.
  persid: S04
- desc: My name.
  persid: S05
- desc: So. i'm going to ask you to do is. rename yourselves. So. On my zoom client
    there's if I hover over a picture or my rectangle. there's dot dot dot. I didn't
    realize I turned on a waiting room here. So i'm having to admit people.
  persid: DHH
- desc: waiting room.
  persid: ???
- desc: So where there's dot dot dot. over my rectangle I click on that it gives me
    the option to rename. So i'd like you to do is your name yourself to be. So that.
    The name you'd like people to call you in class is first and then parentheses.
    Put your your vagina email ID.
  persid: DHH
- desc: we're good Mike.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay. So make sure your MIC is off and you come in. Okay, so, if you look
    at mine, you can see. My now my name is now darryl. And then in parentheses http
    ti n G D, which is my. ID for my you Jana email address.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So this will help to.
  persid: ???
- desc: identify you. To each other and to me. and Now Elsa helps me to keep track
    of. A view so i'm going to do. So i'm not going to post your names on the website,
    but i'm going to keep track of the comments you make. In. chats and. And in zoom
    meetings. And i'll use your your email ID to do that. So i'm. Let me back up maybe.
    Okay, so i'm going to talk about attendance as well in a minute here. So, my name
    is Darrell happening i'm a professor in the department of computer science. Some
    of you may know me, looking at the class list. I saw a few familiar names. So
    you're welcome to call me Darrell or Dr happening asked you to pick one of those
    two. And if you're if you. I suppose in the zoom transcript like sometimes appears
    Dr happening. But that's only fine to me, I think. anyway. So, how was your Christmas
    vacation and new year's. yeah mine was short to. Welcome back to the winter semester
    for the New Year. Okay, so let me share my screen. Okay, so can you see my screen,
    I think you can't.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep yeah.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S07
- desc: OK so. The syllabus link is from last year, so I. I will get that updated
    by. Our next meeting. i'll make sure that all of these are current links, by next
    meeting. Okay, so. A few things aren't. Working yet. Taken classroom before I
    made some improvements and i've upgraded to. bootstrap version 5.2. So. Anyway,
    so here's. here's our list of meetings for the Semester. And then my semester
    schedule. So we have our class here. Tuesdays and Thursdays, so we have 24 meetings
    all together over the Semester. i'm going to have office hours intend to noon.
    coloring is a little bit off here track that down. And then, also from 230 to
    330. on Tuesdays and Thursdays said seem. Like a good. Okay, good availability
    of office, my office time. Okay, so if those don't work, then we can coordinate
    by email to. find a time that works. Okay, so i'm going to have some more links.
    For you here. listed the topics you're going to cover. we'll talk about that.
    next day, as well as assignments and exams. So my feeling. Is that we don't need
    to have a midterm exam. And we can do a final exam at the end of the Semester.
    So i'm. that's my plan anyway and we'll talk about my plan for the Semester. On
    Thursday. Okay. So here for our list of meetings. Sorry, it was wondering why
    it wasn't updated.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so this is the page web page like this for all our meetings. And i've
    added. Some navigation here. Trying that out so. If. You have questions or comments
    about my. about the website, let me know. and i'll address them as quickly as
    I can. So for the meetings. So we'll have an outline for what we're going to do
    today. And then these other items are following the class. So if there's some
    media some pictures screen captures that I take during this class or some other
    bits of. Other photos or. Things. Things well it's maybe a PDF or PNG file or
    something like that it comes up. i'll include them here and they'll appear. Under
    the media heading. The transcripts i'm going to post. transcripts from zoom. With.
    From from our audio transcript. So those are sometimes interesting to look at
    how zoom. translates. conversations and attacks the pretty good, but not always.
    And then we also transfer the chat session. So, like I said i'm not going to post
    your name so i'm going to. And pre process them so that. you're given. An identifier
    for the during the transcript. But, all I can keep. I can use still use the data
    to. keep track of your participation. So. There will be some marks participation,
    the Semester. And so. engagement in meetings by. posting things in chat and using
    a microphone. Heaven forbid. or turn on your camera well as. encourage people
    to turn on their camera if you'd like to do that, but. that's not something that's
    easily. managed Donna use it as a club either. So maybe we can do is. At the end
    of class, we can. Wave turn on cameras and we're. not something we do in the factory
    or science meeting so it's a nice way to stay connected. That makes sense and
    then responses so i'm given the opportunity to write a response. To each meeting.
    By the end of the day meeting. And then i'll collect those. And post them on the
    website anonymously under. different headings. And then lastly. And i'm using
    a reiki. and One in your courses so it's not going to be available to the world.
    That what. So this is not a new idea. For me, but this is a different execution
    level. So I created a wiki page for each meeting. and My going to. encourage you
    to. Take the source material that we collect here. Media transcripts responses.
    And edit them into the wiki. And then not. To that and. break out discussions
    and so forth, things that come up in class. and put them into. The forum for the
    wiki. OK so again for details of that in the second year. So here's a list of
    meetings, which is a copy of. My web the. Go to my website so it's the same. Really
    meeting so. So there's one place to go for each meeting. That page will. Have
    all the. All the material on. OK, so now. let's go to attendance. Now let's use
    this other link here. Kenya nice student view on. So let me. switch back to that
    belong in the student view and we just finished two things here. Okay, so this
    is the wiki that setup. So it's a collaborative wiki. So that means you can all.
    Continued. So this is this allows html. But the thing is. To make new pages. So
    I made a list so I made a index page for meetings there. You can go back to one.
    So let me just show you how. So you can do. That a link to a new page. Differences
    put them inside double brackets like that. So when I. made the link, there were.
    vindicated they want to link to a page. At this point, that page doesn't exist,
    so if I click on that. You can see it's an Alex in a different color. And click
    on that. first option I get is going to be the create the page. So, like you,
    that. Oh wow okay good so somebody already beat me to it. So this is the collaborative
    part of it. Okay. alright. So we're going to say is here meetings. So I said that
    each page. Link will be going to. And then i'm. i've created groups working class.
    So that was my next piece to talk about it. So in this list of side, made a list
    of classroom groups. And I made. A tactical error here, I suppose. So this list
    is generated by your courses. That included included student numbers. So. I put
    in one they're actually probably whoops. I didn't edit down the other ones. To
    remove the student members. So i'll fix that today. So i'm. i'm putting on i'm
    asking this group who's listed here. To. take the initiative and. Put it putting
    important things you found from the meeting. into the wiki page. So where we have
    breakout activities. Then different groups get different breakout rooms can make
    your own notes to the wiki. But in terms of capturing the main points and. elaborating
    on what was discussed in our meeting. i'm going to ask one of these groups to
    take over. take the lead. So there'll be 12 groups. So I have a funny story I
    had in mind that there are going to be 40 students online and 40 students face
    to face because there's two sections of training. Really there's probably 60 and
    60 so that was. Well, that was. A little bit expected. Anyway, so the groups are
    about 10 people each recall groups and there's 24 meetings, including today. So
    i'm going to ask.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That.
  persid: ???
- desc: Each group to look after to. To meeting days. Okay, so. So one thing i'm going
    to fix for Thursday, as well as taking off in the meeting room. waiting room.
    And had those. So first time i've had it enabled for a class me this time, keeping
    track of the default options. Okay, so today we're trying to get into the meeting.
    To stay in the waiting room and else i'll see you eventually. Okay, so yeah i'm
    going to assign different groups so there's groups one to 12 and i've put. group
    one here. On this page that linked to. one. And the other 11 groups, so this can
    have 120 students in group one, so one 12th of the students are randomly assigned
    to group one. So not everyone's in group one. Just the people who are listed here.
    Okay. And in terms of editing. pages it's just a matter. Aside from doing the
    links like I showed briefly there. it's just a matter of doing html. And if there
    are questions. In having that. i'm i'm certainly. Here, to help get that sorted
    out okay. So let me go back. So i'm not going to post the recordings and post
    the transcripts and closed the audio transcript and i'm going to post the chat
    session transcript. And you can use that as resource source material for the wiki.
    entry for the day and for you. Okay, and i'm happy to engage in a discussion about.
    how best to organize things what are good ways to do it and which are not such
    good ways to do it. Okay, so. let's see so there's a question here in the chat
    so the end of class. Should we going to comment on the class wiki or just really
    just use that for Greg so. If you're in the group who's going to take charge of.
    who's been assigned to keep charge take charge of editing. Then you can. You can
    do the editing the page. If. So for anyone anyone can make additions to the page
    so. yeah so when we do a breakout room activity. Take some notes and. Within within
    your breakout room and someone can copy and paste them into the wiki. So that's
    the idea, so it is to use the wiki page as a resource. for capturing additional
    information about the meetings, so the meeting page. will have the sort of the
    raw materials that you can use in the wiki page so. we'll see how it goes so.
    that's my feeling about how we can make this work. and And for group one for the
    classwork group one. If you want to talk to me about things. I don't mean to make
    this. For. Exceptional burden on your shoulders. The current state of doing this,
    but. i'm here as a support. You lend them support here to support everyone in
    class, we have a productive discussion. And so, our goal for the Semester is to
    think critically about computing. And the way we're going to do that is by looking
    at. Current events. Is one way, one way to look to see. The implications of computing
    in the world. and To evaluate its impact. let's see what. What things can. What
    things are there to. be aware of that aren't necessarily. made. Learn surface
    in. Our. Everyday conversations about things. Okay, so what i'm going to do now.
    i'm going to share. Your screen here. whiteboard. Okay i'm. gonna do the whiteboard
    the tenants so. send me direct messages, because then it messes up. My sending
    everybody in chat. Okay here's the password for the attendance in the chat. The
    password is good for today. This is based on the name of the class.
  persid: DHH
- desc: clarify the biggest risks and rewards in.
  persid: S03
- desc: An integration side in.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Welcome
  persid: S03
- desc: now talk about the responses in the middle. Okay, so i'm going to assign very
    good makeup reiko groups which aren't. Rich aren't going to. match up with the
    class work groups today but we'll do then. Starting Thursday. Okay, so i've started
    the breakout rooms, you can go ahead and join them. Sharing screen inside the
    breakout rooms.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: hey.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, can you transfer me to. The system kick me out I don't know why.
  persid: S08
- desc: Which group, are you in.
  persid: DHH
- desc: group 10.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you, Sir.
  persid: S08
- desc: you're welcome. Okay. So, how does that go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: See pretty productive.
  persid: ???
- desc: It was good.
  persid: S09
- desc: Okay. Well we'll try and build on that in our next over the Semester. So any
    comments to share, about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I guess one major risk would be like. Well, like a mall reward be like Informations
    and widespread thankfully information.
  persid: S10
- desc: uh huh. So the reward is the accessibility of information. So what would be
    your risk is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The. information.
  persid: S04
- desc: about the work.
  persid: S11
- desc: So let's just have a rule here that if you want to speak with your MIC which
    is completely. reasonable and encouraged but put your hand. Up there's a. there's
    a reaction so gentlemen.
  persid: DHH
- desc: According to me the biggest risk of information are could be malware is maybe
    because if there were not detected in property bit quicker up the entire system
    and all the folks at one made to make a system.
  persid: S11
- desc: Okay, so when ransomware is a big issue these days isn't.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep it is.
  persid: S11
- desc: yeah okay thanks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: corey.
  persid: ???
- desc: hey one of the biggest risk is privacy cuz we're basically given no personal
    information to social media site and other online services so we're kind of at
    the whim of their. Security like how good the security oh.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So that. So. We don't necessarily value privacy, then. So it's not something
    that it's them to be important and we're concerned about it says hey we'll give
    you a free. order. will give you a free. Large double double if you give us your
    social insurance number. or whatever it is yeah that's certainly. problem potential
    problems, who jump.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So my point is a bit similar to call you and the same group but yeah privacy
    is a biggest bigger issue, I guess, because. While does reward in using a certain
    thing like yes you're getting information or you get to connect with your friends
    and family. At the same time you're giving out information that can be easily
    breached, or can be used by somebody else to manipulate it for their good or for
    like in a malicious and then I guess if they have a malicious intent.
  persid: S09
- desc: And it may not even be some malicious but just the idea that they have information.
  persid: DHH
- desc: First, and again.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: that's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: An issue.
  persid: ???
- desc: This comes into the heading of surveillance capitalism. Okay, let me try and
    get through our comments here done.
  persid: DHH
- desc: one or more can be like you can click easily connect with people just anywhere
    around the globe even there like just even there like an ocean away from you.
  persid: S10
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah. So. With my family. My wife's family, we did a video call the Christmas.
    We need avoided doing that. So, but it was. easy enough to do and the technical
    problems were weren't too too severe. And then. My son. Well, ours. yeah nicer
    is living in Riga, Latvia, but we often do whatsapp or facetime to. To stay in
    touch with them, which is very. very nice, so it doesn't seem like he's. living
    on a different continent.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So one of the biggest risk, as well as rewards for information is like data
    manipulation how easily data can be manipulated on. Like platforms like Google,
    Facebook like social media and stuff because, if it is used the right way, it
    can be helped to lead people. And if you use the wrong way it can be used to brainwash
    people into doing crimes and stuff which is like crimes and stuff which is not
    right, so there is nothing.
  persid: S12
- desc: Okay yeah so information is. Information being accessible is certainly a reward
    but. If the quality of information is not. There, or if it's just displaying this
    information in lies and that's certainly a big risk. yay. Alright, thanks, so
    to final comment visual. And I apologize if i'm not doing well with your names,
    let me know if i'm not. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah, I just wanted to say, which was discussed in our discussion a breakout
    room as well that artificial intelligence and machine learning can also poses
    a risk to our information society, as we can, as we can already see that. That
    machines are taking over humans slowly and steadily, so it is definitely near
    future.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S04
- desc: we'll be talking about that as well. The semester Thank you so there's a comment
    about their responses, so let me just. So. there's the last thought about. Okay,
    I think i'm sharing my screen. So under responses so there's a disconnect. There
    are three kinds of responses i'm looking for. You can say, the most important
    thing to you learned in the meeting the most difficult thing for you understand
    during the meeting. And the thing about what you would most like to know more.
    So pick one of those three headings types of responses and then rate up to 512
    characters and you have until the end of the day of the meeting to do that. And
    we'll use that to feed into our discussion for the next day. Okay, so. This isn't
    where it should be on now, I guess, because we're just a little bit over time
    here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And we do that lucky wiki page.
  persid: S13
- desc: No that's an assignment and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: ???
- desc: In your courses.
  persid: DHH
- desc: rough, could you please repeat what you see my Internet connection went bad.
  persid: S11
- desc: So. there's a section called responses to meetings. In the description is.
    It gives you it says there's three types responses, you can talk about the most
    important thing you learned in the meeting most difficult thing for you and for
    you to understand in the meeting. And the thing about which you'd most like to
    know more. So pick one of those and write up to 100 words or 512 characters by
    the end of today and look at those responses and we'll talk about them next day.
    And you get a. These do contribute. to your final mark so. it's. it's worthwhile
    to to do them. And to be thoughtful about them. But not spend too much time. Either
    so there's a balance there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is it 512 characters.
  persid: S14
- desc: yeah so it's about 100 words.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So is it more like there is no right or wrong answer it's more like we share
    our own opinion and our own experiences from the glass.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. yeah so it's not being right around and what you do to be thoughtful.
    I don't want you to just describe what we did. But I want you to think about.
    Responding to the meeting, and one of those but talking about what. What was the
    most important thing you learned today, most of the call thing for you to understand
    today and the thing today. thing that was discussed today, but which you would
    most like to know more. Okay. Anyway, so we're a little bit over time here and
    I apologize. So i'll be back in a few minutes for office hour. else i'll send
    the link out to you our courses for that as well. Okay. thanks again take care,
    have a good day we'll see you on Thursday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have a good day.
  persid: S04
- desc: thanks again. bye. Thanks everyone have a good day take care.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You have to pick one for their responses right.
  persid: S15
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: bye and.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so is that there's one more time we have been out for about is a. blast
    wiki right, so I didn't get the concept of what it is.
  persid: S16
- desc: So, are you in are you in the Group one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I know.
  persid: S16
- desc: Okay. So. idea is. That one one group in class will be given the task of responding
    to or so managing. annotation of meeting. On the wiki page for that meeting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, in short, they will give us a brief summary of what has happened in the
    class like that.
  persid: S16
- desc: And so. i'm going to post. different things. Like the transcripts and. Media
    from the class and so on. And so the group who's. in charge of editing for the
    meeting can use that information. So. it'll be raw materials, you could say.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And then. yeah and then and then that that is also included in participation
    marks or anything.
  persid: S16
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: And then, if a group has to help people, how are they gonna work on one thing.
    Like in a group or. One person will be done other stuff. Like basically if people
    are there, how it's gonna work, one by one individually.
  persid: S16
- desc: So. and i'll give you the opportunity to comment about. How all the groups
    work and then semester. But the reason i'm doing groups, instead of individual
    people. So starting on Thursday we're going to use the groups for breakout discussions
    as well. So. Over time, you might become a little more familiar with people, and
    then you can. decide on how to work. So i'm not what I mean about editing wiki
    page and not trying to enforce a certain this distribution of work or division
    of work within the group. and i'm trying to create a smaller structure than the
    class. So that. So instead of dealing with 120 people in class you're dealing
    with can. Maybe maybe that's. A way to make things more manageable.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK.
  persid: S16
- desc: OK so don't stress about. The marks and so on.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S16
- desc: i'm just trying to write a variety of opportunities. So that we can, as a
    group. Have the most fulfilling and richest experience possible under the circumstances.
    Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah sure what book, thank you for your time.
  persid: S16
- desc: You are concerned about the mark distribution like how are the mark distributed
    in class.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah I am going to talk about that on Thursday okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay yeah that makes sense, so we can just like for now we can just only answer
    to the. answer to that 100 word and sections in it. yeah okay Thank you so much,
    Sir hope you have a good rest of your day.
  persid: S02
- desc: thanks you too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Take care.

  persid: S02
- desc: He hasn't given it yet.
  persid: S07
- desc: do we have to make pages like these? I am kinda confused
  persid: S02
- desc: You're going to select which groups contribute each meeting right?
  persid: S51
- desc: Everyone is in group one right now
  persid: S51
- desc: so at the end of each class should we go and comment on that class wiki? or
    will we just use that for the breakout rooms?
  persid: S02
- desc: can anyone please tell me what is the attendance password?
  persid: S04

  persid: S55
- desc: I think it will change every class, ive done something like this before
  persid: S39
- desc: it will keep changing is my guess
  persid: S09
- desc: I think it will change. That way they know that you've gone to that specific
    class session.
  persid: S07
- desc: that makes sense, thank you
  persid: S02
- desc: did we talk about the 'responses to meeting' section? how is that marked,
    and what do we write there?
  persid: S02
- desc: 'Breakout Discussion: What do you see as big/biggest risks and big/biggest
    rewards in our information society?'
  persid: DHH
- desc: good
  persid: S39
- desc: good
  persid: S57
- desc: Good :)
  persid: S07
- desc: Good
  persid: S12
- desc: good
  persid: S58
- desc: Would it be using our personal information in order to make transactions?
    Such as using credit card information to purchase something online.
  persid: S07
- desc: Data Breach is another biggest issue as well.
  persid: S59
- desc: sometimes machine learning can be risker as well
  persid: S60
- desc: not a good deal
  persid: S39
- desc: I think the biggest risk would be misuse of the data and biggest reward could
    be easier access to information
  persid: S61
- desc: 'risk: loss of privacy'
  persid: S62
- desc: There is the potential risk of robots taking over the world through artificial
    intelligence.
  persid: S57
- desc: "Wave looks like raise hand zzzz \U0001F605"
  persid: S13
- desc: what I believe is privacy isn't really a risk as the information that is out
    there was on first hand was given by us so it would really be our responsibility
  persid: S63
- desc: '@harpreet but what about credit cards or tracking of IP addresses'
  persid: S39
- desc: From security perspective, cyber warfare among countries can be a risk to
    whole society
  persid: S64
- desc: 'risk: more suspectable to scammers and catfishers'
  persid: S48
- desc: What are we in group 1 supposed to write in the wiki?
  persid: S65
- desc: can we say that we just had no troubles at all
  persid: S47
- desc: You just want us to write about one? Not all three?
  persid: S66
- desc: Is the "Respond to Mtg 01" on the Breakout Discussion? Or the entire meeting?
  persid: S07
- desc: Is the response to meetings marked by whether you did it or is there a gradient?
  persid: S51
- desc: I think it is on the entire class that we attended.
  persid: S04
- desc: So we just answer one prompt?
  persid: S67
- desc: Gotcha, thank you.
