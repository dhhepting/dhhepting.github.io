- desc: morning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: morning.
  persid: S01
- desc: morning morning.
  persid: S02
- desc: morning.So, how was your weekend.
  persid: ???
- desc: Was fired.
  persid: S04
- desc: was shot.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No seem to be too short.
  persid: ???
- desc: Any football any nfl fans amongst you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah sunday's Games were unreal.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah. I was thinking it just like it's. Just like a CFL game, the last one.
    So scoring in the last three minutes. Anyway, okay. First. sorting out switching
    between classes. Class sections. So I got an email. Yesterday morning from it
    support that. said that my understanding was correct, but if you switched. If
    you dropped one section and then enrolled in the other section of this class that
    your. Your data would be preserved because. What happens when you drop the class
    a drop the class or. Any class you drop that's on your courses. You you're not
    removed completely you lose your role as a student. So what would have happened
    is. You would have temporary last year rule of students, that will then you transferred
    you regain the role, then so everything that you did in the class. Previously,
    would still be available to you. So did anyone have any. questions or concerns
    about that. We can address. So i'd say. Today, you could still talk to Connie
    renwick in the CS and math office. If you didn't get a switch done that you want
    to get done. Okay, so. If you have. If you need some help through registration,
    I would suggest getting in touch with Connie renwick first, but let me know how
    it goes and. Or if you write her an email and copy me that would be fine as well.
    Okay. So. And then. you send me a direct message can I. Can you send me. Okay,
    can I i'm going to talk about that direct message. to remind everyone, please
    don't send me direct messages, because then I get. Oh, then, if I reply and i'm
    not paying attention. i'm trying to always pay attention. But if you send me a
    direct message, then the default is for me to reply directly to you. So. you're
    so you want to switch to the remote section madman. Okay. Let me just take a look
    here what the situation is. Okay, and I said I was going to do this last but today
    for sure i'm going to fix groups. Okay, so. I just wanted to confirm. That there
    was space in. 01 are. And there is. A check on. Okay, so let me just write this
    in the chat. switch back sending to everyone. Space in both sections, so please
    check. Okay, so. Your space, according to the class schedule builder. Their space
    in both 01 are in 01 F. So please check with Connie renwick. And that's your email
    address Connie dot renwick at your child at CA. You can copy me as well. If you're
    having trouble switching between sections so. My understanding is that she can
    help you get that done today. it's. likely no longer available. for you to do
    from by yourselves, but can still be done. Okay. So that bright light on top of
    my head is light shining off my bald spot. My my balding head it's just an unfortunate.
    position of the light behind me. On a video. Okay. So here we go. get some improvements
    done. To the course here, of course, page. So there are still a few outstanding
    issues but. it's getting. getting better. So. I have a different background color
    for the header in the footer and these cards. So our meeting five today. so happy
    Tuesday, make sure I say that loud. And then. To get you get our attendance sorted
    out. Okay. So the problem we were having last meeting on Thursday. Was that. Even
    though I didn't change anything about. This attendance activity. Because I had
    added another one. And then deleted it. The ID number of the. Pre existing over
    original attendance activity changed, so I had to. fix that. we're gonna talk
    about assignments today so let's do that next. So this is still on my laptop not
    publish it. late in the next couple hours. I have too many things here. So there's
    going to be. A writing assignment for a blog. And that's going to be worth a total
    of 16 marks. A critique of someone else's blog. that's for marks. there's going
    to be a group assignment. related to the new website. that'd be 10 marks. So that
    makes very well together.
  persid: DHH
- desc: projects.
  persid: ???
- desc: Is five marks for proposal. In 20 marks for the deliverable. So that. gives
    us 55. final exam. Another 25 cent makes at. And then responses. 10. participation.
    10. So that. Still adds up to 100.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have a question.
  persid: S01
- desc: sure.
  persid: ???
- desc: How many blog entries do we have to do is it to two or just one.
  persid: S01
- desc: it's one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And that's word 16% on.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah. So the reason it's a bit more than i've. done previously is because.
    I want. I want you to. do a bit more work about assessing the reliability of your
    sources. So that portion of it will be. More getting more weight. Would you like
    to have more assignments. No one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: S06
- desc: I mean i'm good with less so yeah no i'm good. Okay.
  persid: S07
- desc: Well, I mean there's still. there's still five things. Okay. So we'll talk
    about. assignments now so. So I have to figure out. i've made a mistake. Opening
    up the assignments, so it should work that click on this will take you to the
    assignment. But they're all on the page here. So that needs to get that sorted
    out today. So I want to mention the other thing. that's. fairly new here. Not
    from today, but. recently. As a list of topics that we're covering in this class.
    So this is. This materials, based on a 2013 computer science curriculum report,
    which is described. Here, and you can you can see the details. So a new one is
    coming down the pipe very soon. Next year too, I think. So anyway, some. of us
    will be refreshed but. They still have a good idea. So s&p SP stands for. social
    and professional. So that's the bulk of. The knowledge area in which. we're working.
    it's time for the social context. And so the stars decide particular topics learning
    outcomes. Two stars, are the most important, so their core in that 2013 report.
    One star is. Their core. In. So two stars should be core for everybody. One star
    is core for some. Zero stars indicate elective. and With this great text. we're
    not going to talk about them. So social context as one analytical tools. is another.
    professional ethics. Intellectual property. privacy and civil liberties. Professional
    communication. Human computer interaction. foundations. And some. hca. focused
    on designing interaction. And then. sustainability. So the blog entry. going to
    ask you to prepare and submit a blog style posts that was a topic within one of
    the course related knowledge units. They. they're just above the summary page.
    and So something that would that is currently or was recently in the news. So
    list of knowledge it's also includes learning outcomes associated the topics.
    So you may consider those learning outcomes i'm just reading. This. So they might
    provide some suggestions about how to approach. The topic find a personal connection
    to the topic. You may, for example, consideration about the current social trade
    offs in technical decision or analyze the role of. Computer professionals. In
    a global computing issue. So. identify some online sources that are reputable.
    and detail how. We use. you've come to your assessment at the reputable. And then,
    here are some. Guidelines for. writing for the web. And some of the details i'll
    fix up. So. i'm looking for length of 900 to 1000 words. And I wonder. If maybe
    we can set the due dates to be on. Mondays. Yes, I mean.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Are you going to host the assignments requirement on on your words.
  persid: S08
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: S08
- desc: I will have a link. To the description on your courses.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, so I. quoted we're multiple.
  persid: S08
- desc: it'll be posted today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh Okay, thank you.
  persid: S08
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What is it gonna be do again. well.
  persid: S06
- desc: I propose. The blog entry or we do February 28. Which is a Monday. After the
    reading week.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just have a question says, this will be like around 900 to 1000 words is
    there, like a specific outline you want it like you want it to be have like No
    five paragraphs an introduction three main paragraph on one conclusion or doesn't
    matter for you.
  persid: S09
- desc: So. So i'm including some ideas for structuring in the description i've included
    some. Guidelines for good writing for the web. So that can give you a basis to
    work with. But i'm not. going to say you need so many of these kinds of paragraphs
    and so on and so forth. So if there are questions about. Okay sorry, let me go
    back and say, I think the description will be will give you enough structure to
    work with. If there are some questions will clarify them. In our discussion about
    the assignments okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: sounds good, thank you yeah you're welcome.
  persid: S09
- desc: And, Sir, whenever we pull reference about other blogs or other writers, or
    any other world news like she should be followed the Emily format, or what would
    you like us to use whenever we are trying to pull reference from other writers
    or other bloggers.
  persid: S10
- desc: Emily is fine. me. Well it's not. it's only a subset of MLA that we'd be dealing
    with. So. i'll post some guidance about that, but yeah you can, if you're familiar
    with MLA. Go ahead and use that. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay sounds good.
  persid: S10
- desc: OK, so the other thing. project proposal. So you can do this, individually
    or with a small group. of up to four. So. Proposal shooting included with the
    following headings. topic so you described a topic and how it relates to class.
    The deliverable that you were choosing to create. and Why you've chosen to do
    that. So you could do a research paper a book review. read a Wikipedia article.
    or add to an existing Wikipedia article. Create. Some an end promote. Some online
    content such as video. which could be recording of a presentation with narration
    a podcast or. or a blog. Identifying discuss role models of. Current competing
    professionals. And how they can be role models in your life as a competing professional.
    discuss your contributions to open source project. write some code to test, an
    idea. So then have a tentative plan. For how you're going to address. Your topic.
    So the week of February 21 is our reading week. and Some. stuff we do a Monday.
    could do the 14 to February at 2340 2359. present proposal. We could maybe make
    that the 18th if that's. let's say the 14 To begin with, and then. We need some
    flexibility we can push it to the teeth. Sound okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So what are we talking about.
  persid: S10
- desc: The project proposal.
  persid: ???
- desc: Was the project proposal.
  persid: S10
- desc: That I just talked about.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So is the project proposal different than the project, or is it the part of
    project doing that we is 25% of our total mark.
  persid: S09
- desc: So the proposal is five marks and the deliverable is 20 marks. So the 25%
    project is divided into two parts, with five marks. And with 20 marks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, and the project will be like individual or will be like.
  persid: S09
- desc: So my.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: It can be either. project we didn't individually or in a small group up to
    four. So i'm. details. today. So you don't have to. I said I was going to talk
    about today in class so that's i'm doing I just had a couple of issues. held me
    up a little bit, so I haven't got the push to public website yet.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Excuse me. So what what the response i'm going to talk about today.
  persid: S11
- desc: Well, I will get this done and then we'll.
  persid: DHH
- desc: kind of problem i'm just asking yeah.
  persid: S11
- desc: And I will. create the assignment for the place for you to rate, the response.
    Right after class. So I encourage everyone. To keep an eye on the news. For. And
    look for connections. between what you read the news and what's. going on in our
    class discussions. So this is. I found this on CBC over the weekend and I thought
    this is really. An important. As contains some very important issues for us. Because
    we're going to talk we're going to talk about ethics. And really related to our.
    discussion with social media. So I found this one line. That makes a connection
    this discussion of bioethics from bioethics mixed makes the connection. To our
    current discussion about social media. and more generally. The. The need. The
    need for. A strong sense of professional ethics. amongst people who are. today's
    computer professionals. Right, so the idea is. The quandary that's being expressed.
    In the medical medical community is that people who are unvaccinated. If they're
    limited when treating people who are unvaccinated. Should that be a factor. When
    it come becomes necessary to. To triage or to decide. which patients. Get the
    look. At the limited resources for treatment. And so. The connection here is a
    quote from one of the doctors speaking about this. So these people have made the
    decision based on poor social media algorithms it could be easily argued that.
    They have been manipulated down this path path that there's no such there's not
    as much free will, as we would like to think we have. So it's it's a long article,
    and I will post, the link. In the chat right now but also. On our reading page.
  persid: DHH
- desc: feel like that's kind of a weak argument to say, well, we have no free will,
    because an algorithm made me like. make this decision, like if someone convinces
    you of something and then you go do it doesn't mean you have no blame in that
    in that thing, so if an algorithm is is based on. Putting you in a bubble of your
    own thoughts. it's not to blame for your actions.
  persid: S04
- desc: Right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That is suggesting. Suggesting otherwise would basically say that, like we're
    basically just drones out here listening to everything and everyone that tells
    us anything, and we have no blame for anything.
  persid: S04
- desc: What about over a lifespan do you think like if every day you're influenced.
  persid: S12
- desc: By an algorithm.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah yeah exactly like the algorithm influence influences you every day at
    the end of the day, like you know five years 10 years. It might completely change
    your mindset or completely like make you make a decision that you might think
    is smart but it's definitely not something along those lines i've kind of just
    playing devil's advocate.
  persid: S12
- desc: yeah yeah. yeah I the way I kind of think about it is OK, if someone's in
    like a cult and they get convinced to like go kill people do they have a blame
    in that like murder, or are they completely blameless because they got brainwashed
    by the cult. it's kind of an extreme version but. It kind of has a direct way
    to blame the person or the call for. The the responsibility.
  persid: S04
- desc: I don't know i've got to admit I feel like it makes your kind of assuming
    that everybody has this base level knowledge or a base level education. Where
    I don't think that is the case, all the time.
  persid: S12
- desc: Almost 99% of us have some level of high school education.
  persid: S04
- desc: But even high school education. is not sufficient to be able to fact check
    things.
  persid: S13
- desc: I think the term you're looking for is common sense is not common anymore.
  persid: S07
- desc: Like the average person has little to no understanding of what it means to
    fact check a resource.
  persid: S13
- desc: People need.
  persid: S14
- desc: Your MIC it's. it's very hard to hear you. i'm not sure who is it Ahmed who
    is speaking.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No. No, but he was.
  persid: S04
- desc: Speaking can you. check your MIC and see if.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it's pooja.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: it's very robotic.
  persid: S13
- desc: it's yeah it's just a little bit better than it was before.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It can be here Internet for all I know.
  persid: S13
- desc: Things that.
  persid: S14
- desc: yeah or you can you can say it again, or posted in the chat.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, does this work.
  persid: S14
- desc: It does.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This works.
  persid: S14
- desc: Much better.
  persid: S07
- desc: Better yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you, but yeah what I said was the same people who use social media as
    an excuse, can just Google it it's literally one to the search only everything
    so people believe what they want to believe, at the end of the day.
  persid: S14
- desc: yeah but going to Google just takes you to i'm right calm and confirms your
    bias.
  persid: S15
- desc: yeah as was stated in that the video we watched last week, even everyone's
    Google searches is different so.
  persid: S16
- desc: Exactly information, information and Google is not accurate anymore, not all
    information is accurate.
  persid: S17
- desc: Well, I don't know if people want accurate information, maybe they already
    have a bias and just looking to confirm the pious so.
  persid: S18
- desc: I disagree, as long as you. do a proper Google search, you can find good information.
  persid: S13
- desc: For mean conspiracy theorists existed before the Internet so it's not like
    the Internet created conspiracy theorist.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah but no, you have to. Have a place to congregate now and why you just
    said yourself that most people don't have. The ability to fact check a source
    so that's why the problem with Google itself.
  persid: S15
- desc: Well, the problem is they don't they don't get any source at all, they get.
    Some weird source that somebody posted in like a Facebook group that is very biased
    if you just do a straight Google search about a topic and read the first few articles,
    more often than not you'll get good information.
  persid: S13
- desc: about that. Though is if somebody is doing a Google search and they kind of
    want to confirm what they want, they can kind of word it in a certain way that
    will make. Yes, that will. Like a group.
  persid: S19
- desc: where you can frame the question. In in in a sense, where it'll give you the
    answers you want.
  persid: S04
- desc: To just basically cherry pick information to fit the narrative for.
  persid: S18
- desc: yeah exactly that's literally just cherry picking information rather than
    googling a question about the topic.
  persid: S13
- desc: You know that's what they're gonna do with Google they're not going to. regain
    everything's gonna have a.
  persid: S15
- desc: slight biased or opinion in the question that they're searching.
  persid: S07
- desc: So what should we do, should we like if people education on how to fact check
    stuff I mean, I learned that in high school, most people did does it really change.
    The fact if they know how to fact check.
  persid: S04
- desc: I think everything will be.
  persid: S07
- desc: On the matter is that I think everything should have like a tag saying either
    like factual this is factual information or, this is not factual information,
    and this is required by. Like I don't know there's so many different, the problem
    is the codes like and where you're viewing from like there's no like really set
    codes, but I think if, like, for example on social media platforms. A news article
    is posted. about something that they don't know the facts on it has to be tagged
    as hey this is isn't a factual article versus something that is scientific proven,
    you know gone through the methods of testing and rigorous. Rigorous tests and
    disapproval from other scientists, basically, is only way to come up with. True
    scientific or fact.
  persid: S12
- desc: What regulatory body or entity is actually going to. step in that isn't going
    to be biased or opinionated, though.
  persid: S07
- desc: sure.
  persid: ???
- desc: I like.
  persid: S18
- desc: Taking the checker.
  persid: ???
- desc: For the.
  persid: S20
- desc: I don't know if there's no right now, though.
  persid: S12
- desc: Facebook facebook's like this is not factual information thing it's been like
    there's so many recorded incidents of it just spreading misinformation.
  persid: S04
- desc: Well, they just admitted in court that they're fact checkers or it's actually
    opinion based it not factually based. right because they were sued over it.
  persid: S20
- desc: So it's like I mean I mean, in the end it's basically a debate of whether
    or not you think no I mean like I use I use. social media and i'm pretty sure
    everyone else here uses social media we're not completely in a bubble of conspiratorial
    ideas about vaccines so like it essentially comes down to whether or not you believe
    people have free will.
  persid: S04
- desc: that's that's kinda overhearing second level education to that kind of puts
    us all in a class of people who are interested in learning more.
  persid: S12
- desc: And I work with people that haven't gone to secondary education, and you know
    they're they're still not brainwashed either.
  persid: S04
- desc: missing people burned, which is up until like the 1800s based on conspiracy
    theories like people don't necessarily have the best judgment if they weren't
    educated like properly throughout their life.
  persid: S12
- desc: This is what he's trying to say is. The more educated someone is the more.
    likely they are to be proficient at. fact checking information.
  persid: S13
- desc: Okay So what do we do, do we then or two people to learn and what if they
    can't learn, I mean there's a reason not everyone goes into secondary education,
    some people it's just not for them.
  persid: S04
- desc: Well, even though we can always with people who are hardcore conspiracy theorists
    who will trust anyone but. Teaching this stuff instructing people will get these
    get more people to understand how to do it, and that they should do it, even though,
    if it doesn't affect everyone, the more just, allowing us into the public consciousness
    means more people who will. be able to do it's a offer more sources stuff like
    that that'd be a good first step, the very least.
  persid: S21
- desc: I think, would it be a big issue is there's a lot of people that are already
    out of school to to how would you, you know reteach those people are informed
    them when they're already in the workforce, like would you have companies put
    out mandatory training for that, like.
  persid: S05
- desc: I don't know operational health and safety.
  persid: S07
- desc: or basically blocking the website that post unreliable or missing from information
    because so many people are scared because of the goon visit website or groups
    or fake it can. Post misinformed information about the vaccine for example 100
    years ago there was this anish flee and same thing so many people were debating
    on, we should not take the vaccine reaction, or can affect us and. 100 years now
    we're still alive nothing happens and we're still facing the same issue again
    by so many people so many political parties and also companies. posting so many
    entrusted misinformation just to make no opinionated opinions and just to make
    money from those people and, just like you know posting. missing from an information
    for their rights, and so I, so I believe that blocking. People who posed by unreliable
    information. educating people by just posting the only counted, like the government
    accounts or like something that's reliable to. get them the right information
    from there, and also, if we do believe that vaccines, already been why the doctors
    and nurses are actually getting the vaccine so. For example, for war and the third
    like what the what will we give what day is today, you know soldiers, but then
    like that do not work and it's the same thing with the doctors and nurses. If
    the vaccines dangerous, then why are they vaccinating themselves so am I missing,
    if anything, would happen to the doctors and nurses, we cannot do anything about
    the miners.
  persid: S09
- desc: feel like saying blocking everything it's like it's like an easy decision,
    because then no one has access, but then it's like. that's a problem because you
    get stuff like in China when coven just happened, the government started blocking
    I can't remember the name of the doctor that discovered coping. But they just
    started blocking his information. on whether or not cold, it was real and what
    you what you start getting is the they block facts and non fact and so it's like
    a slippery slope there.
  persid: S04
- desc: You just get as a. sensory things. And it's a bit extreme I think the main
    problem is not education it's about our open people are to be challenge to get
    their ideas challenge right and it's like a personal thing, so I don't think it's
    an education awesome.
  persid: S18
- desc: I mean, and how many of us have been in conversations with people that were
    anti back, Sir, Sir or conspiracy theorists and no one really talks to them because
    it's just not worth it. And so, then you get their beliefs just keep getting getting
    worse because the only people they talked to her other anti boxers.
  persid: S04
- desc: Exactly yeah so in a way was kind I like swimming an ECHO chamber for them.
  persid: S18
- desc: as well.
  persid: S04
- desc: And yourself.
  persid: S20
- desc: it's almost like they're influenced by their algorithm.
  persid: S15
- desc: Right so there's like two different types of conspiracy theorists to the ones
    who are ensures that always hesitant like that other people who. Mostly believe
    that vaccines are goodbye or not sure, so they wait and just keep waiting until
    they know for certain but there's always going to be those groups of hardcore
    conspiracy conspiracy theorists who are almost impossible to reason with, but
    most of the. things we can do, or to help those people who are instead has a tent
    or just not sure it's give them the information so that they can. Not just the
    information but make sure that they understand so they're competent in the facts,
    they can check, so they can find out. Things they don't all into these conspiracy
    theorists areas.
  persid: S21
- desc: I mean clearly like algorithms have a role to play, but what do we do about
    them, I mean Facebook tried the the whole, this is not factual thing that didn't
    really work. i'm pretty sure if they implemented the different system with like
    the Government doing the same thing would it be any better.
  persid: S04
- desc: So let me just interject here a little bit about. So Facebook and. The whistleblowers
    testimony from recent months were where she talked about. The. The different.
    The people who. were charged with finding ways to improve Facebook, are not the
    same ones who. were given the authority to make the changes. and it's very hard
    to deal with. requirement to make changes that's going to make your business less
    profitable. You know so. i've read stories about. Facebook, promoting pizza gate.
    Groups and theories to people who are not. Not otherwise so inclined to begin
    with. And just as an example, but it. So they've learned. That. Negative current
    content. Driving drives interest and so. The more polarizing the content, the
    better it is for Facebook, because they can charge more for ads. So. It just seems
    to me there's a little bit of a. it's not a it's not necessarily about getting
    to everybody. and helps improve their fact checking skills. But the platforms.
    That people use if if they were. Better. Better constructed and. Just using that.
    For the moment, not suggesting. That, I have a metric for that. Yet. know that
    the platforms didn't fan the fires. start fires and fandom to. raging infernos.
    That might be another approach so. Just going back to the article night I mentioned.
    about the poor algorithms that push people nudge people in a certain direction.
    This computer professionals. So we have. On the one hand. it's just a computer
    program. This will help me make more money or, on the other hand, this is a. i'm
    writing software that impact society as a whole. And I need to be responsible.
    So I mean Those are two examples of decisions that we have. So right at time.
    It was quite a lively discussion. And I realized I couldn't keep track of who
    was speaking because. I thought your rectangles would be highlighted, when you're
    speaking that wasn't the case, but in the transcript. transcription cat should
    have caught those things for me. Okay, anyway, thank you very much for a lively
    discussion. And we'll take it from there on Thursday okay. And we'll take up.
    where we left off today on Thursday thanks, very much for today. Take care have
    a great day and we'll see you on Thursday. And I have officers 10 to 12 and 230
    to 430 today. Either I see you Thursday morning. Take care and stay well. i'm
    gonna sorry.
  persid: DHH

    for the next meeting.
  persid: S09
- desc: A. i'll ask you to look at the. code vaccine i'll post the covert vaccine
    triage articles that. I put in the chat. So we'll talk about that and i'll give
    you an activity to do, based on that. Okay, but we'll we'll stick with what we
    have there will unpack it. From from what was from last Thursday or last meeting.

    select and see a one hour and we can work on another topic like that, for the
    project or it should be something different.
  persid: S10
- desc: well. If you're going to deal with the same general topic. Doing in two different
    ways. Or if you're going. yeah that's right. So you know, doing the same thing
    for both.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Know like I mean not the same topic, but like we can it's going to be like
    more or less of the same kind like both of them. with different news or different.
  persid: S10
- desc: we're not necessarily.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm giving you. So the writing the blog is. Is a writing assignment. The project
    may not doesn't have to be a writing assignment could be different things. or
    it could. there's an option to do things. that are similar. In form. But. that's
    not a requirement.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I see so for the project weekend we can. suggested to make videos or like
    podcast or stuff like that.
  persid: S10
- desc: that's one one option Those are some options. yeah. yeah.

  persid: S32

  persid: S37
- desc: No thanks
  persid: S09
- desc: It is also a link on the UR Courses website called 'CS 280 on Dr. Hepting's
    website'
  persid: S37
- desc: Probably not, I'm just wondering if we get details on this blog assignment.
  persid: S32
- desc: "Will you post the assignment on urcourse or are you going to post the assignment\
    \ on the CS280 website \u201C"
  persid: S08

  persid: S06

  persid: S38

  persid: S37

  persid: DHH
- desc: Pooja ur mic Is muffled
  persid: S40
- desc: social media platform algorithms have been studied and have been proven to
    put people into "bubbles" of ideology and it has been shown that doing just this
    is radicalizing people
  persid: S20
- desc: can you post the recording on ur courses
  persid: S06
- desc: so basically fake or wrong information always existed but internet has now
    made it easier to find wrong information
  persid: S41
- desc: "Sometimes people aren\u2019t looking for factual information, they simply\
    \ want to prove or back up what they think is correct"
  persid: S40
- desc: even facebook misinformation can lead to propaganda
  persid: S42
- desc: I don't  think it has anything to do with education level. even smart people
    join cults when they are manipulated
  persid: S10
- desc: oh so should we make internet available to only certain group, maybe like
    age restriction, but we all know that doesn't work
  persid: S41
- desc: True it is not entirely based on education, however, education is a major
    factor.
  persid: S22
- desc: A mix of different solutions is needed. Their will always be people who don't
    trust the government/ big companies/the man/ whoever .But people need to be instructed
    on how to check information and taught that doing so is nessacry. Not everyone
    will do so but the more that are taught to do so the better. Companies should
    also be required by law to at least offer options to change their filter options.
  persid: S21
- desc: But if someone is proficient in fact checking information, I would argue that
    they are more likely to fact check information correctly.
  persid: S13
- desc: (I will post transcript of audio)
  persid: DHH
- desc: ^thank you
  persid: S21
- desc: Yeah just look at Tom Cruise Mohammed lol
  persid: S07
- desc: Yes, but majority of people don't even bother to fact check.
  persid: S22
- desc: Once they have information supporting their pre-existing bias they take it
    as the law.
  persid: S22
- desc: "Fact-checkers\u2019 personal biases may also influence their choice of which\
    \ statements to analyze and their determination of accuracy."
  persid: S02
- desc: That's because fact checking is hard. We need to find ways to make fact checking
    things easier.
  persid: S21
- desc: Oh I see, so they may choose to ignore certain incorrect information being
    circulated.
  persid: S22
- desc: Very good point, most people can not accept their beliefs being challenged
  persid: S07
- desc: I dont think you need to fact check on a person to person level but mainstream
    media companies do need to be fact checked. (I still dont know how to get around
    the fact check bias)
  persid: S12
- desc: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory
  persid: S43
- desc: We must also take in context a larger group of people (people in third world
    countries) where literacy rate is not as high. These people's minds can be molded
    in whichever the search engine wants and in a way which benefits someone. Rather
    than putting biased information and enforcing that people must fact check themselves,
    the platforms should create an unbiased algorithm to fact check their sources.
  persid: S01
- desc: 'We all know big tech companies use algorithm to increase their bottom line.
    But just to play devil advocate: there are too much information out there that
    a person alone cannot possibly consume all of it. An algorithm is a way to optimize
    information delivery, if we don''t use that then what other solution do we have?'
  persid: S18
- desc: The best ways would be to have laws that require some level of fact checking.
  persid: S21
- desc: thanks have a great day
  persid: S44
