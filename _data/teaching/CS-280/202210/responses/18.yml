difficult:
- desc: about the website assignment
- desc: I am currently experiencing COVID symptoms and barely followed up on today&#039;s
    lecture. I experienced symptoms last Tuesday and tested positive yesterday. Before
    going to your class, I tested negative and knew that things will go downhill from
    there. Hopefully, you will accept this short response. I did it before resting
    again.
- desc: Yep
- desc: Who&#039;s responsibility it is to police online speech
important:
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is the biases of developers may still
    be present in the systems they create.
- desc: Having an Ai to control enforce policies can be fundamentally flawed due to
    the biases the Ai&#039;s programmer.
- desc: 'The most important thing that I learned in the lecture today is that you
    can&#039;t completely rely on A.I. to replace people, because those A.I. will
    still have the biases of the people who developed them, but A.I. can be used as
    a tool to work with people to make jobs easier. ex: an A.I. that processes pathology
    reports and makes it quick and easy to write them and understand them so that
    doctors can spend more time doing other work.'
- desc: An AI is limited by their creators and will thus have the same bias&#039;s
    that its human creators will have. Although they can be a very helpful tool to
    simplify, organize and gather information in the end it is our responsibility
    as people to evaluate and critically examine online sources.
- desc: "We can use Aritificial intelligence to deal with bias in the filed of media\
    \ and journalism. the site\u2019s artificial intelligence (AI) chooses a story\
    \ based on what\u2019s popular on the internet right now. Once it picks a topic,\
    \ it looks at more than a thousand news sources to gather details and rewrites\
    \ its own article. However, we argue the fact that an AI is only as true as the\
    \ computer professional who creates it since he/she might have some cultural inherent\
    \ bias of their own."
- desc: One thing I found fascinating is that some AI programs can learn a topic/idea
    without the use of human knowledge, hence removing any biases.
- desc: Todays discussion about if we should rely on artificial inelligence as a tool
    to support our evaluation and critical examination of online sources. In that
    regards i think, it is rather our responsibility to varify the online sources.
    As at the end of the day, even the AI follows the algorithm that we create.
- desc: AI has improved healthcare, especially diagnosing patient
- desc: AI wouldn&#039;t be really able to help us in identifying the Truth
- desc: In today&#039;s class, professor told us more about the critique of blog entry
    and that he will assign the blog which we&#039;ll have to critique if we didn&#039;t
    put out critique on public. There was also continuation of the discussion that
    we had last time about the Instagram allowing hate comments like death to invaders
    and such things. This is sensitive and should be properly managed.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we talked in the breakout room about slippery slope.
    It also talked about the ethical issues of ai and how to view online posts critically.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is that AI can also be biased. I thought
    AI would not be biased since it is just a machine, but I did not consider the
    fact that it is also made by humanss. Humans have biases and thus if they control
    AI, the AI will also have the same bias with its creator. I thought it was interesting
    how AI also have bias.
- desc: It is hard to know whether we can just an AI or not because there has yet
    to be an AI that is 100% independent from human supervision that people can reliably
    use.
- desc: The issue of trust is still not going to be fully addressed using AI because
    biases in choosing data sets for the AI to be trained on as well as the code in
    creating the AI will be reflected. Thus, trust is not being fully addressed. Trust
    may be more addressed in some cases though compared to humans depending if there
    is limited amount of biases in creating the AI
- desc: Related to the issue of trust by using AI, I believe we cannot hand AI the
    torch to evaluate truth of info, because the programmers who create the code and
    algorithm have biases as well when it comes to information online. So, instead
    of hearing or learning the truth, we are presented the developer&#039;s thoughts
    towards the situation
- desc: Was that technology companies can make very impactful choices that affect
    all users on their platforms.
- desc: "I learnt that AI isn\u2019t necessarily the primary solution to fixing the\
    \ disinformation problem, but it can be one of the tools we can use. It can be\
    \ used to check our own judgement about things, but not intended to be the main\
    \ tool in which people should make decisions or base their reason. On the other\
    \ hand, people might become too trusting of machines and use it to think for them,\
    \ rather than as a factor in decision making."
- desc: We as computing professionals should keep a high standard for our communication
    on online platforms. It is our responsibility to promote truth and to avoid logical
    fallacies in arguments and adhere to conventions. It is crucial for us as computing
    professionals to identify and analyze the biases that may be present in the systems
    we create.
- desc: I understood the need for Instagram to be more active (for lack of a better
    word) at policing content with sentiment for public good and how to balance it
    in comparison with an individuals freedom of speech
- desc: "I learned that according to that Instagram lifting the ban imposed on hate\
    \ speech \u201CDeath to the invaders\u201D while being positively viewed in terms\
    \ of PR, is not entirely ethical. The ACM code of ethics guidelines state that\
    \ well intended actions that may lead to negative consequences has to be avoided.\
    \ Posts made on Instagram In that direction has the potential to incite violence\
    \ against Russians."
- desc: In Today&#039;s meeting, we have discussed about the action supported by ACM
    Code of ethics? and whose responsibilities is the erosion of trust in media and
    public institution. We also have discussion that in future we will have computing
    professionals have an obligations this regard?
- desc: We talked whether or not the hate towards the invaders in Ukraine should be
    allowed to be spread over various social media platforms. We also talked about
    sentiments like &amp;quot;Death to the invaders&amp;quot; should be allowed on
    platforms like Instagram or not, and the impacts of allowing or disallowing them.  We
    also considered ACM rules of ethics while discussing this scenario.
- desc: In todays lecture we discussed about the use of AI in health care and also
    discussed about the Blog critique. We also continued the discussion of the Instagram
    should permit the sentiment of the Death of invaders. Also in the class discussion
    we discussed about the high standards of the online discussion.
- desc: The most important thing i learned today in the class is ACM code of ethics
    And the question on the instagram actions support the public good. then the ideas
    on the Artificial intelligence and how it can contribute in health care.
- desc: In today&#039;s class , we have discussed about AI, like it is helpful to
    us as well as are we really using it or not?
- desc: It is really interesting to learn this topic which we learned in our class
    today humane interface has been a topic to discuss in class as it is so good to
    learn this things and i m really enjoying this class
- desc: Today we talked about the contribution that artificial intelligence can make
    to health care. Discussed (Alphatera/Alphafold) learning without using human knowledge
    (+ bias)
- desc: AI can only be trusted to some extent when it comes to social media or personal
    information
- desc: Instagram does not really support the public good in my opinion. There have
    been studies done that show instagram can be detrimental to mental health. On
    another not, I believe the use of artificial intelligence is needed for sorting
    through the mass amount of data stored by instagram. I dont know if I would consider
    it more affective then us fallible humans but there is no question it is more
    efficent.
- desc: Today the standard of content on Instagram and other social media sites were
    discussed. Online sources should follow AI code of conduct before permitting sensitive
    uploads.  Actions on negative users should also be taken. Related topics were
    discussed in breakout rooms.
- desc: As computer proffesionals, we have an obligation to keep online forums open
    to free discussion while also making sure the discussions aren&#039;t hate speech.
- desc: trust is from human to human, if replaced human with AI, then the whole thing
    becomes meaningless
- desc: The most important this i learn today was ACM Code of Ethics and Professional
    Conduct.
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about the contribution of AI. We also discussed
    about many topics.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned Instagram&#039;s actions do not support
    the public good but rather it supports the individual good on the expense of people.
    Also the programmers of AI should follwow the ACM ethics and should not be bias
    while creating the codes that can be used as filters to prevent hate or slurs
    speech on social media. Alos, AI is beneficial but we cannot rely on it because
    it can be incorrect sometimes.
- desc: AI will be trustful if we know how to control AI. And until now, Ai still
    can not do much work, it is more important for human to develop the AI inside
    of notice the danger of the AI
- desc: AI provides a very good condition assessment technique that can be further
    combined with current condition-based maintenance decisions, but also the same
    AI is subject to the limitations of its developers and we need to look at the
    resources it provides with a critical attitude.
know-more:
- desc: The topic we discussed was related to instagram and their responsibility regarding
    what to show to the pulic. I came accross many content that is available on instagram
    and questionned whether it should be a platform like instagram whose audience
    is child as well. I would like to know more about how these things should be managed
    so that no one have bad impact from these applicatios.
- desc: How well does current AI work in the fields of fact checking?
- desc: I would like to know more about what goes on with the algorithims companys
    create
- desc: I would like to learn more about AI, we were speaking of it in class and someone
    raised the point that it could be infected with the biases of the programmer.
    I would like to know if that is completely true, and if a true AI could progress
    or learn beyond those parameters.
- desc: when does AI go to far and should we reach that point
- desc: Is the ACM Code of Ethics in favour of this activity?
- desc: I would like to know more how Al as a tool can support our evaluation and
    critical examination of online source.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we all talked about artificial intelligence and instagram
    and the discussion was quite very exciting moreover I would like to know more
    about submission of critique.
- desc: Today we learned about the possibility to train algorithms without using human
    knowledge.  I want to know more about this process.  Such as why it isn&#039;t
    being used more?  Are there any downsides to it?  Does this really result in it
    not having human biases or does this simply create different biases from biases
    in the data?
- desc: I would like to know more about how Artificial Intelligence could be more
    useful to address the Bias events and hateful speech in social media platform.
- desc: "I\u2019d like to know more about AI and the general consensus on the helpfulness\
    \ of AI without human bias"
- desc: Can an AI ever portray the decision making process of a human. There is the
    fear of AI of replacing and fully automating the workforce but to do so is understanding
    human decision making. Some jobs need human bias and judgement in order to function  like
    doctors understanding the patients emotions or programmers who accept the ambuiguity
    of descriptions. Is it possible to simplify their actions into an AI? Even if
    they were replaceable, would the objectivity of trust make people choose them
    over humans?
- desc: today we discussee about how the media influences our opinion toward a same
    thing.
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more about laws and ethics regarding content and social
    media / communications companies responsibilities. I understand that under certain
    laws, companies are not entirely responsible for user generated content. For this
    reason, I don&#039;t believe social media companies are responsible for what is
    posted online. I would like to learn more about effective methods of changing
    people&#039;s minds and convincing people to be open minded and critical of their
    own beliefs.
- desc: I would like to know more about AI that learn without using human knowledge.
    How do these machines go about learning and what sort of subjects are they learning
    about? How successful are they?
- desc: I&#039;d love to learn more about AlphaZero and AlphaFold - I have some background
    in Machine Learning, so I find it hard to believe that there can be any way to
    create an AI to judge this without some sort of bias from its creators.  For example,
    with machine learning you need a training and validation set - the former is used
    to teach the model what to look for, and the second is used to see how effective
    the training was.  Who decides the dataset used?  Is this a technique that is
    not machine learning?
- desc: I Would defientely like to know more about AI contributing to healthcare and
    overall society and the future.
- desc: the thing i would most like to know more about is if AI would truly be feasible
    as a misinformation censor/detector.  To make an effective AI without bias that
    could work it would be difficult but if it could be done the result is interesting
    to think about.
- desc: I would like to know more on the efficiency of an AI and the probability of
    the AI to not go rouge. Humanity is heading in the direction where we building
    and creating technology that make things easier for ourselves and the world we
    live in and AI is one of those. I am curios in how positive and negatively it
    will affect humanity when we fully utilize AI in our day to day lifes.
- desc: I would like to know more about how IA can help to identify reliable sources
- desc: "In today&#039;s discussion we discussed about Can we trust artificial intelligence\
    \ to make decisions for us? AI&#039;s ability to not only make predictions, but\
    \ explain why it made them is especially important in healthcare, where a wrong\
    \ prediction can cost a human life. ... \u201CIf we are do build trust between\
    \ man and machine, you have to be able to backtrack AI&#039;s suggestions and\
    \ question how it got to them,\u201D"
- desc: I would like to know more about Machine learning. AI that learn without using
    human knowledge and how are they different from AI that learn using human knowledge.
- desc: biases in the development of AI and the role of everyone to uphold truth in
    online platforms.
- desc: I would like to know what the current responsibilities are for media corporations
    and governments in keeping the media truthful and honest. I would also like to
    know more about other countries governments and media corporations and how they
    manage their responsibilities to be truthful and honest in the media.
- desc: the thing which I would like to know more is opinion about AI help? issue
    of trust addressed by AI? in my opinion I think complex issues should be reviewed
    by human not by AI for example creating awareness by activists , journalists covering
    about war information and controversial comments that  can radicalize people
- desc: I would like to know more on if we could rely on AI as a tool to support our
    evaluation and if so then how?
- desc: How artificial intelligence can be used in areas of society that we wouldn&#039;t
    normally think that it would have a role to play? For example, can AI be used
    to improve education outcomes in our schooling system? What would that look like?
    I feel there is a ton of untapped potential here while also a very strong need
    to be cautious.
- desc: The topic of artificial intelligence is an fascinating and interesting area
    to discuss which I would love to keep learning about.
