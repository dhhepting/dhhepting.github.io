difficult:
- desc: I don&#039;t really know how google can be more or less transparent in their
    attempts to relay information from website to user. May take more research on
    my part, but I&#039;m not sure what phrases to use, or where to start looking.
- desc: How does Google&#039;s algorithm decide what to show as in their info cards
important:
- desc: The reliability of Wikipedia.
- desc: the most important thing i learned today was that wikipedia is not suitable
    for research, it can potentially be argued that it is a good source to used for
    a quick google search. Most people are looking for a quick answer to their question
    rather than an in-depth article.
- desc: The most important thing that i learned in the lecture today is that when
    google is pulling information from site for the snippet at the top of the search
    results sometimes google takes things out of context, and it is important to click
    on the source and find the information in context to get a better understanding
    of what is being searched.
- desc: I did not know Google sources information in such a way.
- desc: wikipedia can be a some what trusted website but is better off for being a
    link to other sources
- desc: Is that many people still believe Wikipedia is an unreliable source when it
    will blatantly tell you that certain quotes aren&#039;t cited or that the citation
    is under review
- desc: Today we go through the result of &amp;quot;How can I minimize my risk of
    contracting and transmitting covid. We also discuss that Wikipedia is trustable
    for it resources or not and I come to conclusion that Wikipedia is good for learning
    some basic information of topic. We also have to look for other sources for getting
    more correct detailed about the topic because it is easy to edit in Wikipedia.
    Wiki is open source if we start learning our topic from wiki is good but there
    are not that much accurate some time.
- desc: google search engine is helpful.
- desc: Today I learned that google uses wikipedia for snippets when you search about
    a topic.  The goal of this is to provide someone with a quick overview of a topic.  The
    problem is that it can be inaccurate.  As with all problems we ask who is responsible.   I
    believe Google is responsible because its their algorithm.  Tools available to
    them would be partnering with wikipedia to help improve their snippets.  Is this
    process transparent.  No.  We dont fully understand these algorithms and how they
    choose snips.
- desc: Wikipedia is a good web that provides a general introduction of topic to start,
    but it should not be the end. We should not just rely on one source. However,
    for COVID issues, wiki is not a good place to get information. Because anyone
    can edit wiki pages, and medical information need to be accurate.
- desc: "In today\u2019s class we discussed about Wikipedia as a source. I believe\
    \ that Wikipedia should not be used as a reliable source because anyone is allowed\
    \ to edit the information on the page. This information is not fact-checked or\
    \ deemed unreliable by its parent company. Google must dedicate a governed body\
    \ of officials as people may not be aware of its credibility."
- desc: "The most important thing I learned is how Wikipedia\u2019s results can not\
    \ always be trusted. Make sure you follow the citations on wikipedia rather than\
    \ using the wiki itself. Google snippets may not always be accurate"
- desc: Wikipedia is great for collecting a few ideas but should not be used as a
    primary source. It should be treated as a secondary source and users should be
    cautious when reading wiki articles. It is always advised the user verify the
    sources listed at the bottom of the page.
- desc: Today&#039;s discussion thought me how Wikipedia itself is not a credible
    source to look for information. As it gives people the ability to edit information
    and gives access to the algorithm to some extent. So, we do not know if the information
    provided is even valid or not. So, people should use Wekepidia just to start with
    their research and to make themselves familiar with the topic.
- desc: Based on the earlier discussion, in my opinion, Wikipedia can and cannot be
    a reliable source. You can use it to get quick information but, you can not use
    it for school. Teachers and librarians would argue that it is not a reputable
    source because it can be edited by anybody. You can, however, utilize the listed
    references at the bottom of the page. It can be beneficial. Furthermore, fact-checking
    is recommended to ensure that the material is trustworthy. Wikipedia is still
    vulnerable to fake information.
- desc: Today&#039;s class had an interesting topic of discussion about our opinions
    on Wikipedia. It is a good topic to have a debate on Wikipedia, whether it is
    a credible source of information or not. In my opinion, Wikipedia is a great source
    to learn about the basics and overview of any topic or subject. But it is not
    very reliable if you&#039;re looking for detailed information about some serious
    topics. For example, people should not rely on Wikipedia regarding every news
    and information regarding Covid 19.
- desc: I found it very interesting to discuss the responsibility of search engines
    to have unbiased results.  Our discussion group talked about how google, or any
    search engine, must be very careful if they don&#039;t want to spread disinformation
    with their tailored results.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, I talked with students and group friends about what
    they thought about Wikipedia. I don&#039;t trust Wikipedia 100%. This is because
    Wikipedia can be edited and posted fake information.
- desc: In today&#039;s discussion we talked about Wikipedia. I learned that although
    Wikipedia is a good starting point to learn about a new topic and get idea, it
    should not be use as a reference. Everyone has access to edit it and it is possible
    that someone put wrong information to it leading you to get wrong information
    about your topic. It is not a reliable source.
- desc: i learned that wikipdia is a good starting place when you&#039;re doing some
    kind of research. Also, the moderation on wikipedia is quite strict and professional
    these days which prevents malicious actors from putting incorrect information
    onto the site.
- desc: I learned that Wikipedia is a very untrusted source. It contains a lot of
    useful information but it is always a great idea to double/triple check your information
    with other similar sources for your results
- desc: I learned that Wikipedia is not trusted source for many in depth topics since
    it may not have completely up to date information.
- desc: I found today&#039;s breakout discussion topic quite interesting and in my
    opinion, Wikipedia is good for looking up some general information about a topic
    or a principle to get a brief idea about a topic but it is much better finding
    multiple sources for same information to get reliable information and protect
    ourselves. Anyone with access to the Internet can edit Wikipedia which makes it
    less reliable source of information as compared to highly-trusted peer reviewed
    paper/articles from a reputable database.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is about if Wikipedia is a trusted
    source.
- desc: Today I have learnt about how Wikipedia is not a reliable source to depend
    on and also I wasn&#039;t aware that Wikipedia could be edited by multiple user.
    I have got to know that the facts published there are not checked so we can&#039;t
    assume that every information is genuine. Wikipedia is good for glance information
    and it is at the forefront of the browser which helps us to understand the concept
    in simple terms. Wikipedia has indepth subject matter which most of us doesn&#039;t
    use them.
- desc: Wikipedia is a good source to learn new things quickly but it cannot be considered
    a trustable source because people on the internet can can be change the information
    available on the website. Also the information is not verified so it cannot be
    trusted. At any information it contains at a particular time could be vandalism,
    a work in progress, or just plain wrong. Hence wikipedia is not a reliable source.
- desc: "I learned that there is no transparency in the information verification process,\
    \ that is how Wikipedia gives information that is not verifiable. I also learned\
    \ that a couple of search engines give information on the government of Canada\
    \ while others don\u2019t."
- desc: "In today&#039;s session i got to know that Wikipedia offers free and reliable\
    \ information instantly. ... This means all information must be presented accurately\
    \ and without bias, sources must come from a third party; and a Wikipedia article\
    \ is notable and should be created if there has been \u201Cthird-party coverage\
    \ of the topic in reliable sources\u201D."
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we have discussed about the activity which was given
    by the Dr. Hepting about finding the top link from the three different browser.
    We also have breakout session where we have discuss about the wikipedia is trusted
    source? Or should google use wikipedia source for snippets about COVID-19.
- desc: In todays lecture we discussed about the results of &amp;quot;How can I minimize
    my risk of contracting and transmitting COVID?&amp;quot; and then we had a discussion
    topic for class discussion. We discussed about &#039;Is Wikipedia a trusted source?
    Should google use Wikipedia for snippets.&#039;. According to me Wikipedia is
    trusted at some extent but should not used for Research paper. Whereas Google
    should not interrupt with Wikipedia as it is free source of information and anyone
    can edit the information.
- desc: Looked at the COVID transmitting activity results, prevention and risks. Talked
    about is wikipedia a trusted source? And is all the results shown while searching
    are transparent?
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today was about the google snippets.
    I never thought about the google misrepresenting the real source information while
    making snippets from that. I learned that we should never blindly trust those
    snippets. We should always visit the source from which the snippet is taken and
    double check the information that we get from those snippets. As per my opinion,
    google should not temper with any of that information while making snippets from
    them.
- desc: the most important thing i learned today is how can i minimize the risk of
    covid 19 infection and how can one prevent the spread of covid infection by taking
    preventive measure and following the rules made by the government. Then the discussion
    took place on whether we should consider wikipedia a reliable source for the information.
    Wikipedia can be used as a source for the information but we should also consider
    other sites as reference and for gathering information. Then we discussed about
    the project pro
- desc: You cannot hold wikipedia on a pedestal, although a good source, it is not
    completely a credible course. People need to fact check information before they
    put it to use. Since wikipedia can be edited by anyone, it does not fact check
    itself. One small edit (if not correct) can spread a lot of misinformation.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture I got know about different types of search engines
    and how to use it with different functionalities.
- desc: Wikipedia is not a reliable source for citations or for academic writing.
    Information on Wikipedia is taken from other sources so I think it is a good place
    to start, but its not a place we should rely on. As a computer science students,
    we must learn how to judge, how to determine what information is trustworthy
- desc: 3D printed guns was a topic to learn i learned how it is done to do 3d and
    learned about flight 401 apollo etc
- desc: We discussed today whether Wikipedia is a credible source. Anyone can edit
    a Wikipedia page, not just an expert on the subject. However, Wikipedia&#039;s
    administrators and online community make sure that edits are based on reliable
    citations, so Wikipedia is still largely credible. But for covid-19, Wikipedia
    does not give a very expert source, because it can only provide some information
    and cannot help people fully understand covid-19. If you need to know enough about
    covid-19, you are better off going to som
- desc: In todays meting we discussed about Wikipedia and how accurate the information
    about Wikipedia is. I&#039;d say it could be reliable at times but overall I&#039;d
    still look at other websites to see if the information is accurate or right
- desc: Today we again discussed about the types of websites and urls given priority
    by different search engines. We had a conversation about weather the facts on
    Wikipedia are trustworthy or not.According to me, Wikipedia is a popular site
    which is verified and suggested by reputed institutions and experts. It is recommended
    and prioritized by Google itself as it appears to be on the top whenever we search
    for information about something. Hence, Wikipedia is trustworthy.
- desc: "I learned that google doesn\u2019t create fact checks. From Google\u2019\
    s website the fact checking is done by websites independently and google just\
    \ links them for their users to see. If the user notices something odd then the\
    \ user is responsible for reporting that website to google."
- desc: I learned today that there are many different types of search engines that
    can show a variety of results. With Google you can see that looking up Covid-19
    you get news stories but looking it up on a search engine like Bing you can get
    best ways to prevent yourself from contracting ovid-19.
- desc: We discussed a lot about whether google should trust taking data from Wikipedia
    about COVID-19. Most of us disagreed that they should not as anyone can modify
    the information on Wikipedia.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture , The most important thing I learnt is that how different
    search engines modulate search enquiries based on Adds, Region and user search
    history.
- desc: "The most important thing that I learned today is that Wikipedia is not a\
    \ trusted source for citations and that\u2019s because, as a user-generated source,\
    \ it can be edited by anyone at any time, any information it contains at a particular\
    \ time could be incorrect and malicious work in progress. However, we could use\
    \ the sources available in Wikipedia to verify if the results posted are correct\
    \ or not. Therefore, Google should not use Wikipedia as a source for snippets\
    \ about COVID-19. Wikipedia should address the"
- desc: As we all know, Wikipedia differs from the encyclopedias we usually know in
    that it is an emerging, open online resource that allows anyone to create entries
    and write articles. Since everyone can write and edit information, and this can
    happen anytime and anywhere, the accuracy of the information cannot be guaranteed.
    Therefore, rather than trusting Wikipedia in general, it is important to consult
    more specialized and academic sources for reference.
know-more:
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss about snippets which are shown by google
    when searched on google. It is very helpful way showing main information as snippets
    instead of visiting the website. Google mostly show snippets for wikipedia website
    which should or should not be trusted for verified information. The next thing
    the algorithm used by google to decide website to make snippet of. The website
    should be selected wisely for making snippets as most users use snippets for quick
    review.
- desc: I would like to know more about Google&#039;s process for picking what questioned
    becoming a snippet and which source is chosen. I would also like to know more
    about why we should assume users will research to solve discrepancies because
    there is a saying that common sense is not so common.
- desc: The algorithms google uses to get the information for their &#039;snippets&#039;.
- desc: We talked about Wikipedia being the source of knowledge about preventing COVID-19.
    What I would like to know about is, if it is actually logical to have Wikipedia
    at the beginning of every search result.
- desc: Why so many students thought it was Googles job to monitor what wikipedia
    was posting on their webpages. My group was thinking that Google shouldn&#039;t
    monitor it because Wikipedia is its own company and can say whatever they like.
    I don&#039;t think Google monitors every other website they have in their search
    engines. If you do our research properly people should be able to determine what
    is right and wrong.  You should never trust  source to begin with.
- desc: Initially, Mr. Daryl Hepting shows us the result of monday activity and the
    result was very interesting as google was the leading one among all its competitors.
    The most essential thing I took away from today&#039;s lesson was the influence
    internet in the IT industry. And I&#039;m quite interested in learning more about
    this in future classes.
- desc: I would like to know more about the vetting system for Wikipedia  and how
    it decides what is valid and what is not .
- desc: Today we discussed Wikipedia and its reliability when it comes to data and
    sources. I would like to know about choosing educational sources from the public
    domain and their trustworthiness.
- desc: How much power should one company have at relaying information? Everyone always
    makes a comment regarding facebook being a breeding ground for misinformation
    and conspiracy but not about what needs to fix that.  Misinformation could lead
    to harm like with preventing covid 19 but should any discussion around said controversial
    topic be heavily monitored? There needs to be some open for debate in any topic
    but what is too far? Where should the line for data be drawn between freedom of
    speech and censorship?
- desc: Something I would like to know more about relating to today&#039;s discussion
    is how exactly Wikipedia deters vandalism across its many articles and pages.
    For example, I&#039;m curious as to how the anti vandalism bots reduce bad edits
    and I&#039;d like to see some metrics indicating how successful the bots are at
    reducing vandalism in general. I&#039;m curious, as well, about how reliable in
    general Wikipedia&#039;s sources are. We spoke about not using Wikipedia as a
    primary source, though we can draw from the same sources Wikip
- desc: how some people get covid-19 and die while others don&#039;t.
- desc: I would like to know more about how google decides what information to put
    in a snippet. With the covid wiki article it left out the previous sentence which
    connected to the preventative measures. So, does google just start a snippet from
    the point it can find the key words? How does it decide which information is the
    most important to show?
- desc: How Google&#039;s algorithm works for picking out snippets of information
    in a website (Wikipedia) and how it determines what to leave out and include.
    It may help people to understand the results that are being shown to them (why
    it picked that result/snippet).
- desc: Based on topic for this class, I feel like since people can edit on Wikipedia,
    people don&#039;t trust/believe the feedback with the given options, whether the
    information is true or not. Also, I would suggest Google or any search engine
    to create snippets from reliable websites rather than just acquiring snippets
    that have the same sentence or words in the discussions. What I want to learn
    more about is how Google obtains their snippets when someone searches something.
    Like, how do they find the answers?
- desc: the thing i would most like to know more about is how google chooses its snippets.
    Also in the cases where they come from non Wikipedia sources why they choose those
    specific sources. Are they curated or run by an algorithm
- desc: 'Transparency about algorithms and how something is designed is important
    and necessary. I want to know more about why this is difficult to achieve for
    most of the technology we utilize. I also want to know more about the role of
    educators in the computer science world: what is essential to be taught to society?
    Why haven&#039;t most schools emphasized the importance of digital and media literacy
    a bit more? Not to mention the importance of distinguishing unreliable sources
    from those that can be trusted.'
- desc: I would like to know how credible Wikipedia can be because anyone can edit
    it. I wanna know the stats behind it too.
- desc: Should google have control on wikipedia eventhough wikipedia is a different
    company? What are the advantages and disadvantages of having your own control
    over your company?
- desc: I do find the area of the search engine algorithms very interesting. Google
    and other search engines have a major impact on our society, whether that be positive
    or negative impact is very hard determine. With the amount of false information
    out there, it really takes a skeptic to truly learn both sides of a topic.
- desc: How can we tell what sources are better than others?
- desc: I want to know more about how search algorithms such as google decides what
    snippets of information are taken from a webpage and displayed on the search results.
    I would also like to know more about how a search engine and a webpage could go
    about fact checking their information so that it can present information as being
    factually true or false.
- desc: how google decide what snippet as their search result
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about the topic given in the class. Professor
    has opened all the breakout rooms and we should discuss all the given questions.
- desc: How do we ensure that the best information gets presented to the public? Who
    is in charge of saying this is the most important information and of making sure
    that is as easy as possible for the public to find? I tend to think this would
    likely have to be more of a governmental role - although in an age where people
    trust their government less and less that could be a very tricky proposition.
    Some form of regulation would very likely be required.
- desc: i want to know more and the project perrosol, about if i am going to talk
    about secure problem what kind of topic is relate to the class
