difficult:
- desc: Still Interface Aspiration is an unknown topic for me and didn&#039;t understood
    the concept of it in relation with the different events like &amp;quot;The Ghosts
    of Flight 401&amp;quot;,  &amp;quot;The Apollo 13 Accident&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The
    Therac 25&amp;quot;. Would like to know more about Interface relation with these
    in the next lecture as I didn&#039;t understood them in this lecture and is still
    most difficult thing for me to understand.
- desc: How do we plan out what we are building to include all potential use cases?
    Using Apollo 13 as an example; how do we know to think about situations where
    the air filter in one module should be compatible with the air filter in the other
    module?
- desc: "The most difficult thing for me to understand in today\u2019s class topic\
    \ about the guy who was printing 3d guns. is that why would some people use internet\
    \ to prompt the wrong version of public interest?  Promoting guns and violence\
    \ will harm many people and many innocents will be victims of any terror attacks\
    \ caused by selling guns. Would the desire of earning money will make people to\
    \ choose the incorrect decision to not caring about the safety and life of others?\
    \ Selling things that protect others on interne"
important:
- desc: The most important thing i learned is that an interface is humane if  is responsive
    to human needs and considerate of human frailties.
- desc: the most imporant thing i learned was about the purpose of interfaces and
    how a flawed design can cause harm which lines up perfectly with what we learn
    in CS 215.
- desc: Most important thing about today was learning about flight 401
- desc: I learned how other people view twitter. For the most part I think it&#039;s
    a cesspool of complaining, but it is also a very important tool in communication
    for things like revolutions in many countries.
- desc: How can I minimize my risk of contracting and transmitting COVID? Searching
    from 3 or more search engines.? The most helpful search engine was Qwant
- desc: interfaces are important to flight.
- desc: The way we design systems is really important.  Today we discussed how interfaces
    often are life and death with reference to feric 125m, flight 401, and apollo
    13.  Here all of them caused unnessesary danger.  Apollo 13 did this by not having
    interchangable CO2 scrubbers thereby causing unnessesary work.  Flight 401 didn&#039;t
    have adaquate sensors so when a lightbulb failed they had to put a lot of effort
    into sensing if the landing gears were down.  The autopilot should have had warnings
    about being disengage
- desc: Today I learned the impact of relying on Computing in our society with examples
    of Flight 401 accident which killed 101 passengers, 737 Max Fault Sensors which
    killed 346 passengers, and Apollo crash 3 crew members.
- desc: An interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and considerate
    of human frailties. A computer shall not harm your work or, through inaction,
    allow your work to come to harm. A computer is created to help people to do their
    work.
- desc: "The thing I would like to think know more about from today\u2019s meeting\
    \ is why humankind struggles hard when automatic fails. As Jef Raskin says, \u201C\
    A computer shall not harm your work or, through inaction, allow your work to come\
    \ to harm\u201D and \u201CAn interface is humane if it is responsive to human\
    \ needs and considerate of human and machine frailties\u201D. A computer professional\
    \ must have an understanding of relevant information on how both human and machines\
    \ operations."
- desc: I learned a lot about how we can relate current news and events to the course
    and course content. This will help me with my project and my blog posts because
    it will help me easier identify topics I could cover in these assignments.
- desc: The Laws of Interface by Jef Raskin taught me how computer professionals should
    be accountable for their every single action. They should not allow a computer
    to affect their work. Computer professionals should check their code and software
    thoroughly before they work with them in the field.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is that it is important to check that programs
    and make sure they take into account what the people who use them need to be responsible
    for. In some of the examples stated in class, there where issues where people
    were to reliant on programs and there were situations where programs did not work
    as intended. It is important that people know the capabilities and limitations
    of programs.
- desc: We investigated what the students thought of Twitter. I personally have a
    lot of fake news on Twitter and I don&#039;t trust Twitter.
- desc: It&#039;s hard to imagine how just a small a small detail can lead to a big
    event, like the broken lightbulb that leads to the crash of flight 401
- desc: That simple design choices in technology can have an impact on many lives
    (easily change a burnt-out lightbulb in planes, safety switches in Therac-25).
    They need to be well tested and user-friendly (as well as other qualities) in
    order to prevent damage to people, environment, and businesses.
- desc: From an ethical perspective, the connection of Flight 401 incident with the
    Jef Raskin&#039;s third law of interfaces i.e., a computer shall not waste your
    time or require you to do more work than is strictly necessary was that the pilots
    should have been engaged at all times and not shouldn&#039;t have just relied
    on the auto-pilot. The pilots relying too much on the auto pilot or flight control
    system caused the flight to crash which could have been avoided if the pilots
    had been engaged at all times.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is that that when we are at the work
    environment we need to relay information correctly and engage in our work. I also
    learned that information from the news is helpful for the class. We discussed
    In the class about the Olympics and the world cup. The impact of Covid-19 and
    that Saskatchewan is going to lift covid restrictions.
- desc: I have learned about interface aspiration and their examples, I wasn&#039;t
    aware of the incident which happened in the ghosts of flight 401 as the flights
    didn&#039;t have adequate sensors and when the light bulb failed, pilot has to
    put a lot of efforts sensing if the landing gear were down, which unfortunately
    caused the lives of 101 people and also the Apollo 13 accident..
- desc: computers have to be designed very carefully to avoid tragedies such as flight
    401
- desc: I learned that an interface is humane if it is responsive to human needs and
    considerate of human frailties. That is an equipment that is built to perform
    a particular function or activity has instructions to respond to the various needs
    its users may have and in the process of carrying out its instructions is able
    to interrupt program flow if a its users could come into any potential harm; These
    kinds of interfaces are considered humane. The case of flight 401 exemplifies
    an interface that is not humane be
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture, we have discussed about the twitter&#039;s post and
    we had a poll of how many are aware of twitter what it is actually and how many
    of us not using the app. Later on, we had story of Ghost of the flight 401, which
    was explained by Dr. Hepting in class.
- desc: The thing about twitter especially the poll got my attention towards finding
    more knowledge about this subject.
- desc: The most important thing i learned from today&#039;s lecture is about the
    current news about the world cup qualifying and a man from saskatchewan from weyburn
    is facing charges after rcmp seizes firearms. Then discussed the question about
    how to prevent covid-19 infections and have to submit results from various search
    engines. on how we can prevent covid-19 infections. The most interesting thing
    i came to know about is the ghost of the flight 401 how sensor failure led to
    very bad result. then the discussion on
- desc: Today we looked at professor&#039;s twitter and how people use twitter to
    share their opinions
- desc: Today, we talked about the ghosts of flight 401. The flight&#039;s lightbulb
    stopped working and then, pilots spent a lot of time trying to fix it. While fixing
    it they set the plane on autopilot mode which at that time was newly made available.
    It was in its developing years, so it was not well developed like nowadays. While
    repairing the lightbulb, the pilots accidently turned off the auto pilot mode,
    which became responsible for the plane crash.
- desc: Twitter is so dangerous, even a leader like Moe can spread incorrect information.
    It is very urgent that our government establish a law when using social websites
    for influencers. How can we trust our leader when they posted nonsense Tweet?
- desc: I learned today that the ultimate goal of an interface is to enable the user
    of a computer system to understand the behavior of the machine and to be able
    to respond appropriately to the behavior of the machine (computer). So when we
    design the human-machine interface of a computer system, how should we imagine
    the behavior of the computer system? In the author&#039;s opinion, the metaphorical
    approach is very effective. The so-called metaphor is to see the computer system
    as an object with some kind of behavior
- desc: The Therac-25 story has really emphasized the importance of testing software
    created. While I do not agree that any ethical decisions were made, as it it very
    tough to have an understanding of the software, hardware and medical aspects of
    the Therac-25. I do think a critical error was made by the company in not completing
    enough testing.
- desc: Always go through the safety checklist before a flight.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt from today&#039;s lecture is that how covid
    had impacted in the technology sector. And I really wish to learn more about this
    in future lessons.
- desc: "The most important thing I learnt is how detrimental a poor interface can\
    \ be, and the impact we\u2019ve seen it have. I\u2019m interested to see what\
    \ current interfaces that won\u2019t be accepted years from now!"
- desc: I thought the discussion about interfaces was pretty interesting.
- desc: Compared to duckduckgo, which only lists statistics according to country,
    bing and google have made a more intuitive statistical chart according to region,
    where bing also made a cumulative diagnosis chart to clearly show the growth rate
    and other factors
- desc: The online database can be protected by firewall and in the coid-19 time,
    people still can work  online
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about what methods social media sites use to censor
    content, and what (if any) regulatory oversight is involved.
- desc: The thing from today&#039;s lecture that i would most like to know more about
    is how a $5 light bulb caused the crash of an airplane. Don&#039;t they have to
    check everything before takeoff? Did the light burn out during takeoff, when else
    would it have been on? Did the plane engineer not have a flashlight when he went
    to check under the plane to see if the landing gear was down? There was so many
    mistakes that could have been prevented.
- desc: W have learned about 3D printed guns in Saskatchewan and how they were obtained
    illegally. I would like to know more about how government is taking steps to prevent
    3D guns from getting in the wrong hands. 3D guns are getting extremely easy to
    obtain nowadays. A person with a 3D printer and a few ingredients which could
    be bought from a store can easily print a 3D Gun. It is extremely easy to get
    a 3d printer hence, a 3d gun. But, I haven&#039;t heard of the law doing something
    out of the ordinary to prevent it
- desc: why do big comperations take most of our internet information
- desc: If you used three different search engines using the same search history,
    if you would then get similar search results to one another.
- desc: Today we have discuss interface Aspiration and its examples. The three examples
    we have discuss that are The Ghosts of Flight 401, The apollo 13 accident and
    the Therac 25. I would like to know more examples in this topic.
- desc: today&#039;s class was very interesting but I&#039;m curious in how various
    websites present different results for the same subject.
- desc: Why doesn&#039;t the government or 3d printing software companies manage and
    track 3d printing activities? Someone could make a bomb or a gun using a 3d printer
    for malicious intent without anyone knowing.
- desc: how search engine connect multiple websites
- desc: Today&#039;s topic and discussion about the interface intrigued me. In contrast
    to other tools which often have limited uses, computers often have many uses that
    involve an open-ended dialogue between the user and the machine. The interaction
    between a human and a computer has been a vital area of research and I am interested
    to know more about this area of research. I am also eager to learn more about
    artificial intelligence and how it is amazing in terms of helping users have a
    better experience.
- desc: Interface errors!  They seem like such a simple thing, yet they clearly have
    been missed in the past to cause dramatic problems.  Is this something that should
    be taught more in Software Engineering classes, to ensure compatability with similar
    systems?  Or should these largely be treated as freak accidents?
- desc: The thing which I would most like to know more about is how we can make sure
    these tech companies are programming in an ethical way. How can we make sure that
    the coders biases are not coded into the algorithm?
- desc: Since we talked about interface examples this class, I wanted to get to know
    more about interface risks and rewards regarding computing technology. And since
    we were discussing whether someone would rather search on different engines on
    COVID related news or evaluating the quality of their own answer, in my opinion,
    I would rather search for an answer on different search engines and maybe turn
    off recognizable filters (ie locations, vpn, etc) to fully credit the search and
    not have biased claims.
- desc: I would like to know how different search engines seek different access and
    information.
- desc: I would like to know more about other areas in which computing makes an impact
    on society, not just social media. Although I understand that social media is
    an incredibly prominent element to the impact, I wonder what else there is that
    we could be overlooking. What other areas do we have so much impact on as computer
    scientists?
- desc: I would like to know how humanity looks forward to the advancement of AI and
    technologies in general. The high expectations individuals have , the fears civilians
    have of loosing their job to AI&#039;s, the fear of being harmed by one and how
    acceptable everyone will be towards the future humanity is heading.
- desc: I would like to know more about how the 3 laws of technology came to be.
- desc: I would surely like to know more about the interface of different browsers
    and by today&#039;s poll i gotta know how everyone thinks about use of Twitter.
- desc: 'To answer today&#039;s question: I would rather come up with the results
    and evaluate the quality of those results. It is better than searching for an
    answer across different search engines. It is not guaranteed that those search
    engines will provide good results. The quality of results matter especially when
    acquiring data. Good quality data gives good quality analysis.'
- desc: I would most like to know about risk regarding technology as well as how we
    can resolve it with different ways.
- desc: Is twitter more user friendly then the other social medias that we use?
- desc: "Why does twitter\u2019s method of posting an article or people\u2019s ideas\
    \ a thing. Twitter would have easily implemented a feature that could display\
    \ an article in image format which also opens up the opportunity to include images\
    \ in the article."
- desc: Todays meeting was very good. It all started with the discussion on latest
    news. After that we all talked about interface aspiration and also discussed some
    examples related to that such as about the ghost of flight 401, the Apollo 13
    accident and also about Theravada 25. After that the meetings ends by discussing
    about next meeting topic.
- desc: I would like to know more about what safety systems are in place in essential
    code such as the auto-pilot on air planes. I would also like to know how these
    codes are examined and tested to ensure that they work and are deemed safe to
    use.
- desc: the number of search result of specific topic and its trendcy
- desc: The phrase an activity dealing with accessing data (about COVID-19) as I prefer
    to evaluating quality of results than searching in other search engines as per
    medical search/news search I would go to renowned organization ex for covid I
    would prefer
- desc: I&#039;d like to hear more about the Jef Raskin quotes, they were pretty interesting
    to think about.
