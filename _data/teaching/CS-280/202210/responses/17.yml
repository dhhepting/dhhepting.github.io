difficult:
- desc: The reasoning of instagram to relax rules on hate speech. Social media drives
    this type of extremism in order to gain more interactivity but this seems deceitful.
    Times of conflict should be when social media tries to bring people closer together
    not farther apart. At the same time, you can&#039;t blame every Russian for what&#039;s
    going on in Ukraine. That would be like blaming every asian person for the corona
    virus it&#039;s an action that is quite prejudice and ignorant of how the world
    functions on a global scale.
- desc: The response for the break out room question is mixed, so I&#039;m not too
    sure what is the right answer. I think hate speech is not acceptable, but who
    decide what hate speech is? In my opinion, I think even if instagram relaxes filter
    on hate speech, i think they should give th
important:
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in the lecture today was that Instagram
    decided not to censor hate speech, such as death threats against the Russian invaders.
    It was definitely an interesting move on their part, possibly for marketing purposes.
    This is definitely an unacceptable move by a major social media platform because
    who&#039;s to say what can and cant be censored, if they let this go on where
    will they draw the line on other hate speech.
- desc: Being allowed to express yourself out in public is good but can sometimes
    go to far
- desc: Hate speech = bad
- desc: There are reasons both for and against censoring varying levels of hate-speech
    and we have to decide on an ethical approach to dealing with it
- desc: I did not know meta was removing filters from their platform so that people
    could freely express themselves over what is going on right now in the world.
    I do believe in freedom of speech and that everyone should be able to be vocal
    about how they feel but I do not believe that these platforms should be giving
    a people a stage to be hateful and hurtful towards others. Which leads me to believe
    that this is a marketing stunt to stay relevant and keep people supporting them.
- desc: today we talked about an Impact of &amp;quot;Hate Speech&amp;quot;. I believe
    the social media is fueling heat speech for good and bad reason, however it is
    our responsible especially as a computer professional  how we handle it.
- desc: Social media is a important part of society, so they should take care to promote
    a higher standard of behaviour
- desc: "Instagram relaxed filters on hate speech - \u201CDeath to the invaders\u201D\
    \ to show their stance on the Ukraine-Russia war. I think this is not acceptable\
    \ because social media platforms have a primary responsibility to deliver information\
    \ from an unbiased perspective and the computer professionals working for these\
    \ platforms must act and stand up to obey the code of ethics. By following these\
    \ codes of ethics, a computer professional can take a step towards the greater\
    \ good and model ideal behaviour."
- desc: Today, we discussed the possible reasons why most applications are relaxing
    filters for hate speech. The elaborate discussion gave me a clear idea about why
    this scheme is globally acceptable. Firstly, it provides a medium for Ukrainian
    people to express their emotions, and secondly, it is just another marketing strategy
    for social media platforms.
- desc: Blog entry
- desc: Instagram, Facebook, and Tiktok are all US-owned social media platforms that
    discontinued their services in Russia. This was triggered by the new law that
    Russia enacted. Recently, Instagram has decided to relax its filters due to hate
    speech. They may have eliminated the means by which Ukrainians and others communicate
    their opinions about the war. Instagram did the correct thing, in my opinion,
    because it might lead to greater social media disputes.
- desc: Social media platforms can easily allow hate speech to a certain group of
    individuals
- desc: Today&#039;s class had some interesting topics of discussion. There was a
    discussion about how there is no such thing as bad publicity. The idea that no
    publicity can harm is open to question. Sometimes, bad publicity also benefits
    the company to which the publicity is done towards.
- desc: There is no clear or easy way to determine what is hate speech or what is
    correct online.  For example, there&#039;s no clear answer to is it wrong of Meta
    to capitalize on the Ukraine conflict to get good PR by allowing their filters
    to be relaxed?  It is a really complicated issue and one that has repercussion
    for any action, as it could be argued that Meta supports Russia had they not made
    that decision.  There seems to be no correct answer.
- desc: 'Topic: Designing Interaction Interaction design is used in many computer
    fields such as websites and applications. Information can be effectively delivered
    or consumers&#039; consumption can be promoted through appropriate interaction
    design between consumers and companies or information providers and those who
    need information. We learn human-computer interfaces and their analysis/evaluation
    in CS280. Through the books we choose, we can see how the web design interface
    works and how the seven sins of humans are'
- desc: Meta allowing hate speech against Russian soldiers is a marketing move
- desc: While we were talking about how Instagram decided to relax filters for hate
    speech, I think its good for people in Ukraine to express themselves, but I think
    it is because of the toxic environment we&#039;ve created in social media. Like,
    I get it. People have freedom of speech, but sometimes it goes too far. So I agree
    that social platforms should try to promote a higher standard of behaviour and
    possibly block the negativity?
- desc: Social media platforms hold a lot of influential power over people nowadays.
    The most important thing I learned today was related to the impacts of social
    media on our lives mainly our thinking and decision-making. Considering the impact
    of social media platforms, computer professionals should be well aware of the
    consequences of their actions, for example, Intagram deciding to relax its rules
    for hate speech in Ukraine.
- desc: Today we discussed about Instagrams decision to relax rules on hate speech
    and whether or not this is acceptable, I have learned about the ACM code of ethics,
    it expresses the conscience of professions, it contributes to the society and
    to human well-being, it avoids harm or negative consequences.
- desc: Instagrams decision to relax rules on hate speech is bad because hate speech
    would be promoted a lot and that is overall not good for the society as social
    media is a crucial part of our society. So basically I think relaxing the rules
    is a bad thing.
- desc: The
- desc: In Today&#039;s meeting we have discussed about Instagram decided to relax
    filters for hate speech temporarily for now and is it acceptable or not. Some
    believe no and some yes as it gives citizens of Ukraine a means to express themselves
    and many more reasons.
- desc: We discussed the importance of keeping a certain high level of standards on
    every available content on social media platform.  We discussed both the positive
    side and the negative side of Instagram relaxing its hate speech rules. I disagree
    more with this kind of relaxation as it is a biased decision.
- desc: We are living in an age where technology is a part of everyone&#039;s life.
    Social media has a lot of power in swaying public opinion. How these social media
    sites are managed is very important.
- desc: Talked about the russia-ukraine war for a while in breakout rooms and discussed
    about Instagram&#039;s strategy on relaxing the filter of &amp;quot;Death to the
    invaders&amp;quot; and the different impacts of it on the people around the world.
    Also looked at the Avoid harm section of ACM Code of ethics and professional conduct
    for more details on how as a tech company they should keep these ethics in mind
    while making any changes.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discussed in breakout room regarding Instagram&#039;s
    decision to relax rules on hate speech and whether or not this is acceptable.
- desc: Today we discussed Instagram&#039;s decision to relax its filters on hate
    speech, and that social media platforms are an important part of society, so they
    should take care to promote high standards of behavior
- desc: In todays class, professor talked about blogs and our submissions.
- desc: In todays meeting we discussed about how Instagram&#039;s decision to relax
    rules on hate speech and whether or not this is acceptable. We also discussed
    that hate speech is a good thing or not and Ukraine citizens should be given a
    means to express themselves. At the end we also discussed about some general ethics
    principles.
- desc: as long as it is not unethical, it is acceptable
- desc: The most important thing that I learned will be Code of ethics and Instagram
    decided to relax filters for hate speech . According to me this is not a great
    solution because social media became the media of propaganda and it will increase
    misinformation i think social media is should not interfere in geopolitics
- desc: I wasn&#039;t aware that Instagram allows hate speech directed towards Russia
    now
- desc: How hate speech can be a good and bad at the same time.
- desc: "In todays class, we discussed Instagram\u2019s decision to relax rules on\
    \ hate speech and whether or not this is acceptable. Split into breakout rooms\
    \ to discuss Topic is a \u201Cslippery slope\u201D.  If we allow direct calls\
    \ for violence now what precedent does it set for future decisions?  Where is\
    \ the line? Gives Ukrainian citizens an opportunity to further express themselves\
    \ at the expense of allowing hate speech."
- desc: That the ACM Code of Ethics can help guide computing professionals when determining
    their duties to act in certain situations. For example, if social media platforms
    are not held to account for some of their actions - is it up those in the industry
    to step up and act? In some scenarios, yes, they do have a duty to ensure that
    ethical actions are being taken.
- desc: The most important thing I have learned today that the big companies should
    not get involved in politics in sake of their benefits on the expense of the innocent
    people. Alos, it is not okay to META or Instagram to releases the filter and encourage
    people for hate speech. Also, it is so ironic that  there are many wars arounds
    the world but their are not being reflected or shared on social media because
    there are no individual expensive from those wars. Also, the policies should imply
    on everyone.
- desc: With the rapid development of computer information networks, network security
    issues are becoming more and more prominent. If the risk of computer network security
    is too great, it will inevitably have a great impact on people&#039;s work, study
    and life.
know-more:
- desc: I would most like to know more about the ACM Code of Ethics - General Ethical
    Principles
- desc: In todays meeting we discuss about instagram taking action regarding hate
    speech on their application. They are trying to introduce a new filter to remove
    these hate content. Iwould like to know about that are these hate speeches acceptable
    on a platform like instagram. It is used by kids in very might quantty leaves
    a bad impact on them. I think they need to more strict about hate speech.
- desc: If instagram and other platforms are gaining money from certain hashtags and
    accounts that promote hate speech why do their guidlines say they don&#039;t indulge
    hate speech. Isn&#039;t that breaking consumers trust and a diservice to their
    platforms?
- desc: How much of the rules around allowed content on social media a product of
    political pressures? For example, Trump getting banned from twitter while leaders
    of other countries who say much worse things are still happily enjoying twitter.
- desc: Today we have discuss about hate speech is good or not. I want to discuss
    more about how social media take a important part of society and by changing their
    behavior they can bring high standard in society.
- desc: Today I learned about the ACM code of ethics.  I learned that I can use it
    to analyze how ethical a technology change is.  I plan on reading more of this
    so I can better understand some of the ethical implications of it.
- desc: When did Instagram get so political? It used to be a fun photo and video sharing
    platform and now its ruined with political statements. I would like to learn more
    about how social media platforms like facebook and instagram use politics to their
    advantage
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more about how Instagram and other social media platforms
    analyze and categorize text and speech in terms of hate speech. This topic is
    related to sentiment analysis, which is another topic which I would love to learn
    more about and discuss about how this technology can affect how we interact with
    other people across these media platforms.
- desc: who sets the standard hate speech in the fi
- desc: I would like to know more about Instagram&#039;s decision to allow that specific
    phrase of hate speech and how it is being used on the platform. Is it being used
    as Instagram intended and allowing people to express their discontent with the
    situation or is it just causing innocent individual&#039;s to be targeted with
    this phrase?
- desc: "I would like to know more about social media companies censoring speech because\
    \ it can lead to dangerous results. I think it\u2019s important to allow this\
    \ speech so we can understand it and possibly change the opinion. When you censor\
    \ it you lose that ability"
- desc: Because Instagram modified their filtering algorithm/rules to allow for hate
    speech due to the war in Ukraine, what happens to all of those posts that are
    being allowed temporarily when/if Instagram goes back to their old filtering algorithm?
    Would those posts get flagged by their filter and remove them from the platform?
    As well, would the accounts who posted that get flagged/taken down due to violating
    Instagram&#039;s policy?
- desc: Is what the true reason behind Meta allowing the hate speech towards Russia
    on Instagram.
- desc: the thing i would most like to know more about would have to be the effect
    on people that censorship has had. The more censorship seems to happen the more
    divided and polarized the internet seems to become.
- desc: I don&#039;t know anymore.
- desc: 'We discussed about the blog assignment submission which was on last Friday
    as some have faced issue in &#039;submit&#039; button. He also discussed about
    the  Critique writing for blog entry which is due on March 25th. Then we had a
    class discussion which on Humane Interface: clicking submit or not on Ur courses
    when you are submitting your assignment. Then we also discussed about the Instagram
    which relaxed their hate filters. I would like to know more about the Humane Interface.'
- desc: Western media is engaging in a full-scale propaganda war against Russia, like
    what we saw in video games, movies,... Social media platforms should not be allowed
    to interfere in politics. I believe what Instagram did is discrimination against
    Russian
- desc: The steps social media platforms will take to prevent hate speach against
    communities and individuals..
- desc: What is the role of technology in Ukraine and Russia war?
- desc: I would love to know more about practical implementation of analyzing things
    on the web and explore more about it . I would love to study the dark web which
    is has created controversy among many. I would also like to experience each and
    every aspect of the internet.
- desc: I would like to know more about what the responsibilities and ethics of computer
    specialists especially in how it affects different global issues such as the Russian
    invasion of Ukraine.
- desc: I always seem to find the discussions in regards to Ukraine and Russia to
    be pretty interesting.
