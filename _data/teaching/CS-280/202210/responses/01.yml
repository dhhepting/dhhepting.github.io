difficult:
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is that it is hard to consider the
    difference between Risk and Reward unless the purpose is defined. As observed
    most of the ideas discussed in class for Risk and reward of information society
    were associated with personal data. It was pretty much hard to understand the
    concept of risks only as most of the ideas were based on the data breach. I will
    look forward to skim through the risk part related to information society.
- desc: So far, the most difficult thing for me to understand is how the wiki works,
    how to implement a new page into it, and how a classwork group distributes the
    work amongst each other. I would definitely need more explanation there to understand
    my full duty in what I need to upload. Another thing I did not understand quite
    as well was how to navigate was syllabus.
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand was what this class was about
    and how it will be graded.  I want to learn more about what this project is, the
    assignments, as well as research credit.  What are the exact criteria used to
    evaluate participation?
- desc: Was about the wiki.  Are a group assigned to it after every lecture to work
    on and progress?  Is everyone expected to always contribute?  Is this for grades,
    or to help us further our understanding of the topics presented?  I&#039;m just
    a little bit confused!
- desc: Firstly I could not got the question that was asked in the class today for
    discussion in breakout rooms. I was able to get question after I heard some of
    the answers from other students. So I think I learned also in this class about
    risk and reward kind of things hearing from fellow students.
- desc: "I am not able to understand Assignments and it&#039;s\
    \ due dates, final exam date as well as course material which is not mentioned\
    \ in the syllabus. I have found only the Meetings date. Nothing is mentioned in\
    \ the syllabus except the date of the meetings. If it is mentioned then it will\
    \ be more beneficial for us as well organized.\r\n\r\nI would like to gain more\
    \ knowledge in system security, cryptography, encryption, digital signature, authentication\
    \ protocols as well as network security."
- desc: I know today what I need to learn for cs280 and what I need to do this semester,
    and the group discussion was cool. Also, I learned about how the internet affects
    us and how there are many unstable elements in the internet.
- desc: I&#039;m not entirely sure what the term Information Society means, I&#039;d
    love to learn at some point.
important:
- desc: We discussed some of the biggest risks and rewards that we face in our information
    society where both the  access to information, and the publishing of said information
    has been made very easy.
- desc: I learned that we as a society do not value privacy. We will freely give away
    our private information for incredibly small rewards such as a free coffee, or
    access to an application on our phone. We will allow large corporations to monitor
    our online activity for something as simple as being advertised to more accurately.
- desc: well In today&#039;s class I learn or discuss basic things about Risks in
    computers field. When someone tries to damage or steal the user data or tries
    to access the user information without user permission. In many application like
    Facebook, Instagram user information are leak that create security risk for user.
    There are many things which are risk for computer such as viruses and worms. Viruses
    that can be attached to the computer files and corrupt or destroy the user data.
    Viruses can be spread from various sources. It can spread from internet and some
    human involvement is necessary to spread the virus.
- desc: The largest risk, in my opinion, would be data misuse, while the major benefit
    could be easier access to information. I personally believe that today&#039;s
    first class very helpful in understanding various fields of computer science.
- desc: "- I am very pleased to take CS 280, it is not only a part of computer science\
    \ but also very important to understand the risks and rewards in current society.\r\
    \n- In my first class, I have learned what is the biggest risks and rewards in\
    \ the current society through breakout room discussions. \r\n\r\nRisks \r\n  \
    \ o\tData and Privacy Breach \u2013 Lead confidential information into wrong hands\
    \ such as cybercriminals, data manipulating private companies, campaign companies.\
    \  \r\n   o\tDisinformation \u2013 Divide our society through different or wrong\
    \ information. \r\n   o\tArtificial Intelligence (AI) \u2013 Lead real-life errors,\
    \ High unemployment rate, making people more dependent on technologies. \r\n \
    \  o\tCyber Attacks \u2013 Massively interrupt daily life (attacks on utilities\
    \ or essential supply companies), costs more money to run business. \r\n\r\nRewards\
    \ \r\no\tGetting and sharing information from across the world \r\no\tCloud Infrastructure\
    \ \u2013 Less effort to build an infrastructure with the latest tools with a minimum\
    \ level of security (data and infrastructure)\r\no\tGlobalization \u2013 Able\
    \ to connect to any part of the world with less effort which is leading high record\
    \ of online businesses. \r\n\r\nAntony E"
- desc: "The big risk in our information society is that our personal information\
    \ is more likely to be leaked. \r\nThe big reward in our information society is\
    \ that people all over the world can contact each other very conveniently."
- desc: "The important things I learnt in today\u2019s lecture were about the rewards\
    \ and risks in the information society. The rewards include the easy accessibility\
    \ of information (how effortlessly  any kind of information is available at the\
    \ tip of our fingers in this fast-evolving technological world). Anyone can get\
    \ linked from any corner of the world through the virtual connection served by\
    \ the information society. The risks of this society go hand-in-hand with its\
    \ rewards. The easy accessibility of data has posed a threat about the security\
    \  as well as corruption of sensitive data. We need to protect this information\
    \ against malware. Privacy of data is a risk in today\u2019s information society."
- desc: I believe the most important thing that I learned during today&#039;s lecture
    was the importance of understanding our current information society. More and
    more companies are using and selling data that has been scraped by countless hours
    of scrolling on their websites for profit which is very questionable. The fact
    that these companies use this information as they please without laws in place
    to help protect the consumer is borderline insane to me.
- desc: attending classes
- desc: Today, I learned about the information society of today. It&#039;s all about
    creating and disseminating information, which carries both high risk and reward.
    The benefit is that information is easily accessible via the internet. On the
    other hand, it carries significant risks. Due to the ease with which information
    can travel via the internet, people must exercise caution in determining whether
    or not it is accurate. People could also gain access to your personal information
    and misuse it.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was that their are many different
    interpretations of how information can have contrasting pros and cons. One example
    is social media, you get to connect with friends and family, which is a pro, but
    sacrifice privacy in the process, as we do not know how these companies gather
    our info and what they do with it. This can lead to a rather interesting discussion
    of whether or not the pros outweigh the cons or vice versa. Another discussion
    can also be about how we can keep the pro of staying connected with friends, and
    minimize the impact or get rid of the con, which again is lack of privacy.
- desc: I talked to classmates in the breakout room about privacy. Everyone agreed
    that privacy becomes easier to expose as there are more comfortable parts in daily
    life using SNS. Through Facebook or Instagram, everyone can easily find photos
    and information, and many people don&#039;t take personal information seriously.
    Through this class, I think we will be able to learn how to manage personal protection
    and why personal information is important.
- desc: The most important thing I learned from today&#039;s discussion is about the
    biggest risk and rewards in today&#039;s information society. I learned to get
    easier access to a massive amount of information, we first have to provide our
    personal and privacy information. We sacri
- desc: "The most important thing that I learned today.\r\n         The most important\
    \ thing that I learned today is the risk and reward in information system. Information\
    \ is very useful in our day to day activity, if we find information easily it\
    \ will make our life easier .And on the risk part, data breach can be dangerous\
    \ therefore we have to be careful when managing information. I also learned different\
    \ ways of communication in the class and interacting and sharing ideas to get\
    \ to use links in U of R courses. I also get to chat on discord with classmates\
    \ and ask some questions. It was a great time to meet with professor and chat\
    \ with student on line."
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we discussed about the biggest risks and rewards in
    regards to today&#039;s information society. The most important thing that I have
    learned, or should I say, the topic that I agreed the most with today is that
    although the internet offers us a plethora of resources and information, it also
    has its downsides. These downsides mostly have to do with your privacy and how
    your information can easily be accessed and breached by anonymous users on the
    web. The worst part is, since most users in today&#039;s age are well educated
    in regards to technology, you&#039;re more prone to getting hacked or having your
    information leaked than ever.
- desc: The most important thing I learned in the discussion topic (big/biggest risks
    and big/biggest rewards in our information society?) is how big a role cybersecurity
    plays in ensuring the safety and protection of the rights, privacy, and security
    of individuals in society. A breach in the security of an organization can lead
    to loss of information which could result in individual information being compromised.
    Also, it can lead to manipulation of individuals for political gain as in the
    case of Cambridge Analytica. Where political parties made use of algorithms in
    triggering people to act in certain ways.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was how sharing our personal information
    to the internet can potentially be a big risk to our own privacy. Other people
    that have the ability or skills are able to invade our personal data which they
    can sell/share to other third parties. Though sharing our personal information
    through the internet indeed has a lists of risks, we still definitely get rewards
    in return. One reward that we can obtain is having a huge access to a vast array
    of information using the internet. The internet has its lists of risks and rewards.
- desc: I think after today&#039;s session I got to know that Doc Hepting is good
    professor... He understands what does student a student need... And moreover I
    think this course is gonna help me to understand better regarding what is actual
    privacy and is social media using our info for their purpose... So looking forward
    to next session!
- desc: Today is the first day of the class, I am happy to learn from Dr. Hepting
    and our class started with understanding the Course Guidelines and Evaluation
    for Assignment, Feedback, Exams. I was interested in knowing how this class will
    be throughout the semester. I was waiting for the syllabus where we can find all
    the weightage of the assignments, exams, and participating. It was good to see
    all the students and looking forward to learning more things from everyone in
    this class.
- desc: The first meeting was very informative, we got to know what we gonna learn
    in this class. We also learned about the projects that we have to do in this class.
    In todays meeting we also had a group discussion on &amp;quot;What do you think
    which is the big/biggest risk and big/biggest reward of Information society&amp;quot;.
    Got to learn some new things from this discussion. We discussed what are risk
    of information society, the point that came out of this discussion is threat to
    privacy. Our personal data can be leaked and misused. The reward of information
    society according to me is easy access to information. Due to advancement in technology
    you can easily access any information online and that save lot of time. This are
    the major things that I learned in the first meeting.
- desc: Today&#039;s class started with the introduction to course as well as professor.
    After that professor provided the details about what we will be doing in this
    semester for this course like assignments, group discussions and attendance. in
    breakout room group discussion i came to know about what are pros and cons of
    information society. rewards like providing more efficient services to the world
    and helping people with technologies like artificial intelligence, information
    and communication technology and risks like data leak, data manipulation, stealing
    information and using it to harass people and whole society. at the end professor
    has also given the idea of what we will be learning based on the group discussions.
- desc: Today&#039;s information society has developed a lot. There are many risks
    and rewards associated with this developed information society. It has resolved
    our communication problems significantly. In the past, we had to rely on birds
    like pigeons or eagles to communicate with those who live far away from us. Nowadays,
    due to the developments in the information society sector, we have several ways
    like video calling or voice messaging, which are far more efficient and easy to
    use. Accessibility is one of the other most important benefits of today&#039;s
    well-developed information society. We can get news from all over the world with
    just a single click. Although, there are some risks involved as well. The biggest
    concern associated with it is privacy. To use these facilities, we give various
    permissions to applications providing these facilities. So, there are always chances
    that these applications use these private data for their personal gains. Sometimes,
    this kind of data that should be limited to the user only might leak and become
    available to everyone.
- desc: The significant thing I learned in today&#039;s class was during the group
    discussion. The risk and rewards of the information society. Privacy was one of
    the risks that was hugely discussed and the ability to spread misinformation too.
    Reward would be to the ability to connect and share information with other people.
    Depending on how one uses such things, it can either be a risk or a reward. Since
    it was the first day today, we didn&#039;t get to talk much about this but very
    interested in the different outcomes that can be discussed.
- desc: After our discussion in the class, I learned that information society is high
    risk and low reward for consumers; in contrast, it is low risk, high reward companies.
    Consumers grant access to a virtual world with little or less knowledge about
    this law, business, psychology, and economy. Companies with a better understanding
    of these aspects can easily manipulate people to earn more rewards. For example,
    with the appearance of NFT games, people could waste their money while thinking
    they were making money.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt today is various rewards and risk of modern
    technologies. The thoughts share by everyone were interesting and I would like
    to learn about the topics in details in this semester.
- desc: "The most important thing that I have learned today is that it exists many\
    \ risks and rewards which are quite present in our society such as:\r\n\r\nRisks:\
    \ \r\n\u2022\tWe don\u2019t have any privacy because in every single website where\
    \ we have to register, they ask us for many personal information. \r\n\u2022\t\
    Our personal information can be used against us in a malicious way.\r\n\u2022\t\
    People is reading less and less books because all the information is at Google.\r\
    \n\r\nRewards:\r\n\u2022\tConnecting with people all around the world.\r\n\u2022\
    \tRapidity to obtain information with just one click."
- desc: The class started with professor giving introduction and then he discussed
    some stuff about assignments and group discussions and stuff like that. Later
    the group discussion took place into the action where the question &amp;quot;What
    is Risk and rewards systems in Information Technology&amp;quot; was raised. We
    also discussed the pros and cons of it. we brainstormed many cons like data breach,
    manipulation and hacking. and Pros like how AI is gonna help and reduce human
    efforts. At the end the professor gave us feedback on it.
- desc: Most important thing I learned was that the big/biggest risks and big/biggest
    rewards in today&#039;s society can include many things. Rewards can include how
    easy it is to access information or make contact with people globally. Risks can
    include people hacking into those types of sites and getting your personal info.
- desc: "The meeting today\
    \ was amazing and I get a lot to learn not only from the professor but from the\
    \ students as well. We discussed the rewards and risks in the information society,\
    \ which in its on the main topic of our course CS 280. There were rewards like\
    \ it become convenient for all of us to talk to our loved ones at any given time\
    \ through face time or regular calls and messages. Secondly, it benefits each\
    \ and every individual to gain knowledge while sitting at their homes. It also\
    \ has some risks such as threatening our privacy and our personal information\
    \ getting leaked to those whom we don&#039;t want to know about. Moreover, nowadays\
    \ cybercrime is at its peak as many of us getting robbed, as the hackers are penetrating\
    \ our bank accounts and taking away our money. And all this happens as our information\
    \ gets leaked.\r\n\r\nToday&#039;s lecture was quite informative, as it provides\
    \ me the knowledge that information society provides many rewards but it can be\
    \ harmful, if not used securely.\r\n\r\nThank You."
- desc: "The internet or social media could bring plenty of opportunities for people\
    \ but is also considered a dangerous place with many risks.\r\nThe biggest risk\
    \ might be misinformation/propaganda, data breach/harvesting, and Cyberbullying\
    \ caused by freedom of expression.\r\nAnd the rewards could be convenient for\
    \ people to contact each other or get information and knowledge ever before."
- desc: Information Society is a broad topic, and It has risks and rewards. Thought
    the class discussion, the privacy issue seems to be the top concern of the classmates,
    as we put our personal information on social media, etc. Sharing information could
    be a reward as people share knowledge and resources. However, harvesting or mining
    the info could be relatively tricky. The quality of information sharing is also
    a concern as it could mislead people to do the wrong thing. We can see that information
    society could be a double-bladed sword, and it depends on how people use it.
know-more:
- desc: The effects of the rapid access of information on people&#039;s attention
    spans, perception of the world, self-esteem, etcetera. It would also be interesting
    to know if there is a difference based on what platforms/social media networks
    the person uses.
- desc: One thing that I would like to know more about is the risks of our information
    society, and how to safely avoid them while still being able to have the rewards
    of our information society.
- desc: the thing I would most like to know is how to protect the risk of information
    from leaking and maintaining privacy among ourselves how to overcome the risk
    of getting the wrong information and about how to handle information in a right
    way
- desc: what are some ways we can keep our information safe and secured.
- desc: What exactly is the determinate of what an Information Society is
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we learned how to edit the wiki.But I still not sure
    about what&#039;s that wiki for,should we edit it for something and how the Classwork
    work.
- desc: What does it mean to be in an information society?
- desc: I would like to know more about how to protect my personal information. Including
    making sure my computer has the security measures in place to keep out hackers
    and make sure none of my information is leaked on websites. I would also like
    to know how to detect invaders, bugs, viruses, etc. on my computer and how to
    clean my computer of them.
- desc: I would like to know more about how the different physical components of a
    computer (mouse, monitor, etc) and how they interconnect with the software components.
- desc: In regards to information access, I would like to learn more about the restrictions
    for accessing certain networks in certain countries and how VPN services are able
    to bypass in a certain these restrictions. For instance, why is certain media/content
    that is uploaded on say YouTube for example restricted in the Canada but say not
    the US? Another point I&#039;d like to know is how much  how much censorship is
    actually involved in a network that has a massive assortment of information at
    peoples access? how much information can we not see compared to the amount we
    do have access to?
- desc: I would like to know more about the different ways that information is collected,
    used, and distributed online, and what risks/rewards pertain to the collection
    of this information. Specifically, what is done to ensure the security of an individual&#039;s
    data? How is data managed so that it can be used in a way that is beneficial to
    both the individual and the company? I am very interested in how information is
    managed online, and how permanent online information is, such as a credit card
    number or transaction.
- desc: I really want to learn more about this project that is worth 25% of the class
    grade. It wasn&#039;t mentioned in class today and I noticed in the filters before
    when I was trying to find my group( as the groups were hidden before) that there
    were a bunch of double letter groups (CL, DF, EH, etc ). There were some single
    letter groups too so I&#039;m curious to see how that is organized in if the letter
    indicates a specific topic and double letters for the project are two topics that
    interact well with each other.
- desc: With the immense amount of information at our fingertips, no one is really
    safe as their privacy and data can be surfed by potential hackers and/or be stolen
    by identity thieves. I would like to learn more about how people can prevent their
    data from being breached and how/why hackers are able to break through firewall
    protection softwares.
- desc: After discussing the rewards of the information society, I am curious and
    interested to know more about the various ways we can cut down the risks of it.
    As we discussed some information society, now I am willing to find out some ways
    we can use data encryption and other security techniques to cut down the loss
    of privacy and data breach. One of the main reasons I chose Computer Science is
    to expand my knowledge about data hiding and cyber security, so in this semester
    I hope to get familiar with some such developed encryption methods and ideologies
    to make information society a safe and secure place to connect with people all
    around the globe.
- desc: "I\u2019d like to know more about how, as a society, our adoption of information\
    \ processing technology has aided or hindered human development. There are many\
    \ great rewards to using computers, yet I\u2019m curious as to the risks involved.\r\
    \n\r\nWe often treat our personal cellphones like libraries or repositories to\
    \ information that we don\u2019t necessarily need on hand at all times. In this\
    \ way, we treat our phones like a little second brain. With this, we have the\
    \ ability to offload certain information processing tasks to this second brain\
    \ of ours. How does this offloading behavior affect human development?"
- desc: What is information society? and who and what is the part of the information
    society?
- desc: I have taken this class as I&#039;m really interested in knowing the risks
    and rewards that are included in information technology. It is really important
    for an individual to know the risks that are involved while surfing in internet
    or any website as internet is very vulnerable place. Internet is also a place
    where one can benefit a lot so I&#039;d like to know more about these topics
- desc: I would like to know more about how different measures are put up to stop
    the risk of leaking personal information. With that, I would also like to learn
    about how people with malicious intent end up getting information, so that we
    can learn how to defend against it.
- desc: I would like to know more about the syllabus and the grading system of this
    class. I also want to know more about the topics that will be cover in this class.
- desc: I&#039;m sure we will be talking more about this in the future but I&#039;d
    like to know more about the project we have to do. Some of the key pieces of info
    are what the project is on (e.g. do we choose our own topic within the field of
    Information Society), its due date, if we have to do it in partners or individual,
    and the rubric for the project. If it is a research paper, then what is the format
    for it (is there any required formal formatting like APA or just any general research
    paper format), requirements for sources, and its estimated length.
- desc: Well, in my breakout room, we came up with more risks rather than rewards,
    so I want to learn more benefits about rewards in information society. Because
    the rewards I came up with are... easily accessible information, new info, and
    communication spreads way faster. While in the risks of info society, we came
    up with misleading info, data breaches, leakage of personal info (privacy), inappropriate
    content, scamming, catfishing, etc. So, all in all, I would like to learn more
    advantages of the rewards and how we benefit from the information society from
    around the world
- desc: I would like to learn more about ransomware as I personally have never had
    issues with this but have seen many videos online of people being exposed to it
    or trying to remove it from their own computers. It is a very relevant topic as
    new ransomware is still being developed.
- desc: The thing I would most like to know more about are exactly the risks and rewards
    in information society. The discussion today showed me that what I believe to
    be the biggest risks and rewards may not be what most people seem to think are
    the biggest risks or rewards. Given that society is constantly moving further
    and further into automation/smart technology the risks and rewards are only adding
    up as time goes and as such I would like to know more about them.
- desc: "I am curious about the meaning of \u201CInformation\u201D when we talk about\
    \ an \u201CInformation Society.\u201D I wonder what kinds of information this\
    \ consists of, if it means personal information or educational information, etc\
    \ . I want to know more about the global impact of an information society. For\
    \ instance, I want to know if such a society, which is founded upon the premise\
    \ that there is no privacy, can be considered ethical. Is there a different system\
    \ other than Capitalism in which the wide accessibility of information can survive?\
    \ In our discussion groups, it was mentioned that an Information Society has allowed\
    \ for technologies to become smarter, which can better people\u2019s lives. Realistically,\
    \ however, who will such technologies be able to reach?"
- desc: "The thing I would like to know more about in this class is the importance\
    \ of our privacy. This discussion is based on Dr. Hepting&#039;s example in today&#039;s\
    \ class-&amp;quot;Companies offering rewards such as a free large double-double\
    \ if a customer provides them their social insurance number or some other personal\
    \ information.&amp;quot; Such types of rewards (baits) are largely deployed by\
    \ organizations across the world to obtain valuable user information. Organizations\
    \ can use this information/data in numerous ways such as targeting particular\
    \ consumer segments for selling a product etc. It is not always necessarily used\
    \ with malicious intent but they control the information and can use it in whatever\
    \ way they want such as providing (selling) the user information to other companies.\
    \ \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I think it is crucial that we as individuals must have\
    \ some sort of awareness and understanding of our privacy and what impacts it\
    \ could have on our lives if we do not safeguard our privacy."
- desc: In todays class we discussed the potential risks and rewards of the information
    society. During the discussion in my group, although we had a general inference
    about what an information society was, we realized that we did not know what an
    information society was to the extent that we were able to describe what it was
    . I would also like to learn more about what is classified as information and
    what makes a society an information society.
- desc: The highlight of today&#039;s class was when everyone was discussing about
    the risks and rewards of information society. What I am more curious to study
    more, is to understand that does this information can be a risk or reward to the
    commercial side of the society. I mean all we know so far is it has risks to privacy
    for any individual or a company; and has reward to connect from the corners. But
    can this little piece of information capable to changing the way our economy works.
    For example, a rumour is also an information; may be not authenticate but an information.
    can this rumour turns to be a huge loss to anyone&#039;s or any company&#039;s
    reputation. In short, information has both risks and rewards, but upto what extent
    it can do the either one.
- desc: I think this is going to be interesting.. very excited for this subject as
    I am always keen to learn about pros and cons of information Society. Looking
    forward to next class.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture Dr. Hepting discussed the course information in detail.
    He also explained about the group work projects and also told us about what we
    have to do in this semester. We also discussed about the big risks and rewards
    which is the main topic of this course and It seems to be interesting Thus I would
    like to know more about that topic. I know it will be a great semester learning
    this course.
- desc: Today we made a light discussion about risks and rewards in the information
    society in breakout rooms. Further we may learn about how to avoid risks and know
    about more risks and rewards that we are not aware of yet, and that is the thing
    I would like to learn the most. We would also learn about rewards in detail so
    that we could make more use of it.
- desc: Informational society has become essential in the real world as they shape
    the ideas through which the world operates. I would like to learn more about how
    this affects our day to day lives and the future of mankind. I am also interested
    in going in depth about the risks and rewards that we are gaining through it.
- desc: "In what ways can risks in the form of data theft or data breaches be minimized?\r\
    \nWhat are some steps I can take now to limit my risk while online?\r\n\r\nOverall,\
    \ I&#039;m interested in learning about the history of the internet and the web\
    \ and the steps that have already been taken to make it more secure.\r\nI&#039;d\
    \ also like to learn about the ways a computer science major might find work in\
    \ web security."
- desc: I would like to learn more about what an information society is and what kinds
    of risks and rewards that exists in such a society. In class we discussed what
    some of the biggest risks and rewards were but most of those ideas were put forth
    by the students and we don&#039;t have an informed opinion. Thus, I would like
    to know more about the central premise of this class and what we will be learning
    in it.
- desc: The thing I would most like to know is what exacatly is the meaning of the
    risks and rewards in information society, there are many examples like malwares
    and accessibility of information, but what makes that so special, making people
    discussing about it.
- desc: I would like to hear more opinions about Information society
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discussed the risks and rewards of information and
    in the discussion we talked about how malwars could be a great risk to  information
    society. I would love to know further regarding this as I have been a victim of
    malware and I would love to how to prevent our systems from such malware attacks.
- desc: I would like to know more about the course related topics as things are still
    unclear for me that what we are going to study in the whole semester.
- desc: I found today&#039;s class discussion about the risks and rewards of information
    in our society to be interesting, and frankly quite eye-opening. From personal
    information being hacked to being able to connect with other people online, the
    use of information seems to now be a controversial topic as it reaps as many rewards
    as it does cause chaos. After our discussion, I am curious and now hoping that
    we are able to cover how information has been used for propaganda in recent current
    events, for example, how information has been distributed during the Coronavirus
    pandemic.
- desc: I would really like to know more about the risks that artificial intelligence
    technology poses to our information society (and society as a whole). It seems
    like an area of great potential however we probably have to be careful with how
    we proceed in developing and implementing it. What are the likely consequences
    if it is not regulated properly?
- desc: The thing I would like to know more about is Cybercrime. Cybercrime is an
    amazing topic to know more about, the criminal activities that either target or
    use a computer, a computer network or a networked device can be so dangerous for
    the users.  Also, to understand why the cybercriminals would hack users who are
    not involved in any serious organization or are not famous. Also, how do cybercriminals
    become organized, use advanced techniques and are highly technically skilled?
    How to overcome or identify people who are involved in this dangerous path. Understanding
    the ways to overcome the criminal could decrease the cases of attacks that happen
    against many innocent users and make the Internet a lot safer.
- desc: Personally I would like to know more about cyber security and about how certain
    websites are more protected than others and how they are more protected than others.
