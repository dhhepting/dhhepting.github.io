- desc: How oscar linked theclass. content..
- desc: What the final will look like. I am still a bit confused
important:
- desc: Computer professionals should make sure to do no harm with future projects,
    and the possibility that since the world relies on tech, computing professionals
    should have an oath like doctors.
- desc: I learned that we can make rate our group members on the upcoming assignment.
- desc: understanding why we ourselves chose to join computer science
- desc: what brought me into studying computer science is that it has vast job opportunities
    and is a secure and growing profession as per my opinion
- desc: In todays class we have discuss about
- desc: some people find the term divide and conquer offensive which i never considered
- desc: I got into computer science because I liked the satisfaction of building  something
    and having it work correctly. It is a lot of pressure for a CS professional to
    take on the responsibility of public good because there are so many different
    opinions and I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s possible to put that expectation on
    everyone.
- desc: As computing professionals we have many ethical responsibiliites.  We should
    consider the public good, do no harm, and uphold a certain standard of professionalism.
- desc: Today we talked about the importance of studying computer science. I think
    Computer Science is playing key role in every field.
- desc: Computing has space for both collaborative work and individual effort. Intellectual
    property may favor recent, incremental advances. Traditional knowledge is also
    important.
- desc: "One of the important discussions of topic was what brought you to Computer\
    \ Science. For me, the answer is quite simple: CS enables me for make creative\
    \ and logical solutions that would impact people\u2019s lives and CS gives a lot\
    \ of room for career advancement (hence personal financial advancement). The sense\
    \ of accomplishment and satisfaction that one feels when the program successfully\
    \ runs is incomparable."
- desc: Today I discovered how Computer science could be a blessing in disguise. Pursuing
    the subject can help us make telecommunication easier, get good jobs with/without
    a degree as the job opportunities are high. Computer science also has a creative
    aspect besides a variety of specializations. I chose this major because of the
    endless possibilities the field offers.
- desc: breaking the spell of silicon valley
- desc: To answer the question, of why I chose to study Computer Science, it is because
    my father recommended it to me. I also enjoyed programming when I was younger.
    I recently thought that maybe it is the degree for me. There are also countless
    opportunities in this field. Furthermore, as a future computer scientist, one
    of my responsibilities will be the creation and development of new products ,
    solving practical problems, and collaborating with other professionals as well.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, there was some good discussion regarding computer science
    studies. There are things related to it such as feeling of accomplishment once
    the task related to computer science is finished
- desc: I found our discussion regarding responsibilities for computing professionals
    to be very interesting.  I agree to an extent with ensuring that your work doesn&#039;t
    harm people, but I also believe there is another side to this.  For example, white
    hat hackers will hack corporations to ensure that someone malicious does not.  These
    tools will exist regardless, so these harmful tools can be helpful to protect
    others.
- desc: We talked about why we studied computer science. The reason I study computer
    science is because it suits my aptitude.
- desc: We talked about what brought people into computer science and some of the
    answers are job opportunities, career growth, and salary. Which I agree as it
    was also one of the reason I chose Computer Science.
- desc: Is about what our final exam format will be.
- desc: 'I learnt that sometimes, people go into studying Computer Science with the
    wrong motivations, which might end up disillusioning them in the future. With
    that said, there are still plenty of good reasons for pursuing CS as a career:
    stable income, flexibility, satisfaction when coding, etc.  Additionally, a CS
    professional holds many responsibilities because their software will be used by
    a lot of people. They must make sure that their software is safe and useable for
    diverse types of users.'
- desc: "\u2022\tThe most important thing I learned from today\u2019s lecture is the\
    \ benefits or reasons why people study computer science. We also discussed some\
    \ of the critical responsibilities of computing professionals. Professor informed\
    \ us that we now have an option to rate our group members if we\u2019d like to\
    \ give him some feedback about participation of each group member."
- desc: Today we have discussed about the study of computer science and discussed
    about everyone&#039;s perspective on choosing their carrier in computer science
    and we discussed all the advantages and benefits in the field. we also discussed
    the roles and responsibilities as computer engineers.
- desc: Thing that brought us together in computer science were passion for computing,
    money, creative aspects, career growth and since we are in digital age it is possible
    we can land a job without having a degree from university. Basically there are
    endless opportunities. With these opportunities we have responsibilities while
    developing new products and services and yhose services being ethical.
- desc: The responsibility you hold as a software engineer to a large pool of information
    both private and public.
- desc: Today I learned about the many benefits of being in computer science from
    job flexibility, work life balance and the fulfilment other computer scientists
    get from their ability to code
- desc: I learned my reasons for chasing a cs degree. I have always felt passionate
    about computer science, but I have never really bothered to analyze the root of
    my passion in the field. Today, I believe the main reasons for me pursuing a degree
    in computer science is to contribute to humanity and the most attainable way I
    believe I can do that using computer science. Additionally, I learned that we
    have responsibilities as cs professionals one of which is to do no harm. As cs
    professionals the common good of soc
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we have discussed experience of CS relate to the
    authors and what is the reason to study computer science. what are advantages
    of this field and all. Later on we have discussed about website assessment as
    well.
- desc: In todays class we discussed about the chapter 2 and professor asked experience
    while reading this chapter. Then we discussed what brought us to study in Computer
    Science. We had a discussion on that and we also got to know some people opinions
    on that. Then we discussed what are responsibilities of a person working in Computer
    science field. Then the professor discussed about Group Assessment, in which we
    added an option to rate your group members or if you like to give them feedback.
- desc: The discussion about what brought you to study computer science was so engaging
- desc: 'We discussed the question: what brought us to study computer science? briefly.
    We considered several reasons for choosing computer science as the major subject.
    We discussed the importance of computer science in today&#039;s era, and the responsibilities
    computer professionals have; we also talked about morals and principles an ideal
    computer professional should have.'
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture professor discussed and read Breaking the spell of
    silicon valley , as well as discussed was it dramatic?, How does our experience
    in CS relate to the authors, Unpaid work for greater good or not?
- desc: computer science is a blessed field. We take the advantage of the development
    of math, physical,... So our duty is to create a better society, support other
    fields, and care about the weaknesses of human&#039;s being.
- desc: today we learn that details will be talked about next week and some marks
    are updated (may not be visible yet. option to rate your group members if you
    like to give them feedback
- desc: We need to ensure that whatever technology we are using or planning to invent
    does do any harm to the humanity as it can become a serious issue
- desc: "Today\u2019s meeting started with attendance. After that professor told us\
    \ about the submission of grades that we have to give to our group members, which\
    \ seems to be fun and after that there was a discussion on assessment. And talked\
    \ about syllabus a little bit."
- desc: There is high demand for jobs, I didn&#039;t know that.
- desc: In todays class, we discussed and read about chapter 2. We also spoke about
    computer science, job opportunities, and many more.
- desc: After today&#039;s discussion, the most important thing that I learnt was
    just how important it is to honour prior work and contributions and to also understand
    that traditional knowledge is quite important in favour of those techniques that
    lead to very small advances.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is that computing is part of everything
    we do in our lives now! Expertise in computing enables you to solve complex, challenging
    problems we are facing now. Also, Computing enables you to make a positive difference
    in the world. Computing jobs are here to stay, regardless of where you are located.
    Expertise in computing helps you even if your primary career choice is something
    else. Computing offers great opportunities for true creativity and innovativeness.

- desc: For me when stack with the program it will be very plainful, even when you
    finally success build the program it will still have many kinds of problem
know-more:
- desc: The thing about which I would like to know more is the final exam
- desc: The thing from todays lecture that I would most like to know more about is
    what are the responsibilities of a computer programmer. What programs would I
    develop to solve practical problems? What are the problems that need to be solved?
    How do I go about doing such a thing?
- desc: Why has a job in the Comp Sci field become so desired?
- desc: I would like to know more about the final exam and what the format, length,
    time limit etc will be like
- desc: Should software engineering have a more &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; organization?
    There is a lot of pressure nowadays with applying professional engineering principles
    to computer science. While they have always existed before issues regarding important
    concepts like data privacy are becoming more apparent while at the same time you
    have people who might not be as caring of those ideals when they choose the field
    for simply.the prospects. Would an official licensing help prevent engineering
    oversights with programming?
- desc: Today we talked about that we can mark our group members due to the work they
    done
- desc: As technology advances, will AI ever take over computer professionals jobs?
- desc: I&#039;m interested in learning more about the group assignment. I&#039;m
    planning to work on it tonight and I am mostly doing an outline of how I want
    to complete the assessment. I have to go through and read the assignment over
    once more to make sure that I know what I&#039;m doing. I think the hardest part
    will be coordinating the members of my group together and assembling all our work
    into one cohesive whole.
- desc: I would like to know if there are any groups working towards making an ethical
    oath for computer science professionals? I think it would be beneficial to outline
    the ethics computer scientists should have and I wonder if anyone is working towards
    making a standard code.
- desc: I want to know more about the collaborative aspects of computing
- desc: Why a decent amount of employees in the past (primarily in the 80s and 90s)
    in Silicon Valley kept choosing to work for their company if they had to work
    long overtime often and didn&#039;t get paid for it. Unless there weren&#039;t
    many jobs still for CS that they wanted/could do, I would have imagined the amount
    of stress and lack of free time would not be worth it.
- desc: As a future computing professional, I&#039;m going down the Computer Science
    path, and I wanted to learn more about future jobs, like what are my other options
    and what path resonates with me the most. I guess what I&#039;m worried and stressed
    about is what is in store for me after I graduate? What are my responsibilities
    as a computing professional when working?
- desc: Today I learned and would like to know more about we can see the stirrings
    of this in the growth of startups that are profit-driven but have social purpose
    at their core, the battle for millennial talent being driven by the need of a
    generation to spend their working lives doing something meaningful, and the concrete
    steps being taken by companies like Google DeepMind to actively engage with third
    parties in shaping the technologies that will power the businesses of the future.
    Language can be used to recal
- desc: I need to know more about the news came out two days before about the feds
    outline plan in 2030 cutting down 40 percent of emissions cut
- desc: Breaking the spell of Silicon Valley
- desc: Using computers to solve problems is a powerful motivator. But where do we
    draw the line after which we should not indulge further in the computer science
    field. There must be some restrictions to what we are building at some point in
    the future.
- desc: I would like to know more about how code can be made usable by many different
    people who use different languages.
- desc: in what circumstance, people thought that they need to make a rule of responsbility
    of using computer
- desc: The thing that I would like to know  more is why people study computer science
    and responsibilities such as developing that does not harm society and it should  be
    public good how can we decide for example (tinder it used as social media and
    some people such to scam people for example  tinder swindler( a case of three
    people getting involved in scam? how can we see it whether it is good for public
    or not?
- desc: What would a Hippocratic oath for computing professionals look like? This
    is an industry unlike many others that offers members the ability to change the
    world - in good ways and bad. As such, if computing professionals had to swear
    an oath to do no harm, what would that look like exactly?
- desc: I would like to know more about our final exam.
