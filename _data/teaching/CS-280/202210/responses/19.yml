difficult:
- desc: if deep fake technology continuelly is being aboused and used for negative
    purposes much more than postive, why has it not been banned and removed from people
    being able to use it.
- desc: I don&#039;t seem to understand the reason people decide to commit unethical
    actions such as giving out private information on either random citizens or people
    in some sort of power or so. Being a software professional, one should have the
    ethical code they stand by when performing the duties of a professional both during
    working hours and off. I am learning a good amount of information in this class
    relating to this and I am looking forward to the rest of the class.
- desc: Still, I&#039;m not able to understand what to do in critique.
- desc: The most difficult thing for me that I learned about risk and reward in IT
important:
- desc: we need to understand how to organize things so that it doesnt get over complicated
- desc: What deepfakes truly are
- desc: deep fake and final suggestion.
- desc: "I really liked the poem &amp;quot;First they came \u2026&amp;quot; and like\
    \ the message behind it"
- desc: todays class was very interesting as the professor explained the crutique
    and extended its due date and the prof also discussed about the deep fake as well
    as viral news regarding war between Russia and Ukraine and how Canada is involved
    in it.
- desc: Today we practiced critical thinking.  Deep fake videos may seem convincing
    but that only underlines the importance of careful fact checking.  Only by fact
    checking such as looking for broad agreeance from other sources can we detect
    these kinds of things.
- desc: Today we talked about Deep Fakes, the video that has been manipulated to spread
    false  information. I think it is very important to differentiate the fake videos
    from real as we see it has been widely using in Ukraine Conflict.
- desc: "Videos that are fabricated (fake) but looks very convincing. For example,\
    \ someone modified/created a video of Ukraine\u2019s president surrendering even\
    \ though he never said that."
- desc: The most important thing I learned was more about deep fakes and how they
    can be used. I think the topic is very important to society today
- desc: Today, we discussed about the final test in this class, and we are willing
    to recommend the type of questions on the final.
- desc: about the next assignment
- desc: Today&#039;s technological advancements never cease to amaze me. Especially
    we now have access to AI&#039;s to portray people and produce something fake.
    For instance, the CBC article that our professor showed us in class today. Someone
    created and modified a video of Ukraine&#039;s president allegedly surrendering
    when he did not. People could easily believe that and might cause opinions to
    rise. Pretty sure it is hard to figure out if a video is deep fake.
- desc: deep fake videos are fabricated video that look very real
- desc: In today&#039;s class, the professor told us more about the final exam. He
    gave information about the format and pattern of the exam and that it will be
    a take-home exam. There was also an interesting discussion today about deep fakes.
    People using deep fakes to spread misinformation throughout social media is an
    alarming sign. We discussed how AI should be upgraded to detect these types of
    deep fakes and stop the spreading of misinformation.
- desc: I liked learning about and think about what are fallacies. It was important
    to be able to connect it to computer programming as well.
- desc: We talked about deepfake. And we talked about whether it is practical to select
    fake news through AI. And we talked about the dangers of errors.
- desc: According to our discussion, I think that deep fakes could be potentially
    dangerous in our society. Like, sure, we can use them for entertainment purposes
    and such. But if more people are creating false advertisement in the world, then
    it will be harder to distinguish real from fake. It can cause harmful controversy
    like the how to fake Zelensky video showing that he was surrendering. Was the
    intention to satisfy the public good?
- desc: "We learned about how to write blog critique submissions and also got some\
    \ guidance on how we can start working on the website assessment assignment. We\
    \ also briefly discussed about the Final exam. Apart from this, I am interested\
    \ in learning more about the \u2018Deep Fakes\u2019 and the technology used to\
    \ create such content. The discussion on the Fallacy of Misplaced &amp;quot;concreteness&amp;quot;\
    \ was something new to me and I found it interesting."
- desc: Today I have learned about deep fakes, how fake video&#039;s looks very convincing
    and we discussed about the Dr hepting&#039;s class, how a student modified/created
    a video of Ukraine&#039;s president surrendering even though he never said. we
    discussed about using AI to evaluate fake news.
- desc: Use of deep fakes had been used for a long time. I got to know that these
    deep fakes are basically used from previous footage to recreate a fake one. It
    was used for Obama, Hillary Clinton and recently it was used to imitate President
    Zelensky to influence the war with Ukraine. As I learned from today&#039;s lecture
    that AI us used to recreate a fake face speaking fake news.
- desc: Today I learned the term &amp;quot;Deep Fake&amp;quot;. I would like to know
    more about how often deep fakes are used and how often I night see it without
    recognizing it
- desc: Today I learned about deepfake. They are videos, images or audio that are
    fabricated but look very convincing. The deepfake technology is used transparently
    in movies. However, it could be used with malicious intent by parties looking
    to promote their self-interest. There are technologies and methods used in detecting
    deepfakes, but they are not common practice. An example of deepfake used recently
    is the war between Russia and Ukraine. There was a video being circulated In mass-media
    that supposedly showed
- desc: In Today&#039;s meeting, we have discussed blog critique and web assessment.
    Later on prof has discussed about Finale exam tentative plan. We also discussed
    about Deep Fakes like what protection we have against them and how we maintain
    our connection to reality.
- desc: In todays lecture professor discussed about the Blog Critique writing and
    also provided the list of the people who wrote the blogs and told mark one of
    those. Also he mentioned about the Web assessment assignment and told that he
    will discuss about that further. Also professor discussed what is Humane and wanted
    the critiques to based on it. In todays lecture main topic was Deep fakes. He
    explained what are deep fakes and what we measures we can take to save ourselves
    from that.
- desc: There has been a lot of discussions in the groups about the topic given in
    the meeting. However, the most important thing that I would give more importance
    to learn is to understand that the research into the topic has a depth. To carry
    on studies on it and prove various aspects right about internet is well appreciated.
    Moreover, the main aim is to understand that the thing to note more on
- desc: I just check out some deep fake videos and they are so real. Is there any
    tech/method we can use to find out a video is fake or not? Nowadays, younger people
    posts selfie of themselves on social media without worrying  about the protential
    risk. It&#039;s a good recourses for people who want to use deep fake technology
    to harm other.
- desc: Today the due date of blog critique was extended. We discussed about videos
    that looks convincing but are actually fake. Many examples were given for it,
    and need to establish necessary measures to tackle this problem was also demanded.  Criteria
    for website assessment was also given.
- desc: The meeting started with attendance and professor told us that the submission
    date for critique extended to 28 March. Their was also some discussions on AI
    are limited. After that we discussed on a page about digital currency donations
    for freedom convoy evading seizure by authorities.
- desc: the way to against deep fake is to find source or references of presented
    video
- desc: The most important thing that I learned will be about deep fakes ( videos
    that are fake but looks very convincing) and after going through in internet it
    mostly used in porn industry and ad agency . In ad agency it is very good form
    the point of small business you get promotion from the actor ? and this will also
    lead into misinformation and issue of copyrights etc..
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about deep fakes. Professor has also showed
    us an example that someone has created Ukrainians president requesting to surrender
    even though he never said that.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is about the drawbacks of AI, Deep
    Fake, is used when a AI program  has been coded the person&#039;s face with another
    video. This can cause many fake, misleading and unethical information&#039;s that
    will Causes harm or destroy the reputation of someone.
- desc: learning about the final was good to know
- desc: It is impossible to use AI to check the news is fake or not, because human
    still can find a way to make Ai to believe the news is truth. Human as the controller
    of the AI, is much clever than the AI, and more possibllity
know-more:
- desc: Do younger people trust videos less, given that they&#039;ve grown up where
    deepfakes are somewhat common?
- desc: The thing that I want to know more about from today&#039;s lecture is Ukraine&#039;s
    president being deep faked and made to look like he surrendered. How does someone
    go about deep faking? How was behind this incident of deep faking? What is the
    punishment for this kind of thing?
- desc: Reification (also known as concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of
    misplaced concreteness) is a fallacy of ambiguity, when an abstraction (abstract
    belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete real event
    or physical entity.
- desc: Can deep fakes be used for positive benefit? The usage behind deep fakes seems
    malicious. It&#039;s used to defraud people&#039;s images and damage others&#039;
    reputations based upon fabricated evidence. Even in cases where there isn&#039;t
    any political motivation behind such as with use in the film industry, you still
    distort what is there. The entertainment in films using it disassembles the boundaries
    between what is fake and what is real. Is the entertainment value really positive
    when you are degrading people&#039;s truth?
- desc: What other technology is the Russian military using to sabotage president
    Zelensky?
- desc: How UN decision impacts developing countires
- desc: How to ethically combat deepfakes.  With machine learning approaches to deepfakes,
    by creating better methods to find deepfakes, the quality of the deepfakes directly
    improve.  Is it necessary for researchers to make their research more difficult
    for others to implement?  Is there some sort of watermark that needs to be included?  What
    is the best way to combat deepfakes?
- desc: The issues, and the arguements for and against deep fake
- desc: How wide spread are deep fakes going to be in the near future with more advancements
    of machine learning and AI? Soon videos are going to be something that we will
    have to consistently fact check just like any other information online. The saying
    &amp;quot;seeing is believing&amp;quot; won&#039;t apply anymore if the deep fakes
    are get good enough.
- desc: I would like to know more about how AI is used to elevate the progression
    of technology
- desc: Impact of deepfakes in pre-recorded political videos.
- desc: The Misplaced Concreteness fallacy we learnt about today sounded very interesting.
    I think we didn&#039;t get to explore its connection to AI as much because we
    ran short of time, but I&#039;d love to know more about it. Additionally, I&#039;d
    like to know more about other hypothetical solutions to the misinformation problem,
    especially stuff related to an actual software that a person could use. It&#039;s
    interesting to think about a software that could somehow evaluate its level of
    truthfullness or fallaciousness.
- desc: I would most like to know more about the structure of the Final exam and how
    it&#039;s going to work.
- desc: "In todays lecture we talked about programming a computer an AI to identify\
    \ human bias in writing essentially means teaching it how to read. But reading\
    \ itself is a complex mental process that scientists don\u2019t fully understand,\
    \ and artificial intelligence is only as smart as the programming and data that\
    \ supports it."
- desc: I want to know more about deep fakes and how AI can be used to detect fallacies.
- desc: We talked about the deep fake videos, and how harmful and misleading they
    can be. We also considered how we can we use AI to analyze and track down this
    deep fake videos. This topic seemed interesting to me; I would like to know more
    about it.
- desc: What would be the right way to develop technology?
- desc: What does a template for the web critique look like?
- desc: I would like to know more about deep fakes especially what sort of things
    they are being used for and what things they can do. I also want to know what
    methods we have that can be used to identify these deep fakes and tell them apart
    from actual images.
- desc: I want to know more about the final exam .
- desc: I found our discussion on cryptocurrency assets being seized to be quite interesting
    and something I would like to discuss further as this technology is quite foreign
    to me and knowing the risks and rewards of this would be quite beneficial in the
    long run. As to my knowledge, trying to claim your cryptocurrency debt has been
    quite a struggle for collectors and that is something that we could potentially
    discuss further.
- desc: How do we control deep fake technology? It has a lot of positives going for
    it, especially for use in things like movies and TV shows. However when the audience
    isn&#039;t aware of the &#039;deception&#039; it could be used for a lot of very
    bad things. How do we make it so the public is aware/can spot these fakes before
    they cause some real damage?
