difficult:
- desc: I don&#039;t seem to understand the reasons individuals decide to take part
    in information theft, giving away people&#039;s private information even thought
    it might be for a huge amount of money, it is still a stupid act which in my opinion
    is just sad.
- desc: I had sum technical issues with Zoom so could not hear properly.
important:
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in the class today is that the due
    date of the blog post got moved back to Wed. Mar. 9, and that there would be an
    example of how to setup the blog and how to properly cite and answer the source
    questions.
- desc: Our group believed that the best way to combat disinformation could only be
    achieved through long term solutions such as proper scientific education. Short
    term solutions are the wrong approach, and will only lead to more arguments.
- desc: how hard it is to come up with a solution to stop disinformation
- desc: A lot of misuse of information happens on the internet so the responsibility
    of the platform host is to prevent the spread of it. Here the technology comes
    in action and acts as a firewall so that the spread should be prevented and necessary
    precautions are taken.
- desc: etail of bolg.
- desc: I agree that education is the (or atleast part of the) solution to combat
    disinformation
- desc: I learned about blockchain during the breakout room.  We discussed how it
    is permanent and you can tell who exactly is posting.  This allows people to easily
    trace back credibility and could potentially lead to better monitoring of credibility
    and sources.  You can only ever add to the chain.  I&#039;ll have to look more
    into this when he posts his blog/assignment about it.
- desc: 'Today we talked about &amp;quot;Technology&amp;quot;  role in combatting
    disinformation in breakout rooms. I think the technology is making disinformation
    available to our society while combatting on the other side, example: social media,
    news sites.'
- desc: The role of technology in combatting disinformation is to identify false information
    and timely deletion to prevent proliferation.
- desc: Technology companies should invest in tools that identify fake news, reduce
    financial incentives for those who profit from disinformation, and improve online
    accountability. Educational institutions should make informing people about news
    literacy a high priority. Individuals should follow a diversity of news sources,
    and be skeptical of what they read and watch. Governments should promote news
    literacy and strong professional journalism in their societies.
- desc: today we talked about the blog we are working on
- desc: The elaborate discussion about the blog entry made the students more confident
    and open about their works. Students could have a clear idea of what prof is expecting
    from them on the blog entry. It is essential to have a detailed discussion about
    the assignment contents during a class.
- desc: I feel like technology is just a gateway for disinformation to happen. Nowadays,
    with the help of the internet and social media, people can easily spread false
    information. With just one click, it can reach people which may cause others to
    believe it. We should worry about it since there will be people who might believe
    it and spread it further. It can also alter someone&#039;s opinion about a certain
    topic. Lastly, anyone who has access to the internet can be responsible for disinformation.
- desc: I talked about the group assignment with my team members. We talked about
    what topic to choose recently about the war between Russia and Ukraine.
- desc: the Internet plays a role in combatting misinformation because the news and
    newspapers can be influence by the government
- desc: With technology, it is easier to spread information whether it is credible
    or not. Due to globalization, there is controversy on the spread of global media,
    because they provide info on news or situations around the world without really
    being in the local environment. So, yes, we need to worry about the spread of
    misinformation through technology, because everyone is responsible. Everyone is
    on social media. So with important news, fact check or blockchain is needed to
    identify if the source is true or not
- desc: Was how technology impacts what misinformation we are exposed to.
- desc: 'Regarding misinformation, it&#039;s difficult to try and weigh a heavier
    responsibility on just one party. Everyone has an equal responsibility. For instance,
    schools (like high schools or elementary schools) should guide students in identifying
    more reliable sources of information. As for the designers: putting people into
    bubbles through the algorithm puts a filter on someone&#039;s reality, which can
    only validate misinformation. Ultimately, we want to avoid an Orwellian situation,
    I think.'
- desc: Today I learned about how technology play role in combatting disinformation,
    we need to worry about it as it is going to effect us in so many ways as we blindly
    believe these days. we can also see how there are are many false information spread
    on the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We can try to prevent it by
    making algorithms which detects false information and removes them from web..
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is some ways that technology can
    help tackle misinformation. Misinformation is a cause for concern because false
    information can be used to make larges groups of people act in a particular way
    to promote self-interest. Technology can be used to trace false information through
    background checks and origins checks. Notifying the public about the falsehood
    of information will help create awareness of the prevalence of misinformation
    and help people filter more thoroughl
- desc: In the breakout rooms, we concluded a point where we are have to be self responsible
    for the information we get from Social media, or any technological based information.
    We have to filter out what is correct and what is false.
- desc: Today, we have discussed about the assignments that professor is going to
    post how to do and all. Later on we have breakout session about the technology
    that helps us to support of our work. And also about what is the combatting disinformation
    of that technology.
- desc: To be wary of information that we read. As technology advances, it can act
    as a sort of firewall to filter out information. It can also act as a shield against
    disinformation. At the same time it is the person who is viewing the information
    ho is responsible to fact check the information that they are reading. The host
    should also fact check the information that they hold on their website.
- desc: AI can be used to combat disinformation. So, if we can develop a AI-based
    scanner that read all information from the users on social media website, it can
    be used to ban user&#039;s posts before they harm someone.
- desc: Check out the web-based group discussion forum in the &amp;quot;Assignments&amp;quot;
    section of the UR course to find your group for web-based assignments. Also I
    watched the video given by the instructor on the hacking of Russia
- desc: Today again mr.heptins extended the due date more for two days. It was very
    thankful for him to do so. We also discussed important topics in the breakout
    rooms as well related to our course.
- desc: Dr. Happening wore a zoom friendly shirt. He got banned from Twitter. Event
    is coming up on facebook. We learned out group discussions information.
- desc: I learned more about the assignments that I will have to accomplish for the
    future. This includes changes to their due dates and their descriptions.
- desc: Technology can play assistant role in combating disinformation
- desc: We discussed how technology can play a role in combatting disinformation.
    I learnt that the platform that posts the information should have the responsibility
    to filter the false information and also the person viewing it should have the
    knowledge weather the information is false or true.
- desc: That determining how technology can confront misinformation isn&#039;t a straightforward
    question. This is because it&#039;s really hard to determine who&#039;s responsibility
    it is to do so. Is it the tech companies? Government? Individuals? Or group though
    it really fell on all parties to have a plan to address it. So tech companies
    should continue to label misinformation but people also need to be able to spot
    it on their own.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is that Technology has altered
    the normal workplace and has become a huge part of our daily life. People want
    the most up-to-date technology, whether it&#039;s the newest smartphone or the
    newest automobile model. We should improve our professional technology if we are
    continuously updating our personal technology. Technology in the workplace is
    critical for a company&#039;s smooth and effective operation.
- desc: I found the discussions regarding the blog entry to be very helpful.
- desc: technongy such as phylon can use analyze large amount information some company
    use that to send the users the adds that conation fake information. It is legally
    but if we can be aware of that it is not a problem
know-more:
- desc: I would like to better understand the tradeoff that technology causes with
    respect to misinformation. Clearly, technology allows for a great deal of information
    to flow to nearly anybody, yet it can cause considerable misinformation. Given
    that, prior to technology, access to both information and misinformation was much
    more limited, is the general public still better off due to technology?
- desc: It&#039;s a tough debate to decide who is responsible for misinformation.
    I would say that its always the individuals job to fact check and make sure what
    they are reading is correct but it would be easier to start from the source and
    eliminate learning misinformation. But we cannot control people opinions on things
    and skeptical thoughts.
- desc: I&#039;d like to learn more about how tech. can impact our communication and
    how that can play into either our detriment or benefit.
- desc: Where is the fine line between stoping disinformaiton and censorship? If we
    can utilize technology help stop the spread but what do you call disinformation
    in the first place? Does a fact need to be certified and have some type of proof
    behind it in order to be considered information? How can a system be implemented
    so that people are allowed to have freedom of speech but not be responsible for
    spreading misinformation to people?
- desc: How can AI deal with disinformation?
- desc: data and privacy
- desc: I would like to know more about what other people think that web technologies
    should be in charge of in terms of stopping misinformation. I definitely think
    technology should have more responsibility with stopping misinformation but I&#039;d
    like to know what specifically should be done.
- desc: I would have loved to have heard more responses from the group discussions.  It&#039;s
    very interesting to discuss who and what need to be responsible for disinformation,
    and what measures need to be taken to ensure that this filtration isn&#039;t biased.
- desc: For the question whose responsibility is it in combating disinformation, I
    am not really sure if it&#039;s the person needing the information to make sure
    to fact check it or the technology. I feel like it&#039;s the person&#039;s responsibility
    to make sure the information it need is right, but at the same time the technology
    should also be making sure the information its providing is right. So, I&#039;m
    not too sure whose responsibility is it.
- desc: In the modern  world, technology is being used at a vast scale to create disinformation.
    I would like to know more about how technology can be used to combat disinformation.
    We all commonly use social media such as Facebook, Twitter etc. and these platforms
    are notoriously famous for misleading information or disinformation. One thing
    that I believe can help in combating disinformation is use of blockchain technology
    to track the processes and information and provide transparency to the users.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture, Prof talked about source I want to know more and
    more about source , like how it is used in information technology.
- desc: I am more interested in knowing the fact about the Russian&#039;s invasion
    on ukraine and its a topic of interest nowadays this is what that should stop
    and there should be no world war
- desc: How does technology change the way we think?
- desc: How does AI algorithms stops amplification of disinformation on social media.
