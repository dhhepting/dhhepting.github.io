difficult:
- desc: I struggle to understand why some would prefer a minority/LGBT &#039;visibility&#039;
    policy rather than a meritocracy. It feels almost patronizing, as it assumes intervention
    is necessary to achieve visibility, which is clearly not true.
- desc: Why there is so much racial/gender bias in Computing Profession. The gap of
    male and female computing professionals is quite noteworthy.
- desc: Is it possible to design a program that is free from biases? Big part of being
    more diverse and inclusive when it comes to the hiring process is removing that
    element of human bias. AI models needs to be built from preexisting data. if their
    is already precovecied notions in the workplace of bias, how can AI overcome it?
    Also this AI would have to pinpoint equalitive outcomes to. If there are two equally
    valued resumes, would it be as biased to pick one based on diversity just because
    their work lacks it?
- desc: Something that is difficult for me to understand is how to best approach intersectionality
    in our society. Intersectionality is a topic of great debate and I find myself
    lost in the middle at times. At first, looking at it at face value seemed simple,
    although after more discussion, I find it clear that is a broad and complex issue.
    I admit that I am not fully equipped to speak intelligently on this matter, so
    I have not much in the way of arguments in favor or against methods to enhance
    equity in society.
- desc: As we were talking about the importance of queer visibility in STEM, I agree
    with most students in the class that prejudiced minds (silent racism) is causing
    for the government to create policies for inclusion. However, some companies are
    rather using these policies for the use of representation rather than merit. What
    I want don&#039;t understand is how people can&#039;t just have an open mind and
    release their biases towards certain genders, sexual orientation, or cultures;
    and just hire accordingly.
- desc: Why women don&#039;t chose STEM fields? Is it because they don&#039;t feel
    welcome or is it because they are interested? Merit is often defined by people
    who have received the most success in a company or freedom in a field.
important:
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is that how women have the fear of
    pursuing a degree into STEM due to others questioning their abilities
- desc: The different opinions on diversity quotas and how people perceive them.
- desc: the guidelines of googles snippets were very direct, however, we are left
    to google&#039;s moral compass in what is right and wrong as they remove some
    topics from being searched about and also remove apps or search results if asked
    by a goverment to
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in the lecture today is how Google&#039;s
    featured snippets works, how they are selected and the policies around them. Its
    important to know how you are getting the results for what you are searching.
- desc: Google doesn&#039;t show false information in search results
- desc: I learned that people do not like to hear opposing viewpoints to their held
    beliefs.
- desc: Is that you can see how a search engine tries to give you the best results
    based on your experience with it
- desc: About the discrimination that happens within the tech field as the ratio of
    men and women have vast difference and also women are being questioned on their
    abilities and skills.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss about Class Gender Quality and we go through
    some great examples like Grace Hopper who put contribution in making COBOL, Lisa
    Su is CEO of Advanced Micro Devices. We also discuss about Jordan Peterson video
    in that he mention that women and men are different in two things one is biological
    and second is cultural.
- desc: gogle
- desc: Today I learned that many women don&#039;t feel welcome in computer science.  This
    was news to me as no one I am exposed to is very sexist and so I fundamentally
    don&#039;t understand why a woman would consider herself incapable of doing computer
    science because of her gender.  We discussed that this idea is often implanted
    in them by society and hypothesized that that explains why only 20% of the computer
    science workforce is female.  We discussed methods of increasing representation
    of women such as hiring practice
- desc: Everyone is equal. Women also can make a great contribution in STEM. One of
    the representative is Grace Hopper (women in Computer Science). Behind the development
    of COBOL, she is one of the earliest standardized computer languages, and also
    created the first compiler.
- desc: "The riveting topic of discussion in today\u2019s meeting was related to women\
    \ and LGBTQ representation in STEM. I think that we must not forget why the quotas\
    \ were implemented in the first place. These communities have not been encouraged\
    \ to participate in STEM because of the orthodox rigid mindset of people in charge\
    \ and the fact that they won\u2019t be provided the equal opportunities to advance\
    \ their career based on their identity. Blind screening and interviewing process\
    \ based on  merit is a better option."
- desc: Today we learned who decides what information is important to us to find on
    google. Prof walked us through how google handles its snippets. Google&#039;s
    algorithms are the actual gatekeepers of information that decide which information
    is important to show up on google searches and which one is not. There are certain
    policies of google that have to be fulfilled for information to be uploaded there
    for people to view.
- desc: Google snippets are like previews of the website. They often show short information
    about what you&#039;ve searched. In addition, when you click on the google snippet&#039;s
    link, it will often jump to the previewed information and it will be highlighted.
    Moreover, snippets will help people find what they are seeking.
- desc: Society has changed a lot since it started and we need to change with it
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is that there is discourse about if
    inclusivity programs are helping or hurting the groups of people and work places.
    It helps individuals get entry to jobs they may not have been able to get otherwise
    but does this cause the individual to be more discriminated against in the workplace
    as people feel they have been given an unfair advantage.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, I was able to know my friends&#039; thoughts and professors&#039;
    thoughts on gender equality.
- desc: That diversity encouragement programs for companies were created to benefit
    minority groups to help breakdown the barriers of entry for minorities. However,
    they can sometimes hurt them due to people questioning whether they were actually
    qualified for the position, which creates new issues.
- desc: Is that there may still exist a gender inequality in workplaces.
- desc: The thing I learned today is that a lot of water was used to make the Olympic
    in Beijing. We discussed about Wikipedia, Google, Lisa SU. Changed project proposal
    date. We discussed about Stem, equity and diversity.
- desc: Today I have learned many things, like how google search engines works, googles
    featured snippets work, and we had also discussed on many topics like amount of
    water used to make snow in Beijing for winter Olympics, I was surprised by the
    answer as it was 49 million gallons. I wasn&#039;t aware of Grace Hopper, she
    was involved in the creation of UNIVAC, the first electronic digital computer
    and she was also behind the development of COBOL, it was one of the earliest standardized
    computer language.
- desc: I didn&#039;t learn this, I already stand by this. Equal rights for all!
- desc: Learnt how some certain communities are viewed just because people don&#039;t
    agree or feel the same so they choose to treat them poorly. The importance of
    google and google search, helping people around the world seeking answers to various
    questions and just those interested in gaining knowledge for free without the
    need of living one&#039;s home. Learnt about the history of one of the earliest
    computer languages created by a woman in computer science.
- desc: the most important thing I learned today was that the fact that corporations
    are purposefully looking for visible minorities to hire is in fact encouraging
    or emphasizing discrimination. it can make others wonder if you were hired because
    you can do the job or if it was because your part of a marginalized group. I would
    like to know more about the different ways and methods that are being used to
    combat this issue, specifically using tech aside from IA.
- desc: I learned that biases exist in the population of computer scientists relative
    to the world demographics. There are policies to help mitigate this gap, also
    the government tries to create awareness to the presence of the inequality in
    industries in society. Additionally, I learned how google makes use of snippets.
    There are policies in place to ensure that snippets meet documented criteria.
    However, there is no way to verify the level of implementation by google.
- desc: Today, we have discussed about the Queer Visibility of STEM. We also discussed
    about the transparency of google search and like how their featured snippets work.
    we had a pool about snippet of Google&#039;s meeting standard on it or not.
- desc: In today lecture we discussed about the huge amount if water used in Beijing
    Winter Olympics and also discussed about the google snippets and its polices.
    The main discussion of the class was &#039;The Importance of Queer Visibility
    of STEM (Science Technology Engineering Math)&#039; this led to the racial and
    sexual discrimination at work places. According to some people women&#039;s are
    not treated fairly at work place. This are the somethings which got to learned
    in todays class.
- desc: "The most important think I learned is about how google works ..i always wondered\
    \ how does it comes up with this accurate and relatable results but now I know\
    \ . Thank you for today\u2019s class sir."
- desc: I learn most important thing in today&#039;s meeting that amount of water
    being used in winter Olympics is just to gigantic.I always wondered that why waste
    this much water when you could actually use that to help those who really need
    it .
- desc: The most important thing i learned today is beijing used large amount of water
    to make snow for winter olympics. today&#039;s important topic was the discussion
    on STEM(Science Technology Engineering Math) then the important topic was the
    google search and snippet policies. the important topic was on the LGBTQ equality
    and diversity. The discussion was on the gender equality as grace hopper had achieved
    a significant position in computer science by developing cobol. the important
    discussion was on the project pr
- desc: I came across a lot of new ideas today. We talked about Winter Olympics that
    is happening in Beijing, and how they used a lot of water to make artificial snow.
    Someone also raised a good point of holding such events at the places where there
    is natural snow, so in that way we can save a lot of water. We also talked about
    silent racism that happens almost everywhere. The reasons behind it and various
    ways to deal with it. I believe that the main cause behind this silent racism
    is prejudiced mindset.
- desc: Visibility of minorities in STEM should be discussed more. Representation
    and participation in STEM of such minorities and why it should be spoken about
    more. And while discussing about it, said minorities should be involved in the
    discussion as well. Learning about people like Lisa Su and Grace Hoper can also
    encourage minorities.
- desc: The most important thing I have learnt today is how google search works and
    types of features it provides the user to make their work more easier.
- desc: Today we discussed abstracts. Abstracts come from snippets of your web content,
    which are extremely relevant to the search content. The aim is to provide a quick
    solution for searchers. Currently, the main form of the presentation is text-based,
    not excluding the possibility of images and short videos, which means that Baidu
    Featured Abstracts have a significant role in keyword optimization rankings. When
    you want to learn more about the relevant content, you can access the original
    text given in the Baidu
- desc: i learned about the obstacle for certain groups of people in their way to
    succeeded in the tech industry.
- desc: In the beginning, we discussed the representation of minorities in this field
    should be based on merits or not. Then we talked about women not choosing the
    field of computer science is due to its difficulty level or they are not allowed
    to do so. At last, we compared many search results related to covid with that
    of Google and had a conversation about that.
- desc: In todays meeting we discussed and In my view it is humans that change the
    way of thinking and not an AI.
- desc: In todays meeting we discussed that a large amount of water is used in winter
    Olympic to make snow in Beijing. And we also discussed about project proposal
    and also told to inform professor as soon as possible for group members. The professor
    also told us to watch &amp;quot;Stranger than Fiction Case Studies in Software
    Engineering Judgement&amp;quot; by Steve McConnell for next meeting.
- desc: The important thing I learned today is about stem and how it works and discussions
    about lack of qualified  graduates to work in high tech jobs
- desc: Google has an asked questions section that I didn&#039;t know about until
    now.
- desc: I loved the concept how google search engine and its snippets works. And hope
    to learn similar stuff in the future lessons.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we discussed about LGBTQ representation on equity,
    diversity, and inclusion in STEM due to prejudiced minds (silent) racism. We also
    discussed about the project. Professor has extended the time till Feb 18th. Thanks.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned unfortunately is that silent racism
    and prejudice against minorities still exist in the work field against LGBTQ and
    women. I also learned that we do have to stand up for the minorities and help
    them to be equal like other people who are in the work field. I also learned that
    sexual orientation and race must not be something to judge or to be a qualification
    on the person who has applied to STEM. We should also encourage women to get involved
    more in STEM and prohibit
- desc: The discussion regarding google searches was pretty interesting to take in,
    learned a lot of new things.
- desc: 'In general, robotics and AI are tending to present two distinct sides: the
    traditional side with its masculine face of mathematics, logic, and large, heavy
    industry, and the other side with its light, gentle humanism and rich human applications,
    which seem to be the specialty of female researchers. In fact, it&#039;s not just
    women; the field of robotics and artificial intelligence requires a much broader
    diversity, including culture.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free
    version)'
know-more:
- desc: I&#039;m not sure how Google can be more or less clear in its efforts to transfer
    information from a website to a user. It&#039;s possible that I&#039;ll have to
    do further research, but I&#039;m not sure what terms to use in my project proposal.
- desc: Today we talked about Google Search options, and I would like to more about
    algorithm and snippets.
- desc: I would like to know more about the project and certain topics we can work
    on, such as examples of real-world topics that would be acceptable for the project
    that relate to the course.
- desc: "The discussion between whether the races will influence their chance to get\
    \ job or not leaves me an impression in today\u2019s class, I think that people\
    \ should not describes a person by their skin colour, everyone has their own advantages\
    \ and disadvantages, you can not tell if the people is good in the work by their\
    \ races."
- desc: Why should the public report a snippet? Shouldn&#039;t google already have
    read the snippet and ran it through it&#039;s system to determine if it goes against
    one of their policies?
- desc: more representation of women is needed in the tech world
- desc: Google&#039;s safe search algorithm.  Do they manually screen content?  If
    so, do they employ a large number of people to this means?  How would they ensure
    that diversity is met while employing people to prune the results?  Similarly,
    if they use an algorithm, how do they ensure a lack of bias?
- desc: One thing about which I would most like to know more about is minority representation
    in STEM. Is silent racism still a current issue, and how can it be combated. Are
    diversity quota&#039;s a good ethical practice or does it give jobs to less qualified
    applicants, just for the sake of diversity so the company does not get in trouble.
    What can be done to prevent discrimination towards immigrants that are applying
    to jobs, especially fields dominated by the majority race in the country.
- desc: In today&#039;s discussion we discussed the reason why few women take stem?
    Do they just lack interest or feel unwelcome? I think it&#039;s a bit of both.
    I think some women doesn&#039;t do stem because they are not interested. I think
    the reason is when they are kids the parents introduce dolls to girls and cars
    and robots to boys. So boys are more exposed to technology stuff than girls. So
    I think the lack of exposure to stem is the reason few women take it.
- desc: I&#039;d like to know about different perspectives when it comes to encouraging
    women and minorities to participate in the technology field.
- desc: I would like to know more about the women interest in coding as much as men
    topic. I honestly don&#039;t see many women in my coding classes and I was wondering
    why?
- desc: the thing I would most like to know more about would be how often google personally
    decides to curate their snippets rather than relying on an algorithm to choose
    them. Certain snippets do not seem to match their own rules so it makes me wonder.
- desc: We still have a long way to go in making STEM, and Computer Science especially,
    to be a more inclusive work place. According to the discussion, people experience
    many micro-aggressions in the work place. Because these actions are so subtle,
    the pain it inflicts is hardly noticeable to someone unaware. I want to know more
    about the kinds of efforts companies are putting in place to make computer science
    a more welcoming place, and I want to know who are the people we are trusting
    for implementing them.
- desc: "I would like to know more about some of the factors contributing to gender\
    \ inequality particularly in the computer science field. The number of women in\
    \ computing world is much different than the number of women in the society. There\
    \ have been many years of trying to understand why women aren\u2019t encouraged\
    \ to take computing fields/computer science. I would like to try to find an answer\
    \ for the question &amp;quot;Why women don\u2019t feel welcomed in this field?&amp;quot;"
- desc: the data on minority status workforce in tech vs other similar industries
- desc: It was a good session about STEM, and had some good discussions.
- desc: Today&#039;s discussion about gender, race bias is really interesting. I want
    to know more about how to prevent Discrimination. So far, Canada did a good job
    at preventing it compare to US or other countries. I think the most important
    factor is diverse education that young generation received
- desc: I would like to know more about those polluted sites which were in the 80
    i think this was something interesting to learn and know about the past how it
    used to happen.
- desc: With biases present in both humans and algorithms, should people or computers
    conduct interviews?
- desc: who did the most contribution on reducing gender discrimination in STEM
- desc: After today&#039;s meeting, I found the discussion about women in STEM to
    be interesting, and insightful hearing the different opinions. Although some were
    in denial of the environments that create barriers for women joining STEM,  the
    facts remain that women make up only 28% of the workforce, while men dominate
    the rest. With that being said, it is important to educate the public of the gap,
    which is where I would like to know more about how the CS community can play a
    hand in this.
- desc: How do we as a society encourage more women to take up STEM careers? It is
    such a male-dominated industry that really doesn&#039;t need to be. I don&#039;t
    believe there are any intrinsic difference between men and women that make men
    more suited for the industry. So we can we do to help balance it out?
