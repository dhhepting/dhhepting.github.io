difficult:
- desc: Why more clicks is such a bad thing.  For example, if everything were clearly
    labelled in many categories, I&#039;d rather have something like that instead
    of where there&#039;s a lot going on on a single page where I might be able to
    get less clicks.  I feel like there&#039;s a tradeoff of efficiency versus organized.
- desc: It would be better if professor would take time to explain about the topic.
- desc: Everything
- desc: In class, the question was brought up if user interfaces are ethical and I
    am having a tough time understanding when a GUI would be unethical.
important:
- desc: the most important thing that I learned about interface is that an interface
    that&#039;s not humane does not provide meaningful access to the functionality
    of the software
- desc: The most important things that I learned in the lecture today are what make
    an interface humane, such as how long does it take to switch between keyboard
    and mouse when interacting with the interface, how much clicking is required when
    navigating the interface etc.
- desc: Humaine interfaces are useful to help bring usability to the program
- desc: Urcourses is designed poorly
- desc: Today We have discuss about the trusted source. Wikipedia is not trusted source
    because it can easily edit. It is good platform if you want a start to learn a
    topic. Mostly people are looking for good answer for their question rather than
    going for deep information.
- desc: Today we learned a lot about analyzing websites and how humane they are.  We
    learned that because of some people&#039;s setups, changing between mouse and
    keyboard can take a lot of time so we should try to minimize this.  We learned
    that websites should be discoverable and intuitive.  Displays should work in a
    variety of settings (phones, computers, etc).
- desc: I learned how user unfriendly urcourses can be for professors
- desc: 'Today we talked about Designing Efficient Human Interfaces. Easy Interaction
    and proper development are the key factors when it comes to designing User-Friendly
    Websites/ Programs especially when it comes to reducing interaction time between
    keyboard and Mouse. Example: University of Regina UR Courses'
- desc: A interface that is not humane does not provide meaningful access to the functionality
    of software. The time to switch between keyboard and mouse is significant. This
    is something to consider when building an interface.
- desc: Our discussion about how humane interfaces are an ethical requirement helped
    me immensely. I learned a key thing about how usability is based on the accessibility.
    As a humane interface, it does not provide meaningful access to the software&#039;s
    functionality. Hence, computer professionals should take charge of society&#039;s
    access functionality in a more meaningful way.
- desc: Blog entry
- desc: OMS is a specialized human information processor model for human-computer
    interaction observation that describes a user&#039;s cognitive structure on four
    components.
- desc: Today&#039;s class was informative in terms of our website assessment as the
    professor gave more information on it. Detailed discussion about the humanness
    of the UR courses computer science department website was done. Professor discussed
    various aspects of the website which would argue its humanness.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is that it is very important to have a
    humane interface. I had never thought about it in the way that if the functionality
    of an interface is bad that it is similar to not even having access to the information.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, We talked about our blog entry assignment and previous
    assignment also, we discussed whether the ur course was well organized or human-friendly.
    I think the ur course  is still easy to use.
- desc: I learned that it is possible rate the visual comfortness of a webpage
- desc: The time it takes for each action on a website (time moving between keyboard
    and mouse, time clicking and selecting something, and time to think about how
    to approach a task) all affect the user&#039;s experience. By minimizing this
    time, the user will be able to use the website more efficiently. It takes a lot
    of investigating to improve the flow of a website and reorganizing each link and
    where to find them.
- desc: The most important thing I&#039;ve learned today is that an interface that
    is not humane does not provide meaningful access to the functionality of the software.
    I would like to learn more about inferface and how it works in the computing world
- desc: "I learnt more about humane interfaces, particularly how one measures a well-designed\
    \ one. Information should be accessible for the user, and so it should be intuitive.\
    \ Otherwise, a service that is difficult to use can\u2019t be considered a service\
    \ at all. Computing professionals should"
- desc: Providing a software capability is not good enough if it is not easily accessible.
    It is important to understand the impact software has on society and we need to
    think about people being able to access functionality in a meaningful way. Also
    I would be interested in knowing more about some of the ways/strategies through
    which the capabilities provided by a software can be made easily accessible.
- desc: Today I have learned about GOMS ( Goals Operation Method Selection), it is
    a human performance and we can use it to improve human &amp;amp; computer interaction
    efficient. It is based on research phase with end users and used to eliminate
    developing unnecessary actions, so its time and cost saving. we discussed about
    UOR website  as an example as the interface is not much humane and requires lots
    of clicks and scrolling from the users.
- desc: human design in computer science and its implications
- desc: As professionals, it&#039;s our duty to ensure UI functionalities are well
    thought out and are perfectly humane
- desc: Learning the importance of making software&#039;s easily accessible to the
    society because it is the responsibility of computer professionals.  Making a
    website means that one is responsible for making the information on the website
    clear to its users rather than making them put one and two together before it
    makes sense. This sort of information is good and helps computer professionals
    to make good work habits and and keep in mind the importance of their roles.
- desc: We had a discussion about the time to switch between keyboard and mouse is
    significant. And also discussed about the human interfaces an ethical requirements.
- desc: In todays lecture we discussed about the submission of Project proposal and
    Blog entry. Professor also discussed about the new University website, he discussed
    if the website is Humane or not. He also added that the time to switch between
    mouse and keyboard is significant, from that he concluded that when you are building
    a website one has to keep this things in mind and should try to make a simple
    but impressive website which user feel ease to access and navigate. That&#039;s
    the important thing I learned.
- desc: The importance of good web designing. It is the responsibility of the web
    designer to make sure that the website they are designing is accessible and has
    a good interface. Websites can get confusing to use if they are not designed properly.
    The interface of websites should be humane.
- desc: We discussed the importance of a website being humane, and it is developer&#039;s
    duty to make website as humane as possible. Dr Daryl considered our current university
    website, and discussed the humanness of the website from a instructor&#039;s point
    of view. Our current university website is better than the former ones.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture I got to know about different interfaces about University
    of Regina&#039;s Page as well as interfaces faces by professor of our university.
- desc: Interface is very important to users. A bad interface can be somewhat unethical.
    As computer scientists, we should consider every aspect of designing a good interface,
    including accessibility and usability to maintain a pure product. After all, computer
    science is for serving society and creating values
- desc: The user-friendliness of the interface of the UR course was discussed. As
    professionals, it is our responsibility to consider the functionality of the interface.
    The interface needs to be manipulated by us
- desc: The time to switch between keyboard and mouse is significant. This is something
    to consider when building an interface.
- desc: "Today, the class begun late like some ten to fifteen minutes. Actually it\u2019\
    s better as we need more time to get fresh early in the morning. The most important\
    \ thing that we learnt today was discussions on the upcoming website assessment\
    \ and related topics."
- desc: A web developer should strive to design their site in a way that minimizes
    the number of times a user has to switch from keyboard to mouse and vise versa.
- desc: "Today class started with attendance and after that he told us about re submission\
    \ of project proposal, that it has to submitted before 14 march. After that there\
    \ was a discussion on the topic \u201CAre human interfaces an ethical requirement\u201D\
    ."
- desc: a good design would have a good balancing on keyboard and mouse input
- desc: the most important thing that i learned is time to switch between keyboard
    and mouse can be significant and something to be consider while  building an interface
- desc: That a humane interface is one that provides meaningful access to the functionality
    of the software. It makes a lot of sense as to why this would be important. It&#039;s
    hard to imagine it mattering if your program does what it&#039;s supposed to if
    no one can use it!
- desc: i think because of the pyton, the website can know what we most view or search
    , and show the information we want to us, i think it is good for the user, it
    make users quick to find the information we want. IF the website can show all
    the information, it will take much longer time to find the infomration
- desc: Humanized design is a human-centered design, the humanized design of cell
    phone APP interface needs to conform to all aspects of human habits, operating
    habits, psychological thinking and even human structure. In general, it is to
    make users use it conveniently, use it comfortably, make people like it and look
    comfortable.
know-more:
- desc: That the interface of the school website is not perfect even with having experts
    in the university, I would like to know how they come up with the design of the
    urcourses and why it&#039;s still like such when many professors struggle with
    it.
- desc: Is there an objectively better or ideal way to lay out information in a website,
    or is it subjective?
- desc: I find the studies Professor Hepting was talking about in which people save
    and waste time while completing tasks while working on a computer. I would love
    to know more about that.
- desc: Today&#039;s class was very important I learned a lot but m little bit confused
    about the format of blog entry.
- desc: I would like to know more about the GOMS (Goals, Operators, Methods, Selection)
    model which is useful in real world design situations. This technique provides
    a four-step solution towards building a humane interface. First, the interface
    designer needs to establish what goals to achieve the final product. Then operator
    is an action performed to accomplish the goal. Methods are the steps following
    an operator to reach the end. Selection rules are needed when there is more than
    one way to reach the end goal.
- desc: I would like to know more about what makes a website or interface humane.
    The examples in class with UR courses was very interesting and I had never considered
    it before
- desc: Can too much accesibility in human interfaces be a weakness? There is what
    can be considered a standard when it comes to accesibility when it comes to interfaces.
    There needs to be some useability otherwise how would a person wouldn&#039;t use
    a website? Many websites implement ways to accomidate certain disabilities such
    as color blindness. Too much accesibility might take time away from new features
    to accomidate everyone. Do websites need to be acessible to everyone and if not
    what is aceptible accesibility?
- desc: Why hasn&#039;t the university updated their self-service website? It seems
    very outdated and I always have troubles finding information.
- desc: controlling the spread of misinformation
- desc: For the one we talked about in class, &amp;quot;is it possible to look at
    a webpage and feel comfortable about how to access the information you want?&amp;quot;.
    What i do to make sure a webpage is safe is at the top there will a padlock logo
    to make sure it safe, a triangle if it is a suspicious website. Other than that,
    I&#039;m not too sure what are the sign th
- desc: "Today we discussed about whether the UR Courses interface is humane, from\
    \ an instructor\u2019s point of view   ~Is it interface humane? -Dots for clicking\
    \ -GOMS (Goals Operator, Methods, Selection) Keys   ~analytical approach to evaluating\

    \ -Are human interfaces an ethical requirement?"
- desc: I would like to know more about the instructor point of view about urcourses
    or our university website
- desc: I want to know and learn more about humane interfaces as this is an important
    topic to go through and interesting things can be learned from it
- desc: I would like to know more about webpage and human interfaces and how we can
    make them more humane to work with while keeping them functional.
- desc: I find the user interface design aspect of today&#039;s meeting pretty interesting.
- desc: I would like to know more about the GOMS.
