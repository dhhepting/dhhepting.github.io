difficult:
- desc: Today is the last class and it is very hard for me because I will miss it
    so much!
- desc: How there arent more informative classes like this! Makes university enjoyable.
- desc: I am still confused about the grades and final exam.
important:
- desc: Final will be 3 day take-home.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned from the lecture today was the details
    of the Final Exam. The professor went over the date, timeframe, structure, what
    it would be about, etc.
- desc: what i should be expecting for the final project and exam
- desc: I think learning about making humane interfaces is something important that
    I now know more about and will continue to learn about throughout my career
- desc: In todays class the professor talked about the final exam as he told all of
    us that the exam will be posted on 16 April around noon and submission is on 19
    noon. Also, the professor extended the due date of the project deliverable also
    the professor talked about group project which was submitted. I like the lecture
    very much.
- desc: Today we learned about the importance of designing humane websites.  We examined
    the UofR website to look at a common way profs use it (delegating assignments
    for markers to grade) and just how not user friendly it is for that purpose.
- desc: Last day of the class !!! It was a great semester. Today we talked about Final
    Exams and Final Project Group Marks. Also, Professor explained to us consider
    joining Canada&#039;s Association of Information Technology and Association of
    Computing Machinery.
- desc: Advancing the broader concepts of a profession and professionalism in IT will
    result in an improved ability for organizations to exploit the full potential
    of IT effectively and consistently, and a profession that is respected and valued.
- desc: The most important thing I learned was more about the final exam and its format.
    I also appreciate the project being bumped to next Wednesday
- desc: I learned the due date for the project deliverable was moved to wednesday
    April 13.
- desc: Today&#039;s discussion about the finals was constructive and precise. A slight
    glance over the critical topic was excellent. Ethics and the impacts of computing
    were among the most important things I learned this semester.
- desc: ethics, final exam information
- desc: The most important thing I have learned today is about the details of the
    final exam, as well as the project deliverable. The professor was kind enough
    to extend the deadline from 48 hours to 72 hours. It covers up pretty much everything
    in the topic list. Lastly, the project deliverable is also now due on April 13.
    They also talked about how they are going to mark the web assessment. Whether
    it is humane or not.
- desc: The topics for final
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is that it is our responsibility
    as computing professionals to make sure our applications are humane. It should
    not be the responsibility of the user to get used to a bad interface or find work
    arounds for complicated procedures. As computing professionals, we should make
    sure we are making humane things from the start.
- desc: I found the case study of using the UR courses website to be very interesting.  I&#039;ve
    done grading for classes as well and I&#039;d thought that there was some easier
    way to do group projects, but I was quite surprised to see how convoluted the
    process is!
- desc: I like the final exam format and feel it is fair.
- desc: Knowing the topics that would be on the final was really helpful and I appreciate
    the 3 days final availability and asking students what question they would like
    to add in the final. Thank you for this fun semester.
- desc: That to sorted students by groups is quite challenging to do on UR Courses
- desc: How many times a user has to click to accomplish a task plays a role in how
    humane an interface is. The user&#039;s experience and productivity with it drops
    if the user has to click a large amount of times. Proper effort should then be
    made in the design and testing phases to make the interface as humane as possible.
- desc: From this class, I learned a lot about the social context of Computer Science.
    I learned about data scraping and blockchains that have informed me enough to
    keep me paranoid about the internet and its risks. This class made me think about
    what I wanted from my degree and help me think critically. Thank you Dr. Hepting
    for you lenient and understanding attitude. I hope to see you again!
- desc: the most important thing that i learned is that this was a more enjoyable
    class than i thought it would be. I enjoyed taking this class with everyone and
    i hope everyone does well in their exams this year.
- desc: "I learnt a little mire about some useful website resources for computing\
    \ professionals. I appreciate being given some guides like these on following\
    \ a computing profession. We also discussed how the uofr courses moodle is designed\
    \ a little inhumanely. Professor also pointed out how tech is \u201Csupposed to\
    \ augment human abilities.\u201D I really like that way of putting it. Tech is\
    \ supposed to make life easier, there\u2019s no point of it\u2019s poorly designed\
    \ and confusing to use."
- desc: Most importantly, we discussed about the Final exam and what it entails. We
    also briefly touched upon Project Deliverable and website assessment assignments.
    Lastly, professor talked about the humaneness of the UR Courses interface for
    assigning 12 groups to each of 2 markers. There was a good discussion on this
    and some students suggested their ideas and solutions in this context.
- desc: Today we have discussed about the final exam and a recap to all the topics
    discussed soo far. Today I have got to know about CIPS and its commitment to advancing
    the IT profession and is actively engaged in a number of initiatives that directly
    relate to the advancement.
- desc: It was about IT sector and what defines it.There are many definitions of what
    constitutes a profession. Typically they all refer to a disciplined group of individuals
    who adhere to high ethical standards and are accepted by the public as possessing
    special knowledge and skills in a widely recognised, organized body of learning
    derived from specialized education and training. Inherent in this definition is
    the idea that the responsibility for the welfare, health and safety of the community
    takes precedence o
- desc: That this final is a take home
- desc: From the web assignment I learned that user experience is very important and
    is very insightful when creating an effective website
- desc: In Today&#039;s meeting, we have discussed about the Final exam and last project
    Deliverable things. Later on we have discussed about module/URcourses about how
    it works and all new things.
- desc: We talked about how the final examination for will take place for this class.
    We also talked about project deliverable assignment. The new due date, and how
    we should write it; the fomating and content related stuff.
- desc: "I have learned a lot of things in today\u2019s class but,"
- desc: The final exam discussion was quite helpful. The possible solutions for the
    grading pattern for the web assessment was also something to be considered. Always
    ask a question because it might just work in your favour.
- desc: Talked about the final exam topics, due dates and deadline about deliverable.
    Also talked a lot about human  interface
- desc: In today&#039;s class professor discussed about the final exam as well as
    gave some hints regarding question will be asked in final exam, also discussed
    about project deliverable.
- desc: Today we talked about the Humane in URcourses design. I am totally agree with
    Dr Hepting. Sometimes, we try to make thing beauty, instead of being useful. For
    web design, especially website for students, students parent, staffs, we should
    make it more intuitive for users
- desc: Today we talk about Dr. Hepting will still welcome your suggestions for exam
    questions + answers by April 14 @ noon (1 week from today).For the project deliverable,
    it is directly related to your project proposal. In your project proposal, you
    would have chosen a topic and a way to present it (the deliverable). This can
    be a research paper, podcast, video, etc. So, the project deliverable is you putting
    your proposal into action (Sundus)
- desc: the details about the final exam.
- desc: Today was the last day of the classes! Almost all were present . Final examination
    was discussed in addition to project deliverable . Questions session was conducted
    in the last 15 minutes . It was an interesting class.
- desc: When designing websites, we need to consider the ease of use for users while
    also considering every feature that a user may need. For example, making it easy
    to sort groups in URCourses.
- desc: The meeting started with the attendance and after that we discussed on &#039;what
    defines profession&#039; and on the topic &#039;CIPS and the IT profession&#039;.
    After we talked about ACM membership services. Then we discussed about project
    deliverable and the date for the project deliverable extended to 13 April by the
    professor.
- desc: groups can be assigned to markers in odd and even group, one get odd groups,
    one get even groups
- desc: The important thing I learned today will be about I.T profession my perspective
    about I.T profession changed completely I thought it similar to software profession
    but is different it is different it completely depends on individuals and stick
    to ethical standards
- desc: After today&#039;s discussion, I found that the most important thing that
    I learned was about the IT profession as that is an avenue that I&#039;m interested
    in pursuing post undergraduate. With my passion in football (soccer), I know that
    IT football world is developing so I want to be a part of that and learning about
    this was awesome as it was good insight!
- desc: Part of what it means to make an interface more humane is to ensure that there
    is not an excessive amount of clicking necessary. It is not kind to users to make
    them have to click on a large amount of boxes, spaces, etc. in order to complete
    a simple task - like assigning groups to markers.
- desc: The most importnt thing I ahve learned today is about the format of the final
    exam and that we will have 72 hours to finish he exam. We also learned about the
    CIPS and how to get the certificate as well. We also talked about how the prof
    will divide the web assesment between himslef and his markers.
- desc: Learning about the final examination and knowing what to expect was very helpful.
- desc: The final is start on April 16 due on 19th and project proposal due on 13th
    midnight
know-more:
- desc: The thing which I would like to know more about is the ethic responsibility
    of a computing professional toward the community.
- desc: Since moodle has many grievances, is there a place for professor to give feedback
    and suggestions? I think some professors would like that because I have another
    professor who talked about the problem for assigning markers for groups
- desc: Today was the last class. We talked about the finals. I would probably like
    to know about what the format will be for the finals. If there is grading rubric
    for the take-home essay, it would help a lot of us.
- desc: How would one apply accreditation to the computer science profession? Most
    job offerings work around the need for some type of standardized liscense by having
    some type of coding exam. This becomes problematic in becoming in arms race. People
    want to perform well to secure higher paying jobs and websites like Leetcode encorage
    extensive practice. Those coding problems while utilizing algorithms don&#039;t
    always test day to day skills of software engineering. What testing would best
    avoid gameification?
- desc: We talked about the final exam and the final assignment. The final assignment
    period has been extended,  the project deliverable is you putting your proposal
    into action
- desc: Thank you for the semester professor!!
- desc: The thing which I would like to know more about is what will the future of
    the IT profession look like? A more mature IT profession will be demonstrating
    the required leadership in advancing and improving the IT delivered products and
    services through the responsible and progressive application of IT standards.
- desc: What material is recommended for studying this course for final exam?
