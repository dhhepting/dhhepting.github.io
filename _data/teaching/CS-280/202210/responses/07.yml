difficult:
- desc: The last 15-20 were not clear due to choppy internet.
- desc: I dont fully understand how the covid and truck current events relate to the
    class
- desc: I learned about search engines and how they work. Every browser has its own
    specific search engine it operates which is unique in returning specific types
    of results. Majority of students are biased towards google and the results of
    a google search will hold more influence amongst a population. The other search
    engines used were Bling and DuckDuckGo. The 2 links resulted in opposing results.
- desc: It is really tough to grasp just how much influence the algorithm used by
    search engine can have on ones life. If two people were in the same field, with
    the same capabilities but used different search engines for their entire lives.
    I wonder how much their knowledge on the subject matter would differ!
- desc: After today&#039;s meeting, I reflected on the discussion and found many areas
    quite fascinating. There were some areas that I was familiar with, however, some
    I wasn&#039;t familiar and I found it difficult to keep up. I would like to learn
    and understand the search engine more and how the data is collected, and manipulated
    in order to promote products based of the data.
important:
- desc: today we learned about the cookies and web crawlers that are used to track
    the user&#039;s activities on the Internet and how they are stealing data without
    proper consent.
- desc: You can filter your search on google using the tool button under the search
    bar. You can set a time frame against your search.
- desc: that different search engins will provide different results
- desc: Is that there are so many different types of browsers, all of whom provide
    drastically different search results
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss that wje
- desc: First know there is a search engine named DuckDuckGo.
- desc: I learned that there are a lot of web browsers are owned by larger companies,
    like google.
- desc: Today we gained a better understanding of how we decide what web browsers
    to use and how said web browsers decide what sites to send us to.  We discovered
    that they use web crawelers to rank sites and have algoritms to compute the information
    that they give us.
- desc: Today, we identified Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo as popular search engines
    among our classmates and we also addressed choices of search engines, privacy
    issues, tracking user search information, and ranking the results.
- desc: Different search engines show different results lists for the same topic.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is how search engines are used and what
    the use to track a user on the internet. The different results when searching
    &amp;quot;covid vaccine triage&amp;quot; between different search engines was
    interesting, as different engines gave different results (especially when location
    is enabled/disabled).
- desc: I learned how algorithms decide what we get to see on the internet and whatnot.
    The filter bubble is our personal unique information that we live in online. The
    algorithms let us see things that it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily
    what we need to see.
- desc: that search engines uses web crawler to track your activities
- desc: After listening to other student&#039;s discussions, I have learnt that there
    is a lot more going on behind the search engines. I never knew much about cookies
    and web crawlers. It piqued my interest and in fact, I made a short research about
    it. Google and Bing utilize web crawlers to access websites. Another search engine
    that is discussed during the class is DuckDuckGo. I have heard about it but have
    not had the chance to learn more about it. It&#039;s interesting since they claim
    that they do not track its user.
- desc: cookies and web crawlers that are used to track the user&#039;s activities
    on the Internet
- desc: Today&#039;s class started with a brief information about the groups for project.
    Either we can do individually or upto group of 4 people. Professor put everyone
    in their own group. Then we continued with the bubble text and saw all results
    from different students. Then we had some discussion about the cookies and web
    crawlers that are used to track a person&#039;s activities in internet and how
    it actually makes web surfing experience bad.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt today was how a majority of our search results
    were very similar, I initially thought they would differ substantially because
    I always thought that google uses suggestive search results. Along with that it
    was interesting to see that most people use google as their search engine.
- desc: oday, I learned and used the characteristics of the ducduckko search engine.
    I didn&#039;t know there was a search engine like this. It is a search engine
    that does not collect any personal information and does not collect cookies, so
    I think it will be a great help to protect my personal information.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is that when you search the same
    words on different search engines, each are going to provide different result.
    It is also interesting learning about different search engines because I&#039;ve
    never know what duckduckgo or qwant or opera gx until today.
- desc: i learned that different search engines have different algorithms that recommend
    websites to users differently.
- desc: "That browsers use web crawlers to order the websites presented to the user\
    \ and that this data has been accumulated for over a decade. This is one of the\
    \ reasons why someone would get different results when searching for the same\
    \ thing on a different browser (besides from the bubble factor). I knew google\
    \ had a way of ordering/ranking websites but couldn\u2019t remember how they did\
    \ it."
- desc: Based on the videos we had to watch for today, I agree with Don Norman that
    &amp;quot;intense fear paralyzes you,&amp;quot; because it affects the way the
    brain works, which causes fear and anxiety to help people focus. Additionally,
    fear of judgement also causes a person to gain a new confidence, &amp;quot;self-efficacy,&amp;quot;
    where you get the sense of changing the world for the better. I agree that fear
    can encourage a person to do better, but one shouldn&#039;t let fear stop them
    from doing something.
- desc: Is that different search engines can use different techniques to filter through
    content
- desc: The bubble test really helped me understand the extent of which results are
    tailored to the person based on their ip adresses and based on what browser or
    search engine they were using
- desc: Today I have learned about cookies and web crawlers that are used to track
    user activities on internet. It is also called spider or spiderbot. It browses
    the world wide web which is operated by search engines. When we search some thing
    on internet, search engines don&#039;t know what websites exist on internet. The
    program have to crawl and index before they give you the proper result based on
    your key word. Search engine uses web crawlers to gives us best result for what
    we are searching as there are many thing
- desc: Getting to know about different search engine. Also, in terms of privacy google
    and bing share or sell data to third party according to their business model.
    These two search engines use cookies to recommend us different website and ads.
    DuckDuckGo is the most private search engine which doesn&#039;t store user data.
    Also no ads target any user and search result of each user is the same. Personally,
    I prefer using DuckDuckGo for privacy reasons.
- desc: there is a lot of search engines to use
- desc: Privacy is harder to get than i expected in the modern day
- desc: The things needed for a search engine to function
- desc: Today, we have discussed about the project proposal group. And we also did
    the discussion about the activity top three website and which search engine most
    people used such as Google, Bing, Duckduck go and many more.
- desc: In todays lecture professor discussed about the project. He discussed how
    groups should be made and also informed that we have to add username and id of
    UR courses for each student. We also discussed about the Filter bubble test and
    its results. The outcome of the test was that maximum people used Google as the
    main search engine while some students also used DuckDuckGo and Bing. We discussed
    about the cookies and how google stores your search history, this the most important
    thing that I learned today.
- desc: Looked at the result of bubble test and web results of different search engines.
    Learned a lot about search engines and web browsers such as how to modify the
    information you want and how the search engines priorities the data we are looking
    for. Current scenario of the vaccines.
- desc: "The most important thing that I learned today was about web crawlers. I had\
    \ never heard of them before. This stuff drew my attention. I knew that different\
    \ search engines use cookies to provide good services. But using web crawlers\
    \ to track users\u2019 activities doesn\u2019t sound good to me; I thought it\
    \ would be against government policies. This kind of activities arises a question\
    \ to me that do these companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook have grown so\
    \ much that we don&#039;t have any replacements for them?"
- desc: The most important thing from today&#039;s class was project. a student can
    submit project individually or in a group of maximum four members. they can submit
    a research paper, book review or a documentary. The deadline for the project proposal
    is 14th february  and the project deadline is 11th april. project can be on the
    topic related to the class for example on security, spying, surveillance. Then
    after that the important discussion was on the the results of the bubble filter
    activity on the covid vaccine tri
- desc: The search engine stuff really  got me involved in the subject and changing
    region does affect the result or not..
- desc: So by changing different search engine I got to know different information
    on different region
- desc: Tech company gathers our search history to improve their search engine and
    also earn from displaying advertisement that we might be interested. So the question
    is should we let them to collect our data? It is similar to &amp;quot;Look at
    that guy&#039;s data or let them be?&amp;quot;. But this time, it is more easier
    to decide, because we don&#039;t have to think about moral, we only need to evaluate
    what we gain and what we lost to give our decisions
- desc: I learned alot about google we can find the best news regarding th topic we
    cover. I also got to know how we can maintain our privacy by using some other
    websites qwant i got to know regarding the tools which was kinda interesting and
    good to know about ty for some imformation i believe it will help in many thing
    we look forward to.
- desc: Moe doubles down on goal to remove vaccination, negative test mandate.It can
    be seen that the vast majority of people in all countries around the world are
    willing to receive the New Crown vaccine, and only a small percentage of people
    are not willing to receive the New Crown vaccine. It can be seen that Chinese
    people have the highest willingness to receive the vaccine, with 97% of Chinese
    people saying they are willing to receive the vaccine. Each person has different
    reasons for anxiety, so to say what t
- desc: Today we discussed about search engines and how efficiently each of them works
    as compared to each other. For example DuckDuckGo is also one of them and works
    similar to google but consumes more time and so google is preferred. We also looked
    at what shows up on google after searching  covid-19 triage and discovered various
    links and websites coming up after searching it. Students also gave their opinions
    on different search engines and discussed the same among themselves.
- desc: Most people use the google search engine.
- desc: "Todays lecture started by taking attendance. After that professor putted\
    \ every student in temporary group that can be adjusted after the project proposal\
    \ is submitted. After that there was a discussion on \u2018Bubble Text Result\u2019\
    \ and we found majority used google and others were bing and DuckDuckGo. At the\
    \ end there was a small discussion on in person classes that are scheduled to\
    \ start on 1 march."
- desc: I gained a greater understanding for how the upcoming project is going to
    work.
- desc: DuckDuckGo does not track users because it does not store their search history,
    does not track their IP addresses, and essentially has no personal data to sell,
    whether or not the user is in private browsing mode.  It stands out from its competitors
    early on, often in the privacy it offers users - other search engines have refused
    to offer the same privacy until DuckDuckGo.
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more is the porject. If we want to work in a group, do
    they have to be in the same class section as us? also, I would like to know how
    the bubble test fits the course content that we have read in the textbook so far.
- desc: I would like to understand why &amp;quot;infection&amp;quot; is the meaningful
    endpoint with respect to vaccine efficacy against COVID variants. While vaccinated
    people are more likely to be infected with Omicron, statistics still show remarkable
    effectiveness versus hospitalization and death, which I thought would be the only
    meaningful endpoint at this point.
- desc: The thing that I would most like to know more about is how search engines
    work? How do they get the best results? How do they track what is being searched?
    Do multiple search engines run on the same back end (Google&#039;s and Bing&#039;s))
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more about search engines
- desc: Got to know about the latest news around our province. Secondly we discussed
    about the group assignment as to what to use such as Research Paper or Book Review
- desc: Today the prof told us about class group work and I learned about the task
    during today&#039;s lesson. Also, I was able to learn about blog style and how
    to complete assignments by visiting the website and wiki.
- desc: "The filter bubble test results were discussed in today\u2019s class. The\
    \ results showed how different were the search results depending on the search\
    \ engines used. This is because every search engine uses different algorithms\
    \ to produce result for a particular search. The search results are also based\
    \ on Personalization and Location observed using cookies and web crawlers. These\
    \ results can nudge a person\u2019s mindset towards the opposite direction without\
    \ guarantee of its accuracy and authenticity."
- desc: Why has google continued to hold a monopoly as a search engine? It seems strange
    how we see so much competition in other areas when it comes to technology (operating
    systems, hardware like HDD and VR tech) but not search engines.  What would a
    world with multiple main search engines look like compared to ours where the majority
    uses google? Especially with meeting 5&#039;s discussion with how social media
    companies maintain polarizing algorithms, would there be more polarization due
    to different search results?
- desc: Today we talked about the bubble result that used by google search
- desc: With all of the search engines people can choose from, why is google the number
    one search engine in the world but has the most user data issues? Why don&#039;t
    we see more people using microsoft edge or duckduckgo?
- desc: One thing that I would like to know more about in relation to today&#039;s
    lecture is web tracking. I somewhat understand the idea of tracking but I would
    like to know more about the practical approaches to tracking and more about the
    consequences of internet tracking. More broadly, I&#039;m interested in how trackers
    influence individuals and firms and the way they interact with each other in today&#039;s
    digital age.
- desc: I would like to know more about how search engines track peoples input and
    sort their results. I have heard about website tracking and cookies before but
    I have never really looked into what they actually do and what data they get.  I
    would like to also know more about how search engines choose to sort their data,
    and what criteria they value most out of a search result.
- desc: The impact of the time/day on a search engine&#039;s results.  For example,
    would we have had more similar results if all of the samples for the filter bubble
    were taken at the same time?  In the internet era everything changes so quickly,
    I feel as though it&#039;s an important consideration.
- desc: I would like to know more about the project and how in depth we&#039;re supposed
    to go in each topic such as the topic civil rights, or surveillance.
- desc: the thing I would most like to know more about would have to be the search
    engines and how they curate their search results. The covid results we went over
    are interesting but not near as interesting if you start searching more politically
    left or right opinions/facts. Certain search engines such as google censor the
    results from on side more than the other for example.
- desc: I want to learn more about search engines and the pros and cons of many different
    kinds. Also, are they all designed in nearly identical ways? How do they each
    decide to filter their search results? If it is almost similar, does it make a
    difference which one to use?
- desc: From today&#039;s lecture discussion, I would like to know more about how
    different search engines such as Google and Bing track user data based on our
    browsing activity. I would also like to know more about how is this user data
    managed and used for advertising and marketing. I would also like to know more
    about how or if companies that collect and share user data without the user consent
    can be stopped from doing so to allow information privacy for individuals.
- desc: I wanna know more about how technology is being implemented with the pandemic
    going on.
- desc: "I would like to learn more about how \u201Cweb crawlers\u201D and cookies\
    \ work. Someone breifly mentioned in class about how googles policies are not\
    \ necessarily binded by law, what are the steps that government is taking in terms\
    \ of privacy and further issues surrounding tech?"
- desc: The thing which I got to know is like google is keeping track of us while
    we search something so I just wanna more things regarding privacy and protection
    against this!
- desc: The transmission thing that we were discussing after vaccination and before
    vaccination like do vaccine reduces the risk of transmission ?
- desc: I want to learn more about the web crawlers that are used by search engines.
    Is it ethical and okay to use web crawlers to gather user&#039;s data?
- desc: Today prof told us regarding project as well as project groups. I did not
    understand the difference between blog and personal blog. Which was most difficult
    things for me to understand.
- desc: i would like to learn about cookies and crawlers in details to learn about
    their importance in online business.
- desc: Do web browsers like google chrome still keep the data somewhere even if we
    use the incognito mode?
- desc: How are the search results ordered. Not every search is humanly allocated.
    They would have a system that is so sophisticated that it gives us the right information.
    I would like to know the behind the scenes of this process.
- desc: What is the most secure search engine?
- desc: How companies and governments monitor and keep track of peoples data that
    they share online. Also, I would like to learn more about the different ways to
    keep my information private and stop companies from accessing my more private
    information.
- desc: About cookie and its history
- desc: After listening about  web crawlers and  cookies it got me thinking when we
    use the VPN our IP address changes does it mess with web crawlers I would like
    to hear more about it
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about the assignment submission. We also discussed
    about last time mgt (mgt6). We also tried to search in DuckDuckGo and we doubt
    out that DuckDuckGo search results are from google and mainly Microsoft bing.
- desc: I&#039;m curious to see how the major search engines, like Google and Bing,
    adapt to the growing demand for more privacy online. The major part of their revenues
    come from ad sales that rely on a certain amount of tracking. How will they still
    offer the same service if they&#039;re not able to make the same revenues?
- desc: I would like to know more about if searching in the engine or a browser differ.
    Also, I would like to know more about how much the time of query affects the results
    of the queries from our bubbles/ search.  For example, if someone search about
    a certain topic on Wednesday, and someone else searched on Monday, would there
    be new and more relevant results that the first person could&#039;ve been shown
    to?
