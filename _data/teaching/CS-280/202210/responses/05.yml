difficult:
- desc: 'The concept of creating a polarizing algorithm for views. It showcases the
    ability for media to scapegoat a common enemy but Its dividing factor does have
    its limits. Consider anti-vaxxers:  Majority of Canadians are vaccinated yet their
    is still many restrictions. I don&#039;t mean anti vaxxers aren&#039;t a problem
    but the media overstates them. Canada has had underfunded healthcare for years
    before covid. I don&#039;t understand the media stance on that minority when there
    are multiple factors for return to normal.'
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand is how COVID-19 will continue
    effecting our education and university career. It seems as nobody knows what truly
    is going on or how to handle the pandemic situation and education. It is truly
    frustrating and hard to get a grasp of.
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand is how so many people seem to
    just believe what they see on social media and the news. They talk about fact
    checking and education like its this end all be all thing that somehow makes them
    more likely to be correct. However when you look at the actions of the government
    censoring speech and banning doctors that don&#039;t follow the narrative and
    you reference such actions with history the correct side is never the side afraid
    of people with opposing opinions.
- desc: Today i faced difficulty in every topic we discussed about. sorry but may
    be somewhere it&#039;s my fault
important:
- desc: we learned the importance of Algorithms in IT. That how big companies are
    manipulating the facts by the use of algorithms. We even learned that how the
    audience can be targeted with use of  factual information.
- desc: The point of confrimation bais in what people search on google is very imporant
    and relevant. The search engine works based on what you search so if someone words
    their search in a certian way, they will only find information relevant and macthing
    information they already agree with. Another imporant thing was that if you change
    to remote your class data will still be saved.
- desc: Today we had a sneak peak at the topics which we will go throughout the semester
    and after that we have dissuade about the 1st blog assignment which is due on
    22 February. Dr.Hepting explained each and every thing point about the blog like
    how we need to write and make a research on it.
- desc: I learned today that everyone has a solution that no one agrees to about how
    to solve the distillation of information of the internet.
- desc: Even with proper knowledge on how to validate any form of information can
    be hard.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss how the media algorithm generate misleading
    information. In the ted video elipariser clearly explain how Facebook, Google
    algorithm works. If two person search for same thing it is highly possible that
    their results will be different, the reason is the website algorithm show that
    kind of information based on your last searching. Even if we are not logged there
    are 57 signal from which algorithm will jugged from what kind of place we are
    sitting, which browser, location etc.
- desc: The algorithm control people to get information they most want.
- desc: Today we discussed how social media algorithms are biased.  We suggested that
    one of the reasons for this is they benefit significantly from the increased ad
    revenue generated from polarizing topics.  These algorithms are designed to make
    money not provide balanced views.  We see this on other media sources as well
    where news stations will frequently cover whatever gets the most views (death,
    disasters, etc) rather content which doesn&#039;t hold people attention as well
    so its not just facebook.
- desc: Creating a more &amp;quot;mainstreamed&amp;quot; way of fact checking sources
    to boost the credibility of an article/topic can be extremely beneficial in today&#039;s
    and age. With people generally skimming and potentially not receiving the full
    story or not knowing where their information is being received can cause some
    serious issues.
- desc: Today we discussed the social media and search platform algorithms and their
    role to spread misinformation, especially in the pandemic situation. The question
    comes into place whether the society takes responsibility for what they find in
    social media and search platforms or the tech companies who control the search
    engine and algorithm.
- desc: The information we get today is probably all guided. Some opinion-formers
    only show us what they want us to see. We need to learn how to screen information
    for authenticity.
- desc: "The most important discussion in today\u2019s class was about how the algorithms\
    \ used by various social media platforms produce different results for the same\
    \ search for different users. These algorithms play a huge role in molding a person\u2019\
    s mindset based on sources that aren\u2019t always reliable. I think it is the\
    \ responsibility of these platforms to fact check information and distinguish\
    \ the sources produce on their websites. A law mustbeinstated which requires these\
    \ platforms to differentiate between sources"
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is more information on the blog entries
    and the project. I am glad to know more about what to expect from these assignments,
    so I can better prepare myself to complete them before the deadlines. I like that
    we can choose from many topics relating to the course, and I am excited to see
    what myself and others can come up with for the project.
- desc: The most important concept learned today is that algorithm is putting people
    in bubbles. Social media platforms are manipulating people and forcing them to
    see what they wanna see. Even educated people are being driven in a single direction
    that leads to the spreading  of more misinformation. Even when these biased people
    go to google, they just search accordingly to confirm their bias.
- desc: "I&#039;d say the most important thing that I learned during today&#039;s\
    \ meeting was more info about the project we will work on during the semester.\
    \ I learned that the project has to be around 1000 words, have 2-4 sources and\
    \ will be assessed based on a project proposal and the project itself. Another\
    \ important thing I learned today was that we are expected to leave a critique\
    \ on our fellow classmate\u2019s blog posts. I am actively thinking about which\
    \ topics to investigate."
- desc: Based on the Chapter 1 reading, I can say that technology is steadily advancing.
    It also definitely has some cons to it. Since most people have access to the internet,
    they could easily post false information online. To check the validity of a post,
    it is important to fact-check everything we read to make sure if the information
    is real or not. People&#039;s opinions about a certain topic could easily be manipulated
    and would benefit other people.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, Professor Hepting discussed in detail about the project
    that we&#039;ll do as individual or up to 4 members in the group. I learned about
    the marking scheme of the project and how there are different parts of the project.
    I also learned about the blog that we have to write and also about the blog that
    we have to write as a critique to someone else&#039;s blog. Towards the end of
    class, we also discussed about a covid related article and heard some good points
    from that discussion.
- desc: I think the discussion regarding how to reduce misinformation is a critical
    one, but unfortunately I don&#039;t think it&#039;s one with any good solution.  If
    we give the power to the government, or a company, then suddenly we are at their
    mercy regarding what we see on the internet.  Further, it&#039;s been shown that
    Facebook was basing their screening on internal opinions rather than true fact
    checking.  I think the Ted Talk regarding journalistic ethics is a good start,
    but not total solution.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was how manipulative social media
    companies can be, especially with their algorithms. They have a responsibility
    to act in a non biased approach but it is clear that the programmers code with
    their biases. The question then becomes how can we insure programmers are ethical?
- desc: The first task was discussed. Many students said why fact check is important.
    As there are more data in modern society, we should always doubt and be wary of
    whether these data are true or not.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we talked about how easy it is to get wrong information
    in the internet. Some of the results are biased. It is important for everyone
    to know how to properly look for right and unbiased information.
- desc: "Based on today&#039;s discussion, I think that information on the internet\
    \ is sometimes both believable and questionable since some articles are sometimes\
    \ opinion based and evidently factual based. But another question would be how\
    \ do we categorize something as factual? Nevertheless, what I learned from the\
    \ \u201CBlown to Bits\u201D chapter is that since technology is developing everyday,\
    \ it is getting more dangerous as everyone&#039;s digital footprint is stored\
    \ in bits which can be an advantage and disadvantage."
- desc: Was that this class will soon be changed with a different class to teach more
    relevant information to today.
- desc: The responsibilities, risks, and potential issues with doing online research.
    How algorithms can help to confirm our biases, and how in order to stay properly
    informed you must be extremely proactive when looking for online information.
- desc: One thing that caught my attention this class was our discussion about fact
    checkers and social media algorithms. The topic that stood out in my mind was
    how much of the internet isn&#039;t fact checked, or how much of the internet
    is claimed to be fact checked. I have always thought that some people are paid
    to write whatever online, makes me wonder how much of the internet I can trust
    nowadays.
- desc: Learning how social media algorithm helps with the spread of news and information,
    creating awareness at different locations on earth and also enlightening the masses.
    I also learned how those social media algorithms pass across false information
    to deceive the masses and also how big companies fail to maintain a polarizing
    algorithm because it increases ad revenue by increasing views.
- desc: I think the most important thing I learned today was that although the internet
    (search engines and social media) are designed to display information that is
    catered to what we want to see, it doesn&#039;t mean that we are being brainwashed.
    free will still exists and it is up to the individual to decided for them selves
    to be openminded enough to be okay with the beliefs and values to be challenged.
    it Is a matter of taking a closer to look to see if the info is accurate.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is that information is very powerful, and
    it has the power to influence not only how people think, but also how they behave.
    Therefore, it is important that the government/society implements measures to
    tackle false information in circulation. One of such measures is a fact checking
    system. For Example, Facebook made considerable efforts to verify information
    being circulated on its space. Although measures like fact checking has its benefits,
    it also has some cons; The fa
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting, we have discussion about in class and remote section\
    \ class. We have also discussed individual assignment which blog post of around\
    \ 900-100 words. Waiting to post in the assignment section page."
- desc: the class started with the discussion of the remote or inperson classes. Also
    daryl hepting said to contact connie renwick for any help related to the section
    change from remote to inperson or inperson to remote.  Then in today&#039;s meeting
    the most important topic was project for the term related to the course for 25
    marks. 5 marks for the project proposal and 20 marks for the project itself. Project
    can be done in group or alone with maximum of 4 members. Professor then discussed
    the social media algorithms
- desc: Pretty interesting meeting today especially that discussion about the trucks
    going to Ottawa which passed through Regina the other night.
- desc: Learned about the assignment format and project proposal
- desc: In today&#039;s class I have learnt the most important thing is that we got
    outline for our first assignment which is due on 28th Feb.
- desc: Today Professor Hepting started the class with discussing assignments and
    project, he let us know about a lot of important topics and explained the weightage
    of each of them. then we learned about Social media algorithm and their role in
    the spread of misinformation. We also learned about how polar algorithm has been
    used by social media company , just so they can increase revenue and viewers.
- desc: As the debate was going on in our class session today, I learned that people
    that are biased to a particular idea are always looking for things that assure
    them of this bias. The applications that we use are also smart in keeping us in
    this bubble. I guess this all comes up to how our information is used against
    us to provide relevant results or ads and thus affects the way we think.
- desc: As web companies work to custom fit search results to their users people are
    only being shown a small percentage of the information that is available online.
    This can often trap people in a filter bubble where they are only exposed to information
    that doesn&#039;t challenge their worldviews.  To fix this issue governments need
    to pressure companies to allow people to choose their own filters so that they
    can access more information.
- desc: I learned a lot about how people perceive social media, and how their algorithms
    interact with their users. The discussion was pretty interesting today.
- desc: Social media algorithms and their role in the spread of misinformation.
- desc: "Social media, nowadays, has a lot of influence on real life issues. Over\
    \ the years its influence on social issues has been increasing. A nation\u2019\
    s political debates are often on the internet. In addition to this cult groups\
    \ now have a way to communicate and spread their word as well. COVID-19 has shown\
    \ us the adverse effects of social media in broad detail. A lot of incorrect information\
    \ is spread on these platforms"
- desc: "The most important thing I have learned today is that we cannot force people\
    \ to belief that they should vaccinate or not. Also, to reduce the number of accounts\
    \ that post incorrect information on social media, we should educate the antivaccine\
    \ people and doing our best to let them understand that vaccine is safe for everyone.\
    \ We cannot rely on the news that are posted from unreliable websites but rather\
    \ we should follow the news that are published by public health. If we don\u2019\
    t talk to people who have faulty"
- desc: I enjoyed learning about the different opinions shared with the class in regards
    to misinformation online.
know-more:
- desc: "Today we had discussed about social media companies create the content in\
    \ such a way which makes it look interesting for the user to read and share to\
    \ their friends and family, It includes creating fake or sometimes editing original\
    \ article. The main purpose behind this is to attract more and more users to the\
    \ social media which will help them in making revenue through advertisements.\
    \ how these companies are able to get a customer for a longer time as user know\
    \ they don\u2019t get real or much important article."
- desc: What is the balance to be struck between controlling misinformation and allowing
    freedom of speech? Censoring the internet does not seem practical nor desirable,
    yet leaving it as a free-for-all also seems unreasonable. This is even more difficult
    when answers to questions are not immediately obvious, especially in a new area
    of research where even academics will not agree on any one answer.
- desc: I would love to see more people&#039;s ideas for the upcoming assignments.
    I think the creative liberties given to us for this makes it a very good reflection
    into someone&#039;s point of view.
- desc: The thing from todays lecture that I would like to learn more about is ways
    for people on social media to get factual information without the hassle of having
    to do your own research all the time. Is there a way for social media platforms
    to ensure that information posted on their site is factual. Can we even trust
    an algorithm to fact check for us, will it have the bias of the programmer.
- desc: I wish to learn more about what we could do to regulate information online
- desc: How better algorithms can retrieve accurate information and the roles the
    internet giants would have to play to deal with hoax and misinformation. I would
    like to know more about how search engines like Google tackles cherry picked information
    of the websites to get more clicks and match with the search keywords.
- desc: What would entice people to look past the facts that are presented to them
    on media and to look into said topic to fact check things before spreading false
    information
- desc: The blog entry is what i need to know more as to what write in the blog entry
- desc: I&#039;d like to talk about the importance of privacy in relation to social
    media
- desc: I would just like to keep having open discussions in class so we can hear
    different opinions and learn but it is hard to keep up with what everyone is saying
    when they speak over each other.
- desc: I&#039;d be interested in learning more about how COVID-19 has impacted the
    globe and encouraged us to adopt internet solutions to solve the challenges that
    are caused by COVID-19 in our society..
- desc: I personally believe that certain classes of people are stuck in their own
    bubble due to social media and also the people they are closest to. I worked in
    the oil industry for years and personally know how someone can just be parroted
    information from a co-worker and not fact check.
- desc: I would like to learn more on why social media companies make algorithms from
    user data and how it benefits the company. Why include these algorithms if they
    create conflicts like misinformation?
- desc: Who is rally in fault for false information?
- desc: I would like to know more about the discourse between what is an individual&#039;s
    responsibility vs the social media platform&#039;s responsibility to show accurate
    information. Social media controls what people see to an extent with algorithms
    that cater to what people want to see but is it the platforms responsibility to
    make sure all information is accurate? Would that even be possible with the amount
    of content online? Or is it more of an individual&#039;s responsibility to check
    their sources? Opinions seem divided
- desc: I want to know of a solid solution to deliver information if we are to get
    rid of algorithms
- desc: "We had a good class discussion about facts and fact checking content and\
    \ how it is an issue in today\u2019s world. Not everyone knows how to fact check\
    \ and simply just teaching it in school is not enough as that only teaches the\
    \ younger generation who are currently in school but not those who are out of\
    \ school. Should companies require their employees to take training on how to\
    \ properly fact check information? What happens if the employee refuses to do\
    \ the training? Having a central fact checker poses risks as w"
- desc: Listening to the discussion today made me realize how much more research I
    should do on this topic. But aside from that, I found it interesting how the focus
    shifted to user responsibility rather than our responsibility. While it is true
    that the user has some level of responsibility for their actions, I&#039;m more
    interested in knowing what we as computer scientists can do. What is within our
    scope to control? Moreover, I wonder if we are merely holding on to an algorithm
    only for the sake of convenience?
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture discussed the importance of fact-checking the publicly
    available information on social platforms such as Facebook and Google. However,
    I think it is also crucial to consider the personal biases of people who fact-check
    because their biases may influence their choice of which facts to analyze and
    their accuracy determination.
- desc: I would more like to know about social media algorithm and their roles in
    spreading of wrong information and how social media companies uses our personal
    information for their benefit and generate good revenue and also how they share
    our data with other companies for their benefits.
- desc: Today&#039;s session was quite interesting cuz it was regarding covid and
    vaccination...So in my opinion people nowadays don&#039;t understand how critical
    situation is either they are trying to ignore it or its just that they are dumb...Vaccination
    is not cure obviously but it can fight against the covid-19 variants ...So at
    last i think if people wanna live in this world then they need to understand how
    critical the situation is and try to support government and other nations as well
    !!!
- desc: In todays lecture we discussed about the assignments and projects. We discussed
    more about the dead lines and topics on which we can work on for the blogs and
    project. The blog should be 900-1000 words long and it should be in MLA format
    with some legit references. We got to know the total marks of the assignments
    and the project. There is a option for the project you can either work alone or
    in group with maximum of 4 people. I would like to know more about the topics
    of project.
- desc: "Binary! The language of computers. Computers only understand binary language,\
    \ the language of 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s. Nowadays, we mostly write our code in\
    \ higher level languages, and then the compilers do the translation job for us.\
    \ I would like to know about the translation process from high level languages\
    \ to binary language. How the compilers are made, and how they work?"
- desc: Today&#039;s discussion on fact checking and how social media plays a role
    in it was very helpful. Even if a person is educated, based on their algorithm
    they can get incorrect information. What knowledge base is required for a person
    to understand that they need to fact check? How does the algorithm show a particular
    set of information since the very beginning to a user? And how does the user form
    a bias and an opinion based on the information provided?
- desc: I really liked today&#039;s discussion as it was related to the political
    issue with some extent as it was leaded to almost 700 trucks for a protest in
    Ottawa .
- desc: I&#039;m really excited for the next project. I&#039;m doing coop at the moment,
    and your class is a perfect opportunity to improve my writing for my work term
    report. This pandemic did stop me achieving some of my goals, but it taught me
    how to study on my own, how to do research, .. Can&#039;t wait for it
- desc: What I would love to know is that the number of people who can access the
    Internet varies a lot from country to country, for example in developed countries
    everyone will have a computer, so they will all be very aware of the Internet,
    which is conducive to the development of the Internet. However there are many
    underdeveloped countries or poor countries where few people can afford to use
    a computer, so there is not enough Internet awareness. In the information society,
    the geographical barrier is no longer
- desc: i would like to know more about the project and the blog. The topics are not
    clear to me.
- desc: Fact-checking is one of the major issues that has been happening while searching
    on google. Not all the searches gives us the accurate information in one attempt.
    Even there were some questions raised by a congressmen to the CEO of the google
    company in one of the meetings.
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more about the algorithms used by social media companies
    to increase clicks. I know that a number of companies have hired psychologists
    to help play to our emotions so I&#039;d like to learn what some of those methods
    are.
- desc: Todays meeting start with attendance and we all discussed about in-person
    and online lectures and even get to know that there are still rooms in both 01R
    AND 01F. Then, we discussed about the assignments and projects and the first assignment
    named blog entry 1 and for this we have to write an essay in about 900-1000 words.
    Therefore, I want to know more about this.
- desc: About the algorithm and the fact checking
- desc: I would like to know about web revelation  while watching the video I got
    a doubt as Google , Facebook filters the results . So, it possible to manipulate
    the digital marketing( eg elections  ) manipulating the votes etc.. is it possible?
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we discussed about all the topics which we learn in
    upcoming classes. We also discussed about Assignment 1 which is due on feb 22th.
    In 1st assignment, we should write a blog. I want to know more about assignment
    1 in upcoming class and also can you please explain the details on how to write
    a blog and what all resources and references I am allowed to use. Thanks!
- desc: After today&#039;s meeting. it was evident that there was a lot to be said
    in terms of the information spread about COVID-19. The different options to deal
    with handling misinformation regarding COVID-19 was interesting and I am hoping
    that we can also explore options from people from both sides as it&#039;s important
    to weigh both ideas equally without any judgement.
- desc: What is the role of government is providing frameworks for how its citizens
    interact online? Freedom is incredibly important, obviously, but it also cannot
    just be the wild west. Private companies such as Facebook have also proven why
    it can&#039;t just be in the hands of the firms either as the spread of misinformation
    runs rampant and threatens our public health and democracy.
- desc: still a lillte bit confuse about the asignment and group project , such as
    how many words or can we get a range of the topic
