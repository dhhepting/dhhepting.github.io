difficult:
- desc: As we were discussing the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct or &amp;quot;The
    Code,&amp;quot; I understood what people were trying to say like that the government
    should create this laws regarding computing technology, but mostly the objective
    of the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; technology was created to impact humanity positively.
    Some people are just taking advantage and using it for malicious acts. As technology
    advances, how are computing professionals supposed to create algorithms for the
    public good? What is the &amp;quot;public good&amp;quot;?
important:
- desc: We discussed about the Assignments and project today. The most important thing
    i learned today was the importance of project in the course. Also we discussed
    various aspects of the algorithms are having on our daily life. The manipulation
    of facts through use of algorithm remained primary focus.
- desc: Computer Code of ethics and how the goverment needs to rewrite tech laws to
    suit the adanving world as many laws are outdated. Also, how do we create technology
    in a way that it can&#039;t be used for evil and how can we decide what is evil?
- desc: "In today\u2019s class we have discussed about the assignments and it really\
    \ helped a lot about how to so the assignments. I got a clear picture on how to\
    \ do the research papers and the assignments and its kind of interesting doing\
    \ these research works."
- desc: Today I learned how and when to do our assignments for the class.
- desc: The pros and cons of Social Media (Facebook). What facebook is being used
    on is completely up to the person using it, similar to a gun. Gun is just a tool,
    but its the people who does the real killing.
- desc: Gun won&#039;t hurt people,people do,internet is the same,It&#039;s always
    depend on how to use it.
- desc: I never thought abt how artificial intelligence can absorb our biases and
    how we could prevent this and i think it is an important issue in ai
- desc: Today we learned about the AMC which deals with codes of ethics and professional
    conduct.  One area that it focuses on is the idea of public good where some people
    may define public good differently than others.  This means that both parties
    may claim to be acting for public good while acting against each other.  We will
    discuss exactly how to define this and who gets to define this next class.
- desc: As computer professionals, they have more opportunities to get access of others&#039;
    information. At this time, it is important to obey computing code of ethics. Otherwise,
    the society will get in a big trouble. Moreover, the government should make stricter
    laws to restrain those who try to commit crimes.
- desc: "The topic of discussion in today\u2019s class was about code of ethics and\
    \ how should we define it and ensure it is being followed. The first step is to\
    \ update the laws relating science from 1990s to the current much evolved technological\
    \ age. A technical body should be put in task by the government to see if the\
    \ tech companies under the administration uphold the enforced laws. We can also\
    \ advocate to make these laws for the greater good of the public and to honor\
    \ their privacy and confidentiality."
- desc: The most important thing i learned is further information on the assignments
    and project. It is good that we are informed well in advance so that we can prepare
    for the project as much as possible
- desc: Today we talked about the project proposal
- desc: Today&#039;s discussion about ACM has taught me how a responsible computer
    professional should behave. One of the main rules of thumb is to take public good
    into primary consideration. The tasks associated with research should also take
    individuals&#039; privacy and human rights into account.
- desc: "The most important thing that I learned during today\u2019s meeting was that\
    \ the project we will be working on can consist of a few different things. We\
    \ are left with some freedom of choice in determining which route we want to go\
    \ down whether it is a Wikipedia entry, a podcast, a short written document and\
    \ so on a so forth. I\u2019m looking forward to deciding a format by which to\
    \ create my project. It\u2019s nice to have options for an assignment so I\u2019\
    m looking forward to it a lot."
- desc: that writing algorithms requires diversity to reduce bias. government legislative
    actions taken to control this biases impact on society.
- desc: To answer the wiki question, &amp;quot;As computer professionals, how do we
    make a decision about what&#039;s right or wrong?&amp;quot;, a variety of factors
    must be considered. First, I would want to identify the issue, make a list of
    all viable solutions and repercussions, and then make a decision from there. Since
    making a decision is difficult, I would be fully responsible, held accountable
    if anything went wrong, do my best to be fair, honest, and commit to my decision
    (tho I sometimes have commitment issues).
- desc: I got information about the assignment through today&#039;s class. and also
    check the website and the wiki, and Also, I was able to learn about blog style
    how to do assignments.
- desc: I learned that tools such as an algorithm can be use for both good and bad.
- desc: We have the ACM code of Ethics for computer scientists. It does not restrain
    computer scientists by clearly defining its vocabulary, such as terms like &amp;quot;The
    Public Good&amp;quot;. This allows us to define for ourselves what it means to
    us. So, at the end of the day, the code gives us guidelines on what things to
    consider.  I also learnt more about the greater impacts of social media and misinformation
    on hospital ethics. Where we frame responsibility on for vaccine misinformation
    and ignorance affects triage.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is about the deadline of the projects
    and assignments. About the ethics on how to submit project and how to critique
    blog.
- desc: In response to the Jimmy Fallon article, I think its fine for him to plug
    NFTs, but he is obviously doing it to serve his best interests. It reminds me
    of the whole dogecoin craze last year and how Elon Musk and other celebrities
    hyped it up because they invested millions into it. Dogecoin did well for some
    time, but it was only held afloat by the hype. So proceed with caution and don&#039;t
    put all your life savings into something just because it&#039;s popular.
- desc: I learnt that there are laws implemented to help computing code of ethics,
    to prevent them from being violated by tech companies. I also learnt about certain
    types of security applications such as facial recognition, being involved with
    alleged racial discrimination charges and violation of personal information.
- desc: Today, we have discussed the blog post assignment, project proposal assignment,
    and critique blog post. I would like to know more about critique blog post as
    I am confused about it little bit like what we have to do in it. At last, e have
    also discussed about ACM code of Ethics and Professional Conduct in to it.
- desc: In todays lecture professor discussed about the assignments that we have to
    complete in this subject. He provided with the detailed information about the
    assignment like on which topics we can write and how is the grading scheme for
    the assignments. Also we had a discussion on the computing code of ethics. We
    discussed some blogs about this topic. The most important in todays lecture was
    the details of the assignment and also got to some new things through the computing
    code ethics.
- desc: Today we got some more information of assignment and we discussed about the
    ACM code of ethics and professional conduct.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned was about the filter bubble. I heard
    about it for the first time. I was amused when I heard it; I had never imagined
    that such a bubble is possible. I checked it out myself and now, there is no doubt
    that it exists! It was an interesting new fun thing to learn. Now, I guess, maybe
    we can use incognito mode to escape from this bubble.
- desc: professor started class with the introduction to the assignments and then
    important discussion about code of ethics of tech companies and digital laws that
    should be implemented to tech companies. The important discussion included the
    covid vaccination triage for the people who are refusing vaccination and how to
    convince them for covid vaccine shot. next important thing that i learned today
    is ACM code of ethics and how professional and practioner should follow code of
    ethics and then racial discrimination
- desc: The most important thing I have learnt today is about blogs, project work
    as well as participation. Besides these I got to know about apple car theft which
    I have not ever know before.
- desc: My opinion is we have to practice our thinking, know when to use common sense
    and when to use critical thinking. Nowadays, the internet is full of fake news,
    misunderstanding, .. If we don&#039;t evaluate what we heard, how can we know
    what is right or what is wrong?
- desc: Today in class again, we learned about the new assignment we will be working
    on soon and visited the blog. We also discussed the various behaviors for ethics
    and many suggestions to learn about contributing to society and humanity through
    computer systems. Computer systems need to ensure people&#039;s privacy and high
    standards of professional competence. At the same time, there should be no discrimination
    or unfairness in science and technology. Computer science should ensure the rights
    of each person, and comp
- desc: The most important thing in todays discussion was ethics not only in information
    society but also in medical practices. Everyone&#039;s opinions were different
    and brought new prospectives.
- desc: "In the beginning, we had a brief discussion about the upcoming projects and\
    \ blogs in the semester.  Then all of us shared our viewpoints on biased algorithms.\
    \ Data sometimes could be biased, but however, companies follow the procedures\
    \ with transparency but does not temper their data\u2019s privacy. Also, an app\
    \ or website is never made to be misused. It is always made for the betterment\
    \ of people . But it gets misused by some negative people intentionally."
- desc: "In todays meeting, the most important thing I have learned is about our assignment\
    \ with worth 5% named program proposal. It\u2019s important for me because assignments\
    \ are way to score good in overall grades. After that there was also a discussion\
    \ about the computing code of ethics and suggestion to ensure this ethics are\
    \ not violated by tech companies. At last professor told us to watch two videos\
    \ before next lecture. Hope, I will perform well in my assignment. :)"
- desc: "In today\u2019s class, we mainly discussed about the assignment. We have\
    \ an option to make a group or else it\u2019s okay if we are not in a group. Professor\
    \ has extended the date."
- desc: Algorithm becomes bias because of the people who create or write the algorithm
    are actually have biases.  For example if a person does not know how to code what
    we can do solve this issue is either teaching them how to code or use multiple
    people to code the data and letting the person who does not know how to code to
    manage the group in a different way. Also, the big companies such as Google and
    Facebook are not clear about how they are using their algorithm and how they use
    the users&#039; data for business.
- desc: Ethics are important to large and small companies alike, and many are beginning
    to see the potential consequences of not considering ethics, such as Google&#039;s
    employees who object to unethical behavior within Google. However, companies are
    also seeing the potential to call for a more ethically conscious marketplace that
    cares about their privacy, security and data and is increasingly articulating
    their needs rather than accepting the latest technology imposed on them.  Translated

know-more:
- desc: Types of biases in technology
- desc: Today we discussed about computing professional actions. These actions can
    lead to great impact to our lifestyle. We discussed how a new invention can be
    used in different ways by different kind of people. Like a new device by Apple
    called air Tags which are for personal for a person to find his item if he lost
    it. But other people use it to track other people vehicles and stealwhen no one
    is around. The consequences should be considered if a product is misused.
- desc: I would like to learn more about the Apple AirTags and what issues they cause,
    and what Apple is doing to address concerns raised by this technology. I would
    also be interested in knowing what one can personally do to mitigate risks to
    themselves.
- desc: The thing from todays lecture that I would like to learn more about is the
    ACM code of ethics and professional conduct, and what is the public good?
- desc: how we can try and keep our selves more protected online
- desc: what exactly was included in the Computing Code of Ethics in 1992 and what
    changed and was added in 2018 when it was updated?
- desc: I would love to know more about the blog entry as well as project proposal
    which is due on 14 feb also I wanted to know more about how class group can work
    together as it is online semester. At last today class was very interesting.
- desc: Today we discussed the Search Algorithms, and it is important to understand
    whether the Algorithms are biased or not, how it is ranking pages, provide equality
    to all businesses, and transparency. I would like to know more about Open Source
    Algorithms and analyze the above factors.
- desc: Why doesn&#039;t the government patrol/ monitor these apple airtags or allow
    a certificate in order to buy one? Making it readily available to the public is
    causing issues and apple hasn&#039;t done anything to prevent people from abusing
    these airtags.
- desc: computing code of ethics
- desc: I would like to know more about what the current laws and regulations are
    regarding social media programs and what information they are allowed to take.
    I would also like to know more about how the world should go about updating those
    laws and restictions.
- desc: How one can properly define what it means for something to be good for the
    public.  It seems like an impossible task - if you empose too many restrictions
    at what point does it become authoritarian?  While if you do nothing at all, there
    can be many ethical dilemmas.
- desc: I would like to know more about the Phoenix pay system because I am currently
    working for the federal government and it is very interesting to me because I
    have never had any issues with phoenix pay systems but it does seem very interesting.
- desc: I would love to know more about &amp;quot;the public good&amp;quot;. Many
    people use the term but often do not mean it. Not to mention many of the worst
    things to happen in history were done under the banner of &amp;quot;the public
    good&amp;quot;. In society today more often than not &amp;quot;the public good&amp;quot;
    seems to refer to what your political leaning believes in rather than everyone
    as a whole. This especially applies to vaccinated and unvaccinated.
- desc: The upcoming assignments there due dates
- desc: I would like to learn more about the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
    Since, we know that making ethical decisions/choices is not always straightforward
    as deciding between right and wrong. The proper understanding of the code of ethics
    can prove helpful for us when we need to make ethical decisions in difficult situations.
    In my opinion, we all should have a some sense of our moral responsibility and
    should always (try to) maintain our integrity.
- desc: I want to dive deeper into the ethics when it comes to technology and computers.
- desc: The way AI takes into consideration peoples data and show content based on
    that
- desc: I would like to know more about the different techniques that can be used
    to reduce bias in technology and how we can use machine learning / AI to further
    enhance experiences.
- desc: We were discussing ethics as a computer professional today. While discussing
    that we spoke of &amp;quot;pubic good&amp;quot; or in the better interest of the
    &amp;quot;public&amp;quot;. I want a better understanding of the &amp;quot;public
- desc: Do the apps nowadays give enough alert messages to the users so that they
    can keep their data secure and up to date?
- desc: In the ethics website, we are repeatedly told about rules that are set for
    the public good. I would like to know what parties are responsible for this decision
    and how they come to it. Where is the bar set for rules that protect the public
    as a collective good.
- desc: I would like to know more about the computer code of ethics. This includes
    how these ethics can prevent issues and how we as a society can enforce a computer
    code of ethics on companies, governments, and individuals.
- desc: the whole thing about the code of ethic and its developing history
- desc: I would like to know more about professional conduct because the Facebook
    whistleblower case was it problem of ethics and professional conduct was it case
    of  negligence
- desc: I want to see a discussion about NFTs and crypto and how other people feel
    about that.
- desc: I would like to learn more about how we define what the public good is. It
    seems like a concept which on the surface would be easy; however once you start
    thinking more about it it becomes much more complex. How do we draw the line of
    deciding a policy or action is good for the many despite hurting a few?
- desc: I thought learning about NFT&#039;s in-class was kind of entertaining, even
    though I&#039;m not too knowledgeable about the topic.
- desc: i still confuse about the detail of the group project and what we should write
