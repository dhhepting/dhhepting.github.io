difficult:
- desc: I did not quite understand the purpose of the new assignment and why it has
    to be done as a group since we are just critquing the improved website
important:
- desc: To learn about Grace Hopper.
- desc: Today first we discussed about our project proposal and we watched a video
    in which a old lady was interviewed and she was great in computers. Then we duscussed
    about blog entry and about our groups
- desc: I had the pleasure of learning about Grace Brewster Murray Hopper today, and
    a bit of the impact she had on our world as we know it.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture we watch the Grace Hopper in David Letterman Show.
    She joined the Navy and later she became Rear Admiral.  She was also known as
    &amp;quot;Queen Of Programming&amp;quot; and she contributed in programming in
    Harvard Mark I computers.
- desc: Detail of assignment.
- desc: Grace Hopper is the queen of programming
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture the prof shows us a video in which a lady was astonished
    by the nano seconds and pico seconds also prof asked about the groups. Overall
    the lecture was very great.
- desc: Today I learned more about the project so that I can properly plan my project
    proposal.  We discussed how it is supposed to be 1500 words ish but that this
    isn&#039;t a hard number.  Other than that we discussed general expectations for
    it.
- desc: the details for the project proposal and the blog post
- desc: "Today we watched an interview video of \u201CQueen of Software\u201D Grace\
    \ Hopper with David Letterman. It was a great 10 min video clip especially Dr.Hopper\
    \ explained about Nanoseconds and Picoseconds."
- desc: First index in arrays start at 0 because a bit is either on or off. If we
    don&#039;t start the index at 0, then we can&#039;t get values. We would be wasting
    a state.
- desc: Today I learnt that I should start working on my proposal as soon as possible
    and get started on my project!
- desc: Today we discussed about the project proposal in our class, I first thought
    that we can use any kind of books for this project, but after the discussion,
    I realized that we need to choose the book that relates to our class.
- desc: Today I learned who Grace Hopper was and her many accomplishments in the Navy
    and working on the Harvard Mark I. She was a very important person in American
    history by revolutionizing the computer.
- desc: The amazing interview of 90&#039;s American computer scientist Grace Hopper
    taught me a lot about the initial approach of Computer. Grace was one of the first
    programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer, she was a pioneer of computer programming
    who invented one of the first linkers. I admire how she stayed so poised and down
    to earth while describing the concepts of nanoseconds to the interviewer.
- desc: Today we watched Grace Hopper&#039;s interview on David Letterman&#039;s show.
    She is a U.S. Navy computer pioneer who is known as the queen of programming.
    I&#039;ve done some research and according to Britannica, she helped device UNIVAC
    I, the first successful computer. Furthermore, the deadline for the Blog Entry
    has been moved to March 4. The professor also talked about the newly uploaded
    homework which will be due on April 4. The rest of the class time is dedicated
    to answer student&#039;s questions.
- desc: Participation of women in computer science
- desc: In today&#039;s class, the professor explained more about the blog entry and
    its marking criteria. We were also assigned a group assignment that is based on
    assessing the website of the computer science department in the U of R website.
    We also saw an interesting video of Grace Hopper attending the show of David Letterman.
    There were some very interesting examples and opinions given by Grace in that
    video.
- desc: I found the Grace Hopper video to be very interesting.  She seems like such
    an interesting and funny person yet also just a tad strange.  I also found the
    discussion regarding the project proposal to be very helpful due to the due date
    being this coming Friday!
- desc: Today, we had a discussion about our first task. How to start the task. And
    I knew what to do with the last task.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we watch a video about Grace Hopper. She was one of
    the programmer of the Harvard Mark 1 Computer. It was interesting how the hour
    format starts at 24:00 instead of 0:00 for start of the day. Out of topic, but
    the discussion about why the index of array starts at 0 makes me more wonder why
    ot is the way it is.
- desc: I find the reason why the first index of an array starts with 0 is interesting.
- desc: I didn&#039;t know that the reason array indexes started at 0 because of the
    states of bits and that if you didn&#039;t start at 0, you would be wasting an
    array state.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was the first index of arrays start
    at 0 because bits are either on or off.
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture was mainly focused on discussing about the different
    assignments that we need to submit in this course. I found Grace Hopper&#039;s
    YouTube clip quite interesting and her journey and experience as one of the first
    computer scientists to work on the Mark I computer is remarkable. Because of people
    like Grace Hopper, there has been a tremendous amount of growth in the computing
    world.
- desc: The thing I learned about today is about Ms. Grace Hopper in her interview
    with David Letterman .And how she became a rear admiral. Date for Blog entry was
    extended. And due date for project proposal was told.
- desc: Today we discussed about the David letterman show where Grace Hopper appeared,
    she joined navy when she was 37 years old and later became a rear admiral. She
    was assigned to program the Mark I computer. She was also known as queen of programming.
    She created the first computer language compiler, which led to the popular COBOL
    language.
- desc: types of ways to write a project proposal
- desc: Today, we have seen some video on interview which was very good and interesting.
    We also have discussed all the assignment. I would like get more information on
    group website assignment.
- desc: Good discussions. The video was fun and interesting session.
- desc: I would like to know more about Grace Hopper as she did a revolution in field
    of computer science
- desc: The most important thing i learned today is the book written by the grace
    hopper &#039;&#039;The queen of programming&#039;&#039; and also came to know
    that she was one of the programmers for harvard mark 1 computer. She also joined
    navy when she was 37 years old. Then the discussion was occured on the blog entry
    like how we are gonna submit and what topics should be included and how we can
    evaluate the online sources. also prof discussed if student chooses research paper
    then 1500 words maximum and groups assigned for website
- desc: Today, we saw one video of Grace Hopper which is shown by our professor and
    I have found quite interesting video.
- desc: We enjoyed an interview with Grace Hopper today and I was captivated by her
    humorous and entertaining performance. She was one of the first computer scientists
    in the world, and we can see in her the research and exploration of computers
    by early programmers. She believed in the rapid development of computers, and
    at the same time, she wanted people to use computers to do things better. She
    developed COBOL, the first commercial high-level language in human history, and
    she was also the founder of bug.
- desc: the most important thing learnt is the details about the project proposal.
- desc: We watched the video Grace Hopper&#039;s Interview on David Letterman and
    discussed the conversation happening between them briefly. Then Mr. Hepting gave
    instructions about upcoming assignments and projects.  Also thankful to him for
    giving one day extension for project proposal&#039;s due date.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned about is Grace hopper , I don&#039;t
    know who was she I get to know lot of things about her admiral achievements and  She
    was one of the programmer in Mark-1  computer
- desc: Grace Hopper was the inventor of one of the very first linkers, which is incredibly
    cool!
- desc: The most important thing i learnt in today&#039;s lecture was about Grace
    Hopper and how he gave importance to 00
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about the blog groups. We also discussed about
    assignment
- desc: How to visually represent the size of a nano-second. The video we watched
    was very informative and I found it really interesting that you could visually
    represent a nanosecond. It was done by a short stick the represented how the distance
    light would travel in 1 nanosecond. Very cool!
- desc: the most important thing that I learned was about Grace Hopper which she was
    an American computer scientist and rear admiral in the United States Navy. She
    was a pioneer of computer programming and invented one of the earliest linkers.
    She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer. She was the
    first to develop the principle of machine-independent programming languages, and
    her FLOW-MATIC programming language was eventually developed to produce COBOL,
    an early high-level programming lan
- desc: The Grace Hopper video was an interesting watch
- desc: The amount of information in today&#039;s society is so great that the transmission
    of information is no longer as slow as it was in the past due to the development
    of the Internet. Not only because of the ease of information transfer in today&#039;s
    society but also because of the fact that there are more people generating information
    in today&#039;s society. People are no longer faced with a lack of information,
    but the selection of information. It needs to be received more efficiently.  Translated

know-more:
- desc: The continued progress in the speed of computers and how that has impacted
    society.
- desc: The thing that I would most like to know more about is the guest from the
    David Letterman video, Grace Hopper. She seems to have lived a very interesting
    life. I would like to know in more details of what it was like to work on/with
    the first computers and how computers evolved over the years especially in a military
    environment.
- desc: About how google shows its results
- desc: how fast can computers do calculations now a day compared to when they where
    first coming out
- desc: Grace hopper mentioned about her programming days when she mentioned about
    her the hour format the computer they programmed.
- desc: I would like to learn more about women in tech and women in power positions
    because I am a women who recently started this journey in computer science and
    its inspiring to see women work their way up and do whatever they want without
    limitations.
- desc: "In today\u2019s class, the professor made us watch Grace Hopper\u2019s interview\
    \ on the Letterman show. Grace Hopper, known as the \u2018Mother of Computing\u2019\
    , has an interesting theory for nanosecond wires. She used wires to illustrate\
    \ how in one nanosecond an electric signal can travel 11.8 inches. It is  a visual\
    \ aid that represents how fast electricity can travel in one billionth of a second\
    \ which is a nanosecond."
- desc: I would like to know more about what is expected of us on the project, and
    to see examples of previous project submissions to have a better idea of topics/submissions
    that are acceptable
- desc: about the website review assignment, I am very confused about what we have
    to do exactly
- desc: Hearing about the nanosecond and picosecond was really interesting. I would
    like to know more about what advancements have been made since the picosecond
    and how fast information can travel now.
- desc: Today, we went over the assignment deliverables, and what I wanted to learn
    more about was how would we prepare for the final in this class? Will we be asked
    a question about computing technology and its impact on the world? or do we have
    a somewhat review package of certain terms we need to know and such.
- desc: the thing from todays lecture that I would most like to know more about would
    have to be some of the big names in the history of this field. I think its fascinating
    to see their stories and how they changed the IT industry.
- desc: 'I learnt a little more about Grace Hopper&#039;s contributions to computer
    science. It would be nice to learn about other notable figures in the world of
    computing, especially women. I hear very little about them, even though there
    are other women who have contributed. For instance: Lady Ada Lovelace.  Maybe
    talking about these historical figures makes only a very small impact. I don&#039;t
    know. But it&#039;s still important to give people a source of inspiration.'
- desc: The upcoming research project proposal
- desc: Google.
- desc: I would like to know more about grace hopper and take a deeper look about
    why she was so well known as a programmer and how she learned about computers
- desc: Today&#039;s topic was quite interesting i got to know about Grace Hopper
    also got to know like he was one of the programmers for Haward Mark1 computer
    and his book namely Queen Programming.Would like to know about him more!!
- desc: We talked about how it was interesting how Grace Hopper mentioned computer
    hours format starting from 24:00 instead of 0:00 for the start of the new day
    .
- desc: I would definitely love to know more about Grace hooper as she changed different
    format for hour formats . I always get fascinated about this kind of folks who
    revolutionized the systems we use today.
- desc: In todays class we saw the interview of Grace Hopper on the David Letterman
    show. It was a really nice interview in which Letterman discussed about the difficulties
    she faced in navy. She explained her journey and also told some facts of the computer
    and why she is called &#039;Queen of Software&#039;. We further discussed about
    the project submission and also discussed about the Group website Assessment.
    I would like to know more about the assessment.
- desc: Harvard Mark I computer. We watched a video of Grace Hopper on the David Letterman
    show. And the one thing I would like to know most about is the Harvard Mark 1
    computer that Grace Hooper had to write a manual for.
- desc: Computers only understand binary language, the language of one&#039;s and
    zero&#039;s. Nowadays, we mostly write our code in higher level languages, and
    then the compilers do the translation job for us. I would like to know about the
    translation process from high level languages to binary language. How the compilers
    are made, and how they work?
- desc: Programming is for everyone. I literally mean it. In a computing society,
    knowing a programming language can be a great advantage, you can work in the tech
    field or not. Programming help people develop logical thinking. Different age
    groups can learn how to write code.
- desc: In the time of pandemic how are supposed to keep ourselves motivated to to
    study?
- desc: How does dr happening manage to walk around the ice outside his house?
- desc: How did risks/rewards influence choices early computer scientists made when
    developing the first architecture and programs?
- desc: I would like to know more about how these projects we are completing for our
    class all connect to an understanding of Risk and Reward in an information society.
- desc: the history about the why people use 1 and 0 instead of other things
- desc: may i know more about the how the risk of security and personal information
    leak
