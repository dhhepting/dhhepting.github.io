difficult:
- desc: The lecture due to audio lag and cutting
- desc: I am still confused about the final exam and final project report.
important:
- desc: We asked questions about the humaness of linked open data and learned that
    the usability of it is challenged as the progress to improving it has been slow
- desc: About Tim Berners-Lee, father of Web. Berner is a Computer Scientist who invented
    the revolutionizing World Wide Web.
- desc: Politics and science dont mix
- desc: "The most important thing i learned today was the role computer science professionals\
    \ play in limiting climate change.\_ For example, we can produce accurate predictions\
    \ and modeling and make that accessible.\_ We can facilitate the production of\
    \ green technology (how much is invented these days without being designed on\
    \ computer software?)"
- desc: '&amp;quot;Fake News&amp;quot; didn&#039;t begin on the last 5 years. The
    single most important contribution I can make in the society as a computing professional
    is to make the world more equality.'
- desc: At the end of the class, we discussed what would be single contribution we,
    as computer professionals, can make in the society. I think if we devote our energy
    and resources towards the greater public good and develop new ideas, inventions,
    creative works, and computing artifacts that create value for society.
- desc: Today we talked about IPCC&#039;s report that the emission will peak by 2025.
    With that, we also briefly discussed climate change. For instance, what is the
    role played by computer professionals, is there a climate emergency, and about
    communication. Furthermore, Dr. Hepting quickly went over Tim Berners-Lee&#039;s
    5-star Linked Open data. The first three in the list are open and the remaining
    two are linked. Lastly, we talked about data quality and trust.
- desc: Becoming an ACM or CWS is the single most important contribution you can make
    in the society as a computing professional
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is about the 5 star linked data. It
    is important to know how it progressed and what makes something have a higher
    star value.
- desc: I found the five stars of Linked Open data to be very interesting.  It&#039;s
    a concept that I have not heard about before, and it is one that can be easily
    applied to any website you visit or create.  It provides a good framework for
    what should be expected from a website on top of W3C conventions.
- desc: Tobacco companies knew about the health impact of smoking due to their own
    research and yet they chose to hide these findings.
- desc: Tim Berners-Lee was the father of the World Wide Web as well as coming up
    with the 5-star linked open data deployment scheme
- desc: Although it is true that &amp;quot;fake news&amp;quot; didn&#039;t just begin
    in recent years, I think that the most efficient way to spread good data quality
    and trust between the internet is that we ALL have to mutually agree to provide
    and spread the truth (good info). Because what is hate posts/crime or fake news
    going to benefit us all? I believe social media platforms should either create
    a block chain for the misinterpreting posts and the hate crime towards others.
- desc: I learnt that we cannot control whether or not a person will mistrust a piece
    of information / data. Perhaps one can manage it a little by trying to show that
    the source can be trusted / has good intentions, but there will still be uncertainty
    among many, no matter how much one tries. However, that doesn&#039;t mean one
    should give up on building trust. Companies especially should be as honest and
    transparent as possible in order to be trustworthy. People want to see all elements
    of a certain reality.
- desc: "I found today\u2019s discussion on climate change interesting and in my opinion\
    \ from a geological perspective, it is crucial to include timescales are important\
    \ when discussing climate change in Earth\u2019s history because Earth has been\
    \ undergoing climatic changes such as from glaciation to deglaciation since its\
    \ formation. It is our duty as computing professionals to focus on the quality\
    \ of information being shared on social media platforms to tackle misleading and\
    \ false information from creating hoax news."
- desc: Today we discussed about the role to be played as computing professionals  and
    discussed about climate emergency . We also discuss about its linked open data
    humane?  and we discussed its support in our human frailties. We discussed about
    the contribution we can make as computing professional.
- desc: A lot of information nowadays is forged
- desc: During the lecture today, we discussed
- desc: Today I learned that Tim Berners- Lee is the father of the World Wide Web.
    I would like to know more about how he came up with that name for it.
- desc: Today I learned that there a major problem in the information society due
    to verification of news. The prevalence of fake news has created doubt when faced
    with authentic news. Perpetrators of violent or criminal acts (governments) now
    brand every news that does not fit their agenda as fake news. It then turns to
    a word-of-mouth event. For example, Russia are claiming the evidence presented
    for the war crimes against Ukraine are fake.
- desc: In todays lecture we discussed about the topic
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discussed about IPCC report, What is the role
    to be played? by computer professionals? Is there climate emergency? as well as
    COVID data managed by JHN and what formats do they have?
- desc: As a computer scientist, after the lecture today, I realized that I haven&#039;t
    contributed to the world anything. My goal is become a skilled developer with
    a big heart.
- desc: today we talk about  Linked open data has more promise but you fill find several
    dead ends to link trails thar seemed promising, Fear, uncertainty, doubt campaign
    waged by Microsoft against open/ free software (reference needed)
- desc: Today I attended in person after a long time . It was amazing and interesting
    to be back. Saw the prof after a long time and enjoyed to learned with him!
- desc: Tim Berner Lee is the father of the World Wide Web. He also distributed data
    according to their sensitivity using stats which I found out to be very intriguing.
    Thinking about more ways through which we can improve the world.
- desc: More education is needed in today&#039;s world to understand where misinformation
    comes from and how to combat it.
- desc: "Today the meeting started with the attendance and after that we talked about\
    \ \u2018New IPCC Report\u2019 which claims emission must peak by 2025. We also\
    \ discussed about what is the role to be played by computer professionals. And\
    \ questions whether there is a climate emergency and that the message has been\
    \ communicated effectively or consistently in the past."
- desc: the role of computer profesinal is to deliver the important information constantly
    to society
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about the group assignment submission and we
    also discussed about ipcc report. We also spoke about 5 star linked data
- desc: the most important thing I have learned today in class is about Linked open
    data has more promise but you fill find several dead ends to link trails that
    seemed promising.  Data Quality and Trust do not go hand in hand with &amp;quot;Fake
    News&amp;quot; as it didn&#039;t begin on the last 5 years. For example, Tobacco
    companies hiding their own research about health impacts of smoking
- desc: Combating fake news means bringing principles and standards from outside the
    public dialogue into the public dialogue. Originally, the power to judge whether
    speech is true or false lies in the hands of each citizen. It is up to each citizen
    to judge whether a piece of content is fake news or not. This is a freedom that
    citizens have acquired through reason, but it is also a responsibility that they
    must assume.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)
- desc: i think more important ting for the Data quality if depend on human, actually
    many news truth but they only reports the part that they wants the reader know
    and what will influence on how reader feel about the news.
know-more:
- desc: the thing about which I would most like to know more is how does data support
    our human frailties
- desc: Today the main focus was on the quality if the data shared over social media.
    It is noticed that the news shared is fake which are generated to make some content.
    I would like to know more about the nature of humans that get influemced by fake
    news.
- desc: Does efficiency in algorithms make any meaningful impact on electricity usage?
- desc: The thing from today&#039;s lecture that I would most like to know more about
    is data quality and trust. What caused the significant rise in &amp;quot;fake
    news&amp;quot; over the past 5 years. Was this a thing for a long time but it
    just went unnoticed. Do companies such as big tobacco get held accountable for
    hiding the research about the negative health impacts of smoking. How can we enforce
    laws to prevent &amp;quot;fake news&amp;quot;.
- desc: Today was the first time I had heard the phrase 5 star linked data. The first
    thing I did after class was looked this term up to find out more about it. Thankfully
    someone put an informative link in the class discord for that term!
- desc: today we talked about climate change and how it is related to a computer professional.
    I think it is effecting computer sector in many ways. I would like to know more
    about how it is effecting Infrastructure administration. Cloud is the best Option?
- desc: I would like to learn more on the topic of computing professionals making
    positive contributions in society. What computer jobs make the most positive difference
    in society?
- desc: I want to know more about if the linked open data is humane and also what
    is the most crucial contribution of us as computing professionals in our society?
- desc: I wan to know more about how data is stored and how that impacts privacy and
    data security day to to day for people and users of the internet.
- desc: TECHNOLOGY IMPACTS ON CLIMATE CHANGE
- desc: We talked about linked open data and we talked about whether it was safe.
    And we talked about fake news. We talked about how we could do it to increase
    reliability.
- desc: We talked about a lot of things one of which is about climate crisis, I agree
    with some of my classmate comments in the chat that with today&#039;s technology,
    experts could create new technologies that could help the climate crisis. They
    have created technologies that could save lives in hospitals, surely they can
    also create one to save climate?
- desc: Is what will be on our final exam.
- desc: I have always been curious about the stuff related to cyber crime. Nowadays,
    we use advanced security to prevent such incidents from taking place, but still
    we are unable to stop their occurrence completely. In order to break this kind
    of security, the crime committers need to be proficient, who possess extreme expertise
    in the computer science field. The question also arises that why would such intelligent
    people choose to commit crime?
- desc: How computer science professionals can help in the climate crisis. Other methods
    than more accurate models to predict data.
- desc: Marking criteria of the project delivery
- desc: I would like to know more about the data stars and how they can be made to
    be more humane for people to use them. I would also like to know more about different
    examples id five stars that work well.
- desc: The thing which I would like to know more will be role of computer professional
    in climate change through  analyzing the data  (data scientist) and focusing the
    idea  and promoting in social media
- desc: How can we make linked-open data more humane and accessible? It&#039;s clear
    that it is the best way for data to be presented however that doesn&#039;t mean
    it will always be accessible. Is there a way to ensure guidelines are followed
    when posting information?
- desc: I would like to know more about our final exam.
