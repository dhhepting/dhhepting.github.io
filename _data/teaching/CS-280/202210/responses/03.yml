difficult:
- desc: Definitely the new plan for going back to in person.  Its not that I don&#039;t
    understand it per say it just anything when it comes to covid right now it all
    feels a bit complicated when it comes to this new omicron varient. It&#039;s peaked
    in other places of the world but here in Saskatchewan it definitely hasn&#039;t
    peaked yet so I&#039;m not sure that Febuary 7th date will work well for timing
    considering cases are rising still. This doesn&#039;t affect me as all my classes
    I picked remote for but still, it&#039;s confusing.
important:
- desc: The most important thing that i learned today was the difference between features
    of an I-phones and Androids. There were significant features which were discussed
    like tracking , lagging and hacking and many more. I would more like to learn
    about which is better an I-phone or Android..
- desc: "I loved those ted talk videos which gave me a lot of information about privacy\
    \ and security. And coming to the today\u2019s class the polls about ios and android\
    \ are quite interesting. I support ios in this because we have more privacy iphones\
    \ compared to androids and iPhones are generally more well built and have better\
    \ hardware-software integration than Android smartphones."
- desc: It is important to think beyond profit and business when thinking about peoples
    privacy in the computing world.
- desc: is that people have their own prefrences over iphone or android
- desc: The most interesting thing to see was that those who voted that data should
    be read also voted that Apple was better. This is interesting because Apple has
    the most transparency in data usage out of any phone brand to go as far as using
    icons at the top of your screen to indicate that the app is using your location
    or other things
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discussed about the ted video&#039;s and in
    that it is explain that what can done if the website known the person data. The
    companies collect the data of people and make money by giving them loan, insurance
    because they can have track of their bills and get an idea of financial status
    of person. The data analysis can know the interest of person and suggest them
    product by showing advertisement.
- desc: we have a topic of either wo chose iPhone or android.
- desc: Government and a lot of private companies have a lot of access to personal
    user data.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was the ability to better analyze
    the impacts of decisions when designing systems by asking by asking is this decision
    ethical and who decides this?
- desc: When it comes to freedom of  speech, the power of utilizing annotations to
    create a more dynamic poll in the classroom can have some extreme drawbacks. creating
    a more structured poll such as the discussion for when in person classes should
    resume was a much more effective manner and can help negate the use of duplicate
    votes.
- desc: The privacy is still the most important thing. However, it is also necessary
    for Public Agency to collect the user data for COVID 19.
- desc: "For my personal opinion, I think that there is no personal privacy. And sometimes,\
    \ the person\u2019s privacy is necessary for government to protect our safety."
- desc: Today&#039;s two way discussion about &amp;quot;moral operating system&amp;quot;
    has taught me,  how we can use data to track down several criminal activities
    happening around  us. And, on the other hand, how an individuals privacy should
    be the first  priority no matter what the consequences are. The most important
    thing that I learned is,  that there is no formula to what&#039;s right and wrong,
    we should think ethically before making decisions.
- desc: "To decently answer the first question from the earlier lecture, I would always\
    \ choose Apple. I have tried using an android phone before but it was not for\
    \ me. I am well aware that there is more freedom when it comes to android devices,\
    \ but Apple products do not get any viruses. For the second question, &amp;quot;Look\
    \ at the guy&#039;s data or let them be?&amp;quot;, I would answer that question\
    \ with my classmate&#039;s legendary quote. Pooja Patel states, \u201CKnowledge\
    \ is a very dangerous thing, especially in the wrong hands\u201D."
- desc: that android is better than Iphone..
- desc: Today&#039;s class was quite fascinating as I learned some crucial that the
    data of a person. I learned that making a decision about some crucial topic is
    really important. In my opinion, we should not use the private data of a person
    for any reason (even if it is to make his experience better), as respecting a
    person&#039;s privacy is must and its unethical if someone&#039;s privacy is being
    tempered with.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is that moral decisions are not simple.
    Based on the Ted Talk video I learned that there are many different ideologies
    around making moral decisions and that not everyone agrees. Even in our class
    discussion people had differing opinions about what decision to make regarding
    people&#039;s privacy versus collecting data. This emphasized that moral decisions
    are not easy to make and that people need to think these things through before
    implementing stuff on computers.
- desc: Through a survey in class, I was able to share what the students who listened
    to it together were thinking. I think the protection of personal information is
    the most important thing.
- desc: In today&#039;s discussion, I learned that our phones have access to our data
    which then sold our data to advertisement companies. We get lack of privacy and
    phones and advertisement sell our privacy for profits. I also learned that Android
    is better than iphone. - from an android user.
- desc: I learned that the choice of operating system is based on preferences, and
    the discussion on data and privacy is quite nuance.
- desc: "That deciding to collect data from people and what we do with it (if we decide\
    \ to collect it) is a moral issue. These different kinds of morals we base off\
    \ of to figure out what is \u201Cright from wrong\u201D and whichever someone\
    \ should use is up for debate. Some examples mentioned in the Ted talk were Plato,\
    \ Aristotle, or Kant\u2019s way of determining what we should do. There is not\
    \ secret formula on choosing which way of thinking though."
- desc: Basically, when I watched the TedTalk, it made me reflect on my morality based
    decisions. Because it is true. There is no simple answer on how humanity is making
    decisions. And I agree with the videos. That since technology is our future, people
    need to acknowledge and learn about computers more. Also, with the debate on iphone
    vs android, tbh I like both, and as long as device does its job, it fulfills our
    needs.
- desc: The most important thing I learned in today&#039;s lecture would have to be
    that a lot of people seem to believe that there is no need for privacy of the
    individual online. It scares me a bit to think that there are those who believe
    this but I guess many have grown up giving away personal information for so long
    they think everything should be accessible to the government other others?
- desc: "It is our responsibility as Computer Scientists to approach design and technology\
    \ with a humanities perspective. We are humans building and utilizing systems\
    \ that will be used by other humans. We will never find an objective truth-- a\
    \ unified code of ethics that will guide us. But in spite of this, we still have\
    \ to try our best. We shouldn\u2019t thoughtlessly make things without even considering\
    \ how it will affect the user. We aren\u2019t just computing machines."
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is  the different ways of information
    transmission and how it is important to know where the source of information is
    coming.
- desc: "Firstly we went through the syllabus and we had a discussion on the ongoing\
    \ topic whether the classes will be offline from feb or the march. We also discussed\
    \ the marking scheme and the credits for research studies. I learned about the\
    \ topic google claiming that apple is bullying android users because they use\
    \ a different Colour for messaging and also about Elmo\u2019s viral feud with\
    \ Rocco the rock. Finally we discussed on the poll topic whether to prefer iPhone\
    \ or android."
- desc: Iphone vs Android. Both operating are superior but each of them have their
    own perks. iPhone&#039;s operating system is is very simple and clean and experts
    say it can be learned by any person but android is more complicated. Good thing
    about Android is that it is an open operating system whereas iPhones have closed
    OS. In terms of data privacy, iPhones are known for it because of their integrated
    design makes security vulnerabilities far less frequent and harder to find. I
    personally prefer iPhones over android
- desc: We discussed about iPhones vs Android in today&#039;s meeting. Personally,
    I have been using an iPhone for several years now, but my first ever smart phone
    was an android. I think there&#039;s not really a bad choice whether you go with
    Android or Apple phones, just know the risks are always the same when it comes
    to your privacy and data being accessed or potentially breached.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was from the videos that were provided.
    the ted talk taught me that morality and decision making can happen in different
    ways. although we as technologists are taught about the mathematics and technicalities
    of decisions and truths, it is important to understand and implement humanitarian
    though processes when discussing moral operating systems.
- desc: I learned today that there are different perspectives and views in society,
    for example Iphone users and android users have created a division between each
    other where Iphone users see android users as inferior. The Iphone users see themselves
    are using devices of higher status. They usually get some sort of gratification
    from using the latest types of phones.
- desc: "Really enjoyed today\u2019s lecture and especially the poll part which was\
    \ quite interesting and uplifted my mood in the morning ."
- desc: "In today&#039;s meeting, we have discussed about the syllabus for CS 280\
    \ class. And discuss about the Google that has said that the Apple \u2018should\
    \ not benefit from bullying\u2019 created by iMessage lock-in. Furthermore, we\
    \ have discussed about the Elmo Addresses Viral Feud With Rocco The Rock and I\
    \ hate how Zoe uses Rocco just to get her own way when she\u2019s around Elmo\
    \ most of the time and literally treats him secondary when it comes to Rocco,\
    \ and Elmo has a really good."
- desc: About the syllabus structure, the opportunity for research
- desc: There were a lot of interesting topics that were discussed today. The most
    important thing I learnt was that knowledge is a powerful tool that can be misused
    if in the wrong hands.
- desc: In todays lecture I got to know about the the syllabus of the course and what
    is the percentage division of each module. Also after the discussion of the syllabus
    we discussed about the videos which professor told to watch  and we did a poll
    about iPhone and android. From the discussion we found the google thinks apple
    is bullying android but atlas of the poll android won. We also had a poll regarding
    if a organization can look at person data or not. The result of the poll was 50/50
    some think that we shoul
- desc: Professor started lecture with the introduction of the course syllabus and
    then went over to the grading scheme as well as how to gain research bonus marks.
    After that there was discussion on videos and reviews on the video. The main question
    discussed today was the iphone vs android. Which one of the brand is better than
    other and google is claiming that the iphone is bullying the android users.
- desc: Omg! After very hard work done by professor finally we were able to see the
    syllabus. The most important thing we have found textbook which really helpful
    for whole winter 2022 semester. I read some of parts which was quite interesting.
    Hope to get more and more information regarding new innovations and its risks.
- desc: SO I think we are the operating system. We have so much power  and with great
    power comes great responsibility. We need to see the action in different angels,
    in different models. What if the outcomes outweigh the unmoral action we did,
    what if the outcomes of our actions benefit the society?
- desc: the most important thing i learned today was the need of digital privacy in
    everyone&#039;s life and how to achieve that. Everyone&#039;s opinions were useful.
- desc: "The most important thing that I learned today is that there are several differences\
    \ between iPhone and Android. I consider iPhone to be much better than Android.\
    \ Despite the fact that Android has progressed a lot during the last years in\
    \ the operating system, the intuitive iPhone\u2019s interface and the simplicity\
    \ of its use, makes iPhone be above of Android. In fact, the prices of each devices\
    \ show the reality of the market. On the contrary, iPhone would not be as expensive\
    \ as it is."
- desc: Today we went through a few comparisons between apple and andriod phones.
    Students gave their suggestions and the reasons for why they choose andriod or
    iPhone. I prefer andriod over iPhone because of some better features like two
    ports , one for earphones and one for charging. We can also open up the battery
    of an andriod phone anytime and there are a list of more features that makes it
    better than iphone. We also learned that using social media is probably selling
    your data for advertising purposes.
- desc: The most important thing I learned from today&#039;s class is there are good
    and bad things in collecting a persons data. This data can be used negatively
    or positively. Positively being that the collected data is used for better usage
    of the site that is collecting data or the site negatively using that data for
    their own gain.
- desc: Todays lecture was great. We started with discussing about the syllabus and
    the book that can help us to learn more on this course. Then, we discussed about
    the in-person classes and the professor provided a poll for that, when we should
    return and the majority opt for march 1. After that there was a discussion on
    climate change and computing. There is some kind of effect on computing by the
    climate change. It is a true fact that when the weather is bad such as stormy
    or rainy weather than the connections b
- desc: I very much agree with the Google&#039;s accusation on apple that iMessages
    can divide people and put on a lot of peer pressure for teens to buy an iPhone.
    Those who have an android phone feel like an outsider in all the social groups
    and this may also lead to depression and anxiety. I believe that the mobile community
    should come up with a plan on how this can resolved in order to stop judging people
    based on use of operating system.
- desc: The meeting did a really good job of highlighting why rules are important
    for the information society. Without any rules things can quickly devolve as a
    few bad actors take advantage to derail the original purpose of a function or
    idea. In our case it was the attempt to poll the class through Zoom. In the future
    I think a much more formal way of tabulating votes is necessary to gain any information.
- desc: I have learned about the connection between climate change and computing.
    Making me understand how computing can help with the real world problem.
- desc: I learned from today&#039;s topic is that computers and programming are like
    superpower that this generations has been granted. It is an amazing skill to learn
    as this field is developing and is increasing. There will be so many job opportunities
    in the future with less people knowing about that since they are not familiar
    with coding/programming. What I also learned is that our privacy and data has
    not been secured because of the social media organization that steal and sell
    our data to different organizations.
- desc: As far as I&#039;m concerned, the iphone is indeed more stable and lasts longer
    than Android. But I think the iphone is too limited, being confined to an already
    designed system, unlike Android which can be cracked and installed with other
    programs that didnt designed by the designer. Of course the iphone can also be
    jailbroken, but I think this is to lose the meaning of the iphone, because you
    can clearly feel the life of the reduced.
- desc: Today we learn about the difference between each phone system. IOS and android
    both has their length and weakness .  Android system good at the development,
    developer can  use many resource. IOS system is more secure
know-more:
- desc: Today we dicuss about what would we whether apple devices or android. It was
    expected by that iPhone will be preferred more over android,but it was totally
    opposite.The reason was that androids are more customizable and cheaper than iphone.
    But Someone told that iPhones are more secure. But I came to know with a video
    which says an hacker hacks iphone immediately after after launch. I came to know
    with a concern that whether iphone is more secure or android. I am using iPhone
    and I didnt great experience.
- desc: After today&#039;s meeting, I would like to learn more about cyber crime,
    data enycrytption, and how laws are applied to people&#039;s data. The ted talk
    about wheather the government should have ascess to people&#039;s data is very
    concerning in our world today since every few months or so there is a news of
    a data breach/leak in government computers, huge social paltforms, or banking.
- desc: How we can find an appropriate balance between individuals&#039; right to
    privacy and the government&#039;s goal of enforcing certain laws.
- desc: One thing that I would like to know more about after todays lecture is the
    laws around internet privacy and protection of user data. How does the government
    avoid these laws and take your data anyway?
- desc: I was understanding little part of todays meeting as I just joined in few
    days back and I had almost no clue about the video that my fellow classmates watched.
- desc: I would like to talk more about how data privacy affects our lives
- desc: I would like to know more about how companies are able to keep taking data
    and information from others without consent and no one is punished. What is the
    purpose of having all the privacy settings and rules on apps, social media, websites,
    etc. if no one follows them. I do not understand how this is legal.
- desc: Today we discussed privacy and collecting user data without proper permission
    especially through phones. I would like to know more about regulations and technical
    details regarding such as Canada privacy policies, User rights, Information protection
    acts, applications permissions, anonymous communication between phones and manufacturing
    servers, monitoring phone activities and processes.
- desc: "I would love to know more about the definition of a \u2018moral operating\
    \ system\u2019 and if there are any criteria for an operating system to be considered\
    \ \u2018moral\u2019. Just like Damon Damon Horowitz said in his TED talk if we\
    \ should look at the guy\u2019s data or leave him alone with his privacy and dignity.\
    \  I am intrigued by the Golden Rule pointed out by him: \u201CDo others as you\
    \ would have them do you\u201D. I would really like to explore and see if using\
    \ this rule we could have a moral framework to guide our decisions."
- desc: "The thing about which I would like to know more relates to the second whiteboard\
    \ question about accessing the guy\u2019s data or not. I would like to know how\
    \ companies are bound by ethics when it comes to data protection and privacy,\
    \ and to what extent they can share/sell a user\u2019s data without their explicit\
    \ permission. Also, is a user able to opt out of a service after agreeing to the\
    \ terms and conduction if they no longer want their data to be stored? The collection\
    \ of data is interesting to me."
- desc: How do phones retrieve certain user data? Sometimes when I&#039;m talking
    to someone about a certain product/ item I get an ad 10 minutes later for that
    product on instagram and/or facebook. Is my phone always listening to my conversations
    or is it pure coincidence?
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more about the blown to bits book. I&#039;m looking
    forward to reading more on the different topics enclosed in the pdf provided during
    today&#039;s lecture.
- desc: The nuances to the pros and cons of looking at someone&#039;s data.  I think
    that there is a lot of good that can be done by examining data, but I would love
    to learn more about the drawbacks of looking at the data.
- desc: One thing about which I would most like to know more is how our participation
    marks are broken down, in more detail. Are our zoom contributions tracked and
    then we are given a mark based on how many contributions we have? Are the zoom
    participation marks half the total 10% participation mark, with the other 5% being
    attendance? More clarification would be appreciated.
- desc: I want to know more about data collection and how in depth it goes. It is
    very interesting how our personal and our information is able to be viewed so
    easily through devices.
- desc: I would like to learn more about how COVID has affected work in today&#039;s
    world and how working from home has impacted the world itself.
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more about how the participation marks work for the
    class. How exactly are they broken down and how do we get them.
- desc: The discussion in the lecture today regarding the iPhone or Android quickly
    became sidetracked and there were a lot of unrelated comments and information
    which was hard to critically analyze. I second with Dr. Hepting&#039;s thoughts
    that whether this chaos actually means we are practicing our freedom of expression
    or it is distracting us from having the important conversations in our society.
    It leads to the question of comparison between the advancement in technology and
    existing laws in place.
- desc: The thing that we talked about today that i would like to know more about
    is how the government and big corporations like google and other services farm
    and use our data. and wether or not it is even possible in this day and age to
    manage how much of your data is being collected. can you stop them or are they
    farming it anyway.
- desc: We just discussed about iphone or andriod which one is better so it was kinda
    amazing like this is present scenario wherein both of the parties are trying hard
    to attract more and more people towards them with adding extraordinary features
    in smartphone but according to me which phone is it doesn&#039;t matter unless
    you can call &amp;amp; text a person !!!
- desc: Banking is closely attached to our daily life. I have always wondered how
    the banking system works, and how they maintain such securities that are almost
    impossible to break through. Nowadays, almost all the banking system is online,
    which is quite impressive but amusing as well. We can do all kinds of work related
    to the bank just using the bank application. How would they maintain such applications
    and securities related to it?
- desc: There was a good debate about android vs iphone
- desc: I actually had no idea about the Canadian government used the pandemic in
    order to access cellular data. This really make one thing about the security and
    privacy rules related to the tech industry. Does new legislation need to be thought
    through in order to protect Canadians?
- desc: "Such a good discussion which allowed all students to participate and really\
    \ feel involved. I personally did not understand why people felt it was necessary\
    \ to fool around with the writing on the whiteboard but overall felt very able\
    \ to participate and listen to everybody else\u2019s responses."
- desc: How do we come up to a conclusion to the problem about data consumption? What
    data is a fair amount to be collected and what kind is absolutely to be not collected?
- desc: I would like to learn more about moral frameworks and just what people believe
    is the most morally correct option given different options. I would be interested
    in learning more about how to go about creating a moral framework and just how
    you could program that into a artificial intelligence.
- desc: the relationship between different platforms and the information privacy
- desc: the thing about which I would like to know more why are we collecting someone&#039;s
    data and  where can we draw a line and more important what ethical decision should
    we make to set our moral code
- desc: I would like to know more about the iPhone and android infrastructure. Such
    as How they provide security to the users and do they follow the same algorithms
    and strategies to do so.?
- desc: I would love to learn more about the legal ramifications that companies face
    when breaking different rules. It would be interesting learning how the rules
    may have changed over the history of technology as humans decide what is &#039;moral
