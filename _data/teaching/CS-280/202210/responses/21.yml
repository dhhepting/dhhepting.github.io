difficult:
- desc: the most difficult thing for me to understand was that how all the controversial
    issues on social media are  biased to one side and how can they ban those who
    oppose without any major issues.
- desc: Why is negativity still a selling point when it comes to media? There is the
    perspective that no publicity is bad publicity but can&#039;t that be a turnoff
    when there is too much of it? If the media is just a bunch of drama and clickbait,
    how can a person understand the legitimacy of the media source? Furthermore, what
    about their understanding of the truth? Shouldn&#039;t the people who have become
    entrenched by social media be desensitized by the fake and catchy titles? What
    might prevent that from happening?
- desc: Based on social media and how we can have meaningful conversations on certain
    topics, I believe it can help to spread important concerns on topics and express
    their opinions and claims. However, it is easier to spread misinformation with
    accessible and manageable platforms. So, what you read on the internet is mostly
    50/50. How are we going to move forward in life if many people who use social
    media are trapped in a toxic environment?
- desc: Last week, we talked about Instagram and violence. Today we talked about the
    violent action of Will Smith. On social media, I see that&#039;s a lot of people
    said that violence in any form is not acceptable. So what about Russian? Violence
    toward Russian is acceptable? I believe not. But a lot of people shows their double
    standard.
- desc: I had internet issues which kept me out of the lecture for a big portion of
    time. I learned the details about the wesite assesment.
- desc: Why in controversial issues, social media tends to be biased to one side and
    bans those that oppose?And what is the purpose behind it
important:
- desc: Discussion of the latest news
- desc: we should be carefull of what we do in public spaces
- desc: The oscars are wildin
- desc: "Discussion on Will Smith slapping Chris rock on prestige Oscars was supposed\
    \ to be staged because the ratings and attention the Oscar used to get  doesn\u2019\
    t get much of it these years . That\u2019s the reason why it was staged According\
    \ to me"
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss that news sources are uses post of social
    media to publish in there article. The news sources should apply judgement and
    analyze unless they are specifically used to show a famous reaction.
- desc: I do think that we need to do change even just for a few people.
- desc: Events like will smith slapping chris rock can be made worse by social media
- desc: today&#039;s class was very interesting the professor told us a way that in
    order to succeed in computer science one should know how to convert reality into
    code or create an algorithm so that it can benefit all of us.
- desc: Today I learned about the importance of paying special attention to the inclusion
    of diverse perspectives in the work force.  Here if we judge people for going
    against the norms or having a different opinion we may lose out because that opinion
    may be what solves the problem we are working on.
- desc: All the controversial issues all social media are very biased to one side
    and will ban those that oppose.
- desc: "I think social media played a major role in presenting the Oscars incident\
    \ transparently. People quickly formed their opinions and chose sides. I personally\
    \ believe that resorting to violence of any sort is not acceptable. Even if you\
    \ are offended, you must strive to address the issue without violence. Having\
    \ said that, joking about one\u2019s mental illness is not acceptable as well.\
    \ As professionals, comedians should draw the line and if lines are crossed, the\
    \ audience need to resolve the issue through talks."
- desc: Today&#039;s discussion on how technology does not allow more diverse voices
    and opinions have intrigued me. I never looked at this matter from the perspective
    of how the controversial issues on social media are biased to one side and will
    ban those that oppose it.
- desc: Next assignment
- desc: Technology help to encourage more divers voices and opinions through its open
    resources.
- desc: To answer the first question that was discussed earlier today, social media
    and other people play a big role to spread a story or information online. With
    the latest issue about the Oscars, it spread quickly and several memes resurfaced
    online. Some say it was staged so that it will be talked in social media. Hence,
    giving more attention to the Oscars event. Honestly, if Chris Rock have offended
    Will, it could have been handled privately.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is that being a taught as a computer science
    professional can change how you view regular situations. It was mentioned in class
    that people who are trained in computer science tend to look at situations in
    a more technical sense instead of looking at the whole reality.
- desc: We talked about the Oscars. We talked about Will Smith, and we talked about
    computer-based communication.
- desc: I learned that technologies, especially social media, discourage the diversity
    of voices and opinions. Most people would rather take sides than to think critically
    about an issue.
- desc: Social media played a role in the Will Smith and Chris Rock story by spreading
    it widely within minutes of it happening. Allowing people to see this on TV (and
    on social media platforms) allows for many people to spread their opinions on
    the matter and potentially &amp;quot;cancelling&amp;quot; either person for what
    they did.
- desc: That certain events in pop culture are staged for publicity.
- desc: how to make cs work for the world instead of vice versa
- desc: The importance of the internet and social media in delivering news and information
    almost immediately, keeping the world and society updated on what goes on close
    by and around the world.
- desc: I learned that although technology can be a great tool for communicating with
    people with various mindsets, it is often the wrong and less meaningful topics
    that are talked about on social media.
- desc: I learned that transparency could help you see the flaws in humans. If the
    show was pre-recorded that altercation would have been edited out before being
    aired. Live streaming creates transparency in processes. Additionally, I learned
    that computer technologies help us have meaningful communication relating events
    that occur in the world. If the incident that occurred at the academy awards happened
    2 decades earlier, conversations of the average individuals will be limited to
    people in their immediate circl
- desc: In Today&#039;s class, we have discussed about the few questions such as computer-based
    technology support us in haring better and more meaningful conversation about
    important issues. what role social media play in how story covered???
- desc: The topic related to computer was quite engaging
- desc: "In todays lecture we discussed about the Chris Rock issue and how professional\
    \ he is as he never changed his expression and keep running the show. And then\
    \ we discussed about \u2018Do computer based technologies support having more\
    \ better and more meaningful conversations about the important issues\u2019. We\
    \ discussed this topic more in detailed and had a good discussion on it."
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture Prof explained about Chris Rock who is very professional
    in his reaction and in choosing not to press charges.
- desc: Today we talk about  role did social media (and millions watching live) play
    in how the story was covered. Do important comments rise to the top of the discussion?
    what perspective is built in to this language?  if we find someone who has a problem
    with this language, what do we do?
- desc: Computer based comms helps us to voice our opinions and also see more diverse
    opinions. Now to fix the world&#039;s problems we need more people to contribute
    to problems, in this way we will have more unique solutions and sustainable future.
- desc: While social media allows for more voices to be heard, it also makes it harder
    to distinguish facts from opinions.
- desc: The most important thing I learned was about the different ways people can
    perceive social media in regards to how useful it is in obtaining true and factual
    information,
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in today class will be opinion on
    role of social media in the play how social media news covered  and mainly point
    given by student that all social media are very biased and examples of it and
    another important thing I learned will be opinion on divide and conquer approach
    when to solve a problem
- desc: Chris rock had it coming
- desc: The most important thing i learnt today was technologies and world issues
    connections.
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about Chris rock and also we spoke about computer
    based technologies.
- desc: "Today\u2019s meeting and discussion about the role of social media in big\
    \ events was interesting to discuss and especially important as, with the example\
    \ given in class about Will Smith, I\u2019ve seen many different opinions and\
    \ many of those opinions have flip-flopped due to what they\u2019ve seen/read\
    \ on social media. This further accentuates the need to regulate how global events\
    \ are being informed on social media to the public."
- desc: The most important thing I have learned today is that social media does not
    get effective only on trending, regardless if the Will Smith and Chris case was
    staged or not. It showed us how the trending working and how the social media
    has affected people and their behaviours and how could trending distract people
    from the bigger issues and most important issues.
- desc: Discussing the oscars incident was pretty entertaining
- desc: News coverage is an important part of public opinion formation. However, due
    to the influence of journalistic philosophy, media business operations, values
    and national interests. The media&#039;s emphasis on objectivity does not exclude
    its tendencies. So we need to have our own understanding and judgment.
know-more:
- desc: Today we talk about the news about a award function which was aired on tv.
    It was trending on twitter. I was thinking about the algorithm which made it trending
    and the role of social media today.
- desc: if we shouldn&#039;t include tweets from people that are unknown or unchallanged
    authority then should twiiter come up with a way to filter how tweets are organized
    in important disccusions?
- desc: I would be interested in knowing if there is any empirical evidence regarding
    whether the most valid opinions rise to the top of social media platforms, or
    if expertise is a more minor factor.
- desc: The thing from today&#039;s lecture that I would most like to know more about
    is the language of the phrase &amp;quot;divide and conquer.&amp;quot; Why do people
    find this phrase as problematic? Same goes from killing two birds with one stone.
    It was changed to feeding two birds with one seed, but that reduces the effect
    of the phrase because if you feed two birds with one seed then both birds only
    get half a seed each which gives a feeling of incompleteness/unfulfillment..
- desc: I am learning that people take a snapshot of the times they are in and assume
    all of history is exactly the same. Take what the discussion on whether technologies
    helping to encourage diverse voices and opinions. The comment that &amp;quot;all
    controversial issues are biased to one side or the other&amp;quot;. It has only
    really been like this for a decade or two, and not necessarily how human beings
    interact with each other naturally. Maybe technology is the cause of that? Maybe
    it isn&#039;t I would like to know more about it.
- desc: 'Today we talked about how social media is playing a key role when it comes
    to dealing with controversial issues as happened in the Oscar event. I believe
    it is a good way to start meaningful conversations but it is important to respect
    others&#039; privacy.  Example: Several people tweeted about Jada Smith&#039;s
    condition &amp;quot;alopecia&amp;quot; after the Oscar controversy. Is it breaching
    others&#039; privacy or getting more attention about an autoimmune disorder?'
- desc: I would like to know more about the web assessment assignment, such as seeing
    a sample of what we are expected to write
- desc: I would like to see a discussion on Elon Musk&#039;s consideration of creating
    a new social media platform and how it will compare to other platforms like twitter.
- desc: About what ways language is harmful for computer scientists.  I believe the
    only term I heard mentioned today was conquer as in the &amp;quot;divide and conquer&amp;quot;
    strategy.  I would love to learn more about this issue and how I can help to create
    an inclusive computer science community.
- desc: More on cons of how technology can help us have more meaningful conversations.
- desc: I would like to know more about computer based communication technologies
- desc: Is about the social implications of tracking software built into Social Media.
- desc: From today&#039;s lecture discussion, I would like to know more about how
    computer-based communication technologies support us in having better and more
    meaningful conversations about the important issues. I would also like to explore
    whether the computer technologies help to encourage more diverse voices and opinions.
- desc: Getting to know more how role of social media play in way some stories are
    covered and how does it affect people and society? Would love to know more about
    it in detail.
- desc: After today&#039;s session I think Nobody expects Canada to dismantle itself
    and return to precolonial conditions. But people do expect this country to acknowledge
    its past, confront its racist foundations and abide by UNDRIP.  To begin, it must
    disavow this Doctrine of Discovery as the foundation for its national policies
    and laws. Decolonization, true reconciliation, demands nothing less. Canada must
    understand that residential schools are only part of the story.
- desc: I have always wondered how the banking system works, and how they maintain
    such securities that are almost impossible to break through. Nowadays, almost
    all the banking system is online, which is quite impressive but amusing as well.
    We can do all kinds of work related to the bank just using the bank application.
    How does they maintain such applications and securities related to it?
- desc: How can blockchain technology be used in different aspects of life?
- desc: is there any list or record of what word triggers what people
- desc: What is curation and how important is understanding it to how we process information
    online? What implications does &#039;who is doing the curation&#039; and &#039;how
    is it managed&#039; have on our modern society?
