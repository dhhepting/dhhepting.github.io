difficult:
- desc: How could block chain be used to mitigate risks and increase rewards?
- desc: Well, regarding today&#039;s discussion, I would have to say that we cannot
    stop others from posting about their opinions or factual content (true or not).
    So, it is kind of hard to decipher a globalized world to only spread the truth,
    because people will believe what they want to believe. Obviously, the risks are
    gaining misinterpretation of different topics due to an opinion based comment
    or just factually incorrect. Fact checking or using block chaining will solve
    our problem, but who is in charge of that?
- desc: As professor told in today&#039;s lecture, he will marked our assignment with
    some comments so we have chance to edit our assignment one. Still we didn&#039;t
    get any comments then how do we supposed to change or edit our assignment-1?
important:
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is to  spread truth instead of misinformation
    there should be a law enforcement body to check the authenticity of the information
    and should not be limited only to variety of computing concepts like information
    on website or articles but also to live news feed
- desc: Today we discussed about the blog entry. The most important thing that we
    discusss today is the  format and refernce that to be given in the blog entry.
    It was very helpful in making my blog.
- desc: The verfication of sources and how to spot sources that could be unreliable.
    one examlpe is a source that has no author or publishing details avaible, therefore
    prevents them from responsiblity.
- desc: The blog post was extended
- desc: Professor discussed about the blog which helped me a lot and gave an idea
    about the blog
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in today&#039;s lecture is that the
    blog due date is no Fri Mar. 11 @ 11:59pm and that we are supposed to answer some
    questions about the sources we used to write our blog.
- desc: New detail and due date of blog.
- desc: Today I developed a better understanding of expectations for the assignment.  We
    learned about hyperlinking correctly, how to critique our works cited page, and
    that the deadline had been extended in order to increase the life expectancy of
    students (reduce unnecessary stress).
- desc: The risk of getting information online is that the information might be incomplete
    or wrong, that will lead to misunderstanding. The benefit of getting information
    online is fast and convenient.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was more information on the Blog
    Entry. It is very useful to know what we are expected of when it comes to citations
    and references.
- desc: today we talked and changed the due date of the blog again, and now it is
    due on Friday.
- desc: Misinformation online will always be an issue as there will most likely be
    no solution to correct the information. Once misinformation spreads, there is
    no way to get rid of it.
- desc: Today we had a brief discussion about the risks and rewards of getting information
    online and checking if the sources we picked are valid and reliable or not. The
    discussion helped students to think twice if the references they selected for
    their blog entries were reliable or not. It was an excellent way to make us accountable
    and more careful about the resources we chose for our blogs.
- desc: ceasing misinformation from the internet is almost not possible. The only
    thing we as an individual can do is take these informations as opinions instead
    of facts
- desc: Today, in class professor told a lot about the blog entry. Information about
    how we are supposed to cite the sources was given. Details about how the sources
    that we will be giving should be reliable and should avoid sources from unknown
    writers.
- desc: I talked to my friends about how to determine whether the information that
    comes online is true or fake and how to accurately distinguish information. I
    think the best way is to find and compare a lot of data.
- desc: That some risks of getting information online is that anyone can put something
    online whether it is true or not. This then allows people to wonder if the information
    they are receiving is in fact correct. An idea to mitigate this is to have a score
    rating on its legitimacy. This, however, can create more issues though (governments
    giving out low scores to sources that go against them). On the other hand, getting
    information online is more accessible at any time you wish.
- desc: I learnt that one can attain a more accurate picture of the truth by diversifying
    one&#039;s sources. A person has to work harder and put in more effort to listen
    to different sources and ideas if they want to actually get closer to an objective
    truth. I know that time is very limited, so we design algorithms and filters in
    order to sort through what&#039;s most &amp;quot;relevant&amp;quot;. But are we
    willing to sacrifice truth for the sake of productivity? How can we get closer
    to the truth if we are stuck inside our own bubbles?
- desc: Most important thing was learning the way we should discuss and include our
    sources in our upcoming blog post
- desc: It is essential to provide all the valuable information about the sources
    to ensure that the research is reliable and performed extensively. I learned how
    to properly select and cite the sources that I will be using to write the blog.
    I also learned about some of the ways/ideas that can be used to spread truth instead
    of misinformation online.
- desc: Blog entry submission date was changed and we had a breakout discussion about
    the importance of technology.
- desc: Today I have learnt about how to avoid spreading misinformation through online,
    we can fact check before we share anything on internet. Always look for author
    and the official pages and verify them and always check for links to other resources
    to backup the claim. We can also check the objective like how it is presented,
    is it personal opinion or is it professional, we can also check the time when
    it was published  and is all the information up-to-date. By doing all these we
    can try to stop the spread of mi
- desc: This is a crucial time in history where we might see a big change in how we
    see that world. Blockchain have introduced a new way to look at tech companies
    and other things. I personally think web 3 will be the future and it can be seen
    in every aspect of life. Like for example rental agreement would be hosted on
    blockchain. Decentralization would bring power back in the hands of people.
- desc: how to mitigate risk and increase reward when getting information online
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, professor explain about the blog entry submission
    and how to submit references to it as well. and also had discussion in a breakout
    session.
- desc: Thank you for extending dues and the conversation about blockchain was just
    awesome.thanks
- desc: What contributes as misinformation? How do we know that something is false?
    People believe what they want to believe at the end of the day. Preventing the
    spread of misinformation is a bit difficult due to the first two questions. Perspective
    plays an important role in evaluating the objective truth. And people do not have
    the time to fact check every little thing either.
- desc: Getting information online is fast, but risky if you don&#039;t know how to
    spot the fake information. It&#039;s even more complicated with the rise of social
    media. Anyone can post and share their thought, some people abuse the freedom
    of speech to spread harmful words, toxicity,. ..
- desc: We discussed spreading truth rather than misinformation online today. What
    are the risks and rewards of getting information online. Ideas for what can reduce
    the risks and increase the rewards
- desc: the discussion on breakout room about rewards and risk of getting information
    online
- desc: In this class of CS280 professor discussed about the deadline tomorrow and
    then we went to the breakout room and gave out our opinion on the topic that was
    discussed.
- desc: Today lecture was quite awesome as we learned more about our blog and professor
    also told us about our submission that how to convert it in html.
- desc: Today the most important thing I learned is that the web blog entry description
    has changed and that I can finally complete the assignment once I finish these
    new changes.
- desc: you can do fact checking before spreading information
- desc: First we discussed about the blog entry assignment and then we discussed about
    how we can spread truth instead of misinformation online.
- desc: Mitigating the risks we take when trying to find information online is a very
    difficult, but important thing to do. With the proliferation of misinformation
    it is vital that everyone is vigilant when seeking out knowledge online or else
    we risk repeating the same wrong information ourselves and making the problem
    worse.
- desc: We can stop the spread of false information by creating some technical and
    human systems that can weed out and minimize the ways in which bots and other
    schemes spread lies and misinformation or to create a fact checker asking for
    resources when a publisher posts any information online. Some risks of getting
    information online can be that the information is false and there is no truth
    based on the information posted. The rewards can be that there are so many reliable
    researches that we can use them as a ref
- desc: the extend of the blog and how to submit the blog.
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about the health field and data protection on it.
- desc: How can we find trust worthy information online
- desc: In today&#039;s class it was about mitigate risks and increase rewards in
    breakout room and I want to know more about this topic.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture prof told all of us about project proposal as some
    of the project proposal was not up to mark so he extended the due date by 14.
    The class was very impressive.
- desc: "Business runs on information. The faster it\u2019s received and the more\
    \ accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information\
    \ because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information\
    \ stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network\
    \ members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production\
    \ and much more."
- desc: how misinformation triggers violence
- desc: I would like to know more about what people define as spreading true information.  Lots
    of what gets posted on social media is opinion based but this can also come across
    as spreading false information. With that I would like to know how other people
    categorize as spreading misinformation or truth.
- desc: The idea of using a blockchain of information.  We discussed it in the breakout
    room I was in.  It sounds like an interesting concept for sure, but I&#039;m not
    entirely sure how it would work and I&#039;d enjoy learning more about it and
    hearing about it.
- desc: How does one spread the truth through the internet and get people to actually
    listen
- desc: The confidentiality of your info.
- desc: The proper morals to have as a member of society, as a youth and as a human
    being because all of this affects the code of conduct one holds and carries out
    as a person in the computer science field. Learning and gaining certain knowledge
    puts one in a position with the access to a wide area of information which sometimes
    leads to the misuse of those information which is an example of poor conduct.
    With great power comes great responsibility. I hope i can gain a few of those
    good morals in this class.
- desc: I would like to know more about the block chain and how it came to be and
    what limitations it might have
- desc: "In todays lecture i learned The rise of \u201Cfake news\u201D and the proliferation\
    \ of doctored narratives that are spread by humans and bots online are challenging\
    \ publishers and platforms. Those trying to stop the spread of false information\
    \ are working to design technical and human systems that can weed it out and minimize\
    \ the ways in which bots and other schemes spread lies and misinformation..."
- desc: In todays class we discussed about the blog entry and what we have to write
    in it. Professor informed that the blog should have at least 4-8 citations and
    also stated that the citations should be from some reliable source. Then we had
    a group discussion on &#039;How can we spread truth instead of misinformation
    online? What are some risks and rewards of getting information online? Any ideas
    about how to minimize risks and increase rewards&#039;. I would like to more about
    the group discussion.
- desc: What can we do to make our information socoety plateform more secure and user
    friendly instead of being owner and profit friendly?
- desc: I really enjoy the knowledge that i am getting from this course it has really
    helped me out on my searching process and its getting more and more interesting
    considering the topics we consider in class and i am very thankful for professor
    knowledge.
- desc: I would like to learn more about the methods used by current fact checking
    algorithms. It seem&#039;s to me that fact checking specific websites, articles
    and more is a near impossible task. Who determines what is factual/how do we define
    what is factual information? As mentioned in class about covid-19, the fact&#039;s
    for Vaccine information has continually changed, and facts known today were not
    necessarily facts. How do we navigate situations like this?
- desc: Why don&#039;t we ever actually learn something in class instead of just going
    over the assignments again and again?
- desc: The thing i would most like to know more how to spread to truth than misinformation
    and the responsibility of  Platform to reduce it ? spreading misinformation it
    too fast what complication can be seen by platform?
- desc: I would like to know more about how can we stop the spread of misleading informations
    online.
- desc: I would like to know more about the block chain as such topics really excites
    me.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, professor explained us about blog. If possible can
    you please post the blog outline? The blog due date has been extended to march
    11.
- desc: After today&#039;s meeting, something that I would like to discuss/cover further
    would be the discussion on blockchain. With issues being brough up in energy consumption,
    high costs, and even scalability, I think that it would be interesting to dive
    further into this topic as it&#039;s something that&#039;s very much important,
    but the cons can be quite costly to many users
- desc: One of the drawbacks of major social media platforms is that it is often difficult
    for users to determine where the messages coming into their streams are coming
    from.
