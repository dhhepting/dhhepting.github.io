difficult:
- desc: I understand the negative effects of social media and how people become addicted
    to their screens and not &amp;quot;the real world&amp;quot; but I do not understand
    how some people don&#039;t understand the benefits to social media. Everything
    people are exposed to that they never would have seen or heard about before or
    the millions of opinions and different values that you learn from complete strangers.
    It&#039;s opened so many possibilities for everyone but the &amp;quot;older&amp;quot;
    generation is too caught up on the negative. It&#039;s frustrating
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more a out the idea of technofeudalism and hod how it
    relates to our normal everyday life today
- desc: I find it hard to understand why would the Saskatchewan government would stop
    reporting Covid cases
- desc: If we want to have a trust worthy data, the data should be consistent. I am
    questioning the decision of Saskatchewan leaders to stop posting daily update
    of Covid 19. Are they stop gathering daily data or just stop collecting data?
    It has been more than 1 week since they posted the last time
important:
- desc: The video by Tristan Harris
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is the pep talk by Steve McConnell
    who is  CEO and Chief Software Engineer at Construx Software where he consults
    to a broad range of industries.
- desc: That google&#039;s results may sometimes be misleading due to a lack of data,
    but google does not explicitly indicate that.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in the lecture today is the details
    about our assignments and what we are supposed to do for them.
- desc: Sometimes charts might not be in the best format for the subject
- desc: That the way we are displaying covid numbers is inaccurate
- desc: A claim right is a legal right that imposes responsibilities, duties, or obligations
    on other persons in relation to the right-holder. A liberty right, on the other
    hand, is a right that implies no responsibilities on the side of third parties,
    but simply flexibility or consent for the right-holder.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss about designing algorithms and the transparency
    which google display in its website. It is very important to show correct data
    because if people think that there are zero cases then they think that corona
    virus is gone and they will not take precaution against covid.
- desc: The no data make everyone sad.
- desc: gogle
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture the prof shows the search result for the covid cases
    in Saskatchewan. Overall, today&#039;s lecture was very impressive and also prof
    told some improvements which google can do.
- desc: Today we discussed how Saskatchewan stopped reporting COVID deaths and how
    we as computing professionals can better design webpages to be more transparent
    by communicating that the daily tally isn&#039;t getting new data.  An individual
    who looks at it might conclude that Saskatchewan has no new COVID deaths.
- desc: Today I learned about Saskatchewan  COVID cases and Death numbers and how
    it is reported in Google or other global sites. There is a variance in numbers
    for sure.
- desc: The government stopped collect COVID case data to make the statistic graph
    become zero.
- desc: learning about the new website project and regrouped as per professors suggestions
- desc: Project Proposal can be in MLA format
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we discussed about the statistics and data about the
    Covid-19 cases and deaths in province have been shown. We also discussed about
    two interesting videos. One of which was related to how some tech companies have
    control over billions of minds.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is that it is important to have a
    system in place that notifies people when data has not been entered.  With the
    sask covid cases, it should mention that data will only be updated weekly so people
    aren&#039;t mislead to believing that zero cases or deaths are being added.
- desc: I think our discussion on the Saskatchewan Covid Cases widget to be very interesting.  I
    think it is really important that if a tool like this is put out, it is either
    entirely accurate, or indicates when data stops.  This would be a much better
    approach than simply showing that there are 0 new cases.
- desc: Watching Tristan Harris Ted Talk, I learned how clever technology and social
    media companies are. They do a lot of things to attract your attention to spend
    more time on their platform. Examples are youtube create autoplay, Facebook and
    Instagram also started doing it too on their video feeds. Social Media&#039;s
    are traps to keep people on their screen and they are doing very well at executing
    it.
- desc: Based on our discussion and videos in class, it really gave me a new perspective
    on technology. Like, sure deep down I knew the people behind these companies are
    not all great, but I wanted to believe they had good intentions. For example,
    people are saying Youtube or snapchat is taking advantage of humanity&#039;s attention
    span and redirecting us to spend more time on our tech. As a undergraduate computer
    science major, it made me think of what difference i want to make in the future
    industry.
- desc: From the videos uploaded on the website, I learnt more about how social media
    platforms are greatly influencing people&#039;s thoughts. It&#039;s impact on
    the youth is even more alarming considering that kids and teens are the easiest
    to be influenced since they are only just shaping their ideas and sense of self.
    I wonder if such a practice can even be considered ethical? Adults often blame
    the youth for being fixated by their phones, but social media is designed to be
    addicting, so are they really to blame?
- desc: We discussed about project proposal due date and website assessment group
    assignment. March 1st is the cutoff for the web assignment request for group set
    up. March 1st we will resume class at the university. We talked about Saskatchewan
    Corona virus Status, Dashboard Saskatchewan.
- desc: Today we discussed about the importance of designing algorithms with transparency,
    we discussed with googles example on displaying covid results which a user might
    take that as correct but as government is censoring them they might not have accurate
    data, to solve this we discussed that it would be better if there is a note below
    the count explaining it.
- desc: I learned that the project proposal is due tomorrow
- desc: How to write a project proposal
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was that the discontinuation of data
    without clarifying that it has been discontinued can be misleading.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is how the technology evolves is
    not natural. There is a competition for our attention and if it remains profitable,
    companies will keep developing strategies to try to keep us hooked on what they
    are selling. Therefore, it is essential that we have checks and balancecs in the
    system that regulates the way this companies are able to target people. Nobody,
    should have the ability to motivate the actions of a particular group of people.
- desc: Today, we have discussed about assignment little bit and later on discussed
    about the transparency of google topic related Saskatchewan coronavirus stats.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was about  claim and liberty rights
    . Before this I knewed nothing about that.
- desc: With regard to Google&#039;s disclosure of COVID deaths, we highlighted the
    need of building algorithms with openness today.
- desc: "In todays lecture we learned about the google page regarding COVID cases\
    \ and how the data is interrupted by the provincial government. As government\
    \ is not responding covid cases and it\u2019s showing 0 cases. So that\u2019s\
    \ the important thing that I learned in todays lecture."
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture, I saw a video which is based on how companies control
    billions of mind everyday by distracting them and besides that they also get benefits
    from it.
- desc: We watched TED TALK today and learned that a handful of tech companies can
    use technology to deliver information and ideas that people want to see. Also
    the digital future can influence the shape of people. That&#039;s why the Internet
    is so important now. While resource sharing is widely used in politics, military,
    economy and science, it also creates various problems, among which security is
    particularly important. Not only does it involve personal interests, corporate
    survival, and financial risks, but it is
- desc: today, initially we discussed some videos on YouTube that were mentioned in
    the class wiki. Then we had brief conversations with each other about the rising
    cases of covid and its adverse affect on mankind. Some also suggested unique and
    innovative measures to overcome it.
- desc: Stick with one style when writing the proposal.
- desc: The most important thing i have learned today is how important it is to design
    algorithms with proper transparency.
- desc: Nothing.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt in today&#039;s lecture was how to write
    an project proposal and its format. And how it can ease up my final project progression.
- desc: In todays class, we discussed about citation format. We also discussed about
    the groups for web project and Covid cases.
- desc: The importance of data visualization. Major decisions are taken at a policy
    and individual level are taken based on how data is presented to us. So if it
    is not done properly, or in a misleading way, it can have major impacts on all
    of our lives.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is about SK cases and the data posted
    on the website to follow up with the news of COVID cases in SK. Also, I learned
    that Computer Science professionals have a roles in collecting data or organizing
    the source of the data or whether the data is correct or not.
- desc: The video was a neat idea to watch in class
- desc: next week is break  and we will back to in person class
- desc: Artificial intelligence itself is not right or wrong, but its users. Just
    as a bullet or a gun does not start a war but is driven by evil, profit-driven
    politicians. The race towards making humans redundant is a political act.
know-more:
- desc: It would be intresting to understand why there was a discrepenice in the data
    shown to the professor and another student
- desc: "Tristan Harris\u2019s video discussed the most important topic: \u201CHow\
    \ we ethically steer thoughts and actions of two billion people\u2019s minds everyday?\u201D\
    . He strongly advocated his views which making a comprehensive shift toward humane\
    \ technology that operates for the common good, strengthening our capacity to\
    \ tackle our biggest global challenges. To tackle this humongous crisis, firstly\
    \ we need to have self-awareness. Step two is transforming design -  a massive\
    \ find-replace all the manipulative ways."
- desc: Where does judgment lie in the absence of humans in software? As software
    becomes more advanced there is less human and more software imitating humans.
    Take for example self-driving cars. One might consider specific scenarios to be
    trolly problemesque in one needs to think altruistic. Should ethical scenarios
    that would involve life and death be left to an algorithm? If so, Who would be
    the one to blame? Does one punish the developer that made the code, the company,
    or is the judgment self-inflicted?
- desc: When would this Saskatchewan covid case chart end? Will it keep saying 0 cases
    everyday for the next week, month...?
- desc: Today we discussed how misinformation can be spread via trustable sources
    like Google. Like the example of the number of covid 19 cases in SK on the last
    1 week. I am willing to know about how we as computer professionals work against
    such misinformation spreading worldwide.
- desc: covid situation in saskachetwan
- desc: Today we mostly spoke about Saskatchewan&#039;s decision to discontinue updating
    the COVID-19 cases. When I first thought about it, I wondered why they would do
    such a thing. I always check the number of cases on a frequent basis in order
    to plan my next movements. Right now, the government of this province is treating
    it as if it were a common cold. I&#039;m not too upset about it, but we should
    still be cautious. I say, keep updating the cases till WHO declares it is the
    end of the pandemic.
- desc: Is why Google doesn&#039;t modify their graph for the covid cases being misleading.
    It would probably cost a decent amount money I guess for them to modify their
    system to somehow figure that out for other provinces as well. It would, however,
    clarify the data if people look back on it/analyze it for other purposes
- desc: I would like to know more about software engineering judgement.
- desc: Is what our classroom will be like with people in person and over zoom.
- desc: Computer professionals are generally responsible for collecting, storing,
    organizing and representing the digital information accurately.  I would like
    to know more about the transparency of all these steps mentioned previously because
    transparency itself is not an ethical principle but it can support ethical behaviour
    and I would be interested in knowing more about it.
- desc: How to setup a project proposal, the sample format was really helpful, thanks
    Dr. Hepting!
- desc: I am not really an expert in writing essays or blogs and I feel like the project
    exercise will help me to improve on my writing skills and information gathering.
- desc: Today we talked about Google search engine and how it works and what were
    it prons and cons... So I think I would like to know more like the things uploaded
    on google are recent and latest or is google lacking..... So I think it was good
    discussion today.
- desc: The government stopped uploading the number of covid cases. The number of
    cases g
- desc: Suppose, I am not happy with google collecting my data, and I am not happy
    with filter bubble either. Then what should I do? Some of those permissions are
    necessary if you want to use the service. Without giving those permissions, someone
    can&#039;t use those services. We don&#039;t have alternatives for all the facilities
    provided by google.  So eventually, it doesn&#039;t matter what your opinion is,
    you don&#039;t have much options!
- desc: Is having a personal data record-keeping system a good idea?
- desc: What are some resources I can use to better understand risks in programming?
- desc: Todays lecture was amazing it started with the attendance. After that there
    was a discussion on how tech companies control millions of mind and how such companies
    effect us. We also talked about our project proposal.
- desc: I would like to know more about what laws are currently in place that promote
    and encourage transparency in statistics, news, and other online information sources.
    I would also like to know more about how to create different programs that provide
    transparency.
- desc: how accurate the covid statistic is
- desc: The thing i would like to know how more statistics given by google and why
    countries not testing more about the Covid cases
