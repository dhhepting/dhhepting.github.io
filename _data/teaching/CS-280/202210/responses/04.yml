difficult:
- desc: I really could not understand the concept that how can computing be helpful
    in minimizing the effects of global warming.
- desc: We talked about how the class will change in the future due to COVID-19. And
    an iPhone Android survey was conducted.But I don&#039;t know if we&#039;ll go
    to school or continue online classes after March.
important:
- desc: "In today\u2019s class we discussed about returning to the on campus classes\
    \ or doing it remotely. I would go with remote classes because of this covid thing\
    \ and the discussion about the groups."
- desc: There is more than one way to look at a persons phone choice, are they secure,
    is it for convenience, or status (blue bubbles vs green bubbles)? Not just for
    entertainment.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss about the ted video and most of responses
    was in favor of iPhone than android from the poll. This video is not about the
    personal opinion whether they like to used iPhone or android, In this video Damon
    Harowitz show how complex thinking are we having about making wright or wrong
    decision. In this video he tells us to make moral decision.
- desc: The iPhone or Android Choice question is not about the answer, it&#039;s about
    how we think this problem.
- desc: In terms of looking the data in other&#039;s phone, the owner of the phone
    should been told about this action and the reason why the data is needed to be
    looked. However, it is very easy to get personal information from the social media,
    because as long as we register an account for a social media, our personal information
    is required.
- desc: I would like to discuss more effectively on the effects of computing on climate
    change and COVID-19. I do think that computing has increased the degree of climate
    change by a certain extent. Global computing is responsible for greenhouse emissions
    and carbon footprint. The thing I would like to know more about is blockchain
    technology. This technology is a breakthrough in how we record and protect information
    digitally.
- desc: The discussion of looking at the data on someone&#039;s phone. I more leaned
    towards that the data should be acessed but I can definitely see the appeal in
    the opposing argument. People need to be following of the law but at the same
    time their values when it comes to privacy should be valued too. It obviously
    depends on the severity. With vaccine passports, omicron is evading vaccines,
    so the question remains if that vaccine data is usefull when getting covid is
    publicly seen as enevitable wherever you go out.
- desc: "Today we have learned about how the algorithm of search will limit people\u2018\
    s knowledge of the world. The algorithm will circle people in a comfort zone which\
    \ is bad for people to realize the real world, we should stop this situation and"
- desc: We started with minor choices like iPhone vs android, but the most precious
    thing that I learned today was how we should be mindful and considerate while
    making any decisions in our lives. As our every action has an equal and opposite
    reaction. So we should take all the pros and cons into consideration and make
    an ethical judgment before we take any decision.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is the extra details for returning
    to face-to-face learning in March. Even tho I&#039;m in the remote section of
    this class, I&#039;m still glad that there will be extra slots so that students
    will be able to switch from face-to-face to remote learning. I&#039;m also grateful
    that Professor Hepting, took the time to conduct surveys for the class. In regards
    to the topic today, I actually made a quick research and saw that Android collects
    more data than Apple.
- desc: how computing could be contributing towards pollution and how could we let
    the users know about it
- desc: "The most important thing that I learned today was administrative topics.\
    \ I felt that everything in the syllabus was explained clear and concisely. My\
    \ questions from the past lecture and uncertainty\u2019s in the syllabus were\
    \ addressed. Also I thought it was interesting to see that roughly 50% of the\
    \ class uses iPhone and 50 use android, which contrasts with the 50/50 opinion\
    \ of phone data collection."
- desc: In today&#039;s discussion, we had a pole about iphone vs android. 39 voted
    iphone and 31 voted for Android. I thought it would be 50/50. We also briefly
    discussed about collecting data and I learned that it is done because it is to
    ensure that no one is a security threat and we make judgements based on it.
- desc: "That sometimes there may be a good logical reason why it may be important\
    \ to look at someone\u2019s data. An example discussed in the Ted talk and mentioned\
    \ in class was that so they can ensure that the person is not a security threat.\
    \ The way I kind of see it is similar to police randomly pulling you over and\
    \ wanting to search your vehicle even though you may haven\u2019t done anything\
    \ wrong and they don\u2019t have a warrant. It is for the safety of others but\
    \ it can be infringing on your privacy, etc"
- desc: I have learned or have to come to realize that it&#039;s going to be really
    challenging t to get out of this covid pandemic. It seems like every few months
    we make good progress, but then some new type of variant comes out and forces
    us to go back to square one. I think computing can be highly beneficial in the
    early detection of new variants and maybe this can help us finally defeat the
    virus.
- desc: Social media platforms have a responsibility to the greater good because they
    have the power to influence the way people think and act.
- desc: I learnt how making complicated decisions forces one to think broadly and
    deeply about the specific and detailed reasons why one would pick or choose a
    certain thing over another.
- desc: Today we have discussed about IN person and remote class. we had a poll saying
    which one is better Android or iPhone. Then we many people selected iPhone compared
    to Android. Both has there own identity and are superior in their own features.
    I can say some features iPhone is better and in some features Android is better.
    we also discussed some points on proof of stake and security on it.
- desc: In todays lecture we discussed about some polls that professor have created
    for students to know what they think. First poll was on when we should start in-person
    classes, we also a discussion about two different sections of classes. The second
    poll was Android vs Iphone. In this poll 55.7% people selected iphone and rest
    selected android. This poll was based on whether we should look at the data or
    not. The outcome of the discussion was that we should look data to check for security
    threats and not for doi
- desc: The matter of privacy on an individual&#039;s device is a hot topic ever since
    the computation has been introduced to mankind. And according to Damon Horowitz
    it is a real struggle whether we should collect the data or not. I personally
    have used both Android and iPhone and it is not easy to choose iPhone&#039;s privacy
    or Android&#039;s super user friendly interface. Therefore, we really need to
    work towards Damon Horowitz &#039;moral operating system&#039; and try to explain
    people not to be devil.
- desc: First of all professor discussed about the inperson or the remote classes
    preference of the students based on the polls on urcourses. Professor then discussed
    about the grading scheme of metting response and attendence. Professor then discussed
    about the iphone vs android question by urcourses polls majority of students selected
    iphone as their choice. Also discussion took place on we should look data or leave
    it and why was the question. then in breakout rooms discussion took place on last
    lecture topics
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is the difference between Hybrid
    class and Hyflex class. As well as we did three different activities which is
    similar to poll or voting activities. The activity includes choices of students.
    One of them is regarding return to in-person and in that activity we need to select
    on date among two options. Second one is regarding happy with the class of CS280
    session or we are going to switch section? and, The third and last one is regarding
    iPhone or Android.
- desc: Discussions about in person and remote teaching were carried out . Reasons
    for monitoring ones personal data was given. To avoid a person from misusing systems
    and for security reasons, information of personal data has to be collected. But,
    only known officials should have access to it and it should be made sure that
    the private data does not leak in common public.
- desc: Today was mostly about polls like Iphone vs android, happy with your section
    and for return to in-person.
- desc: Class can get seriously derailed by course admin conversations.
- desc: "In todays class, we discussed about remote and face to face learning. I\u2019\
    m from the remote section but still I suggest that you can continue the face to\
    \ face section also in the remote till end of feb. Because of Covid everyone is\
    \ getting effected."
know-more:
- desc: I am looking forward to reading the textbook and learn more about the moral
    operarting system. Also, I would like to know more about how the project and asssignments
    will be handled.
- desc: We did not cover any course material today. I would be interested in knowing
    more about the reasons people make the choices they do regarding technology (such
    as android vs iphone). It is just whichever you buy first that you stick with,
    or some sort of preference?
- desc: The things I would like to know more about from todays lecture is how social
    media is affected by computing, and what obligations do social media platforms
    have to the greater good.
- desc: If computer chips and circuit is making the environment worse
- desc: I would like to talk more about the effect of crypto on power consumption
    and how that effects the rest of the world, through climate emissions from generated
    power for example
- desc: I would like to know more about how companies/organizations/people get around
    the security on platforms and collect people data without anyone knowing.
- desc: i want to know more about the project
- desc: Today&#039;s meeting was very interesting because covid is effecting life
    of people very much and users of technology are increased whether they are iphone
    or Android users but I personally believe that iPhone are more secured than Android.
- desc: I would love to know more examples about privacy issues regarding computer
    science. Learning about how the government and even private companies have so
    much information about is really eye-opening. It would also be interesting to
    learn about the different methods of how these institutions collect our information.
- desc: "Today we discussed how computing interacts with climate change and Dr. Hepting\
    \ indicated that he wasn\u2019t as interested in emissions so much as how we can\
    \ we can use computing to generate actionable information. We then discussed Etherium\
    \ changing to proof of stake and how it is decreasing emissions. I am really interested\
    \ in finding out more about the scope of how we are analyzing these issues. How\
    \ do we determine what is important? Is it a truly open ended answer or are we\
    \ expected to look at specific aspec"
- desc: As discussed in class briefly today it&#039;ll be nice to learn how the final
    project and assignments/ tests will be for the class as they&#039;ve not been
    mentioned yet.
- desc: Today we recorded the poll regarding choices between iPhone (55.7%) and Android
    (44.3%). I would like to know more about specific establishments why one mobile
    OS is better than another when it comes to Data Protection, User Functionality,
    Security, Privacy Issues, and Collecting Data. It is also very important to list
    all recent mobile threats or breaches and compare both OS, for example iPhone
    Pegasus breach.
- desc: I would like to know more about how coronavirus has effected the data industry.
    Has the industry increased due to a bigger reliance of online systems, or has
    it decreased because of the virus? Also, what changes/accommodations are needed
    in an information system to accommodate users during a pandemic?
- desc: I would like to understand everyones opinion on the iphone/android debate.
    I personally chose android for various reasons.
- desc: Will the final exam be on campus even if you signed up for the remote learning
    class?
- desc: I&#039;d like to know a lot more about the contents of the book that was provided
    as reading material during the today&#039;s lecture. More specifically I&#039;m
    referring to &amp;quot;Blown to Bits&amp;quot;. I&#039;m curious as to what sorts
    of societal insights this book contains. I&#039;ve read up to the first few pages
    and so far I&#039;ve learned that this book is not about computers. It&#039;s
    about people&#039;s lives and how we as members of society live our lives, for
    better or for worse alongside computer technology. I want to know more about ethics
- desc: In today&#039;s class we learned about how participation is really important.
    How&#039;s there&#039;s different ways to participate in class by being active
    and all. But I&#039;m curious about the next class as we&#039;re finally given
    task to read the chapter 1 of book and to go through about it in next class would
    be very interesting. So I&#039;m eager to know most about the next topic in next
    class.
- desc: I would like to know more about the assignments and the project. I have never
    really done a complete computer science project before so I am excited to hear
    about how and what we are going to do for a project for this course. I would also
    like to know how many assignments there will be in this course.
- desc: The project!  I am very curious to hear about what the project will entail.  Will
    it be more similar to an essay format, or will it be something that we code to
    demonstrate the risks or rewards with computers being so abundant?  I&#039;d also
    like to start to budget my time to account for it.
- desc: We&#039;ve mentioned about proof-of-work and proof-of-stake in class, I would
    like to know more how these two concepts work in the cryptocurrency world.
- desc: Today, I learned briefly about blockchain technology, where it creates a safe
    environment to record and store information without it being easily accessible
    by hackers or easily changeable information. I would like to learn more about
    the risks of information technology and how people are modifying the code to hack
    and trace peoples&#039; digital footprints. When has technology become an unsafe
    environment? Will we ever create a public-friendly, healthy environment to use
    without it causing any privacy breaches?
- desc: I am really interested in the category of whether or not COVID-19 has had
    an impact on computing. In a major pandemic that has last now over 2 years what
    would of been different if the pandemic never happened? What kind of things would
    of improved? There is so many what ifs to COVID-19 never happening the list could
    go on for days.
- desc: I would like to know more about how our society is evolving with cryptocurrencies
    and how this affects global economies and computer programmers as well.
- desc: the thing i am most interested in knowing more about would be is there a possibility
    that covid responses could have been helped with technology. From my understanding
    of how things went we did just that and took never before seen measures for fighting
    a pandemic based on a computer model and it has failed miserably and may lead
    to the worst depression North America has ever seen while not stopping or even
    helping to stop the spread.
- desc: Although we only mostly went through administration stuff in today&#039;s
    lecture, there are a lot of things I look forward to learning about in the future
    (which we partially discussed before). I want to know more about other ethical
    considerations that we should be aware of in computing. I also would like to know
    more about the good and bad impacts of computing that I am still ignorant of.
    Overall, I want to know what else I should be considering in this line of work.
- desc: How many assignments in this course
- desc: "I would like to learn more on the topic of &amp;quot;How to make complicated\
    \ decisions&amp;quot; based on the discussion in today&#039;s meeting about Damon\
    \ Horowitz&#039;s question in the video - Whether we should look at the data on\
    \ somebody\u2019s phone or leave them be? According to me, there might be a lot\
    \ of good reasons behind collecting the data but ultimately, the question that\
    \ arises in my mind is whether this would be considered as a breach of an individual&#039;s\
    \ privacy regardless of whatever the reasons for collecting data be?"
- desc: The thing we discussed in class today that i would like to know more about
    is how our use of technologies especially things like crypto mining has an effect
    on the environment, and to what extent our use of crypto has effected things like
    global warming, more so how things like proof of stake are influencing these things
    and how important they are to our ecological footprint
- desc: The thing about which I would most like to know more about is the detail Risk
    and Reward in the information society. So I can apply that knowledge to my other
    classes, and standard of life. I can also use that knowledge in my day to day
    activity which will help me in my daily activities. I would really appreciate
    it if you the professor would explain about the topic in a constant tone so it
    will be easier for note taking .Good to see you Doctor with much appreciation
    .Hopefully we&#039;ll return in class.
- desc: Today I had missed few minutes of the class and was unable to record the attendance,
    but I had been in the discussion, we had discussed on previous class topic about
    android or iPhone. I would more like know about Blockchain technology and their
    work idea.
- desc: I wanna learn more about the effects that computing has on our modern world,
    including benefits and potential dangers. I feel like this topic can be elaborated
    on and can offer a good and deep discussion.
- desc: I would like to discuss more about the potential computing has with slowing
    down environmental issues and the remainder of the pandemic.
- desc: Today&#039;s session was quite interesting ...Today&#039;s topic was whether
    classes are gonna be offiline or not and looking at present increasing rate in
    covid-19 cases i think its better if students continue with their online classes
    and stay safe until situation gets normal!!!!
- desc: Giving out our emails/information has become quite normal these days. I want
    to know more about decision making process and what makes a site &amp;quot;trustworthy&amp;quot;
    or not. The iPhone vs Android discussion did seem quite silly at first but after
    this question, it really does make one think.
- desc: "Various cryptocurrencies like Ethereum came to existence in the last few\
    \ years. I don\u2019t know much about them, but I guess it&#039;s a currency based\
    \ on computers, which has some mining kind of stuff from which we can get this\
    \ kind of currency and then we can secure the currency that we mined by setting\
    \ some kind of security password! This mining causes a lot of power consumption.\
    \ As I said, I don\u2019t know much about this stuff and I&#039;m not sure if\
    \ what I wrote above is correct or not. So, I would like to know more."
- desc: How long could we and the university be able to access to campus? The new
    covid variant is spreading at an unbelievable speed, more and more people will
    be infected. I&#039;m afraid things will go bad that we have to go back to online
    learning again. We just miss the campus vibe so much, do you agree?
- desc: Social medias like facebook and instagram have grown thousands of relationships
    worldwide but are they really good at keeping the private data of their customers?
- desc: To know about what has been taught today
- desc: Companies release new devices every year. How much does this effect the environment?
    I also think that the consumers also play a big hand in degrading the environment
    through buying technology more often. What would be the best practice in upgrading
    one&#039;s devices and how this can help the planet in a positive way?
- desc: Todays lecture was almost all about remote and in person classes. As, the
    professor said that the decision is on us weather to get in campus or still online.
    And there was a poll weather to open in person 7 Feb or 1 march. After that there
    was a small discussion on iPhone vs android and how COVID affecting computing
    and want to know more about this. :)
- desc: I would certainly like to know more about the various ways covid-19 has affected
    the world and influenced us to use online solutions to get around the problems
    that COVID-19 has caused us as a society.
- desc: what is the existing worst case of covid affacting computing
- desc: the thing I would most like to know more will be how looking into some person&#039;s
    data is good thing? Is&#039;nt invasion of privacy ? When we search any product
    page in Facebook  next we receive 100 of ads from companies regrading the product?
    is&#039;nt invasion or forcing the customer to buy it ? I am little confused about
    it and how can we set moral code ? and how can companies set their  moral code
    and how can they make any judgement regrading this?
- desc: I would like to know more about computing&#039;s role in both fighting/mitigating
    climate change but also how it&#039;s making it worse. It seems like it has great
    potential to help us. But, like with many other topics, it can also make things
    worse. Blockchain&#039;s massive energy use comes to mind as one example.
- desc: I still confuse about how student register to the in personal class or to
    the online class and when we should do that
