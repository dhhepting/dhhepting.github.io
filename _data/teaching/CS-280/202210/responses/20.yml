    can reduce the amount of money they spend on leasing, renovating and maintaining
    office space. employees no longer need to waste time commuting to and from work
    and Increased their work flexibility'
important:
- desc: the most important thing that I learned was the limitation of hybrid that
    how the in person interactions have changed from being lively to the fear of COVID-19
- desc: The various point of view regarding hybrid work place
- desc: Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have thought that having to go into
    a place of work where it was not absolutely necessary was a silly thing to do,
    and the reason for doing so was to keep middle management employed and realty
    afloat. Upon hearing my contemporaries theories on what the risks of hybrid work
    environments were, I have bolstered my previous opinion.
- desc: Hybrid work environments are not bad but they have any risks
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss that work for home it is good or not.
    There are many answers for this question and according to me it is good because
    it increase the opportunities. If a person is living in Regina he or she can work
    for company which is located in Toronto. Specially it can save some money because
    their is lot more rent and other expanses than Toronto.
- desc: Today I learned about the benefits and costs of work places moving online.  There
    is actually a lot of benefits I didn&#039;t realize.  I hadn&#039;t thought much
    of telecommuting but I it seems like it could be really profitable to look into
    coding jobs in Vancouver online.
- desc: Today we discussed how the Hybrid work environment impacts our lives. I believe
    a Hybrid work environment is a good solution for any emergency situation but the
    office environment ensures employee interaction and time management.
- desc: Hybrid isn&#039;t a bad idea, but may erode work ethic. Hybrid is better for
    balancing the work and life. Remote is more convenient, and will also be helpful
    for mental health.
- desc: "I liked our discussion about the risks and rewards about a hybrid work/school\
    \ environment.  The benefits of a hybrid culture include: employee\u2019s freedom\
    \ to choose remote/in-person depending on family situation, environment friendly,\
    \ economic advantages, healthy work-life balance and time-efficient. The risks\
    \ are: evasion of work-ethic, in-person experience limited due to hybrid, company\
    \ infrastructure budget greatly increased, local business getting affected due\
    \ to stay-at-home job."
- desc: The most important thing i learned was discussing working from home and the
    pros and cons of a hybrid model
- desc: Having hybrid work or hybrid classes have both benefits and disadvantages.
    It really depends on the individual and their personality.
- desc: Today&#039;s breakout discussion helped me realize how hybrid learning has
    both a downside and plus points. I liked how the class came up with all their
    possible explanation and understandings about the key concepts.
- desc: Assignments
- desc: Hybrid is better for work life balance
- desc: In my opinion, companies will implement hybrid working has its risks and benefits.
    One advantage is that it allows people to work from anywhere they choose and saves
    time on travel. Adapting to a hybrid working environment will need a significant
    amount of effort initially, but it will be well worth it. On the other hand, the
    disadvantage that I could think of is cyber security. Companies will need to constantly
    secure their digital footprint through software and two or multi-factor authentication.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, the professor explained and gave more info about the
    critique of the blog entry. In the main discussion today, there was an interesting
    topic about the hybrid work environment. In my opinion, some number of people
    working online from home can have good benefits. The requirement for large office
    premises is greatly decreased when fewer workers come into the office each day.
- desc: I found it very interesting to hear all of the drawbacks about continuing
    to work from home or having a hybrid work environment.  I couldn&#039;t think
    of any myself, so it was very interesting to see and hear so many other perspectives
    that I hadn&#039;t considered before.
- desc: We discussed about advantages and disadvantages of remote working. In my opinion,
    remote working has much more advantages. I think if I work from home, I can use
    my time effectively and save money.
- desc: Today, we talked about the risk and rewards of hybrid class. It was interesting
    to know that some prefer online than in person. I prefer in person because I cannot
    concentrate online because of distraction at home. Although, advantages of online
    is it saves you transportation and time which is nice too.
- desc: I learned that hybrid/remote work save money for the employers and the employees
- desc: By having hybrid work schedule, companies need to be able to organize who
    comes in on which days of the weeks. As well, people would most likely be sharing
    desks because there would be no need for everyone to have their own. That brings
    up the need for separate lock up filling cabinets/locked safes in each cubicle/desk
    to keep confidential information inaccessible if sharing desks
- desc: Based on our discussion today about hybrid classes, I believe the main rewards
    are flexibility, saves money, and time. Because for me, I have a hybrid cs115
    class and being able to attend online lectures has been a life-saver, since it
    has increased my productivity and engagement with the topics. However, I do think
    a risk is missing out on campus and less socializing has taken a toll on my mental
    health too, but its not bad. Hence, hybrid is really useful for education and
    work opportunities.
- desc: I learnt that there may are many pros and cons to implementing a hybrid model
    into our work post-covid. These positives and negatives vary depending on if it&#039;s
    for school or for work. For instance, learning remotely makes it more accessible
    to people living farther away from school. On the other hand, this might also
    lower a student&#039;s motivation to study if their preferred learning style is
    to be surrounded by their peers. Learning remotely might also allow a student
    to balance work and life a bit easier.
- desc: We learned more about how to work on the blog critique assignments and web-assessment
    assignment. Further, we also discussed about the risks and rewards of hybrid/remote
    work. Hybrid not a bad idea, but may erode work ethic, and lead to blurred work/home
    boundaries but it does help in achieving better work/life balance. Hybrid is cost
    efficient for employees as they can save on transportation costs.
- desc: Today we discussed about the risk &amp;amp; rewards of hybrid (in-person/remote)
    and we discussed that hybrid isn&#039;t a bad idea but it may limit the in-person
    experience but the main advantage of hybrid is for the people who work as they
    can attend the class at their convenience and the disadvantage of being remote
    is it may  affect social life and might affect education as you might not be able
    to concentrate on your studies as you will be at home. The advantage of remote
    is it may save your transportation fees.
- desc: Getting to know the risks and rewards of hybrid/remote classes. Risks would
    be students would procrastinate a lot and rewards would be students could study
    at their own pace if the lectures are recorded.  Hybrid isn&#039;t a bad idea
    but it erodes work ethic.
- desc: ''
- desc: I learned the advantages/disadvantages of hybrid work and study. Hybrid work
    has a few disadvantages like increased infrastructure costs incurred by the company
    from providing extra working materials to employees who work from home; Mental
    health risk associated, individuals who are introverted find it difficult to communicate
    to people and this could lead to higher depression/suicides. Although, it has
    some negatives, I believe the positives outweigh the negatives. For example, there
    is opportunity for the
- desc: In today&#039;s class, prof has  discussed about bog critique submission and
    web assessment which is group project related. Later on we has a breakout session
    for discussion that mandates for working form office? As 20% employees  quit immediately
    if they were made to be in office every work day.
- desc: In todays lecture professor provided the information about the web assessment.
    He told to answer the questions listed in the description of assignment. We also
    discussed in the class about mandating the work from office. So, for that we checked
    the survey of 20% employees said that they will quit if they need to work from
    office. So, now we looked at the option that should it be hybrid or not. In the
    breakout room we discussed what are risk and reward of working becomes hybrid(i.e.
    from home or office).
- desc: Todays lecture gave me a broad knowledge about critique as i was so confused
    regarding it and also the discussion was so engaging. Thank you for that .
- desc: We talked about the risks and rewards associated with hybrid system for working.
    We considered both in person and remote workings, and analyzed their pros and
    corns carefully.  One biggest drawback of remote working is that it can probably
    disturb work-life balance. In person working would help in developing more collaborative
    and team-working spirit. We can save some money while working remotely as we don&#039;t
    have to spend money for transportation, and that is good for environment too.
- desc: Different people will have different preferences. Some people might work better
    in remote while some might work better in-person.
- desc: Talked about the blog submission and critique and also how to answer the questions
    given in the CS280 website. Also, we went through the grading scheme. Discussed
    about the working from home and in-person as well as hybrid in the breakout room.
- desc: As in today&#039;s lecture we discussed about risks and rewards of hybrid,
    which we are facing since Covid-19 started. Some struggled with their work, other
    side some struggle with their study from home and when all are used to do either
    study or work from home they are struggling go back to in person.
- desc: I&#039;m working remote full time and it has been great so far. However, I
    miss the workplace&#039;s vibe and I&#039;m ready to go in person. Hybrid working
    is not a bad idea at all, I wish company can allow employee to work 2-3 days at
    the office and 1-2 days remotely. I&#039;ll help creating a balanced working environment
- desc: Today we discussed how the on-site experience is limited due to the need to
    collaborate with remote locations. Hybrid systems are more conducive to work/life
    balance, remote work is also beneficial for mental health, transportation savings
    - budget, environment
- desc: Hybrid workspaces, are likely the way of the future. Especially for those
    of us in computer science! While hybrid work is definitely a double edged sword,
    I really believe that it can be truly beneficial. It does make sense that the
    work-life balance line is being blurred and many extroverts may have trouble motivating
    themselves in these circumstances. I still feel the good outweigh the negative.
    Not having to commute everyday is a major time saver and working from the comfortability
    of your home is great
- desc: Today explanation was given on website assessment. The discussions were held
    on how effective is the hybrid system of working? Are people satisfied with it
    or it requires changes . Breakout rooms were appointed to discuss the same.
- desc: Working from home can have some benefits and some drawbacks.
- desc: Today, meeting started with a warm welcome from professor Hepting. After that
    we discussed about what is there in the news, such as about &#039;mandates for
    working from office?&#039;. At the end professor made breakout rooms and we all
    discussed about &#039;what are the risks and rewards of hybrid in-person/remote?&#039;.
    And at the attend there was attendance.
- desc: reward of hybrid is people get more chance to take class with long distance
    from campus, risk is chance to cheat in exam
- desc: Hybrid might erode focus on work tasks
- desc: I learned that hybrid work arrangements are probably the best path forward.
    They allow the best way to maximize the benefits of both in-person and remote
    work while also limiting the downsides. There are still risks involved, of course,
    however those risks can be mitigated.
- desc: The most important thing I have learned is about the pros and cons of Hybrid
    and office working and studying. Hybrid is not a bad idea, but it could cause
    some ethical issues for work or school. In-person experience is more time-consuming
    and does not provide many opportunities for people. While hybrid can let people
    from two different destinations work together.
- desc: It was interesting to discuss the pros and cons of hybrid learning and what
    aspects of which are preferred over others.
- desc: the risk for in person is the time is not flexible, but it will be better
    for teacher to teach. For remote  session, i may easier  for  student to cheat
know-more:
- desc: Today we discussed about critique and about the hybrid meetings which is better
    either it is better or the other method is better than this one

    a 4 day work week, could a hybrid apporch harm human interactions
- desc: What is the actual evidence on work ethic and work/life balance with respect
    to working from home? My anecdotal experience suggests people work more from home,
    since there is no clear separation between work/life.
- desc: The thing that I would most like to know about from today&#039;s lecture is
    the hybrid/ remote job opportunities in bigger cities such as Vancouver and Toronto
    that was mentioned by another student. Because we also discussed the pros and
    cons of hybrid work I think that these remote job opportunities will be a great
    way to get started in the industry and get some experience over the summer.
- desc: How a 4 day work week will improve life.
- desc: "More about today\u2019s breakout discussion"
- desc: "The class was very impressive initially the prof told us\_how to compose\
    \ blog critique entries and were given instructions on how to begin working on\
    \ the website assessment project also the marks for the project proposal will\
    \ be updated today. I just wanted to know more about the final exam."
- desc: I would like to know more about how people are finding hybrid work. Hearing
    that 20% of employees do not want to go back to the office really surprised me.
    I would like to know more about what actual workers like and dislike about remote
    vs in-person working.
- desc: I would like to know more about the hybrid life/work balance and the statistics
    on what people think on it
- desc: "I\u2019d like to get better insight on the kind of sway employees as a majority\
    \ have on employers"
- desc: "Early days and I have learned a lot on how to utilize internet for improving\
    \ better risk management systems. However, the rest of what I have worked on today\
    \ depended more on how the past lectures were. I have tried, in my project proposal,\
    \ to describe more about how the importance of social media has created varied\
    \ understanding and misbelief in the mind set on many people. Owing to today\u2019\
    s lecture, I have got a new point to research more on my project. Knowing this,\
    \ I would discuss it in my project."
- desc: Today I researched more about mandates and i discussed it with my self why
    would people love to sit at home and do their work but not going to office regularly
    i believe going to office is a better option it keeps us in work environment and
    can be really helpful.
- desc: Is work from home a better option than working in person?
- desc: the thing about which I would most like to know more is the Risk and Reward
    in the Information Society
- desc: I would like to know more about how being online has impacted jobs, businesses,
    employers and workers.
- desc: The thing I would like to know more will be today about hybrid office/home  in
    breakout room and class we discussed about life/work balance and communication
    and how effects done to work ethic and time and moneysaving and mental health
    is helpful in remote class and valid suggestions from students
