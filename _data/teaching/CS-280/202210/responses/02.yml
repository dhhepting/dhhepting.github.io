difficult:
- desc: I understand that nearly everything and anything is touched by computing but
    what I&#039;m finding difficult to understand is how climate change causes a problem
    for computing. Is it the manufacturing of computers that create climate change
    issues?
important:
- desc: The most significant thing which, I learned in today&#039;s meeting was that
    how much much world is touched by computing. For instance - Main idea discussed
    in our meeting was the influence of the computing over financial markets and cryptocurrency.
    The difference computing has made to the development of blockchain applications
    and the way it has created a void between centralized assets and de-centralized
    assets. Overall, I understood how the financial markets are based on computing.
- desc: The most intresting and important thing i learned today is how climate change
    and covid19 affected computing through electritcy but also the creation and dumping
    of computer parts. Another thing was comparing societies in our world today that
    are either too reliant on computing compared to the rare communities  who are
    not touched as much by computing. This clearly showed both the pros and cons of
    being too touched by computing.
- desc: The quote by David Foster Wallace was interesting and thought provoking. We
    often take for granted the things around us and sometimes do not even notice them
    or appreciate their effects if they are all that we have known, and it can take
    an outside observer to point something out for us to realize &#039;oh, that&#039;s
    a thing&#039;.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in the lecture today is how to tell
    if something is misinformation, by knowing the source, reading beyond the headline,
    checking the date, researching the author, and asking questions about the information.
- desc: I had to think really hard about ways that are NOT touched by computing in
    our society, and how hard it would be to get away from any and all types of computing.
    We are absolutely surrounded by computing in our daily lives, to the point where
    we are becoming symbiotic with technology.
- desc: According to me in every sector we can found that is run by computers and
    our life become easy. With the computer technology we can predict the weather
    and saves many life&#039;s for examples if we came to know about floods, tsunami
    and climate change is going to happen we can evacuate the area and saves the life.
- desc: The most important that I learned today is learning about how one positive
    aspect of everything being online is that since everybody is staying inside, the
    overall carbon footprint is reduced. I learend this during the breakout rooms.
- desc: "Today, we learned how the misinformation is impacting life especially during\
    \ the pandemic and it is our responsibility to verify the information before we\
    \ start to create own opinion and start to share with others. Sharing misinformation\
    \ could lead extreme consequences to our own and the society. Here are the few\
    \ steps we can use to verify the Data Integrity.  Source \u2013 Verify the original\
    \ source not just the website. Headlines \u2013 Carefully read the entire section\
    \ not just headlines before to make a comment o"
- desc: Climate change could be a problem for computing. Bad climate could result
    in internet connections and technical issues.
- desc: How much of our world is touched by computing? are climate change and covid-19
    problems for computing? what are some other examples?
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is that people should always think
    critically about the things around them. In the inspirational quotes it was expressed
    that people should be thinking critically about such basic things as the world
    around them so that they can be inspired to change that world and leave an impact.
    It was also emphasized to think critically when looking at the current events
    with the Sask health message about making sure people are wary of misinformation.
- desc: I learned about how ingrained computing is in our society, and how disruptions
    from the covid-19 pandemic have affected our society technology wise. With chip
    shortages we are feeling it all over the world. I personally felt this because
    of the struggle I had trying to purchase a PS5, which suffered from the shortage.
    I also learnt and saw how computing is becoming a regular part of life more and
    more each day. With the pandemic teaching is remote and when we make a purchase
    we are moving away from cash.
- desc: I learned that a large part of my daily life depends on computers. After COVID-19,
    dependence has increased.It was interesting to see how much was done by computersAs
    dependence increases, there are concerns that our personal information or privacy
    will not be protected..
- desc: In today&#039;s break out room discussion, I learned that almost everything
    in our world is touch by computing. The only exception are the countries who aren&#039;t
    much exposed to technology yet. We also discussed about how covid affects computing
    since some of the things we do are online now and computing and technology became
    more essential. Although I am not really sure how climate change and covid are
    a problems to computing, but what I guess is that those aren&#039;t a problem.
- desc: Almost everything is computerized and we are affected by those items in our
    lives. In the field of science, computing has been used for modelling viruses
    and other diseases to see how they react and evolve. As well, we generate models
    for how soon the polar ice caps would be melted, the thawing of permafrost, and
    its effects on the world.
- desc: There were multiple informative things I&#039;ve learned in the class. First,
    I found out about Amazon Alexa&#039;s dangerous suggestion, which was shocking
    but not really. Next, the discussion based on the computing world put emphasis
    on how humans are GREATLY impacted by computers. It&#039;s basically part of our
    everyday life now. Frankly, anything has a potential to create problems in the
    computing world, due to the possibility of hacked security, internet liability,
    remote automation and control, etc.
- desc: I learned today that is very important to see where information comes from
    such as, source, reading carefully through the information and take a few minutes
    to think about it. Truly understand what the information presented is trying to
    give us.
- desc: Is that the information we will be discussing mostly in this course is our
    own opinions, but we will develop skills in order to back our own opinions and
    be able to defend them when challenged by others.
- desc: "According to J.C.R.Licklider, we\u2019re probably in the stage where we\u2019\
    re developing a symbiotic relationship with computers. To describe this relationship\
    \ as \u201Csymbiotic\u201D makes it sound like computers are actual organisms,\
    \ which is pretty cool, I guess. I can see this so-called \u201Cdevelopment stage\u201D\
    \ even now: we rely on zoom during COVID  in order to continue working.  Overall,\
    \ it\u2019s interesting to define our relationship with computers as something\
    \ biological."
- desc: The most important thing I learned was that computing impacts society in both
    positive and negative aspects. The use of computing makes our lives much easier
    by automating processes that would be tedious for us to do without computing.
    For example instead of going to the library to search for information , we have
    cellular devices that have the capability to find information on the internet
    much faster.
- desc: I found today&#039;s breakout room discussion quite interesting. Majority
    of the world&#039;s population is using some sort of computing devices. Computing
    for COVID-19 has transitioned a lot of offline activities to online such as our
    classes, virtual meetings with doctors etc. Computing for Climate change has allowed
    us to better monitor predict changes in climate, weather forecast, etc.
- desc: We discussed regarding the effects on computing due to climate change and
    the pandemic. I learned that it has effected the manufacturing of the computers
    due to lack of supplies, also heard about the Alexa which gave dangerous suggestions
    to a young girl and also about sask health authorities tackling misinformation.
- desc: I think our world today is heavily influenced and based on technology, such
    as computing. Technology has gotten more and more advanced over the years and
    it shows no signs of slowing down. Now in regards to how COVID-19 and climate
    change are affecting computing, I believe that it&#039;s not a problem for it,
    but more beneficial. Computing has offered many different resources throughout
    this pandemic, such as tracking cases and being a good source for information.
- desc: During todays group discussion, I learned about the different ways the computing
    can be affected by the environment and vice vera. my group talked about how computing
    has accelerated climate change with light and power pollution. We also talked
    about that climate change has created a need for more computing and newer technology
    (such as the meta verse) because it will mask the deterioration of the real world
    and create a more enjoyable, better reality for people.
- desc: In Today&#039;s class, we have discussed about the tweet which was done by
    SHA about the Combatting COVID misinformation. As it important the all the news
    given by SHA should be accurate as most of them are following SHA due to this
    pandemic. As we have also discussed some points on Amazon Alexa giving dangerous
    suggestion for example it gives advice to 10 year old to touch penny to exposed
    plug pocket. Then we had breakout room to discussed about the computing world.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today in the class is about how the today&#039;s
    computer era is affected by the climate and covid-19
- desc: Today we learned about the points in our life process that can be counted.
    For example, the stock market, the market economy, these can be calculated by
    calculating probability events. But things like climate change and covide-19 problems
    are hard to calculate because you don&#039;t know for sure if they will happen.
    These uncertainties make it difficult to calculate them.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is about the inspirations that
    have been read by the professor. I was really impressed with the first inspiration
    from J. C. R. Licklider and how visionary he was telling those comments about
    artificial intelligence in 1960. Furthermore, the inspiration about the fishes
    makes you think that we are no pretty sure about what surrounds us. In the field
    of information society, makes you reconsider how many personal information about
    you is stored in internet.
- desc: The most important thing I understood from todays class was how
- desc: Almost every part of our world is touched by computing. From social media
    improving methods of communication to Google allowing better access to information.
    The internet allows us to share information to a degree that hasn&#039;t been
    seen in human history and this has a tremendous impact on our society. Problems
    such as Covid and global warming can be helped solved by computing in various
    ways. This includes computers being used to track the spread of infection and
    being used to locate areas with high infectio
- desc: Apparently, if some sort of strong enough magnetic force (i.e. solar flare)
    hits the earth, it could wipe out all of the internet in the world.
- desc: Through our breakout room discussion it really was made clear how much of
    our lives are touched by computing. It&#039;s something that I was aware of at
    the back of my head but rarely put much though to. We all thought upwards of 95%
    of everything we own or do in someway had computing involved. The same could be
    said with how we are handling COVID and climate change.
- desc: The most essential thing I&#039;ve learnt about Covid&#039;s effects on computing
    is that, as a cautious move to decrease the risk of spread, all employees began
    working from home as soon as the pandemic began. Employees, on the other hand,
    have been exposed to a variety of security threats as a result of working from
    home. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way businesses work and operate. The
    increased usage of conferencing and collaboration services by employees working
    from home is putting a strain on back-end
- desc: I thought that some of the quotes we went over in class were fairly interesting,
    especially how they related to the work we will be doing in the class.
- desc: "Today, about half of the world&#039;s population owns and can assess to a\
    \ computer\uFF0C whether at home or in the workplace. Global warming and the pandemic\
    \ will have little effect on computers, and even the global pandemic has increased\
    \ computer usage as well as average time spent on computers (according to Internet\
    \ data)."
know-more:
- desc: I saw a two article about artificial intelligence about which I was unaware
    of. The forst one was about amazon alexa
- desc: how advanced 3rd world countries are with computers
- desc: If there would be a chance that the syllabus could be posted somewhere on
    URcourses so that I could use it in reference.
- desc: Can you talk about more detail about the project we will do?
- desc: Today&#039;s class was very interesting I enjoy today&#039;s class very much.
    I would like to know more about the security risk
- desc: I still really want to understand the big picture of what the class will look
    like so that I can fill it out as I go through the class.  I&#039;m talking how
    we will be assessed, what we will cover throughout the whole course, any other
    relevant details.
- desc: Since it still hasn&#039;t been outlined yet I would like to learn more about
    the project still and also some dates surrounding the assignments which I&#039;m
    sure will be covered in the syllabus. I would like to get more of a sense of dates
    to stay organized and be on track especially with this bigger project. I saw that
    the website now shows course topics so I would also like to understand the plan
    when it comes to how the outcomes will be laid out in the meetings as right now
    it feels a little all over the place.
- desc: Today we discussed how the COVID-19 is affecting computing. According to me,
    as the large computing farms started work from home, this might cause a lack of
    security to transfer data between the workers due to high chances of data breach,
    data manipulation and spreading misinformation has made computing inefficient
    from distance. But I am still confused and interested to know some other different
    ways how the COVID situation is affecting our information society and know the
    ways we can cut down these issues
- desc: Today&#039;s class was somewhat similar to the previous one as I am still
    eager to learn more about future topics. In today&#039;s class, I also had an
    interesting conversation in the breakout room about how climate change created
    some real issues in the world of computing. I took a glimpse of the two videos
    that are posted which would be for the next class in which they basically explain
    what a computer programmer does. So I&#039;m very eager to know more about it
    in the next class.
- desc: I would really love to learn more about how society&#039;s reliance on computers
    and technology effects (or doesn&#039;t effect) third world countries or tribes
    with less access to these resources.
- desc: The thing I would most like to know more about in todays lecture would have
    to be if computing has helped or hindered covid response around the world. If
    you look deep into the numbers in less technology driven societies the impact
    of covid looks a lot smaller than the ones that relied on technology to get messaging
    and other things spread out to the population.
- desc: The interesting correlation we weren&#039;t able to went through class was
    climate change creating problem for computing. I would love to know more about
    this relation and how does this really goes in real word and what are the opinions
    of my classmates about it. Personally, I think its the other way around, computing
    harms the climate rather than. Would really like to explore this arena more.
- desc: The thing about which I would most like to know more is how climate change
    can affect computing like in what ways can it affect. Are the effects positive
    or negative to the information society?  I was not able to fully comprehend the
    question about it during the breakout session, but nonetheless I learned that
    the climate change and COVID-19 can possibly be a problem to computing. Also,
    I would like to learn if there is any counter or solutions to the problems and
    how can we implement that solution.
- desc: Today&#039;s discussion question was very interesting. Prior to this class,
    I had gotten so comfortable with the idea that computers are used almost everywhere
    to do work, as well as computing. Since I had always been in this environment,
    I didn&#039;t really understand how much of an impact it had and continues to
    have in the world. Going forward, it will only get more digital. So I want to
    know more about the ways in which computing can impact the world and what are
    the possible future outcomes.
- desc: There are a lot of questions which people make around but the one which I
    think could be controversial is that how climate change and covid-19 are drawbacks
    for computing. What I think so far is that covid-19 has only made computing easy.
    Everything has been turned online and has increased the way people compute in
    the modern era. What I am curious about is to understand how this can bring a
    drawback to the technology. Knowingly or unknowingly  people are anyways getting
    dependent on computer.
- desc: 'I have always been curious about the stuff related to cyber crime. Many questions
    arise in my mind like: Who is responsible for such crimes? Why would anyone do
    such crimes? What are the motives behind such crimes?jjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj  djjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjdjdjdjdjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj'
- desc: Well, In today&#039;s meeting we did group discussion in breakout room that
    how technology used in different ways specially in pandemic to protect our selves
    and reduce direct touch with other person.
- desc: 'In the past, we had books, and now we had computers. Computers touched almost
    every aspect of human life: economy, entertainment, food production, education,
    and so many more. Covid 19 and climate change are not problems for computing;
    they even encourage the development of computers. My biggest concern is, what
    if a global disaster such as EMP destroyed all electronics devices? How can people
    survive? How many people will die when water factories and food factories closed?
    Will the world enter a dark age l'
- desc: What would be the rewards for the society in the next 10 years as the technology
    advances?
- desc: "Our world is touched by computing in many ways and although there are positives\
    \ to this outcome there are potential negatives as well that affect our day to\
    \ day lifestyle. Due to pandemic we have started to use our computers more and\
    \ social interaction has diminished for most people. I would like to research\
    \ more in how this could affect should this be the world\u2019s situation for\
    \ a few more years. How much is it going to affect us?"
- desc: how are the covid and climate things to be computed
- desc: I would most like to know more about is how covid-19 is problematic for computing
- desc: At today&#039;s lecture, I found our discussion on how much of the world is
    touched by computing to be very interesting and is definitely a topic that I would
    love to cover further especially since COVID doesn&#039;t seem to be going anywhere.
    therefore, it is interesting to see what solutions the world will come up with
    and what role computing will play to bring back in helping our society navigate
    through these tough times.
- desc: During the COVID-19, most company base  on programming need more time to finish
    their job. However,  What will be some specials risk will only happen during COVID-19
    and how those company solved that or prevent the risk happen
- desc: If we have a breakout room discussion topic, I would like to have more background
    or preparation before going into the breakout room. It seems like one person will
    lead the direction, then the thoughts&#039; trend will be in one direction. In
    addition, are we going to share the breakroom discussion with the class, so we
    understand what the other interesting thoughts from different perspectives are?
    Thinking from all angles would be nice as well.
