difficult:
- desc: I never did understand why keeping things such as cookies private is preferred
    by most people. I understand people don&#039;t want their info sold, but at the
    same time these are the times we live in.
important:
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in the class today is the date of
    the blog post was moved to Mar. 7, and some clarifications about the blog. Another
    important thing that I learned in class today was how googles cookie system works.
- desc: Due day extend for blog.
- desc: people should be able to protest but there should also be laws governing when
    they are able to and to stop them from impeding other citizens
- desc: To be patient and do my best to participate and speak up during class now
    that it is hybrid class and it is even more difficult for everyone to communicate
    to eachother.
- desc: I learned how to submit the blog assignment.  We need to post it on the blog
    sections, use that to generate html, and then post that html on the actual submission
    page.
- desc: Today we talked about how websites handle data through cookies, for example
    with CBC News, and also discussed how Google Browser stores cookies and allows
    third-party companies to track the user activities.
- desc: The freedoms and rights laid out in the charter are not absolute. The very
    first section of the charter &amp;quot;guarantees the rights and freedoms set
    out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably
    justified in a free and democratic society.&amp;quot;
- desc: "In legal terms, that means that the freedoms and rights laid out in the charter\
    \ are not absolute. To use the most popular analogy, one person&#039;s freedom\
    \ to swing their arms around ends at the tip of another person&#039;s nose.  When\
    \ rights are limited, the limitations must be &amp;quot;prescribed by law&amp;quot;\
    \ \u2014 to extend the analogy, you can&#039;t prevent someone from swinging their\
    \ arms around by cutting them off. Limits to freedom must be precise so that they\
    \ can be measured up against a legal standard."
- desc: The most important thing I learned is more info on the blog entry assignment.
    It is good to know more and i have a better idea of what is expected on the assignment
- desc: Today we had an elaborate discussion about the Blog Entry. The discussion
    helped the students to get further insights into their work. Profs&#039; expectations
    from the assignment have helped many of the students get started with the Blog
    Entry. Blog writings like these can inspire students to expand their horizons
    and learn more about the Ethics of the Information society.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is that the blog post can be formatted
    in a couple different ways and that the due date has been changed to the following
    Monday. We  covered that and talked about cookies which was interesting because
    it is relevant to data privacy and the good of soiety in a way.
- desc: Today marks the first day of being back at uni. I have learnt that the blog
    is now due on March 7th, Monday. Citations can also be either MLA or APA, as long
    as it will be consistent. Blogs can also be first or third person. It can also
    be informal since it is like diary-style commentaries. Even though opinions are
    allowed, we must support them with information from a credible source. Lastly,
    he also showed us how to make our blogs using URCourse&#039;s HTML editor.
- desc: The most important think I learned is that websites may be deceitful in the
    way they word statements about what a user has control over. Like in class the
    website made it sound like the user would be able to pick which cookies applied
    but it actually just showed the user what cookies the site used
- desc: I learned that the due date for the blog entry is moved from March 4 to March
    7
- desc: That social media companies continuously fight for screen time of their users
    and find ways to keep you &amp;quot;pulled in&amp;quot; and grab your attention
    by auto playing the next episode or another video
- desc: I learnt that it is important to be mindful about what sorts of things a website
    promises you, especially regarding how cookies are used and managed. With that
    in mind, I would like to know more about how companies decide to release information
    about their practices.
- desc: Today we discussed about the blog assignment and proffesor extended the deadline
    to Monday. Proffesor showed us how to edit/make our blog using html editor.
- desc: Moscow has been using Tv channels to spread hate and fake news against Ukrainians
    and justify the reason to go on war with Ukraine. Also, government funded Russian
    hackers have affected Ukraine governments website and banks. CYBER WAR has started
    against Russia affecting government website and banks , this is done by &amp;quot;Anonymous&amp;quot;
    hacker group.
- desc: how to properly set up a blog for our assignment
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was a little bit about how cookies
    work and how CBC News as cookie settings that prevent them from using your information.
- desc: "I learned about website cookies in today\u2019s class. I understand that\
    \ there are several benefits to using cookies because it helps the internet to\
    \ remember your profile, passwords and other necessary details. However, it has\
    \ several negatives. It can be used to spy on your activities without your knowledge.\
    \ It is quite harmful when criminals gain access to legitimate cookies. Therefore,\
    \ an understanding of cookies and how it works is necessary to stay safe online."
- desc: "In today&#039;s lecture i got know what is civic awareness program? Civic\
    \ engagement involves \u201Cworking to make a difference in the civic life of\
    \ one&#039;s community and developing the combination of knowledge, skills, values\
    \ and motivation to make that difference. ... Participation in civic engagement\
    \ activities can help youth become better informed about current events."
- desc: Today, Dr Hepting has explained how to do Blog entry submission in ur courses.
    We have also discussed about the AI (Artificial Precision of health).
- desc: Talked about the upcoming blog entry and learned about the cookies used by
    the websites
- desc: I was really hoping to get deadline extended for blog as I already have 2
    midterms in 2 weeks . Thanks for that prof.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture, Prof explained briefly on how to and exactly what
    we are supposed to do in blog entry.
- desc: Todays meeting was all about learning and understanding the basics and fundamentals
    of the use of IT in todays society along with its risks.
- desc: "Today it was the first day of inperson class, very exciting experience as\
    \ got to see all back after two years. We discussed the blog post and it\u2019\
    s due date was also extended hopefully. It was a great one. Many samples of it\
    \ were also shown and discussed."
- desc: Websites use derogatory terms to show the visiters that they care about their
    visiter&#039;s data and it is safe hands. This is done by using false language
    and providing links that don&#039;t work and forwarding users to pages that contain
    terms and conditions which are not explaiend in plain words or for &amp;quot;mere
    mortals&amp;quot;.
- desc: Websites can be very misleading with cookies.
- desc: Today class started with the attendance and there is a small discussion on
    in person classes that started from today. After that professor told us that he
    extended the date of blog entry submission to 7 march. There was also discussion
    on how to write the blog entry which should be in first person.
- desc: Class can run fairly smoothly once the technical issues are ironed out
- desc: We discussed the deadline for the blog entry assignment and how we have to
    submit the assignment
- desc: The most important thing I have learned about today&#039;s lecture is about
    Dr. J Ross Mitchell that will use AI precision in health and agriculture. and
    the background about him that he did his bachelor&#039;s and masters here in Canada
    and moved to the USA. Also, we learned about freedom in Canada and the responsibility
    to one another. Also, some websites allow us to change the cookies some not and
    this sounds to be promising.
- desc: It was definitely nice to get back into in-person learning today, as well
    as I found the discussion about our project to be useful.
- desc: i know who to submit the html format of assignment
know-more:
- desc: In todays class the prof taught about blog entry, how to get html code. We
    saw some articles telling about risk of private data of a user stored in smartphones
    and laptops which are stored as cookies by the browser.
- desc: I would like to know more about the Canadian freedom charter and also would
    like to explore the powers enjoyed by high civil servants
- desc: We briefly discussed CBC&#039;s website and the asking of cookies and what
    they do with the data. I want to know how and why cookies are legal and if they
    can infringe on users without our knowledge. Computers are not to harm us, but
    if we are unknowingly giving more of ourselves to be used as simply data.
- desc: Metaverse and its potential implications on society
- desc: today&#039;s class was very interesting as it was my first day in university
    after a very long time also the professor extended the due date of blog entry.
    I have almost completed my blog but now I got more time to research on my topic.
    Overall the class was a very good.
- desc: I would like to learn when to specifically decline or accept cookies on a
    website. Which websites should we accept cookies in order to utilize our experience?
- desc: More about the web project
- desc: How cookies are used to track you across the internet - I understand the concept
    of cookies, and how they store information on your browser, but I&#039;d love
    to learn more about the mechanisms that go into putting these bits of information
    to use for either beneficial or malicious purposes.
- desc: I would like to know more about the ethics of computing and more on active
    attempts at solving immoral ethical practices.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we talked about the assignment. I was able to see examples
    of how to submit assignments, how to select assignments, and what topics to select.
- desc: I wanted to learn more about how to protect one&#039;s data, so that the privacy
    settings are only accessible to the person. I know there are lots of attackers
    and hackers in the world, but how do we really protect our intellectual property?
    Yes, I know sometimes, it is usually caused from malicious people who are trying
    to steal something, but how do we use technology for the public good?
- desc: I would like to know more about and discuss more briefly the blog entry that
    is due on March 8th.
- desc: The thing i would most like to know more about is how information technology
    is being used and going to be used in the current war happening in ukraine/russia
    as well as the effect it may have on said war.
- desc: Online research and misinformation
- desc: As mentioned by Dr. Hepting in today&#039;s lecture, I would like to know
    more about what can be done to control (or even stop) websites like CBC news from
    collecting and benefitting from user information such as browser cookies which
    are used for advertising purposes, basically to earn more money. I think the choice
    of words shown in the disclaimer is not ethical behaviour as it pretends to make
    false promises to consumers since they can&#039;t really do much about how their
    information is being collected and used.
- desc: I would hope to learn more about writing since we are meant to do so for our
    personal blog and the group blog. I feel like working in a group with different
    people will help improve my writing skills and information deduction. I hope this
    helps.
- desc: Today we discussed about CBC site and it&#039;s cookies settings. The cookies
    settings did not deem to be of much help. I want to learn more about cookies and
    how different sites use cookies. And if they are helpful in anyway or not.
- desc: Today&#039;s leading information society service providers offer most of their
    services free which seems good for the society, but there is a big drawback too.
    These service providers make money by advertising. The problem happens when they
    collect data in order to target specific personalized adds to the service users.
    I believe that it is wrong to collect someone&#039;s personal data in order to
    increase their  their profits by personalizing adds. I would like to know more
    about this topic.
- desc: I todays lecture professor discussed about the project proposal submission
    and told that they are currently under marking process.Then after we discussed
    about the blog submission and professor discussed the submission date and postponed
    it to 7th March. And then he discussed about the topics that he gave us to read
    in our reading break.
- desc: Today i learned on how people are protesting against the russia invasion on
    ukraine and how people are upset with the vaccine mandate thing which i felt is
    something i m very interested to know and how far this is gonna go in ukraine
- desc: The sources of CBC news.
- desc: How has the technology affected the mental health of the youth in pandemic?
- desc: Do we have a midterm and if so when is it and what will the format be?
- desc: I would like to know more about cookies and how websites are trying to become
    more transparent in their use. I would also like to know what methods websites
    use to record and document information about the users on their website.
- desc: Not present
- desc: the thing that I would like to know more will be that how many people review
    cookies and how many people goes through the privacy instructions given in app
    or game ? Even when your submitting the application how many people go through
    the terms and conditions ?
- desc: I would like to know more about the blog format and its content which is due
    next week,
- desc: How do we ensure our privacy rights are transparent enough? Most people have
    a little knowledge that they&#039;re being tracked online but nothing in too much
    depth. How do websites best show users their options for what is tracked on their
    site? And who is in charge of making sure they do it?
