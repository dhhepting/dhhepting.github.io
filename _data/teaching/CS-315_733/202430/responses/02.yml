- desc: An important concept from last meeting that was brought up was the difference
    between vector and bitmap graphics.
- desc: Audio sample rates
- desc: I started to get a grasp of raster and vecotr graphic types and how their
    differences affect the final product along with how they are affected by different
    resolution types.
- desc: We discussed the differences between bitmapping and vector graphics and how
    both have advantages and disadvantages. Much like data structures and algorithms,
    there is never a one size fits all solution to problems in computer science. It's
    up to the designer to choose what tool is best for a given problem.
- desc: The intoduction to a method of anti-aliasing known as Super-Sampling (SSAA),
    which can greatly improve image quality, however the method of rendering at a
    higher resolution does put into question the affect on performance.
- desc: intro to vector graphics
- desc: pixels and framebuffer
- desc: Nature of pixels
- desc: I loved the concept of vector graphics.Though I didn't get it very well.
- desc: We looked at the concept of bitmap and vector graphics, which are discrete
    and continuous respectively.
- desc: We encountered about pixels and vector graphics
- desc: Bitmaps v/s Vector Graphics. Cathode Ray Tube. Pixels and Sampling. Audio
    CD's
- desc: There are two types of computer graphics - vector graphics and bitmap graphics.
    Vector graphics can give us a clearer image, but they are too slow when compared
    to bitmapping/raster, which is used for most modern devices
- desc: "Today, I encountered several important concepts. Pixels are samples of continuous\
    \ phenomena and don\u2019t have shapes. I learned about display technology, distinguishing\
    \ between discrete screens and continuous output devices like oscilloscopes and\
    \ plotters. The professor explained how drawings are produced on Cathode Ray Tubes.\
    \ Another interesting concept is that vector graphics use mathematical calculations\
    \ to maintain image quality when zoomed in, saving space but potentially taking\
    \ longer to render."
- desc: We learned about vector graphics versus bitmaps. It was cool to see how vector
    graphics use math to describe shapes, letting them scale without like losing quality.
