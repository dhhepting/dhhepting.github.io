important:
- desc: One of the most important concept I learned in the meeting was the car model
    hierarchy which includes chassis (the body) and 4 wheels (left, right, front,
    rear) and the calculations will be a bit different because we need to factor the
    movement (backward, forward), speed and whether it is moving in straight line.
    I also learned there are other examples of model hierachy such as the tree and
    robot arm.
- desc: I found the additional conversations about matrix multiplication and transformation
    good to know before the final exam
- desc: Some important topics from todays meeting were that the final is next week,
    the matrix multiplication file now has the question from the midterm in it, how
    toon shading reduces depth/levels in the output, then we went through slides about
    hierarchical modeling with the example of modeling a car, we also went over graphs
    and trees for hierarchical modeling, then we ended with stack-based traversal.
- desc: The discussion on Toon Shading, and a deep dive into what the lines of the
    fragment shader does shows the creativity and approaches that can be taken in
    order to create more complex shaders
- desc: About questions which can be asked in final exams
- desc: We looked at the figure.html/js and roboticArm.html/js. Moreover, we discussed
    the hierarchical models.
- desc: We discussed means of outlining a model through hierarchical graphs such as
    trees and DAGs. We also looked at ways of coding these models through multiple
    push/pops of the model view matrix
- desc: The concept of modeling a car involves using the chassis as the root, attaching
    four wheels, and understanding how to rotate, translate, scale, and add light
    to a robotic arm.
