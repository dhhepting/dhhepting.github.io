- desc: The important concept I learned in the meeting was the terms hidden surface
    removal and visible surface. These are algorithms used so that the objects are
    drawn and in the correct position depending on the viewers. An example we discussed
    is a triangle. It needs to use these two algorithms so that the faces are clearly
    seen by the viewers. Another term we briefly mentioned was the Z-buffer which
    according to the textbook, it is also reated to the hidden-surface removal algorithm.
- desc: Looking and dissecting code files for WebGL2
- desc: Although only briefly mentioned, the concept of using Computer Graphics with
    Filmography shows that having a deep understanding of the technology and programming
    practices that go behind the scenes to develop the rendering engines that major
    studios use for their VFX and Computer Generated Imagery goes a long way in furthering
    the quality and realism that it can provide to the artist.
- desc: 'Vertex Shader, Fragment Shader and Vertex Position '
- desc: WEBGL
- desc: "Sierpinski\u2019s triangle gaskets. It seems like quite an interesting task\
    \ to take on. I plan to take a look at the code and maybe try to write it on my\
    \ own to help me better learn the concept and implementation."
- desc: The topic of coordinates is something which I felt was important in last meeting.
- desc: The Hidden Surface Removal, Visible Surface Determination, Sierpinski Gasket,
    and Triangle Fan.
- desc: The main consept was about Sierpinski Gasket and difference between both the
    gaskets
- desc: Hidden Surface Removal/Visible surface detection, Z buffer, Sierpenski Gasket
    and the steps to create it
- desc: "we learnt a bit about Sierpi\u0144ski triangles/gaskets and the code needed\
    \ to generate them, which will be what are our assignments are on"
- desc: The concepts of hidden surface removal and visible surface determination should
    be considered when generating high-quality graphic images. The idea of the Sierpinski
    Gasket and how to program it using points and triangles is interesting. I have
    learned how to use square.js to draw shapes like triangles, triangle fans, and
    triangle strips.
