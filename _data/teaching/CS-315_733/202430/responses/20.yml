difficult: []
important:
- desc: The function of gl.blend
- desc: Today I learned more about how to map reflections. At first, I thought the
    program we saw in class was just rotating the outside of a cube while the inside
    remains at a fixed position. Though I do wonder if that's possible.
- desc: About Assignment 3 Extension and Quiz questions discussion
- desc: Blending
- desc: We looked at the code for reflecting the environment, transparency on a cube,
    and picking color.
- desc: 'went through reflectionmap code '
- desc: Mapping
- desc: Reflection Map, how reflection maps are being used. Environment mapping, Playing
    with alpha values of the color in a normal rotating cube example.
- desc: environmental mapping, and a method of acquiring colors by rendering in a
    frame buffer
- desc: The concept of how reflection color is used in the cube involves computing
    the reflection vector in the vertex shader using the reflect function. In the
    fragment shader, the texture function samples the cube map texture based on this
    reflection vector to determine the reflected color.
- desc: Learn about environment mapping,  check reflection map code
