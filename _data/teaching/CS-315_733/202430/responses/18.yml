- desc: In the last meeting, I learned the concept of Gouraud and Phong shading. Their
    calculations for Gouraud is done in the vertex shader for the lighting in vertices
    and intensity. As for Phong, calculations are in fragment shader and deals with
    lighting and normal vector.
- desc: Texture Mapping techniques
- desc: Some important concepts covered in the meeting today were, student feedback
    about the midterm, assignment 3 and 4 cutoff date is Dec. 10, Gouraud and Phong
    shading, texture mapping and its coordinate systems, 3 steps to applying a texture,
    then we looked at the code for texturecube2.
- desc: Texture mapping and converting to on screen coordinates
- desc: We discussed how textures get distorted when they are mapped to geometry.
    This reminds me of how 2D maps of the globe are distorted when we try to map the
    surface of the globe to a rectangle. And in a similar way, map makers must choose
    how they want to distort the map. Usually it occurs at the poles.
- desc: Getting to discuss texture mapping is what I believe to be some of the most
    fundemental and important concepts to disucss and learn how to properly utilize.
    Discussing how Bump/Normal Maps are interpreted and utilized to imitate complex
    geometry.
- desc: Shading and different types of mapping, Texture, environment and bump and
    also about midterm and assignment
- desc: The difference between gouraud and phong shading in relation to where the
    computation is done, with regards to the fragment and vertex shaders
- desc: We discussed the Gourand and Phong shading, and Texture mapping.
- desc: 'Texture mapping '
- desc: Gouraud v/s Phong Shading, Texture mapping, bump mapping and how they are
    achieved; forward mapping and backward mapping; mapping images onto objects in
    depth
- desc: The concept of Gouraud shading computes lighting in the vertex shader and
    interpolates vertex intensities across the polygon. Phong shading, calculated
    in the fragment shader, interpolates normals across the polygon for per-pixel
    lighting. Texture mapping assigns a 2D texture to a 3D surface and samples it
    in the fragment shader for rendering.
