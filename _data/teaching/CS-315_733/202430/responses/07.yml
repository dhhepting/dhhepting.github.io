- desc: An important concept I learned during the meeting was how to apply numbers
    to each transformation in the sierpinski gasket to ensure each transformation
    is colored correctly. It also gives me an idea of how I might be able to apply
    the appropriate colors for my first assignment.
- desc: I believe that touch events are an important concepts to computer graphics
    nowadays. As brought up in class, phones are the most common use of touch input.
    However follow ups worth disucssing could be touchscreen laptops and drawing tablets,
    or even discuss the Nintendo DS/3DS with its bottom touch screen that was highly
    used in alot of games.
- desc: Picking and Colors in Assignment 1
- desc: critical fusion frequency
- desc: Why it is important to use (16 * maximum positions) and (8 * maximum positions)
    and where we are meant to use them
- desc: i loved the concept of 24fps can appear as 48fps or 72fps cz i am involved
    a lot in video production. I would love to know about it in more detail and ill
    do some research as well. Ill ask if any question arises..
- desc: We talked about fields and frames (interlaced and progressive), and picking
    the part on the display.
- desc: Picking and colours in Assignment 1
- desc: Critical Fusion Frequency and how it affects other things, discussed things
    about Assignment, Picking and how can it be done using WebGL, window and touch
    events
- desc: How we can use buffers to draw objects and track mouse positions
- desc: The idea involves filling 9 colors when performing the last two transformations
    for the assignment. Picking, or selecting an object, can be tricky. WebGL draws
    a simpler version offscreen, assigns each object a unique color, and then tests
    the colors to identify the selected object.
