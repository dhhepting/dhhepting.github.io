difficult: []
important:
- desc: A true understanding on how saturation and hue make up different colour's.
- desc: I found the explanantions of simple color theory and how that worked very
    helpful along with the quick explanation of right hand versus left hand coordinate
    systems
- desc: Some important concepts that I encountered in the last meeting were the updated
    date of the Midterm Exam, some errors in the description of assignment 1, what
    we are supposed to do for assignment 1, how hidden surface removal/ visible surface
    determination work and the z-buffer work, how variables are named in the textbook,
    we looked at and discussed gasket4 code, how colour and coordinates are related
    and some colour diagrams, what is additive and subtractive colour.
- desc: I realized that colour can be plotted down on a 3D vector with red, green,
    and blue as the three axis.
- desc: Colors and Coordinate
- desc: Color aggregation
- desc: The concept of Colour and Coordinates and how we can find out what the colours
    of the different parts of the cube will be.
- desc: Programming Graphics, Color and Coordinates (Additive color model, which is
    RGB, and Subtractive color model, which is CMYK).
- desc: we learned about webgl2 and 3d gasket
- desc: Co-ordinates and about assignment 1
- desc: Working of Z-Buffer, Generating 3d Sierpenski Gasket, Variables in GLSL, Colors
    and Coordinates, Types of color models
- desc: Today, the professor explained Assignment 1, the rescheduled exam date, and
    discussed the code from gasket4 that utilizes the Z-buffer and variable names
    in GLSL. An interesting part of the lecture focused on color, including the additive
    color model, where we start from black and add colors, and the subtractive color
    model, where we begin with white and subtract colors, as well as the concept of
    coordinates.
