difficult: []
important:
- desc: I thought the discussion on Phoung and Guroud Shading (Sorry for spelling
    I couldnt see the board great) Was very interesting along with the different pros
    and cons of each and how they both look and are calcuated
- desc: We discussed the Phong model of lighting in computer graphics. One important
    perspective is that we are trying to find a balance between realistic lighting
    and computational efficiency. We want results that look good while still being
    fast to compute.
- desc: Shading and materials - the different properties, specular, metallic, and
    diffuse.
- desc: Diffuse and Ambient, Normals
- desc: Gouraud and Phong shading as well as specular surfaces and reflections
- desc: 'We discussed the lighting, types of surface, Gouraud shading, and Phong shading. '
- desc: Lights, Shading and types of lights, Steps to incorporate lights in a scene.
    Goroud and Phong Shading
- desc: we learned about lighting, and compared the gouraud model to the phong model
- desc: Today, I learned the concept of lighting in 3D. The halfway vector is an efficient
    method for computation. Specular surfaces reflect light in a narrow angle, creating
    a shiny effect, while diffuse surfaces scatter light in all directions. In Gouraud
    shading, a normal vector is calculated for each vertex, while Phong shading computes
    lighting at the pixel level for more detailed results.
