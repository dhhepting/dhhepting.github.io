- desc: 'Blending the textures using specular mapping '
- desc: I thought that the way that the cube was changed with different textures and
    shaders was very important to understand with how the different values in the
    code work together
- desc: 'In this meeting, I got a look at how texture mapping works. I found it really
    cool to see all the different ways one can form their textures just by changing
    lighting, positioning, color, etc. '
- desc: 'Mapping: texture, environmental in detail'
- desc: We looked at the code of mapping texture to a cube.
- desc: Lighting Scenes, Mapping
- desc: 'we looked at textures, and ways to modify them such as by using coordinates '
- desc: The concept of applying texture mapping and Phong shading to a cube with a
    checkerboard pattern, as well as utilizing WebGL2 fundamentals for implementation.
- desc: 'learn about webgl helper library: TWGL, shadedTexturedCube program'
