- desc: 'Digital image representation seemed like an important topic '
- desc: Today I learned about the importance of texture mapping. It allows for cool
    abd realistic effects when line shines on an object.
- desc: Different types of mapping to make the surface look more comlex than it actually
    is. Types we encountred were bump, texture, and environement mapping.
- desc: 'Texture mapping! '
- desc: Assignment3,4 and Gouraud and phone Shading and Texture Mapping
- desc: Bump mapping essentially is perturbing the normal vector of a surface to be
    rendered
- desc: More samplw codes for textures
- desc: The concept of texture mapping provides a way to add rich surface details
    to 3D objects, achieving a sense of complexity that would be difficult to model
    directly. Environment mapping captures surrounding environmental details to simulate
    reflections, while bump mapping adds perceived depth and texture to surfaces.
- desc: learn assignment 3, 4 and bump mapping
- desc: the type of shading, flat, Gouraud shading and phong shading
