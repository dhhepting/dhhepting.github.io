    lot of answers including subjects on pixels, RGB, homogenous coordinates, roboticArm
    code, etc.
- desc: I found that what Dr Hepting provided us with as study tools for the final
    was very informative and helped me understand what I need to do for the final
- desc: Today, I learned the importance of the continuous, discrete, sampling, quantization
