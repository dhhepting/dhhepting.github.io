difficult:
- desc: 'no'
- desc: How is the discretization of a continuous phenomenon achieved with regards
    to understanding the pixels of a display or an image?
- desc: I didn't quiet get what exactly is a pixel bcz lets consider when we watch
    a movie on a laptop with 4k quality and the same on iPhone. What exactly is a
    pixel in there?bcz both of them have same number of pixels but the quality we
    see might be different sometimes...So do pixels have a specific size?if yes then
    what it is and will a bigger screen take more pixels? and are the pixel sizes
    same for all screens?
- desc: 'I am wondering whether you can provide us a full course syllabus on the UR
    courses and also the list of readings, so I can read it in advance before the
    lectures. '
- desc: 'No'
- desc: I had a hard time understanding some concepts related to capturing and shrinking
    images, especially when you started explaining the concepts with the figure of
    the square with the little squares inside. I also feel that much of what I found
    difficult was due to my situation as an exchange student who is still learning
    English and also has a hearing loss, sometimes it was hard to follow all the technical
    terms and complex explanations. Some phrases would escape me, and it was difficult
    to catch everything
important:
- desc: The concept of thinking of a bitmap as a mesh or strainer. anything that would
    "fall through" the strainer cant be accurately sampled and therefore cannot be
    shown accurately. this is important when designing graphics.
- desc: Some important concepts I encountered in class today was how UR Courses would
    be setup for the semester, how grades would be split between each part of the
    class, and what is bitmapping and pixels and how they work.
- desc: Pixels and bitmapping. And how pixels don't have geometry, as they're "samples."
- desc: 'We discussed the concept that a screen shows a discrete representation of
    a continuous phenomenon. This is a concept that computer scientists must face
    all the time because they deal with digital systems. A similar problem occurs
    with sound. How does one turn a continuous audio input to a microphone into something
    that can be stored on a computer? You take discrete samples over small time intervals. '
- desc: I believe that discussing the change (or rather increase) in display resolutions
    over the years is important as it opens the door to discussing how developers
    and designers have had to adapt to both changing aspects ratios of 4:3 to 16:9
    or even 21:9 or 32:9. Along with Vram requirements increasing to account for the
    larger screen resolutions.
- desc: few basics and definetions
- desc: 'Important concepts mentioned today in class was what textbook we actually
    was needed in this course as well as the grading throughout the semester (the
    percentages, extra credits, finals, etc.). After introduction we were taught the
    SIGGRAPH and how its an ACM special intented group for computer graphics. Then
    we talked about pixels; I was kind of familiar with this topic however, like many
    i though of them as squares which was incorrect. now i know that they are actually
    samples. '
- desc: The concept of pixels being a continuous concept rather than a discrete concept.
    It seems to go against what I understood pixels to be before today.
- desc: If a pixel can be any shape and size how do all screen appear to show non
    stretched images? Do they use different amounts of pixels to show similar sized
    images?
- desc: I loved the fact that Daryl talked about pixels from very basics bcz its very
    important for somebody like me who wants to learn from basics.
- desc: We looked at the course structure, bitmapped, and pixels.
- desc: In the last meeting, the important concept discussed were bitmapping and pixel.
- desc: The professor explained the overview of the course syllabus and introduced
    the topics of computer graphics and pixels.
- desc: 'The thing about pixel size which i never know that it is not really square '
- desc: In this class I learned a little introduction to what we are going to learn
    in the course, concepts such as bitmaps and pixels. It was interesting when you
    commented that a pixel is not really a square, although we often see it that way.
    I liked that you explained that we use the square representation because it makes
    it easier to understand and work with. This really changed my perspective on the
    structure of digital images
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about what is aliasing, how or if it ties to bitmapped,
    how it works. I would like to see an example as well as its definition and if
    whether or not this is something we will end up doing in the assignment.
- desc: 'Before today I had never even heard of a voxel before. So even though it
    was not mentioned as an important part of the lecture I would very much like to
    know more about them. Aside from that I also look forward to learning more about
    anti-aliasing. As someone that has played games for a long time I have seen what
    it does in games both new and old. In older games it seems a lot more useful than
    in newer games where it just seems to make things look fuzzy rather than remove
    jagged edges.  '
- desc: I would like to learn more about bitmapping and how it will apply in this
    course. Computer graphics is a field of computer science for me, so my experience
    is quite limited. Though I have no doubt that I will learn more about bitmapping
    as I progress through this course.
- desc: I'm honestly just unsure of what the assignments are going to be like right
    now. Is this a class about the history of computer graphics, or are we going to
    be doing anything practical?
- desc: I would like to know more about Vector Graphics (or Scalable Vector Graphics)
    and their use cases, benefits, drawbacks compared to bitmapping.
- desc: how can we get to volunteer in research participant tool? is there a link
    or any other source?
- desc: aliasing and anti-aliasing
- desc: Are there any other shapes other than squares that can be used to represent
    a pixe.? Maybe possibly a rectangle or other quadrilateral shapes?
- desc: Would like to know more about SIGGRAPH
- desc: I have asked all my questions in the 2nd question...
- desc: I look forward to know more about pixels and how we can capture the feature
    for a picture.
- desc: We had to stop before we could discuss about bitmapped vs vector, so I am
    looking forward to learn about it in dept in the next meeting.
- desc: It was mentioned that a part of our participation marks could be gained through
    "wiki contribution." What is meant by this and how do we contribute to the wiki?
- desc: I would like to know more about bitmapped vs vector. Would it be possible
    to get the course lecture slides so I don't need to write everything down?
- desc: 'Related pixel '
- desc: I would like to know more about the differences between vector graphics and
    bitmaps. It seems like an important distinction in computer graphics. Also, I'm
    curious about screen capture units other than pixels. It would be nice to delve
    into how the different types of graphics are created and stored and aliasing and
    antialiasing
