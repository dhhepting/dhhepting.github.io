- desc: Sierpenski Gasket
- desc: 'No'
- desc: Why for the homogeneous matrix we use 1 points and 0 for vectors
important:
- desc: The important concept I learned from last meeting was that we use matrices
    to represent vectors, and other types of coordinates in order to make a geometric
    objects/model. We use 4x4 matrix for homogenous coordinates and 3x3 matrix for
    vector scale. However, the matrice depends upon the object we are creating thus
    we will have to adjust or change representation by modifying the coordinates.
- desc: Transformation matrices! I cannot wait to talk about quaternions &gt;:3
- desc: The scaling matrix, translation, and rotation matrices that make up the points
    of every object in a scene, and how we interact with them in order to be able
    to properly perform transformations to each matrix, cause that was the main aspect
    of Linear Algebra I
- desc: Geometric object + Transformation and Camera
- desc: 'The concept of producing reflections which is as easy as applying a negative
    scale factor to transform the matrix. It made a lot of sense to me. '
- desc: Geometric objects and Transformation, Things needed to define/render an object
    on screen, different frames that deal with CG, coordinate system and 3d rotating
    cube's code
- desc: how we can showcase both a vector and translation matrices together in one
    4d matrix
- desc: 'Today, I learned about geometric objects and transformations. Scalars represent
    quantities like distance. A point indicates a location in space without size,
    while a vector shows direction. Vectors require an origin and basis vectors to
    define a frame. I learned different frames in the graphics rendering pipeline:
    object, model, camera/eye, and clip coordinates. I also studied 4x4 matrices in
    homogeneous coordinates and a cube program.'
- desc: The geometric objects including points, scalars, vectors, meshes and their
    definition
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about how to easily identify which axis something
    is spinning on.
- desc: I would like to know more about how rotation is calculated. I couldn't quite
    see it in cube.html, unless there was something I missed. I've had a similar problem
    in this course's first lab because the variable for rotation was also used to
    calculate speed and I could not find a way to create them as separate variables.
- desc: I would like to know more about camera/eye frames and how exactly they work
- desc: 'I would like to know more about how we can represent points and transforms
    as vec4''s and 4x4 matrices. What other kinds of transformations can we represent
    with a 4x4 matrix? Can we do rotations? '
- desc: The different kinds of coordinate systems, when to use them, why they were
    originally developed. Especially why Blender decided to have Z as the up/down
    axis.
- desc: coordinate systems seem to be similar to the frames we learnt about? is that
    so? like object space = object, world space = Model,  view space = camera/eye,
    clip = projection space
- desc: it was mentioned that a cube could be represented in 3d using only 8 points,
    a showcase of this would be very interesting
- desc: 'It was all clear and we understood most ! '
