difficult: []
important:
- desc: Orthographic projections to screens
- desc: I found the discussion on perspective and how it affects how looked at the
    image very interesting especially the valvulations involved with the perspective
- desc: In the last meeting, more about the inner workings of the box.html code and
    how I can implement it into assignment 2. Though instead of separate boxes, I
    plan to rotate one if the faces of the container to open it.
- desc: The important concepts I encountered in the last meeting were, the details
    about Assignment 2 and its due date extension, then we looked at lab code and
    sample code from the prof that relates to the assignment, then we learned the
    midterm will be on ch 1-5, a summary for midterm will posted and looked at on
    Monday, old exams will be posted to look at, then we ended by going through slides
    about Normalization.
- desc: We went over some of the code to be used as reference on the assignment, and
    what he was expecting conceptually. We also went over what material might be on
    the midterm and which types of questions.
- desc: Perspective frustrum manipulation was pretty neat!
- desc: Animation and Projection
- desc: shadow maps
- desc: Sierpenski Tetrahdon
- desc: 'When passing matrices to shaders, we need to do this: flatten(transpose(m)).
    This will convert the matrix from row major order to column major order which
    is what we need for the computation.'
- desc: nothing great actually
- desc: We looked at the assignment 2 details, model view and projection matrix with
    transformations.
- desc: Discussed about Midterms and Assignment 2 ; Rotation and viewing matrices
    and how to incorporate them in the scene
- desc: we mainly discussed the assignment and midterm, but we did touch on differences
    between the different types of perspective
- desc: Today, I grasped the concept for Assignment 2 on how to animate the lid using
    the modelview and projection matrices. I also learned about using orthographic
    and perspective projections to adjust the positioning of objects in the scene.
- desc: learn abohut mid term exam question and orthogonal projection
- desc: Today mostly we discussed about the assignment 2 end discussed about the exam
    midterm
