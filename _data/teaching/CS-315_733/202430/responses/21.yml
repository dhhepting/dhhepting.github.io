difficult: []
important:
- desc: Today, I learned about the use of frame buffer objects in WebGL and how they
    can be used to help smooth out a ragged image.
- desc: Important concepts from today are, monday we will go over topics from chapter
    9 and talk about advanced rendering methods, wednesday we will review, ask questions,
    and look at interesting demos, we looked at render2, render3, and particleDiffusion
    code, then we went over slides about the framebuffer, and using multiple vertex
    and fragment shaders for program1 and program2 in the same code files.
- desc: Assignment 3 discussion and some image formation on the objects and also detail
    about multi pass rendering
- desc: We discussed the framebuffer and looked at some example of code such as particle
    diffusion.
- desc: went through rendering and color or particle diffusions code
- desc: mapping
- desc: Frame buffers and how to use them. program with 2 shaders and how these 2
    shaders work together ; double buffering
- desc: 'The concept of the framebuffer: In Render 3, Program 1 renders triangles
    into the framebuffer, and then Program 2 uses this output to apply a diffusion
    effect and the concept of how the framebuffer works in the particle diffusion
    program.'
- desc: learn about particle diffusion and check 'render2', 'diffuser' and 'particledissusion'
    webgl program
