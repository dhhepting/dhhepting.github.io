difficult: []
important:
- desc: Various animation framerates
- desc: We learned about the different types of events that can be used to change
    something about the code in yyesterdays class it was the different speeds and
    ways that we could spin the square and how we could apply those to other functionalities
- desc: In this class, I learned about how complex it is to create an animation frame
    by frame. I used to think each frame would be displayed one at a time all at once,
    but today I learned that there is a delay in time before the next frame occurs.
- desc: Some important concepts I encountered in the last meeting were how to rotate
    a square, what requestAnimationFrame does, the different framerates for animation
    in film and for modern displays, what critical fusion frequency is, and then we
    looked at the code for rotatingsquare1 and rotatingsquare2.
- desc: I think kthe most important concept was the introduction of requestAnimationFrame()
    so that we can achieve a consistent and smooth framerate.
- desc: 'Interaction + Animation '
- desc: Recursion
- desc: Critical Fusion Frequency and the concept of fps and hz for displays.
- desc: We learned how to create a rotating square. In addition, introducing the requestAnimationFrame
    to avoid stack overflow and make the smooth animation.
- desc: Animations
- desc: Interaction
- desc: Tints/Tones/Shades , RequestAnimationFrame function, Rotating square code
    and approach, use of double buffers, Frame rates of animations, Critical Fusion
    Frequency
- desc: "The key concept for animating a rotating square involves using a uniform\
    \ variable theta to control the square\u2019s rotation and using requestAnimationFrame\
    \ to ensure smooth synchronization of the animation with the browser's refresh\
    \ rate."
- desc: I learned about the rotating square programm which applies a constant rotation
    through an animation loop.
