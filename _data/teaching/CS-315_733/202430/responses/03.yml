difficult: []
important:
- desc: I feel like Graphic systems, APIs and color knowledge was important concept
- desc: WebGL2 code snippets
- desc: Some important topics I encountered were immediate-mode graphics, retained-mode
    graphics, when A1 is due tentatively, office hours, info about wiki contributions,
    amount of bits per sample for storing colour (1 bit is black and white, 8 bit
    is greyscale, 3x 8 bit is rgb, and 32 bit is rgba), programming with WebGL2, and
    sample code from textbook slides.)
- desc: How computer generated images are made. I wasnt aware of the process/components.
- desc: Discrete vs Continous
- desc: An important concept I encountered today was vertex shaders, fragment shaders
    and how we can make a virtual image to look super realistic with modelling, texture/material,
    lighting and viewing. Another important thing mentioned today was the GEneric
    Flat Panel Display and how there are 3 types. the vertical grid, light emitting
    element, and the horizontal grid.
- desc: programming pipelines
- desc: WEB GL
- desc: An important perspective for me today, was the components of a computer generated
    image
- desc: Setup of WebGL
- desc: 'I loved the example of that ball you gave '
- desc: We learned about the immediate-mode graphics, color space from number of bits,
    WebGL, and frame buffer.
- desc: Chapter 1
- desc: "Today, I encountered the difference between immediate mode graphics and retained-mode\
    \ graphics. Immediate mode draws things quickly and doesn\u2019t save any information\
    \ for later use, while retained mode stores the geometry information in the GPU.\
    \ I also learned about the difference between bitmaps and vector graphics, and\
    \ how we handle colors and precision in digital images, and how to program with\
    \ WebGL2."
- desc: i became to know about WebGL 2 today. We will program with WebGL2 using html5,
    javascript and dom. I think we are kind of drawing some shape/image using WebGL2.
- desc: the difference between immediate mode and retained mode graphics, and how
    the retained graphics using GPUs, allow for more efficient rendering and better
    performance in games
