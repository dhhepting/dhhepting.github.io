- desc: anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: Welcome to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re At meeting planning

    today. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a choice in your

    courses that''s available now'
  persid: ''
- desc: until the end of the day.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t know why I can vote on

    this. Sometimes it tells me for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other activities that says I

    can''t. I''m not allowed to vote'
  persid: ''
- desc: or give my input,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but here I can. I''m just going

    to turn off the pictures to like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and look at the responses so

    far. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: Is everyone here voted.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have pointed responses and

    240 to keep the due date today,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five for Wednesday, Five for

    Friday, and eight for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: following Friday. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so keep an eye on it that it

    won''t be due today.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I asked you a question about

    colors and'
  persid: ''
- desc: reflection.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now let's take a look at this.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What''s going on in this piece of

    code?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone? Take a look at it?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone starting to feel a

    seizure coming on or I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I Don't need to make light
  persid: ''
- desc: of that. Let's do i
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make it easier to
  persid: ''
- desc: interpret What's going On. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what do we have? What are you

    looking at? What''s In the scene?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, Q, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how do we decide the colors

    that we see on the Cube? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a COVID reflection

    map. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: QC and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the cube we see is reflecting

    The environment from a cube we'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't see the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so the vertex shader,

    we''re getting the position by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplying the vertex after you

    get from our buffer by the ball'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of U and The projection matrix,

    and then we''re getting the eye'
  persid: ''
- desc: position.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not the eye position, it''s

    the position of the vertex in'
  persid: ''
- desc: eye coordinates,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we are transforming the

    normal and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the normal matrix, which is

    the matrix that we need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transform normals And object

    space to normals in our eye'
  persid: ''
- desc: space
  persid: ''
- desc: and and then
  persid: ''
- desc: we do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make A call to the GL SL

    function reflect. So that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to give us the information

    of where, where the reflection'
  persid: ''
- desc: is,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where, from? Where are we going

    to access the texture?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s no i No no colors

    assigned. Here, no vertex colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: assigned. We're just passing
  persid: ''
- desc: this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vec three for R for reflection,

    and in the fragment shader,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we take the reflection R as

    input and we output the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color. So we''re going to use a

    uniform sampler cube, so we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: a cube map,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and We''re determining the

    fragment color based on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: sample And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s returned by the texture

    function, GLSL, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how do we specify the texture

    map to'
  persid: ''
- desc: I Don't know that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'picture helps. Does it help or

    harm both? Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so anyway, that''s that''s the

    basic shader, the shaders that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are doing reflection maps. So

    all everything we see on screen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the reflection of the

    environment map.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: here we're defining the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'red, green, blue, cyan, gent and

    yellow as a union terrain and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s the configured texture

    map. So we''re going to create a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture, and then we''re binding

    texture, as we''re using a cube'
  persid: ''
- desc: map. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create the texture and bind it

    as a cube map here, and then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: specify the images that Go on
  persid: ''
- desc: each side.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we specify the positive x

    direction,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so positive x gets red, negative

    x gets green, positive y gets'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue, negative y gets cyan,

    positive z is yellow and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Negative z Is magenta i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So does that picture make more

    sense? Now? Let''s see. So an'
  persid: ''
- desc: agenda. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so here We
  persid: ''
- desc: have Green, Yellow and Blue. We
  persid: ''
- desc: so We're seeing we're this
  persid: ''
- desc: corner,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'In the reflection. So here''s a

    question. It''s a little design'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question, maybe, how do we make

    this code a little more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'demonstrative of reflection

    mapping?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is clear what''s going on

    from looking at the screen and'
  persid: ''
- desc: the code and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who says it''s crystal clear, the

    textbook author did A great job'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creating this sample piece of

    code. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: It's okay. I
  persid: ''
- desc: You don't have to You
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: what's going on. Let's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s do a few more rotations

    here and see what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so There seems to be an awful

    lot of magenta. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so do you have any questions

    that that we can discuss before'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we get To the point of how To

    improve the code? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should we leave it here? Who

    thinks this might be a good I it'
  persid: ''
- desc: question for The final exam you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So I mentioned Terminator

    two already, but I forgot about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the abyss. Anyone seen the

    abyss?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay? That''s a good movie to

    watch. Lots of interesting'
  persid: ''
- desc: special effects. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So similar to Terminator two.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I, okay, I don''t want to give

    any spoiler, in case you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to run out and download

    not download, but stream or Find'
  persid: ''
- desc: a copy of the Abyss to
  persid: ''
- desc: to watch the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the Ideas are reflecting the

    environment on to the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Our view position, a normal and

    the reflected vector and So'
  persid: ''
- desc: WebGL
  persid: ''
- desc: tube has only Q maps to work,
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're determining the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where the reflection reflective

    vector intersects the texture,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then that''s how we''re

    determining the frame and color'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we compute reflection as two

    times n dot v n minus V'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'log. Largest magnitude component

    of r will determine the face of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cube. The other two

    components give the texture of'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that gives a bit of

    explanation of how the colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: are chosen.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re putting together six

    different texture maps.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is obviously so you Just

    use texture in GLSL.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s The example. Consider

    to rotate a cube inside a cube'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that reflects the color of the

    walls. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a cube, as you may

    have guessed, but It''s using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different values of alpha, so

    The colors of Alpha point five'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how Do we make sense of this?

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's these are The shaders,
  persid: ''
- desc: fairly standard. And
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's look at The colors and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have black, red Hill,

    green, blue agenda, Cyan and'
  persid: ''
- desc: white defined. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So to enable to set up blending.

    So we''re using Z buffer, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ve enabled depth test,

    enable blend, and Then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing source alpha One. Minus

    source alpha one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so do all sides look translucent

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does this appear like you think

    it Should? I?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s turn off in Service

    removal and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and there''s No indication of

    whether the inserts rule is on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or off In the interface. That''s

    an issue with sound code and'
  persid: ''
- desc: So here's a simple piece
  persid: ''
- desc: of code that uses alpha so the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so GL position, again, geo

    position from the a position and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vertex color from the

    attribute color, and pass, pass'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those through to the fragment

    color In the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: shader. And you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve made yellow opaque and

    cyan opaque, and the Other ones'
  persid: ''
- desc: are translucent and
  persid: ''
- desc: so You can see some I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe that makes A little

    more sense. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: I want to show you Another
  persid: ''
- desc: one that's kind
  persid: ''
- desc: of fun. I
  persid: ''
- desc: does it look fun?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here we''re using two

    different texture maps, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re updating one from the

    other, and we''re flipping back'
  persid: ''
- desc: and forth.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is
  persid: ''
- desc: think of A game of Life. Maybe I
  persid: ''
- desc: so if you can see that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is the picking example that

    was mentioned earlier. So we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: render into an off screen buffer
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and make it easier to read from

    that buffer the solid colors,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can decide What''s

    going to select. It.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we''re doing our laying.

    We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and our fragment shader we have

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have, first of all, the

    vertex color that''s passed from'
  persid: ''
- desc: our vertex shader and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we have the Other face

    colors, red, green, Blue,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yellow,
  persid: ''
- desc: cyan and agenda.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re using uniform variable

    u color index.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we if it''s set to zero,

    it''s just going to pass the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fragment color to the shader.

    Otherwise, it''s going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fragment color from the

    vertex computed by the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader. If it''s set to other

    than zero, then we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: use the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can explain that better so you

    color index is an index into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seven to this seven color array.

    So the computed color is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position zero, then one through

    Seven are the primary colors. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: when you color the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me. So I''m not sure why the

    author has made the if statement'
  persid: ''
- desc: there. I
  persid: ''
- desc: because we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can just use the in depth color

    New color index to access All'
  persid: ''
- desc: the seven Colors And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we have the List of your

    mouse down and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so We're going to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to bind a frame buffer. So we''re

    going to draw the scene in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the frame buffer and then read

    the colors from it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s the read pixels

    command to get the color and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if red, so this is red is set

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I always prefer to use braces,

    so if I'
  persid: ''
- desc: if Red is on, if green is on, If
  persid: ''
- desc: that doesn't seem like cyan. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, you can write this more

    clearly, but the idea is we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draw a simpler version of the

    cube in the frame buffer read.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then when we interact with

    the frame buffer, we can read'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the solid color per face and

    return that so we know what''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'been picked and we can perform

    the interaction we want to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with that without having to deal

    with the complicated or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'complex fragment colors that

    Come out of the shader. Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions About the

    assignments I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any thoughts About that

    reflection now? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should it be stopped here for

    today? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thank you for today, see you on

    Wednesday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Take care. Thank
  persid: ''
- desc: Take care. Thank
