- desc: 'Okay, it''s fourth. It''s

    not fourth period time for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for that true excitement. So

    it''s our sixth meeting.'
  persid: ''
- desc: This is Chapter
  persid: ''
- desc: Three
  persid: ''
- desc: about animation in the
  persid: ''
- desc: direction, oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I wondered why the scooter was

    blank. I didn''t plug it into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: HDMI. I
  persid: ''
- desc: and I didn't save the changes. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, let me do that.
  persid: ''
- desc: It looks like It's been saved. I
  persid: ''
- desc: well, I put
  persid: ''
- desc: it In the wrong me. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, yes, I did.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll fix that shortly. Anyway,

    assignment, one questions,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the first time I made

    that. I guess it''s the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time for everything. Yeah, how

    much of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'code from examining the textbook

    Are we allowed to use? We'
  persid: ''
- desc: allowed
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to use, like we like

    boilerplate,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everything, textbook and just

    build right'
  persid: ''
- desc: on top of it? Yes. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you should make comments and

    make it be clear about what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re using from the textbook

    code, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not going to make you

    pretend to have come up with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things on your own, because

    we''re going to use the textbook'
  persid: ''
- desc: code
  persid: ''
- desc: as our examples for how to
  persid: ''
- desc: do things,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not the only way to do it,

    and some of the code samples are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a little bit dated, like var for

    example, isn''t a lot. That is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better way to handle things,

    handle variable declarations and'
  persid: ''
- desc: but
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s enough in the assignment

    for you to add on yourselves'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that you can take what You can

    take the sample of the starting'
  persid: ''
- desc: point And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did you see my additions to the

    assignment?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s a generic here''s the

    Genesis sequence from Star Trek,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Wrath of Khan. That''s not it.

    And and I didn''t realize that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Wrath of Khan came up before

    I graduated high school.'
  persid: ''
- desc: No thanks. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so here we go.
  persid: ''
- desc: Let me get the audio for you. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, that should do it. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instantaneously causing what we

    call the Genesis effect. Matter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is reorganized with life

    generally. Tip of living'
  persid: ''
- desc: breathing time
  persid: ''
- desc: 'came. Capable of sustaining

    whatever life forms we see, that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the reforming what we celebrate

    here represents the nearest'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'traction of the chances

    potential. Should the Federation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wish to fund these experiments

    to their logic when we consider'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cosmic problems of

    population and food supply. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'usefulness of this process

    becomes clear. This includes'
  persid: ''
- desc: early there are
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three simple changes. That''s how

    all fire stations make. Number'
  persid: ''
- desc: one, you
  persid: ''
- desc: have to start treating you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do you want to share you stopped

    at where it said you go to'
  persid: ''
- desc: surgery. Oh, great. Yeah. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'most days I''m drinking more

    water and maybe more coffee.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You might be drinking other

    things anyway You Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: just hide that video screen.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I So would you see the mountains

    that popped up? So the way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re using the triangle

    subdivision, perturbing the the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'midpoints of the triangles,

    we''re taking a surface or a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'height field, and then we''re

    displacing it in, well, if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think of it in x and y, and Then

    we''re displacing it in Z to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create the mountains, and we fly

    over. But if we think about z in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the distance, then we can think

    of it as the x said plane. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're changing y and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if you look closely enough,

    you can see there are some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'straight lines, some scenes in

    the in the mountains that don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look quite so natural. But for

    1982 this was a big thing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, that''s the reference I

    made to the Wrath of Khan and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the assignments. So I have added

    two images the samples of output'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here is with the random

    approach. So the idea is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three triangles in this if three

    sub triangles in this lower left'
  persid: ''
- desc: triangle are colored red,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a little more pink and a little

    more,'
  persid: ''
- desc: just a hint of Red in the white,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we have green the fully

    saturated green, less saturated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'green, and this is a white with

    a hint of green and then blue at'
  persid: ''
- desc: the top. Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so that's,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the sample for the random

    one. Here''s the recursive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subdivision sample. So it''s the

    same colors, red, green and blue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the lower right, lower left

    corners of the sub triangles and'
  persid: ''
- desc: then the other versions.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So a difference between the

    subdivision approach and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'random one is, if we did more

    subdivisions, we could see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'structure repeated at a finer

    level, so we would see the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: nine triangles
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in to subdivide each of these

    triangles, for example, does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that make sense? So the coloring

    would be preserved within the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nine triangles, and we can

    generate to a greater love of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'detail. So in the random case,

    we''re just going to see those'
  persid: ''
- desc: nine colors,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because there''s no we don''t have

    a information like we do in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subdivision case, in the

    recursive subdivision case. Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that make sense? Okay, any, Any

    other questions? Let me know. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so there''s a link for

    attendance for today.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I mentioned tints and tones

    the other day. So painters'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'terminal eye for mixing colors.

    If you take a pure color and mix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it with white, that''s a tint. If

    you mix the pure color with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gray, that''s a tone, and if you

    mix it with black, then you get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a shade. And that''s that''s in

    the Wikipedia reference. In the'
  persid: ''
- desc: Next line, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the title of the article is

    not more detailed about color,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but it''s HSV and HSL. So those

    are some transformations we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use on RGB to make them a little

    bit more intuitive to pick'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors. But it''s an interesting

    article, if you article, if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to look at it, that sun can

    be a focus of our, of our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'efforts in class. But there''s,

    there''s lots of issues about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creating a perceptually base

    colors, color ball that we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: use to select colors and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we talked about they''re

    presented as perceptually based,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but they''re not exactly accurate

    In all the perceptual parameters'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to get into chapter

    Three. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s try rotating square One

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's stop that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, Let me introduce Some

    ideas. First. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I didn't turn out too Bad.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does it look like a circle.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Now that doesn''t look squared,

    but Let''s imagine that It is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So cosine, if we think of the

    angle at zero, cosine of zero is'
  persid: ''
- desc: one, sine of zero is zero. So
  persid: ''
- desc: so you get minus One. So
  persid: ''
- desc: you have a comment, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for interaction, we''re

    dealing With the DOM and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'setting up callback functions,

    event listeners for different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things that happen interaction

    with the web browser window, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we use that to trigger

    events. So we define a callback'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for each event in the graphic

    system the callbacks is executed'
  persid: ''
- desc: when the event occurs. So
  persid: ''
- desc: we can see
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in our browser, we''re

    interacting with the web server,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then on the local computer,

    we have the JavaScript engine,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and our CPU and GPU, and then

    the canvas. And inside the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'associated with the canvas is

    the frame buffer. That''s the GL'
  persid: ''
- desc: context,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the HTML file that

    has describes the look of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'page, and it does contain the

    shaders in our cases, in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cases we''re looking at, we''re

    putting The shaders inside the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'HTML file with script tags, and

    then it loads the JavaScript'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'files that are needed or that

    are specified.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in our JavaScript files, we

    have things in init and render,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and those two functions are

    controlling the interaction with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the soft all the graphics that

    are going to go on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we don''t call init,

    nothing''s going to happen. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we use the onload event to

    start the init, and then The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'init calls render, and then it

    keeps going. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can generate points,

    location of the vertices by'
  persid: ''
- desc: evaluating the angles. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t just labeling makes

    sense with this diagram, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: I they're different
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here, So we can cosine and sine

    minus sine and cosine. Minus'
  persid: ''
- desc: cos
  persid: ''
- desc: minus sine of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can continue to do this.

    We could just calculate the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertices as we''re changing The

    angle, and we can substitute the'
  persid: ''
- desc: buffer data and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does that seem like a good

    approach? It''s straightforward,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but are we using the

    capabilities of our graphics'
  persid: ''
- desc: processing unit? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the vertices in the

    buffer. How about can transform'
  persid: ''
- desc: the vertices in The GPU and
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's just Send
  persid: ''
- desc: the angle of rotation and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so uniform variable isn''t

    changing isn''t linked to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertices or other things. So we

    can still change it, but it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not associated with each vertex.

    For example, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like we''ve done with the

    position attributes, we get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'location for that uniform angle

    input,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how do we indicate or help

    ourselves remember that it''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: uniform variable.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, we put u in front of the

    variable name.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in the render function, we

    clear the color bit, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: increment theta by point 01,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we set the value of the

    theta, theta location to, excuse'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me, please, to that variable. We

    make that connection. Then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: draw the triangles and render.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any issues there? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe the render is a problem

    that we''re calling render inside'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the render function, we might

    end up with a stack overflow'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'condition, because we can

    request the renders faster than'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can create The images. So the

    new addition is request'
  persid: ''
- desc: animation frame for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how Can we conceptualize

    creating? Frames in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: animation. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe that''s not A good

    question. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so If we have two sequential

    frames, how do we make the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'animation smooth? It might not

    take'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very much time for us to draw a

    square, a triangle, stripper'
  persid: ''
- desc: forward a seats and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much more complicated, And we''re

    trying to make them appear'
  persid: ''
- desc: smoothly on the
  persid: ''
- desc: comment,
  persid: ''
- desc: no, okay, do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s say we have two frames,

    and we say, request animation'
  persid: ''
- desc: frame, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going from one to two.

    What''s the condition we have for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frame two? Before we switch to

    it has to be done Dry. Yeah, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to have it finished drying.

    I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in OpenGL, we have a command

    called swap buffers. So we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: a
  persid: ''
- desc: so When we want to have a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smoothly rotating square or

    other animated model.'
  persid: ''
- desc: What? What do we need? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let me put that other way, if we

    want a smoothly animated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphic, can we wait an

    arbitrary amount of time for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'great to finish drawing. Say it

    takes five minutes. Are you'
  persid: ''
- desc: going to get an Animation?
  persid: ''
- desc: Not in Real Time. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in a traditional film we

    take, we have 24 frames per'
  persid: ''
- desc: second, and that I
  persid: ''
- desc: that is a fairly,
  persid: ''
- desc: fairly good animation. It's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CMT, North American broadcasting

    standard is three frames per'
  persid: ''
- desc: second. The
  persid: ''
- desc: modular displays.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Senator Brandon, Senator 72

    hertz per modern display.'
  persid: ''
- desc: What 60 Hertz to like 122,
  persid: ''
- desc: 44 depending on the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we do animation. We get some of

    them. You may see the frames per'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second. So for refreshing, 120

    times a second. That would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very smooth animation, if you

    could do 120, frames per second.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there is a term critical

    fusion frequency you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and that''s much lower than the

    top speed that we can get out of'
  persid: ''
- desc: our GPU. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So should we try? Let''s take a

    look at that rotating square'
  persid: ''
- desc: again. Let's
  persid: ''
- desc: finish the so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s our render function. So

    we''ve added the request'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'animation frame to make sure we

    don''t stop workflow condition.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is the vertex shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: So as input, we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the four position vector

    eight position which is a vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attribute we''ve set up in the

    JavaScript because it started in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A and then we''re dealing with

    the uniform theta and n. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re calculating the new

    position x and y.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we take minus theta minus u,

    theta times a position x, plus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cos theta times a position y, to

    get the x coordinate.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then we do a similar

    calculation for the new y'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinate, the z coordinate is

    set to zero and W set to one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: We'll talk about W shortly. The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so the buffer swap is done

    either with a request animation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frame, or we can set up an

    interval timer.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can set an interval timer

    for the render function and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interval interval greater than

    zero, so we don''t run into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Stack Overflow problem. Again,

    we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we have set timeout

    function and the function we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were doing for the timeout is

    the body of the render, so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the request animation,

    frame, Clear the clear the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen, increment, U, theta, and

    draw the strip, and the interval'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is 100 milliseconds, so 1/10 of

    a second will trigger A new'
  persid: ''
- desc: grand tree and
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, let's look At the
  persid: ''
- desc: code. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: so We have a vertex here. We're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'degree. So we''re getting sine

    and cosine of d theta. And this'
  persid: ''
- desc: is
  persid: ''
- desc: this, our
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation for the X and Y

    take minus sign u theta times a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position y plus cosine u theta

    times a partition x, then for so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the new x. The new y is

    sine u theta times x to the x'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position and cosine u theta

    times the y position, so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does what was advertised in the

    slide. And then F color fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color is going to be red. So

    let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: take a look at how that plays
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out in JavaScript. So this is

    the onload to make sure the init'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gets called. So we''re getting

    the Canvas ID by using the dog'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then getting a contact with

    the count from the campus so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we can use GL two, we have

    a GL two set up the display. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here are the vertices. So the

    first section here is loading'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vertices into the ray buffer

    so,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the square 01 minus

    10100, minus one. So that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: centered at the origin.
  persid: ''
- desc: Minus Zero. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 01, minus 101,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I must need some more coffee.

    It''s not a square, it''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diamond. Anyone remember the

    shreves commercials from a few'
  persid: ''
- desc: years ago? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s basically shreddings are

    squares, but they turned them on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the side, and then, oh, they''re

    diamonds.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, anyway, so that was my

    struggle with doing math on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the board for the day, I think.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we connect, you load the

    vertices, so that''s our starting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position, and then we connect

    the buffer with the eight'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position variable in the

    shaders.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then we''re also getting

    we''re making the connection with'
  persid: ''
- desc: new data,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then the rendering is as in

    the slide. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have rotating square so

    that''s set up so that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making the most of the GPU.

    We''re just we''re just sending'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four coordinates for the

    vertices of the square, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re doing a transformation in

    the shaders on the GPU,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re Not having to send a

    great deal of information you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so the controls didn''t

    show up because I had zoomed out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'too much. Zoomed in too much. So

    then we have the ability.'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we have a couple

    controls There. Let''s look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: how we set those up.
  persid: ''
- desc: So in the HTML file we have the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the button ID called direction,

    change the rotation direction,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we have a select

    control. So zero, an input of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero gives us change of

    direction. One makes spin'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'faster. Two controls Spin

    decreases the speed of spinning.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so you we''ve named these

    so we can access them in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: JavaScript you
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can see that
  persid: ''
- desc: we have a
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're initializing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the event handler for the

    direction button, so we get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'album via key and we see On

    Click function. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'changing the direction. We''re

    negating the previous version'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value for the direction, so it''s

    either zero or one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then the controls once you click

    on the controls, we have an'
  persid: ''
- desc: event handler.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, case zero is direction

    changes, case one for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a little confusing, I

    think, because so we can click'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on so the first one is clicking

    on a display'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and 01, and two, and then on key

    down, switching through, using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, two and 3s case to enter.

    So anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'else think that''s a little

    confusing? I mean, you don''t see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the 01, and two, I think it''s so

    you can use your keyboard as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well as just clicking on it.

    Yeah, I''m just talking about the'

    place night, thinking that''s the'
  persid: ''

    I want to input. Anyone else'
  persid: ''
