- desc: Okay, Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Happy first meeting of

    October, they were'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to enjoy the two

    transition from 31 to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 13 and
  persid: ''
- desc: rain in the wind.
  persid: ''
- desc: Error, he here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I want to talk about October,

    11. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s the day that we''re

    going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to be having
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an event for The theme of the

    50th'
  persid: ''
- desc: anniversary of the university. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thank you. I so We have our

    guest. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So he was a contemporary of mine

    in The undergraduate program.'
  persid: ''
- desc: He's now CEO of Kent imaging. He
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does that sound like somebody

    would be interesting to even'
  persid: ''
- desc: talk with? I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there wasn''t a correct answer

    there,'
  persid: ''
- desc: but I went to get your input,
  persid: ''
- desc: because there's a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tragic set of circumstances here

    at university. I think there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: no peace on campus presently who
  persid: ''
- desc: thinks us no age,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not clear, because there''s

    so many food service places that'
  persid: ''
- desc: are boarded up,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but apparently they don''t have

    pizza as an option to order for'
  persid: ''
- desc: Food Services.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: we can order
  persid: ''
- desc: pizza from off campus.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So would you like to would you

    I?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you think a lunchtime event

    would be something you could'
  persid: ''
- desc: you might take in on the 11th?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And if we have a choice between

    sandwiches and rats and pizza,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who votes for pizza? You don''t

    have to commit to going to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: lunch and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and who votes for sandwiches and

    rats? Oh, strong showing for'
  persid: ''
- desc: sandwiches and rats. So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is that a true statement of the

    fact that you can get free food,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s that''s the biggest

    factor.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll be sending a note out
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tonight or tomorrow with some

    more particular details. This'
  persid: ''
- desc: will be
  persid: ''
- desc: recorded and available
  persid: ''
- desc: 'later. So this is in the regular

    seminar slot for The Department'
  persid: ''
- desc: i Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: down to Business here for
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points are you can draw points

    on the screen and'
  persid: ''
- desc: we can approximate well,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they don''t have any size or

    shape or'
  persid: ''
- desc: they are
  persid: ''
- desc: Just a location space i
  persid: ''
- desc: What else Do we need?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Time points to describe

    geometric objects that we''d like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to render on the screen

    measures.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I enough to get a space there,
  persid: ''
- desc: because
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nationals are important a

    triangular mesh is an important'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way to represent objects, to

    model them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how do we get to think about

    the triangles?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: if we start with points,
  persid: ''
- desc: scalars. So What are they?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can be real numbers, maybe

    complex numbers,'
  persid: ''
- desc: usually real and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if you think about the

    distance between points, this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is between 00, and one, zero is

    one'
  persid: ''
- desc: as a scalar.
  persid: ''
- desc: And vectors.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s going on with vectors,

    direction'
  persid: ''
- desc: and direction? So
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can think of
  persid: ''
- desc: directed line segments and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if two vectors have the same

    direction and magnitude,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They''re the same because they

    don''t have a position what if'
  persid: ''
- desc: there
  persid: ''
- desc: were 10 years? I factors. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I diving. So we can talk about

    it as a frame. So we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vectors plus two. We have

    vectors'
  persid: ''
- desc: x, y and z. We could
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have, we could think of the most

    unit vectors along the X, Y and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Z axes and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we don''t usually think of

    them being drawn that way, but I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can put them in
  persid: ''
- desc: together that way.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what hand?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What handed, which handed

    coordinate system Is that'
  persid: ''
- desc: in here? Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when we''re thinking about

    computer graphics,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We might deal with a number of

    different frames and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you might think, first of

    all, object frame.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the thing, the primitives

    that'
  persid: ''
- desc: we are going to work with,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we define them on their own

    coordinate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'system, in their own frame.

    That''s convenient. We have Q'
  persid: ''
- desc: define it from the origin and
  persid: ''
- desc: should I try that again? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looks more parallel, but it''s

    still not I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So you can take the cube and

    say, We want to make it. You can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scale it, rotate it, translate

    it into'
  persid: ''
- desc: our model.
  persid: ''
- desc: And we might think of many cubes
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the models or making the

    transformation from the object,'
  persid: ''
- desc: spade, object frame
  persid: ''
- desc: of the cube into
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the world coordinates that,

    pardon me, into the Model'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates and
  persid: ''
- desc: so then we're putting them into
  persid: ''
- desc: this new frame
  persid: ''
- desc: where the transform
  persid: ''
- desc: objects
  persid: ''
- desc: are
  persid: ''
- desc: in one frame together.
  persid: ''
- desc: There's one origin and so on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What other frames to deal with,

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: any thoughts i
  persid: ''
- desc: What about a camera frame? So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we''re taking pictures of

    the camera.'
  persid: ''
- desc: How do we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specify the three three vectors

    for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: of the frame and the origin and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so We can think of the eye or

    the camera, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: at the origin here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what if I want to take a

    picture of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the exit sign here
  persid: ''
- desc: we described
  persid: ''
- desc: The screen so
  persid: ''
- desc: I have the camera here.
  persid: ''
- desc: That's a position in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'space, x, y and Z, and I''m

    looking At the sign I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'still doesn''t look like he''s

    running, but so I have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position for the camera. I''m

    looking at something like the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chair. So that''s one direct I

    can have that direction. I have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vector going from the camera

    to the chair or whatever I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: looking at.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What else do I need to specify

    the coordinates i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What if I want To take a

    portrait picture'
  persid: ''
- desc: or an angled picture,
  persid: ''
- desc: which way is up and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can make the third

    vector by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cross product of look at and

    up and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s the core camera frame.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what other you mentioned one set

    of coordinates the other Day'
  persid: ''
- desc: that was I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you Imagine this is A key

    again. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's another frame
  persid: ''
- desc: that we're getting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the world, which might be

    hundreds of 1000s of kilometers,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we squish it into
  persid: ''
- desc: the clip or
  persid: ''
- desc: depth frame to the
  persid: ''
- desc: together, ready to display. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so we had a window
  persid: ''
- desc: frame as well. And
  persid: ''
- desc: that relates to the viewport
  persid: ''
- desc: that we set up and
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can Do transformations

    between them. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: so We Can You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s look at A matrix to do

    scaling I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so We can have so it starts with

    A Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so the identity matrix so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if We apply a negative scale

    factor, we get reflections and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we want to preserve the

    object would just reflect around'
  persid: ''
- desc: y,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we could apply a scale factor

    of y minus one. What if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we Want to translate the point?

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we take the hard scale
  persid: ''
- desc: and maintenance you
  persid: ''
- desc: And then we have
  persid: ''
- desc: So we apply
  persid: ''
- desc: transformation and
  persid: ''
- desc: so We multiply our point, p1 px,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'py, pz, by our transformation

    matrix, and then we would add a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translation component. So that''s

    not Very effective or efficient.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so using the homogeneous

    coordinates,'
  persid: ''
- desc: we have the 3d affine
  persid: ''
- desc: transformation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Simple example is the scaling

    matrix. So we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: suspects and and
  persid: ''
- desc: now we can do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to specify the translation

    vector in the same matrix, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: then we have Tx
  persid: ''
- desc: equal I instead.
  persid: ''
- desc: So points
  persid: ''
- desc: are represented as
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four tuple, so we have x, y, z

    and w.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So w is often one, but for

    points, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'convert them to three dimensions

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can think of lights w

    equal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to one and vectors W equal to

    zero. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so the idea is that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can, in our rendering

    pipeline, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can transform our world

    coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into Window coordinates by doing

    a series of'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformations you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when I look at the cube,

    rotating cube, this is Coda'
  persid: ''
- desc: sound from chapter four. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we''re looking in the z

    direction, which X are we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotating on here to Begin with

    you'
  persid: ''
- desc: so if We're out here somewhere,
  persid: ''
- desc: is It Z?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, it''s an X, Y, I think it''s

    x.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's do rotating or y. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? And
  persid: ''
- desc: we can add rotations as well? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you stare the blind enough

    with false feeling, maybe go.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Just did hypnosis. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so eventually you''re getting a

    rotation around the center and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the axis of rotation is a

    combination of x, y and z'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'angles. So that''s as finite

    controls are given in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'example. Let''s check out the

    source code for this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so the vertex shader, so

    we have uniform VEC 3u theta, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the angle is a uniform and so we

    have X, Y and Z values as part'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the VEC three we''re passing

    for u, theta. And then the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing is to compute the size of

    cosines of theta for each of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: three axis and one computation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s converting the angles

    into radians and then computing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vectors of cosines and sines

    based on the rate the the angles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specified in radians. So then.

    So you''ll notice, as you look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through examples of the code

    that this typo has repeated many'
  persid: ''
- desc: times over.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what does it mean that

    matrices are in column major'
  persid: ''
- desc: order? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes. So a column major means

    that we''re putting the column,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'putting them together in

    columns. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first formula is going to

    the first column. Next four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to the second column, the

    next four go in the third'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'column, and the last four going

    to the last column, and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fourth, fourth and last column.

    Does that make sense? So these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are the way. This is the way to

    define rotation matrices around'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the X, Y and Z axes, so using

    the dot notation here to specify'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the x component of the vector,

    the y component of the vector'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the z component of the

    vector. Vector is the cosine.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the vertex color is taken

    from the attribute color that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specify in the JavaScript

    program. And GL position is our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attribute position that we''ve

    started with, the our initial'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cube that we specified in the

    JavaScript code. And then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: applying
  persid: ''
- desc: 'X, Y and Z rotations to

    determine new position.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then the vertex, the private

    shirt is just passing through'
  persid: ''
- desc: the color and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re specifying a cat. This

    is 512 by 512 so let''s look at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the pupa js to see what''s going

    on there. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so why do we have none positions

    as 36 so'
  persid: ''
- desc: secured by three or six sides.
  persid: ''
- desc: So How many faces?
  persid: ''
- desc: Four,
  persid: ''
- desc: six, I?
  persid: ''
- desc: And so how many? So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re not going to represent

    them as squares, because squares'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might be non planar. So how many

    triangles make up a square? Two?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Two, yeah, two triangles.
  persid: ''
- desc: So now we've got 12. How
  persid: ''
- desc: do we roll? So what's what?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What do we need three of them

    for each triangle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have three vertices. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three vertices per triangle. So

    six times two times three is 36'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to generate we''re

    going to store 36 positions. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can do better than that. You

    don''t have to store because how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'many vertices are there? Not Q?

    I?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s four on the top and

    four on the bottom.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can use a more efficient

    way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can look at that for

    yourselves, and we''ll talk about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it some more as well. Okay, so

    10 minutes left, let''s see'
  persid: ''
- desc: what's going on here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we do the standard

    stuff. So we define so we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the red GL to campus, get the

    context, and we set the set up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the viewport. And we enable

    depth tests so that we''re using'
  persid: ''
- desc: the Z buffer loading shades,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you''re restoring colors and

    the colors is defined.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so color cube is called

    first, so that sets up the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors. So we''re taking that

    brain that We''ve set up and'
  persid: ''
- desc: flattening it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we put the colors there, and

    now we''re giving the A color.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re linking that to the

    attribute, so it''s a four RGBA'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we''re passing as the color

    locate, color value, Color'
  persid: ''
- desc: attribute,
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'storing the vertex data, another

    array there, and then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'associating with the variable in

    the shader. And then finally, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do the uniform variable for the

    theta, the X, Y and Z angles. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we click on the on the X

    button in the interface that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get when we set the axis to X, Y

    and Z and we go to Render and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in a render, we set the color

    bit, and we''re doing the clear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the color bit and the theft

    buffer bit, so we''re resetting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Z buffer and resetting The

    screen to be the background'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cover that we set. So the thing

    we do is we increment the angle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by two degrees, depending on

    which axis we''ve chosen, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we set it. We connect the

    value that we''ve just said in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'theta to the uniform variable in

    the shader. We say, draw arrays,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draw triangles to start at zero.

    We go for 36 positions, and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say, request animation frame for

    render. So that''s the rendering.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Use
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the color key. So we do quads.

    So there are six calls to quad.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so they will be given the

    vertices. So 1032,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we start with so the first

    quad is minus point five, point'
  persid: ''
- desc: '5.5, and one. And zero is minus

    point five, minus point 5.5,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and one and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then then three minus or point

    five minus point 5.5, and one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and two is point five point 5.5,

    And one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we specify the vertices of

    the quad based on our input to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the function, and then we also

    have colors, vertex Colors and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re so we take the indices,

    so we''re taking the quad face'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and dividing the two triangles.

    That means the four vertices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have become six because we''re

    duplicating vertices, so we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three vertices for each

    triangle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can see A, B, C, A, C, D,

    so A and C are repeated.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s the way to describe

    the two triangles that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'correspond to the one face the

    cube.'
  persid: ''
- desc: They've commented on the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stuff that assigns different

    colors to each vertex. So just'
  persid: ''
- desc: using solid colors so for each i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for each vertex, we''re

    pushing the same color. So A is'
  persid: ''
- desc: C,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see. So A is one for the first

    squad. So we''re going to color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the those two triangles red. So

    the face is going to be red for'
  persid: ''
- desc: that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, what would happen if we had

    a bigger Q instead of minus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point five to plus point five in

    x, y and z? What if it was one'
  persid: ''
- desc: minus one to one? I?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because we''re not specifying the

    details of the transformation,'
  persid: ''
