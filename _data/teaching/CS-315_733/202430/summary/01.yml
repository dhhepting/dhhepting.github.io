- desc: So. get that going. I
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe There's more truck,
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't know. Here. I guess that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t move anyway. I''ll bring

    more shock. So some of you are'
  persid: ''
- desc: familiar faces to me,
  persid: ''
- desc: some others not,
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re going to talk about

    computer graphics this semester.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can you see my hand if I write

    it large enough for the Back'
  persid: ''
- desc: row? I
  persid: ''
- desc: I should turn the lights on
  persid: ''
- desc: so in the
  persid: ''
- desc: 80s, late 80s, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did my masters here in the

    computer graphics lab and went'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to SIGGRAPH in 1988 a few years

    ago,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer graphics has advanced a

    lot since then. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i was watching Twister from 1996

    and the flying cows and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tornadoes were quite impressive,

    and seem,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seemed Very realistic for the

    year that was made.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, I
  persid: ''
- desc: let me say, textbook.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how many have gone on to the

    campus store website or fallen'
  persid: ''
- desc: and said
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there is no textbook for the

    class.'
  persid: ''
- desc: That's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the state that I found about,

    found out about earlier today.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: so It's a
  persid: ''
- desc: interactive peer graphics
  persid: ''
- desc: machine and Edward Angel,
  persid: ''
- desc: and I might have his last
  persid: ''
- desc: name wrong. here.
  persid: ''
- desc: and It's online only. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, I''ve had a few issues with

    you our courses and things, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: let me see
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so now I've
  persid: ''
- desc: displayed the course to you. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 23 meetings.
  persid: ''
- desc: So normally, with
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a month two meetings per week,

    we''d have 26 so we Truth and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Reconciliation Day falls on a

    Monday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Remembrance Day falls on a

    Monday, and I''m not sure the'
  persid: ''
- desc: third one where we lose,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but it works out to 23 so I

    want,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, what I want to do first is

    go over the course and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: marking scheme.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'By our next meeting on Monday,

    everything will be in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: proper place.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s start. I''m going to try

    your courses email again. How'
  persid: ''
- desc: many people like that?
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm trying to.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you want to get a hold of

    Me for class related things, use'
  persid: ''
- desc: your courses. Email i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, okay, I found a couple more

    pieces of chalk. I don''t have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t have to have that cloud

    hang over me. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, your
  persid: ''
- desc: 'courses email to contact me. So

    for our meetings of the 23'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meetings we have attendance. I

    So,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re allowed to record your

    own attendance. So, it''s open'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'during class times. So if you.

    can, anyone with a device not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'able to get to this your courses

    page.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can take a minute Now to

    record Your attendance,'
  persid: ''
- desc: applause,
  persid: ''
- desc: So I've made
  persid: ''
- desc: a bare bone structure for
  persid: ''
- desc: A leadings wiki.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is an opportunity to

    record'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'notes and resources and so forth

    that come up during the'
  persid: ''
- desc: meetings. So
  persid: ''
- desc: so I given
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just patient four marks, So this

    would encourage you to take'
  persid: ''
- desc: attendance. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so In class involvement as well.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so This next item is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''ll take have a look at

    that and see if it makes sense'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to me when I''ve written the

    first paragraph, I will have'
  persid: ''
- desc: included a beach quiz
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can answer more than one, if you

    like. That''ll help me to make'
  persid: ''
- desc: sure
  persid: ''
- desc: we cover points that are
  persid: ''
- desc: 'giving problems answer questions

    at the start of the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting. But if you just write

    no or nothing for one of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions, that''s not really

    helping you. So if you write a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thoughtful response to one of

    the prompt questions, you get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two marks. And if upon. So if

    you submit a submission of these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responses, you''ll get two marks,

    automatically,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you don''t do it, you get

    zero. Make a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comment that''s related to the

    meeting, or it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not thoughtful and thoughtful,

    you got one mark. And if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need a thoughtful comment, you

    get two marks. So anyone from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last semester you''d like to

    comment, was this a helpful'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing to do? Or was it a good

    way to get a certain chunk of'
  persid: ''
- desc: Mars by
  persid: ''
- desc: being engaged?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t know. This out. I tried

    it last semester by the winter,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: it was worth a little bit more.
  persid: ''
- desc: as.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the response will be

    available after class until noon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the following day, and after at

    noon tomorrow, I will see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comments that I that were left,

    and I''ll post them anonymously'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'under the three categories. Let

    me'
  persid: ''
- desc: preview this.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, this is what it looks

    like.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s the first caught. That

    first paragraph is repeated'
  persid: ''
- desc: there.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what important concept or

    perspective that you encounter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the last meeting? Was there

    anything in the last meeting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that was difficult to

    understand? Was there anything'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the last meeting about which

    you would like to know more?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I will post the
  persid: ''
- desc: responses anonymously and under
  persid: ''
- desc: those three headings,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can use as a

    register for discussion.'
  persid: ''
- desc: For the next day.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are collapse little

    topics, so you don''t have'
  persid: ''
- desc: to see all of them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So another thing that I''ll ask

    you to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: are quizzes. Before
  persid: ''
- desc: meetings and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so they''ll be available by 6pm

    the day before the next meeting'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should I go up there and see

    what''s going on? Who'
  persid: ''
- desc: would like you to go
  persid: ''
- desc: see what's going On. That was an
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opportunity For the Bible''s

    participation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You maybe not locked in.
  persid: ''
- desc: 6pm
  persid: ''
- desc: so today is Wednesday,
  persid: ''
- desc: as you may recall, maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: before the next meeting,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some of that will be Tuesday.

    Tuesdays for Wednesdays and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Fridays
  persid: ''
- desc: for Monday's meeting.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you have the weekend until

    230 on Monday to do the quiz.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And for Wednesday meetings, you

    have from 6pm Tuesday till the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class time to do the quiz. So

    they''ll be marked automatically'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m not asking for creative

    writing. It''ll be something that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will include some keywords,

    perhaps, or something that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something that your courses can

    handle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m not looking so that will

    give you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a nice sense of what I''m looking

    for.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Just a way for you to look at

    the material people today,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material that gives you for next

    day and to'
  persid: ''
- desc: keep you engaged in the class.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, So, so 315 has labs and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so those would be 12 marks. So

    for 315 you''re getting six labs.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So each lab is worth two marks.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: And for 733
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll be doing a presentation to

    make up to allocate those marks,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because grad students aren''t

    going to the labs. 733 can'
  persid: ''
- desc: access the lab material,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do the exercises, if you like.

    There''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: lots of good stuff there.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is 30 marks so far. I
  persid: ''
- desc: then we have 45 marks
  persid: ''
- desc: for exams, 15 for the
  persid: ''
- desc: midterm, 30 for the final and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I must pass the final pass the

    Bus.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not trying to fail anybody.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's just
  persid: ''
- desc: the final exam will give you an
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opportunity to assess your

    learning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'without consulting others,

    because all the other things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could be done in a group. So the

    final exam is a way for you to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'demonstrate that you have grasp

    of concepts.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, I don''t want people to be

    scared about that, and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'probably doesn''t help when I say

    you don''t. Shouldn''t be scared'
  persid: ''
- desc: about it.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, does
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that mean we''d be able to

    collaborate on the midterm?'
  persid: ''
- desc: No Good question, though. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So joke, okay, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you shouldn''t call it a joke.

    That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of aspirational, perhaps,

    but if you don''t suggest any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions, we''ll still have

    exams.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And so for collaborations this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collaborate on the minimum final

    sound.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You Oh, I didn''t talk about

    assignments.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so 30 plus 45 plus 25 should

    equal 100 okay, I worked that'
  persid: ''
- desc: out ahead of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time. Instead of I find that

    doing that on'
  persid: ''
- desc: the board is very difficult.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I Okay, so we''re going to do

    some assignments'
  persid: ''
- desc: that get you to do kind
  persid: ''
- desc: of the accommodation of
  persid: ''
- desc: written and programming.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s fine to talk about

    assignments in groups on'
  persid: ''
- desc: Discord,
  persid: ''
- desc: whatever you used to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'communicate with you can use

    forums in your courses and ask'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions. So we''ll have a

    collection of assignments,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'probably five of them, each

    worth 5% over the course of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: semester. So that's another way.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, you get to apply the

    concepts that we talk about.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so they will likely be a

    little different between 315,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and 733, those assignments.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any questions about that? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So has anyone ever heard of the

    participant pool in computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'science. So the idea is why

    computer wrote in psychology, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we do the same thing in computer

    science. So we have a number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people who are potentially doing

    studies, participants, people to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participate. So computer science

    studies are invasive. It''s more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about asking you how to perform

    a task or how you use an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interface. So if you''re

    interested in departmental'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'research and maybe doing some

    research later on, that''s a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way to get a taste of us, the

    things that are going on in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'department. So this is only

    available if through our studies'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then further confidently

    some opportunities this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'semester. So for each study

    participated for up to an hour,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you get a research credit. So

    that''s enough to say, thank you,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but it''s not too much to say to

    encourage to'
  persid: ''
- desc: twist your arm, because
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t want to do this, but I''m

    getting 25% bonus mark in The'
  persid: ''
- desc: class, and
  persid: ''
- desc: I can turn that down.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So 1% says thank you, but it''s

    not so it''s not a worse amount'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that would feel like you''re

    forced to do it when you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making a one two. So forget

    people who are feeling forced to'
  persid: ''
- desc: do it. That's the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ethical issue about free and

    informed consent, and it''s also'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the issue of the study, the

    quality of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the data indicated
  persid: ''
- desc: when people are locked,
  persid: ''
- desc: meaning able to say no.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so that's 102
  persid: ''
- desc: 100 plus two bonus marks, we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s breakdown for The class

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so trying to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to get ahead of things

    differently. I thought, I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'start with a greater report or a

    grade book set up. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and that didn''t help me very

    much, in fact.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So here I
  persid: ''
- desc: the first one for today's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting. I created it, but it

    didn''t show up in the grade'
  persid: ''
- desc: book,
  persid: ''
- desc: so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have sorted all the other

    meetings.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe because I''m looking at in

    front of you, it''ll show up.'
  persid: ''
- desc: It'll appear to me. I
  persid: ''
- desc: No, I'm still not there.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway. So this is a breakdown

    of the marking for the semester.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So responses, quizzes, each

    seven marks, participation, four'
  persid: ''
- desc: marks,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignments, 25 marks, labs or

    presentations, 12 marks, exams,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 45 marks.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And the research Credit two

    Bonus marks the'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think I''ve got the name right,

    especially for school for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer graphics, interactive

    techniques. I''ll check that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But they also put on the big

    conference, so that was the 1988'
  persid: ''
- desc: SIGGRAPH that they attended
  persid: ''
- desc: as a grad student.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so I''d like to talk, get

    started talking about computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics. Any questions about

    how we''re going to organize a'
  persid: ''
- desc: class? Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So they would like to volunteer

    their experience or familiarity'
  persid: ''
- desc: with computer graphics from
  persid: ''
- desc: 'playing Call of Duty and Yeah,

    Anything'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that is displayed on The

    computer screen over there.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think this is about the lowest

    I can write without'
  persid: ''
- desc: becoming illegible.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll try and keep that in mind.

    If I end up creating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a squiggle that doesn''t resemble

    any word,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let me know, and I''ll try and

    decipher my writing. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sometimes I will stop myself,

    depending on how long'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it is between writing it and

    trying to read it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see what happens
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with larger keyboard and the

    mouse are so inviting, I forget'
  persid: ''
- desc: starting
  persid: ''
- desc: off my laptop. I up my laptop.
  persid: ''
- desc: One of The way i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So those screens are bit mapped.

    Anyone heard that term Before I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can specify
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the color we Want to display at

    a particular location. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'back when I was a grad student,

    1024, 768, was high resolution'
  persid: ''
- desc: graphics,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They would know offhand what The

    4k'
  persid: ''
- desc: resolution is so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I suspect that closing the Doors

    is making it a little warmer in'
  persid: ''
- desc: here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Next time people start talking

    right outside the door, I''ll say'
  persid: ''
- desc: New instead of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let them stay there and just

    close the doors. Anyway.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Comment,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who gave me strength?

    Dimensions, 3840, by 2160, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 33840,
  persid: ''
- desc: by 1210, okay, sorry,
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is, I believe it''s a 16 by nine

    aspect ratio.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you know the aspect ratio,

    then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we only need one of the

    dimensions to fill in the other.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Has anyone heard of the term

    pixel before? What''s a pixel?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, it''s the smallest

    addressable portion of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bid path representing one dot.

    Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a small, stressful unit on a

    display.'
  persid: ''
- desc: See that now? Now what
  persid: ''
- desc: 'else we''re gonna see? So

    actually, it''s made up of'
  persid: ''
- desc: a picture of the element.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s like motive in that way,

    it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we also have voxels
  persid: ''
- desc: for volume elements.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what is a pixel? So it''s a

    small student, or what does it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a shape? What is that? Is

    it a square? It could be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: Square, but it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so LV Ray Smith, who was a

    silicon practice, perhaps, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not sure he wrote a demo or

    technical report about pixels,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talking about another square.

    You don''t have a geometry there.'
  persid: ''
- desc: We Need samples. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that kind of looks like

    squirrels supposed to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: squares. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so let''s imagine that

    square divided inches of One big'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'square divided into 25 milli

    squares. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we don''t preserve the

    aspect ratio, you see pictures'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that get squished like a flat

    house. I remind them the'
  persid: ''
- desc: case is a holiday.
  persid: ''
- desc: Remember? I never that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really an old reference,

    swishing Your head.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Perspective, I can find it you
  persid: ''
- desc: so anyway, the idea is, if
  persid: ''
- desc: you sample an image,
  persid: ''
- desc: we sample a phenomenon,
  persid: ''
- desc: we take the samples being
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equally spaced, then we want to

    keep'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those, keep that information. So

    we keep the aspect ratio, so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'keep the squares, the little

    squares, even'
  persid: ''
- desc: though we might have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for doing 16 by nine, you could

    say 16 horizontal. And nine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertical. Does that make sense?

    Any questions or comments back'
  persid: ''
- desc: there? No,
  persid: ''
- desc: okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if these dots are the samples

    that we take,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s say if we''re converting to

    an image, which is a bitmap'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'display, so we''re getting

    pixels.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the pixels are a discrete

    representation of a continuous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'phenomenon, like if I want to

    take a picture of the room, so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would counter rotate many more

    samples than 25 but we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: taking,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re computing and sensing a

    value for the different parts of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the image and getting a value

    that gets displayed in that the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and those positions in the image

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So are there things that we

    might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'encounter that would miss the

    sample, would not be detected by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the sample by the sampling

    scheme, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m just sounding at the dots

    there. I''m not going to, I''m not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to Continue that deep

    down. Does that make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So let''s think of this grid

    as'
  persid: ''
- desc: a mesh.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if you want to make sure

    they''re going to capture'
  persid: ''
- desc: objects,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they can''t fall through the

    mesh,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that they're smaller than
  persid: ''
- desc: if you have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you''re screening out the big

    rocks, the little ones, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: imagining is sort of sieve
  persid: ''
- desc: 'strainer, and the things that

    you can represent will have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: be stuck By the strainer
  persid: ''
- desc: as Well. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we had this kind of line
  persid: ''
- desc: on display?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Would you expect to see a blank

    screen on A modern display? So'
  persid: ''
- desc: we have some idea of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soon I talked about anti

    aliasing or aliasing, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'aliasing is an artifact that

    comes from not sounding at A'
  persid: ''
- desc: high enough resolution.
  persid: ''
- desc: During 1980 Janice were big and
  persid: ''
- desc: sort of diagonal
  persid: ''
- desc: line on a display in An action.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Compare that line with with

    straight line and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so to have the textbook sorted

    out, coriander this week. Any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quick questions about this

    stuff, so you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a look online. About if

    there''s an alternative to good'
  persid: ''
- desc: map displays. What about vector?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so think about those

    things in both recession they'
  persid: ''
- desc: have. You for your attention
  persid: ''
- desc: today. Have a great
  persid: ''
- desc: 'day and a great Evening. See you

    on'
  persid: ''
- desc: Monday. What does
  persid: ''
- desc: this mean? I
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, hi.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I just didn''t get it. What

    exactly the pixel cost? Let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say I am making a YouTube video

    so I can just watch it on this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one also, I mean, just on my

    iPhone as well, and on this, on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my Mac as well, right? So, is

    there any specific does pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: have a proper size?
  persid: ''
- desc: So video get sampled different
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I mean, I mean, let''s say I can

    just, I can watch a 4k video on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'YouTube, on this device as well,

    and this device as well, right?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, so there''s more data than it

    needs. No, but if you have a 4k'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'video, you have more data than

    you need. Yeah, there''s an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'excess of data to see it on a

    small screen, yeah, but if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'had a video that was at this

    resolution, then seen on 4k'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you might not have enough data.

    Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bigger the screen, the more the

    data you need, right? Yeah. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we the maximum possible is 4k I

    suppose, or is there 8k also, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think there are 8k is possible?

    Is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything''s possible? Pretty

    well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I just didn''t get it when

    you say that pixel is not a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'square, it''s a sample. What

    exactly the sample?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so it
  persid: ''
- desc: can be any shape.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you had a bunch of light

    bulbs, like certain light bulbs,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you just put them all in a

    big row, if you were far enough'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'away from it, you could make a

    perfect picture that would look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that would have detail, but if

    you''re up close, it would just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look like a bunch of random

    colors. So, like, the pixels can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be any size. You could have

    triangle pixels. There''s no'
  persid: ''
- desc: limit, really.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, you could as I think of a

    tile mosaic is at the right'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'resolution. It looks like a

    picture, but, yeah, if you zoom'
  persid: ''
- desc: in enough, it's not,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, it just looks like they''re

    aliasing, right? Let''s say, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re having a picture of low

    quality. When we zoom in, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just looks like that thing. LDS

    in, yeah, the shape just looks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very different. And why does it

    look squares instead of any, any'
  persid: ''
- desc: random, random shapes?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah. Well, a square is easy to

    show it''s easy to fit together.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so we''re each at each

    point we''re taking a sample of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the phenomenon. So here we have

    looking. Here we get green from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the blackboard, or from here we

    get white from the chalk. Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re creating a discretized

    image. So we''re making the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'continuous because we see these

    swirls of the chalk dust after'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the eraser. So we''re not going

    to represent all that detail,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but so we''re going to look at a

    piece of the screen so the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'descent the sensor we use in the

    camera is going to take a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collection of samples, millions

    of samples, and for each region'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the of the image that gets

    mapped into the have. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'underlying color might not be

    uniform, but so we make a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'calculation, or they determine a

    representative value for that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'area in the image and then store

    that. So does that make sense?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I, I think these are good

    questions that we''ll talk about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in class some more. Oh, so we

    are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to cover that thing. Oh,

    yes, I just review it. And what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exactly I invite you to write

    that as a question or as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'response to the meeting today.

    Oh, yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this, yeah, I can just do it.

    And one more question, yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what exactly is computer

    graphics? It''s like, I''m very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interested in CGI, VFX. I just

    wanted to learn these things.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m interested in video

    production stuff. It''s like, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have worked for university as

    well as social media manager, as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'camera operator, as a video

    maker for university itself. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'work for this idea of a YouTuber

    as well, so I''m just very much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interested in VFX CGA. I just

    want to explore it more.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there was a talk from a

    friend of mine who worked at ILM'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and he''s now at EA in Vancouver.

    He talks about his career in VFX'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and games. So that might be

    interesting for you to have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: look at.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is there a website for that

    thing? I can just go there. Go'
  persid: ''
- desc: there and check it out.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s a computer science

    department website, YouTube'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'account. You are comp sci, I''ll

    put the link.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You put the link for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on our class material, okay,

    yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can just put it, yeah, I''ll

    just have a look at it. Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, so this class is related to

    something that time. CGI,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yes, these are the fundamentals

    too, because with computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics, we''re creating

    everything from thin air.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There''s nothing that exists and

    we have to add, yeah, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'modeling cameras and creating

    spaceships and other things that'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't belong.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, right, anyway, and

    learning good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stuff. Yeah, so this is the

    place to get started in that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s what I thought that. So

    thanks a lot for confirming.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Actually, yeah, you're welcome.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, that''s everything for

    today. Okay, thanks.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You mentioned the
  persid: ''
- desc: voxel is for volume, yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Can you give me an example of

    like, when you would use such'
  persid: ''
- desc: measurement?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, if you have three

    dimensional data from, say, a CT'
  persid: ''
- desc: scan or something like
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that, okay, that''s, that''s what

    I thought I just wanted'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to, yeah, and then you can to

    create different representations'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'slice through the volume. Then

    your sampling, your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixel would be a slice of that,

    and the voxel would be the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'overall, or I guess a slice of

    it would be measured in pixels,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whereas the overall thing would

    be voxel.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. Okay, awesome. Thank you.
