- desc: That good. Hey, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t charge over the

    weekend,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll see what that will help

    to plug in. I''ll just stand'
  persid: ''
- desc: right here for the whole time I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'may then get a few minutes worth

    of charge.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So have you found your midterm

    marks online? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so I've adjusted them
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s out of 15, so the lowest

    marks are between 7.5 and 15.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what you''ll get from grade

    scope will be a mark out of 77'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve done some adjustment from

    the grade, from the exam and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'grade scope to your courses,

    acknowledging the fact that it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'may have been a bit long. Who

    agrees with that statement? It'
  persid: ''
- desc: was too long.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. Well,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want everyone to not I

    don''t want anyone to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discouraged by the exam, but

    it''s it''s meant to be formative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feedback for You, and if you do

    better on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'final I will wave the final more

    heavily towards Your final'
  persid: ''
- desc: grade.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any questions or concerns about

    that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so also Simon
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two has been created and marks

    release, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have assignments three and

    four posted as well. So the idea'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is you''ll build on the code from

    assignment Two. We''ll talk about'
  persid: ''
- desc: that In just a second. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a reminder that there are two

    opportunities for feedback'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to me about the mentoring plan

    and about me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are going to close at

    midnight, one minute to midnight'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tonight. So if you want to give

    your input, that would be much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'appreciated. The one about the

    midterm exam, I''ll count out'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'words of participation so it''s

    not the feedback is anonymous,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But the forward evaluation of

    the class is anonymous.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And thanks to the people who

    pointed out I had not had last'
  persid: ''
- desc: week's dates on the quiz,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I hope everyone had A chance

    to complete it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, let''s see whether I have

    enough battery'
  persid: ''
- desc: to last.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, it says less than an hour.

    So,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'based on the midterm I was, I''ve

    been thinking about assignments,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to focus on the things

    that we''ve been doing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So fly by this will give you

    some practice With specifying'
  persid: ''
- desc: camera coordinates and
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'm asking for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A two things in terms of Flying

    Wild, smoking And'
  persid: ''
- desc: I will make,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will prepare a version of

    assignment two code for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for those who have a chance To

    do'
  persid: ''
- desc: assignment reviews,
  persid: ''
- desc: they've Got a starting point for
  persid: ''
- desc: so fly by in two ways.
  persid: ''
- desc: One, all the line, so
  persid: ''
- desc: let's say we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Looking at the plot of our

    assignment two and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is the one that''s a lid

    that opens,'
  persid: ''
- desc: but we might have
  persid: ''
- desc: some other objects the
  persid: ''
- desc: then we can specify a line.
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's add
  persid: ''
- desc: a reasonable height so We don't
  persid: ''
- desc: hit The boxes and
  persid: ''
- desc: so you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might say, here''s The camera,

    and let''s look at just a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: bit ahead of us, or
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe look at 45 degrees
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in front of us. Then as we step

    along the line, we''re changing'
  persid: ''
- desc: the lookout point
  persid: ''
- desc: so we'll see this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'box first, And then this one and

    Then the Third One. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, does that make sense? So

    the look at point, it''s fixed in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'relation to the eye point. And

    as we move along the line,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'removing the eye point, so that

    the look at point,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can feel kind of imagine the

    piece of chalk pointing to The'
  persid: ''
- desc: place where we're looking.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: This is the first way,
  persid: ''
- desc: second way travel along. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of along A circular,

    circular spiral and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this time,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re going to always look at

    the middle and'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we start out at
  persid: ''
- desc: a point here and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and all the time we''re looking

    at the middle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe that''s enough. So do

    two rotations,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and at the starting point,
  persid: ''
- desc: just a different height.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: So it should spiral upwards,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not outwards. But should you be

    moving further away, like as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re rotating around or just

    moving up? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was thinking of just moving up

    or down if you want to have an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'option To fly closer, further

    away. You can do that. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's assignment three and
  persid: ''
- desc: so For fly by option one,
  persid: ''
- desc: move The leg with The camera and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the length can be stationary

    when we''re going In the spiral.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I do
  persid: ''
- desc: I use the Same material and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same material For the whole

    scene And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so does that make sense? What

    I''m asking?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I think we can be flexible on

    the due dates.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve said Monday the 25th for

    the for assignment Three and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Friday, December 6 for

    assignment four. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would say Friday, December 6.

    We don''t want to make it later'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'than that. But if you wanted

    some flexibility to submit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment three later or closer

    to December 6, that would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fine. Does that make sense? Does

    that seem like a good idea?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I don''t want to discourage

    you from the I''m submitting'
  persid: ''
- desc: assignment three on the 25th
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but if you need some

    flexibility, I think we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'provide it. Does that seem okay?

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s take a look At the

    shaded cube.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Example,
  persid: ''
- desc: chapter six and
  persid: ''
- desc: so just
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Let''s look at the shaders

    first and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have in we get the

    position of the vertices through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a position which we''re

    connecting to our buffer in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: JavaScript,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re also getting a normal

    vector, not a single normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector, but a vertex attribute.

    So we get normal associated with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vertex and then we have a

    vertex color that''s passed on to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fragment shader. So then we

    have uniform variables. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the ambient product, the

    diffuse product and the specular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'product. So these are the

    different contributions in our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lighting model. So ambient is

    just background light.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Diffuse
  persid: ''
- desc: is the
  persid: ''
- desc: light that gets scattered,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in general, and then the

    specular is when we''re dealing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a shiny surface, and we''re

    close to the reflected ray of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the light, then we''ll see a

    specular highlight.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have those terms to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'configure into our computation,

    then we have the wall view'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Matrix, projection matrix, light

    position and a shininess'
  persid: ''
- desc: coefficient and
  persid: ''
- desc: B, so we compute the position,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we get X, Y and Z of the

    position. That''s what this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'operator does at the end here,

    and we''re changing the sign.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we get our fixed light

    position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that comes from the uniform of

    the JavaScript.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a vector l, which we normalize,

    is a difference between the'
  persid: ''
- desc: light and position, and
  persid: ''
- desc: the i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector is normalized minus pause

    and H, the half wave vector, The'
  persid: ''
- desc: half vector.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we normalize L plus E.
  persid: ''
- desc: Then
  persid: ''
- desc: we take
  persid: ''
- desc: the normal X, Y, Z,
  persid: ''
- desc: and we add
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a zero for w, and it''s zero

    because It''s a vector.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we transform normal n of two

    I coordinates and'
  persid: ''
- desc: we compute our
  persid: ''
- desc: 'illumination equation. We have

    ambient'
  persid: ''
- desc: and the diffuse and specular and
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're testing here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If the angle is greater than 90,

    we''re not going to have'
  persid: ''
- desc: a color for specular.
  persid: ''
- desc: Then the position
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we take our vertex attribute

    multiply by our wall of V'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix, then our projection

    matrix and our V color becomes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sum of ambient, diffuse and

    specular, and then we set so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s three terms, and the

    Alpha we set to one. So that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: doing
  persid: ''
- desc: the modified
  persid: ''
- desc: the blin Fong using the
  persid: ''
- desc: blin Fong model,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then in the fragment shader,

    we''re just passing through the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex color to the fragment

    color.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re getting the computation

    at the vertices with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normals, and then we''re

    interpolating the intensity'
  persid: ''
- desc: across,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in to the Vertice, to the

    fragments between the vertices.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re just interpolating the

    intensities so we''re not we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re not recomputing the

    lighting for every fragment.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So what
  persid: ''
- desc: kind of shading is This?
  persid: ''
- desc: No, it's not flat. I
  persid: ''
- desc: There are two kinds,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone like a vowel or whatever

    It''s called,'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: grow
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and who''s the other one? I''ve

    mentioned him already.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in the row we''re calculating,

    doing the calculation the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertices and then interpolating

    the intensities of Quang'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shading. We''re interpolating the

    vector so we have, we can do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'full computation for each

    fragment. For'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re still doing an

    approximation to the normals,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but we it''s a better

    approximation than we''re Getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the Grow shading. Does that

    make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we in our JavaScript, we have

    vertices for the cue, plate,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position, ambient, diffuse,

    specular, light parameters and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we have the material

    specified in terms of ambient,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diffuse, specular and China''s

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re computing the normal

    vectors For the triangles here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we get t1 is t,
  persid: ''
- desc: is vertex B
  persid: ''
- desc: and A and
  persid: ''
- desc: vertex C and B And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, he has strange ways of

    organizing parameters. Sometimes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these function calls, so we get

    two vectors based on the edges'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the triangle, and then the

    normal vector is the cross'
  persid: ''
- desc: product. We
  persid: ''
- desc: so we push
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the normal to our normal brain

    And so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he''s assigning the same normal

    to the squad. So it''s making the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assumption that it''s flat, which

    may not be the case.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we get the color cube.
  persid: ''
- desc: So here's the new stuff with
  persid: ''
- desc: the normal array.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Here we''re doing three bytes or

    three values per normal vector.'
  persid: ''
- desc: We're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing the

    multiplication. Take the ambient'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light, and we multiply it by the

    materials, ambient properties,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the diffuse product is the

    diffuse light times the material'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'property diffuse properties of

    the material and the specular'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'product is the specular specular

    light times the specular'
  persid: ''
- desc: properties of the material.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we set the ambient, we set

    uniforms. We need a key here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: we flatten the matrix
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pass associated with The

    projection matrix uniform in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertex shader, and we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''re changing the model V

    matrix based on The rotation'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we set. Does
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: I wanted To
  persid: ''
- desc: tell COVID.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought maybe we could

    start by looking at some code'
  persid: ''
- desc: samples from chapter seven. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what is the purpose of

    texture mapping? Let''s start'
  persid: ''
- desc: with that Question. I
  persid: ''
- desc: any thoughts i
  persid: ''
- desc: What if you want to capture
  persid: ''
- desc: the details,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the feeling of a chalkboard that

    has that''s been written on a Few'
  persid: ''
- desc: times and erased The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we might take a picture, a

    picture of the board'
  persid: ''
- desc: that captures the
  persid: ''
- desc: swirls of the eraser,
  persid: ''
- desc: and We might map that on
  persid: ''
- desc: to
  persid: ''
- desc: polygon
  persid: ''
- desc: for our small
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s going to represent the

    blackboard In our ball.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we may do environment

    Mapping. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So An environment man, I it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has anyone seen Terminator two?

    That was when the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first exam was on, because the

    robot'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was sent to kill a

    Schwarzenegger. This robot,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a new version who can

    become liquid metal. So that''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shiny blob. So then the details

    of the environment are visible'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in that computer generated

    object.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So there is
  persid: ''
- desc: a sense that we have involved
  persid: ''
- desc: the environment that gets
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mapped on to the the surface of

    the object. And then there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: also what's happening. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is we can add

    complexity to'
  persid: ''
- desc: a smooth, polygonal surface
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we perturb the normal vectors

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is so instead of the normal

    vector being normal, we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'change the direction of the

    normal vectors and thereby'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create the impression of a more

    complex surface and the idea is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we''re going to Get more

    complexity in the image in'
  persid: ''
- desc: inexpensive ways. And
  persid: ''
- desc: so here's a Simple bump Mapping
  persid: ''
- desc: example. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: we're creating a texture,
  persid: ''
- desc: '256, So then we have the bump

    data to'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's basically creating a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two by two array, 256 by 256, of

    zeros and ones that correspond'
  persid: ''
- desc: to that shape.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you can see the Can you see

    the inset'
  persid: ''
- desc: square?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then we set the normals based

    on the data.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we have the idea of texture

    coordinates, which is going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: describe
  persid: ''
- desc: how to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'map the texture that we have the

    image that we want to paste onto'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the model. How the texture gets

    mapped on to the surface. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we configure the texture, we

    pass the image, create a'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture, and we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to say it''s active, the

    texture zero is active, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to make a texture

    imaged. So for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mesh, we''re putting the vertices

    as well as the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here We have a texture

    coordinates array and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have an attribute variable in

    the sheet that''s connected to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shader for The texture

    coordinates.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we have all the same

    uniform set up and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the Configure texture

    normals, So we''re passing'
  persid: ''
- desc: normals, and
  persid: ''
- desc: we Set up here.
  persid: ''
- desc: U n8
  persid: ''
- desc: array and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what is that? What is the

    effect of this?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So you end
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eight array is an array of

    unsigned integers. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: eight bits,
  persid: ''
- desc: 256, values, 255, character.
  persid: ''
- desc: So yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't know that they have
  persid: ''
- desc: unsigned character. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, it''s one byte, eight bits.

    So we''re allocating three bytes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for each point in the texture.

    So it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re creating, we''re going to

    pass the normals'
  persid: ''
- desc: into
  persid: ''
- desc: the Configure and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the parameter in for the

    function configure'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture is an image.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a line where we''re

    converting the image into a'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the generated bitmap. That''s

    idea of having different'
  persid: ''
- desc: resolutions of the texture.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can choose the one that''s

    more most appropriate for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: application. Let's go ahead
  persid: ''
- desc: and see what
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you See The Light moving A

    little bit? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me. So we had the impression of

    death because of the way that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the way that set up. So now, if

    we'
  persid: ''
- desc: change the light position, you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so first blush, that doesn''t

    seem like a flat'
  persid: ''
- desc: surface, doesn't I
  persid: ''
- desc: so here we're loading an image.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re pasting it on to the

    queue. Let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Take a quick look at this code.

    Hello.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So here we're passing.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're taking input of
  persid: ''
- desc: the bay position,
  persid: ''
- desc: which is x, y, z and w,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a color, which is RGBA, and text

    coordinate, which is s and t.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s two dimensional. The

    image is 2d so we''re just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specifying coordinates and the

    image to'
  persid: ''
- desc: cube.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you''re doing rotation and

    we''re saying texture coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'based on but we''re doing a

    similar pass through we''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're assigning
  persid: ''
- desc: 'V color, the value of a color

    and assigning V tech quart,'
  persid: ''
- desc: value of A tech quart.
  persid: ''
- desc: So then we have input
  persid: ''
- desc: of the vertex color
  persid: ''
- desc: and the texture coordinate,
  persid: ''
- desc: then we have a sampler that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'makes association between the

    texture map and the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinate,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the fragrance color is

    texture is accessing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture, universal texture,

    uniform, texture map, texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinate. Does that make

    sense? You?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Set up the image and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s Some of the image is

    loaded from H to ml so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right? So that''s where the image

    is located. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when we''re initializing or

    configuring the texture with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: image. Then the last line is the
  persid: ''
- desc: tech texture map,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mutex map we''re looking to our

    shading To'
  persid: ''
- desc: it seems to be a typo. Here
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you text you tech map. Here you

    text your map in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: code, in the HTML, you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I suspect it''s doing some

    good defaults. I''ll check on'
  persid: ''
- desc: that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Report back.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, we''re out of time today.

    Any questions or concerns before'
  persid: ''
- desc: we say goodbye? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it? No, I''m gonna, I just have

    to draft an email so it''ll be'
  persid: ''
- desc: sent shortly. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, thank you for today. Have

    a great Wednesday and a good'
