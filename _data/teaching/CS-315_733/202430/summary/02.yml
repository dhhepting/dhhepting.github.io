- desc: 'How''s that for? Is that

    helping?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What about now? What if I talk

    right into it?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's See if that helps.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How about this better? Does this

    sound better? Okay, we''ll try'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that. Let me know if you have

    problems hearing Me.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I Okay, so this is on my laptop.

    I was going to publish it to my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'website before class, but then I

    realized I needed to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something else. It was going to

    make me late for class, so I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to do it right afterwards,

    and you''ll be able To see this'
  persid: ''
- desc: on my public website. You Thank
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you. How''s everyone doing today?

    Good, first Monday of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: semester.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone like Mondays? No, usually

    we have two meetings a week,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'classes go, Tuesday, Thursday.

    So this is a bit of a change of'
  persid: ''
- desc: pace.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How does that look better size?

    Okay, so we started yesterday by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going over the class structure,

    and we started a discussion of'
  persid: ''
- desc: computer graphics.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I just wanted to show you

    what we''ll get. So here''s a link'
  persid: ''
- desc: to the wiki,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so I''ve added in your

    courses scheduled for wiki'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'editors. So I didn''t describe

    this very well, or I didn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'describe it at all the other

    day, this is a place where and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can still so you can still

    put your name down for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yesterday''s Meet, last meeting,

    because'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's just a matter of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can still go through the

    records that were created that'
  persid: ''
- desc: are on the page. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So that''s just a way. That''s

    a way to participate in class,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you''d like to do that, get

    some of those 4% marks for that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Another way to do that is to

    attend classes and participate'
  persid: ''
- desc: in class discussions.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So my thought for the wiki is

    that you''ll take the media'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through the photos of the board.

    There are nine of them here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway go through there, and

    then there''s also'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcript of my recording of

    the meeting, and I''m recording'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that now, so I''ll have the

    pictures and the recording done'
  persid: ''
- desc: and posted online later today.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the transcript may be

    helpful, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some words are not well

    transcribed. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I included a bit of

    discussion after class.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I So then here I''ve got the

    responses from last day. I i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would say a wiki someone might

    put I''d invite you to do some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'editing of those things that

    have put together a highlights'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'package, so to speak. If you

    want to do that,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get the key points of our of our

    meetings, and possible some rep'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'possibly some references to new

    material, or that would support'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our discussion. Does that make

    sense? Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve tried this in the past,

    and it hasn''t taken off, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe making it more front and

    center this year this semester,'
  persid: ''
- desc: will help.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, so there''s that. So this

    is there''ll be page like This'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for everything, every meeting we

    have, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those attendance in your

    courses, you can do that for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yourselves. If the class

    calendar for today, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now I''m wondering, Where does go

    back? So upcoming events should'
  persid: ''
- desc: show the quiz as well. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so from 6pm tomorrow until the

    start of class on Wednesday, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quiz will be available. So

    what''d you think of the setup so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'far? And we had some you. A

    reasonably good participation. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: guess.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any thoughts on that? Yeah, I

    think the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quiz room for class and response

    after class model, the the epi'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class from last year. I don''t

    hope that quite fits the middle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'currently graphics, so I find it

    kind of difficult to clear what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'service so on to after like a

    given thing for like, something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where it''s really technical,

    whereas with that it''s more like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'open ended, like we had to go

    Quandt, like big tech and like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data harvesting from last year

    was, like, something''s really'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'big, but I don''t know If it

    quite works as well for this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class. So as well for this

    class,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay? Well, the idea is it''s not

    necessarily big ideas or small'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or small ideas or technical

    issues. It''s just to keep the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a way to in the way I see

    it as a way to for you to give'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'feedback. If there are questions

    you''re having problems with,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hard to explain, you still have

    questions about it after a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion, then we''ll take it

    up the next day. So maybe,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe it''s not asking for a

    philosophical answer about what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are the important concepts? So

    maybe you could focus on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things that get causing

    difficulty, or the things you''d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like to know more about. Maybe

    the lizard.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I appreciate your comment,

    and we''ll see how it goes. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s going to be still a way for

    you to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some rewarded for your

    engagement in our ongoing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion this semester. Does

    that make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I opened the can of

    worms by Asking about pixels and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 1000 of that in Georgia.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we talked about pixels that

    need samples last day, so I want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to focus on the fact that we

    don''t have geometry associated'
  persid: ''
- desc: with the pixel. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I wonder that wasn''t a very good

    way to start the class, perhaps'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about things that might be

    difficult to Understand, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: we'll
  persid: ''
- desc: talk a Little bit more today. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Just a quick look at the

    response, my responses, your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responses from last day. So I

    wanted to say everyone who'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'submitted a response received

    full marks, although I did see a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'few nos, meaning the

    instructions weren''t followed.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m wondering if that''s Maybe

    not a thoughtful response. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll get the PDF of the

    syllabus online today, later'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today, I''ve just had a few

    technical issues.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So who''s got the textbook sorted

    already. So I''ve had a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussion with the text with

    the bookstore on the campus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'store, and I asked them about

    this. So here''s a query for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: course materials.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I asked them about this,

    because I go To the publisher''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: website. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would invite you to talk to

    the campus store about this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discrepancy, Because the manager

    knows about The difference in'
  persid: ''
- desc: price. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we want to talk about the

    textbook issue.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are there other alternatives to

    get the eighth edition that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better still than two that I

    have? I i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'guess I''m thinking about

    unconsciously writing smaller'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ears so I don''t have to go over

    the this. Because this this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'board is fairly clean, but the

    other ones are already have A'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good portion of chalk dust on

    them. Anyway, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so just say earlier editions may

    be helpful if you if you have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: copy of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can you say what''s being passed

    around? I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know. It''s like a job or

    opportunity then,'
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, okay. Thank
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so literally, additions may be

    helpful the'
  persid: ''
- desc: website for the text and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is there? Interact computer

    graphics.com, so you can see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: source code and other details. I
  persid: ''
- desc: pixels ensemble and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I should Have a chalk sharpener.

    I think that would help that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like they exist. Are you

    laughing with me or at me? Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, so anyway, I''m not doing

    well with writing magically'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today. How many samples do we

    need to reconstruct a continuous'
  persid: ''
- desc: phenomenon?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any thoughts about that

    theoretically,'
  persid: ''
- desc: the more the better the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re so it depends on about

    the resolution of our the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'capability of our sampling

    device See how much, how close'
  persid: ''
- desc: we can Get to infinite.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So to go back to my sifter or

    strainer analogy from last day,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how what size mesh do we need?

    Or what is the size of the mesh'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re Using? How does that

    determine what we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: reconstruct the
  persid: ''
- desc: smaller than a mesh and
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to know what''s happening for CD

    audios, audio Compact Discs. How'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'many people know about audio

    compact discs'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'used to be that actually own

    several audio discs, but maybe I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t think they''re very popular

    item these days, although vinyl'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is making a comeback, So my

    turntable is as Life again once'
  persid: ''
- desc: more. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the audio, CD, format

    sampling at 44 kilohertz and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what can you hear? 44 exams.

    So people with good hearing,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'young people with good hearing.

    May they want to know offhand'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the answers, what''s the

    highest frequency people can'
  persid: ''
- desc: hear you?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s the so not everybody

    has compared to 22 kiloHertz,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's a common so the one I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so can sample 44 kilohertz, And

    we can reconstruct sounds of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 22 kiloHertz i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s turn it again. So if we''re

    Dealing with graphics, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for graphics from the sample

    of twice the resolution of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smallest feature we want to

    capture.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the mesh should be half as

    big as the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing we want to capture, the

    smallest thing we want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: capture. Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'behind that are Nyquist And

    Shannon i'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so pixels of samples of a

    continuous phenomenon don''t have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shape and just the value. So I

    want to take a sample of this'
  persid: ''
- desc: classroom.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We which should i What would be

    the most representative sample?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe the color of the chairs,

    maybe the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wood paneling or the desktops,

    or thinking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about being one, but this is

    zoom down. The way these you may'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'only have one pixel. So you

    might only have one pixel to use'
  persid: ''
- desc: for this, say for looking
  persid: ''
- desc: from the drone or further out
  persid: ''
- desc: in space, not
  persid: ''
- desc: feeling
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I feel like for every region of

    space that we''re sounding, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need To decide on the value

    associated with that sound.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then that value we choose To

    represent the sample gets so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the samples on display their

    range, so that they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equidistant. So it''s going to be

    written with squares. So pixel,'
  persid: ''
- desc: according
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at that grid position, displays

    the value of the sound. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to talk about this more in

    detail. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so arch is red, green, blue.

    We''ll talk about that in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coming weeks as well, how we can

    depict color, store color in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: images that we work with. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I wanted to talk a little bit

    of it, since we broached the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subject, a bit about vector

    graphics, let''s talk about that'
  persid: ''
- desc: as Well. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there bit about displays,

    like on your my laptop and your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'laptop and so on, they have a

    resolution So that and those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixels are addressable, and we

    get so we make an image by if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take a picture of this

    classroom, let''s say, this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'continuous phenomenon. Then we

    decide which the size of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image we''re making. That we

    choose the value for each of'
  persid: ''
- desc: those samples you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the screens on devices are

    discrete. Do we have any did'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone have any experience with

    continuous output devices.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, my knowledge of

    oscilloscopes is limited, but so'
  persid: ''
- desc: there are I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so another One that I''m thinking

    of is a modern it''s has anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: worked with the plotter before?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that is has a large sheet of

    paper and a set of pens, and you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can direct the pens to go and

    trace out shapes and so forth.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Maybe it''s similar to a CNC

    machine.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is that? Is that a more current

    reference? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is we''re not we''re

    not limited by the excellent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'addresses. We''re we have a 256

    by 256 image and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re constraining the

    element to the coordinates we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have in the image, but in a

    plotter or an oscilloscope, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t have addressable units

    that we''re not lock step'
  persid: ''
- desc: required.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that allows us to get more

    fluid, fluid imagery without'
  persid: ''
- desc: charging interest you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Anyone familiar with the

    cathode ray tube? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so We can produce drawings as we

    stimulate the phosphorus from'
  persid: ''
- desc: the back of The screen
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that where the electron beam

    hits will Be we''ll light up the'
  persid: ''
- desc: screen at that position we're
  persid: ''
- desc: so you do the same. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can have continuous shapes

    if we don''t have any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'restrictions on how the beam can

    move.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the downside is the phosphor

    will only stay, will only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'continue to admit emit late for

    a period of time. So we have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go back and refresh The image if

    we want to. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: complexity and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'effect. So alternatively, Here''s

    how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, shadow mask, which only

    allows the electron Beam to hit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at certain spots. So this is

    development with TV.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You scan. We're not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'having to lean on continuously

    to make a shape On the spray'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we scan through the lines

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so early TVs divided the image

    into the frame so they would do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the odd lines At once, and then

    the even lines at a certain'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'time. So you could, we still

    have a problem of refresh, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the complexity of the graphics

    can be more advanced because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re decided we''re assigning

    them to positions on the on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: display you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you may have heard the word

    roster before Anyone heard the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'word roster before. So that just

    talks about how you scan from'
  persid: ''
- desc: top to bottom.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so let''s say our modern

    displays are dealing with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bitmaps. So the question is,

    well, how do how do we deal with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector graphics, where we are

    drawing shapes without without'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directly being discretized. Does

    that Question make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s Say we have a square

    filled with right to a grid,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five by five, and at this

    resolution we can draw, let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: Say we can draw a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s say we have a

    resolution that where this shape'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we''ve drawn is of

    acceptable quality, but if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zoom in or make that, there''s no

    more data in that image. So if'
  persid: ''
- desc: we make it larger or zoom in, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So if we store it into

    Bitmap, then we''re decided which'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what the resolution you want to

    store it within.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so once we have a bitmap,

    we''re limited to the display'
  persid: ''
- desc: size that we can. We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can the size of display is

    limited by the precision of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphic that we''ve created that

    we stored In bitmap form,'
  persid: ''
- desc: if we Have a vector image.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this would be a higher

    resolution than say,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not going to draw it. Says

    I''m not going to draw it. What'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'kind of resolution would you

    like to see? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 256 by 256
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have a description of the

    shape I''m going to draw, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we reevaluate The formulas or

    the mathematical description of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shape for the screen

    resolution that we have. Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the little graphic on the

    science, it''s maybe a clear'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'explanation so we can so SVG,

    format, Scalable Vector Graphics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s stores the mathematical

    description of the shapes of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'elements of the image. And so

    based on the resolution that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'choose, we''re not stuck with a

    very low resolution type Path,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we need to redo or work with

    native'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a poor approximation to the so

    you can see, when you zoom in on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the raster image, we get

    artifacts of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discretization and a lower

    reservation, and we zoom in on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vector graphics in SVG, for

    example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can recompute the

    discretization at the resolution'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have so We always have smooth

    graphics. Does that make sense?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we have a vector graphics

    image, it''ll take more time to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'render it, because we have to
