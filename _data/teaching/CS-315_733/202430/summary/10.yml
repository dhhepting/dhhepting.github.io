- desc: 'Okay, so the recording

    is started. How''s Everyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: today? That's good to Hear. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Good. Thank You.
  persid: ''
- desc: You Okay, So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I just want to check whether you

    got an email from the Department'
  persid: ''
- desc: both events on Friday.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One person says, Yes, anyone?

    Else?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, thanks, I''ll check on

    that. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let me see that The advantage of

    The'
  persid: ''
- desc: to Say Something
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so that''s the

    multiplication. Ended up a lot.'
  persid: ''
- desc: It's time with you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Change. Thank you. So I checked

    my math and seems to be okay for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that 45 year old issue on the y

    axis I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So because
  persid: ''
- desc: 45 degrees is halfway between
  persid: ''
- desc: the axis,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so sine and cosine are the same,

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, so Let''s take our point

    And we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: work out. You.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Average so rotating around x by

    90 degrees And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we did our set by rotator unset

    by 90 degrees. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in terms of efficiency, we

    always want to do three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrices. We want when we apply

    the transformation, do we want'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to keep these as individual

    matrices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can put them together?

    It''s more efficient in one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix multiplication. So then

    we we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we create one matrix, and then

    we apply that to all the points.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we have one point, it

    doesn''t make a difference, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: if we have a million points,
  persid: ''
- desc: saving
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three changing from three

    operations to one, three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplications to one

    multiplication is going to be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: noticeable savings. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so let''s do This one

    first, 0000, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then 00,
  persid: ''
- desc: minus One, zero And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s people. I''m just thinking,

    maybe easier to apply to have'
  persid: ''
- desc: Clients benefits, because
  persid: ''
- desc: so here we have seven. We're
  persid: ''
- desc: minus five and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two so we''re rotating around the

    x axis, So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: flipping
  persid: ''
- desc: so we keep the x position.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So seven is constant, and then

    we flip the other two positions'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s apply The minus 90 degree

    rotation so 00, minus two, four.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Is zero, minus 500, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 702,
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we transform by
  persid: ''
- desc: '90 degrees around the z axis. So

    so'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we get five
  persid: ''
- desc: 'negative negative minus one

    times minus five, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: then minus two and and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then I and this is about the Z,

    so the Z doesn''t change if this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is about y, so y doesn''t change.

    This is about x, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: x doesn't Change. There. I,
  persid: ''
- desc: does that seem okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Should we try and do The Matrix

    multiplication, 0000,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and 0000, want to swallow.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay So can someone see
  persid: ''
- desc: What the problem is? I
  persid: ''
- desc: so we rotate about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the x axis by 90 degrees. So

    we''ve got the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we rotate around the y axis

    by minus 90 degrees that became'
  persid: ''
- desc: A
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotate around the set by 90

    degrees So minus One.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's Try instead of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an arbitrary block. Let''s do

    something easier'
  persid: ''
- desc: to visualize and
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's simplify 1110,
  persid: ''
- desc: so x, y and z1 so
  persid: ''
- desc: you rotate around x1 Is There?
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's look at The planes, X, Y,
  persid: ''
- desc: so Then The
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is that A better way to

    visualize it? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do I love do okay. So then we

    rotate by minus 90 around the'
  persid: ''
- desc: bottom. Oh.
  persid: ''
- desc: Wk, so we get minus one
  persid: ''
- desc: turns to minus this one, this
  persid: ''
- desc: this one stays minus,
  persid: ''
- desc: and then The third One And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we Get one because you

    multiply minus one by minus one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: We get minus One. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so any obvious mistakes In my

    matrix multiplication you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will work it out, and I

    promise to Not on the board and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Come back And Pray For
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, So let's have
  persid: ''
- desc: source code and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re specifying an axis of

    rotation by A'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we''re going to specify an

    arbitrary axis of rotation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can have Three Angles,
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can displace and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then this place is the right

    word. So we''re going,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to apply rotations

    around each axis, and then that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will give us a new axis of

    rotation. What''s another way we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can specify an axis of rotation

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could be take two points. Is

    that Enough? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we could say is This and
  persid: ''
- desc: another point is the
  persid: ''
- desc: so we specify an origin as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you're rotating around The
  persid: ''
- desc: down the axis, 111, and
  persid: ''
- desc: then we're spinning
  persid: ''
- desc: Q
  persid: ''
- desc: on the X on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from one vertex to Another,

    like,'
  persid: ''
- desc: like the transformation he did
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the color cube to turn it

    from RGB into HSV, tipped it on'
  persid: ''
- desc: its amp.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So having 111, as the rotation

    axis of zero at the origin. That'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'means we would be spinning the

    cube like a top.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s the process for

    rotating around an arbitrary'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'axis? If we Start with Two

    points And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that process, how does
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it compare to Doing change the

    center'
  persid: ''
- desc: rotation in two dimensions?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I Does that Make sense

    comparison? So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these are all transformations we

    can'
  persid: ''
- desc: apply and concatenate, so
  persid: ''
- desc: we'll see.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this gives us the ability to

    rotate around an arbitrary axis.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is an arbitrary center of

    rotation, so their'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformations are
  persid: ''
- desc: So we'll see.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'As we get into viewing the

    chapter five more'
  persid: ''
- desc: fully
  persid: ''
- desc: 'after the break, the

    transformations that will get us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from our object space into a

    space couldn''t coordinates that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give us our display. These are

    all. They can all be witnesses'
  persid: ''
- desc: to be concatenated.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s a very powerful way to

    think about things I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll have
  persid: ''
- desc: an assignment posted later
  persid: ''
- desc: today we do on The
  persid: ''
- desc: '25th that will deal with Chapter

    Four stop. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just want to acknowledge that

    past couple days'
  persid: ''
- desc: of rain on the board have
  persid: ''
- desc: not quickly or been to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enthrall at night and apologize

    for that, and I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: looking forward to a better day
  persid: ''
- desc: to stop the break I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions or concerns before

    I say, enjoy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fall break. If you have me,

    you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: send me an email or come to
  persid: ''
- desc: see me by ourselves.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you for today, and I hope
  persid: ''

    care. Everyone.'
