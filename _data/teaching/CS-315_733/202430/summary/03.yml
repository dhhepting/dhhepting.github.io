- desc: 'I should have caught

    the sample comment in my'
  persid: ''
- desc: recording.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let me try and recreate it. So

    one person'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said they were doing well. So

    therefore, with that one sample,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m saying everyone''s doing

    well, maybe I should take a more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'detailed sample to get a more

    accurate picture of the class'
  persid: ''
- desc: smooth.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But this is the way we think

    about with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer graphics for sampling

    phenomena at a particular rate'
  persid: ''
- desc: resolution.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the results we get are

    dependent on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: sampling we engage in.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we have more samples, then

    we get better credit results,'
  persid: ''
- desc: better reconstructions. Is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it better the first time that

    didn''t get on the recording, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better the second time? Or does

    someone have a better way to say'
  persid: ''
- desc: it than Like two tries?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: so the syllabus is online. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve said it for october 23

    but I realize there''s a lab that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a week is older, the labs are

    very weak, and I was wondering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if there''s some interest in

    changing it From the 23rd to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 28th or the 30th I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ll create a choice for your

    input on that. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I could have made better use of

    my time'
  persid: ''
- desc: when,
  persid: ''
- desc: When my colleague Lynn
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mahanic, was talking to the

    students anyway.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s a way to get to the

    website the meeting today, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then I realized I didn''t get

    today''s Meeting updated. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: will update that later today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I want to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Talk about chapter one today.

    I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'slides Out of post review our

    courses and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what version of the textbook

    are people using? Or can you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give me an idea? How many people

    have got access to the eighth'
  persid: ''
- desc: edition?
  persid: ''
- desc: Seven? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''ve got eight. Were the

    people holding their hands up?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Was that for eight? Seven?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so who has eight? I Okay,

    who has seventh, who has Six or'
  persid: ''
- desc: less, five or less? Good. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think that''s the question I

    asked you, in addition to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'conversion or condition number.

    So what is immediate? One'
  persid: ''
- desc: graphics
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where the client basically takes

    versions and immediately throws'
  persid: ''
- desc: them
  persid: ''
- desc: down. Yeah. So weird. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s the alternative to

    immediate load graphics do?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t know if it was worth the

    talk to write out that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'response. So is the answer, and

    I''ll turn to the book graphics.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll get to the
  persid: ''
- desc: later book graphics,
  persid: ''
- desc: who says Yes?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Who says, Stop trying to make

    jokes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so retain mode graphics. So

    that''s because we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'GPUs. And GPUs were once, once

    upon a time when G''s dirt for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics processing units. Now,

    I think it''s more of a general'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'processing even, because GPUs

    are now being used for AI'
  persid: ''
- desc: applications a lot. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but so the idea is we have

    memory and other capabilities on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the chip. So we send primitives

    and we work with them in buffers'
  persid: ''
- desc: on the GPU.
  persid: ''
- desc: And so we have a up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the opportunity for a lot more a

    lot more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'efficiencies, so we can get more

    polygons, more friends, frames'
  persid: ''
- desc: per second, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just better gaming experience,

    or a better you. For a better'
  persid: ''
- desc: watching videos experience, or
  persid: ''
- desc: doing data analysis or
  persid: ''
- desc: what other kinds of things do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we do at the do we do with

    graphics,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'design? That''s another one

    that''s mentioned in the book.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So does anyone have more direct

    experience with graphics?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Who has experience with graphics

    because of gaming platforms? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was talking to a friend who

    was an alumnus, and he and some'
  persid: ''
- desc: friends,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'once they graduated from U of R

    computer science, he went to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Vancouver to work for Game

    Studios. He''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: now not working
  persid: ''
- desc: at a game studio. He's
  persid: ''
- desc: doing AI for law legal
  persid: ''
- desc: firms, and he
  persid: ''
- desc: stood in people
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who smart programmers, who would

    like to live in Vancouver, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Rural mainland, the Lower

    Mainland, sorry, I don''t know if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a Lower rain land anymore.

    You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m not implying that just

    because you like to play games,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that
  persid: ''
- desc: automatically, just by playing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'games, that you get programming

    knowledge by association. But if'
  persid: ''
- desc: you're interested in
  persid: ''
- desc: games,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s opportunities for

    programming,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re adept at programming,

    graphics and animations do those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are the skills that other

    develop other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Other employers outside the

    games industry are Looking For.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the meetings dot ICS file. If

    you want to put our meeting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'schedule into your calendar, you

    can grab that file and download'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it for your open it in your

    calendar. Here''s the CS 315 lab'
  persid: ''
- desc: page,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and here''s the website for the

    textbook.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can see that I''m in the

    process of creating introduction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to Web GL two assignment. I''ll

    get that sorted you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I find out,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is there a question back there?

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I've added more links here. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s a zoom link to my office.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so set aside 1030, to 12 till

    noon for office hours. You can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'come and see me in person, or

    I''ll be on zoom as well. I''m not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sure what the fate of zoom will

    be now that we''re also doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Microsoft Teams. But I like zoom

    for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zoom is good for a bunch of

    things too. So anyway, I want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mention that, and if we organize

    this a little bit, so there is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comment about participation and

    doing the wiki so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so one way to participate is to

    take your attendance, record'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Your attendance at the meeting.

    Another way is to make wiki'
  persid: ''
- desc: contributions.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what I have in mind is

    thinking about presenting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'highlights of our class

    discussions. Use the raw'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'materials provided within a day

    of the meeting, so photos of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'board under media, the audio

    transcript and responses.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can create an edited and

    corrected version of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcript on the wiki page,

    copy and copy and paste the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcript and edit the stuff

    that''s not course related and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'correct some sometimes humorous

    errors in transcription and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So you can also add links to

    resources that are hinted at in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the transcript or that seem

    appropriate as you create the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wiki page. Include questions

    where appropriate and ask me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when needed you Does that give a

    bit more information and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'structure to the idea of

    creating these Wiki pages?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone slightly more inclined to

    do it? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. Anyway, so involvement in

    class, and one other way to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'involved in class, Aside from

    the ones I''ve listed, there Is'
  persid: ''
- desc: To I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so When we create a bitmap

    image, We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'capturing samples continuous

    phenomenon. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we have a vector graph,

    we''re storing the description of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shapes instead of the

    samples that We take at a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'particular resolution or the

    image we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can describe Something

    with a mathematical formula that'
  persid: ''
- desc: lets us,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lets us generate or regenerate

    an image at any particular size'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the display. Because, in

    practice, we''re working with'
  persid: ''
- desc: screens that
  persid: ''
- desc: are and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll show you a couple pictures

    of those screens. One thing in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that mention about sampling so

    we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: spatial resolution and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we also Have the precision

    with which You''re storing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: information and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what happens if we store one

    Death per sound now,'
  persid: ''
- desc: you Know
  persid: ''
- desc: shades of gray if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how many distinct values. Do

    we get the name gets,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what''s the precision? Which you

    can store or sample 256,'
  persid: ''
- desc: different colors.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if the interpretation of

    color is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it could be colors, but if we''re

    talking about grace together,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might talk About levels. So so

    that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: enough said about that. So
  persid: ''
- desc: what if we have i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What if we store defense for

    red, green and blue channels? Is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everyone familiar with RGB as a

    concept.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have a tri stimulus model

    of colors that we''ll talk about'
  persid: ''
- desc: in more detail later on.
  persid: ''
- desc: But images are generally
  persid: ''
- desc: 'expressed in terms of R, G and

    B.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone know what 256 times 256?

    Times 256? Is? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that gives us the possibility

    of adding to 16 point 7 million'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give or take colors in the

    image. So that gives us a lot of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'precision compared to one bit,

    and we might end up there are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'formats now that go beyond 24

    bits we might also Have RGBA'
  persid: ''
- desc: delta, so that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would be three, two bits. Two

    bits per pixel. That gives us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much more flexibility. So the

    alpha channel controls the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transparency. So we can, when

    we''re editing images, we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: very fine grained information
  persid: ''
- desc: That lets us cause images
  persid: ''
- desc: and do different effects you
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry, I Just want To Get I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so make these slides available

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how many people have dealt with

    WebGL? I forget too. How many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people have had experience with

    WebGL To outside of the lab this'
  persid: ''
- desc: Week?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we create A canvas in HTML,

    html5, Perhaps. You.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the HTML describes, describes

    the page, so we might have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: canvas and some controls.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is so are you familiar with

    document object model as A way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to have JavaScript interact with

    HTML?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? Do it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we talk about shaders. So the

    way the examples in the textbook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go, the shaders are put inside

    the HTML file. That''s not the'
  persid: ''
- desc: only way it can be done.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think it''s a reasonably good

    way to do it, and it works, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: we'll stick with it. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So JavaScript is running on the

    browser, and it''s using local'
  persid: ''
- desc: resources than a local GPU.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this gives you, if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can see it, it gives you the

    address of the page at the top.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If interactive computer

    graphics.com/code/zero, two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: slash triangle at HTML.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the shader,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a vertex shader and

    there''s a fragment shader.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The vertex shader deals with

    vertices, strangely enough, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fragment shader deals with

    the pixels apart from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertices. So we'll see
  persid: ''
- desc: that distinction more clearly
  persid: ''
- desc: 'later on in the semester. Right

    now, we use a script tag to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'define the shader code so for

    the vertices we''re getting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: input of a four position vector.
  persid: ''
- desc: A position is its name and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so GL, underscore, position is a

    standard variable name,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're just assigning value
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the input variable to the GL

    position'
  persid: ''
- desc: fragment shader
  persid: ''
- desc: we're dealing with the color.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re using medium precision

    float. Now we''re outputting a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four element vector for the

    fragment color. So all we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing in this shader is saying

    the fragment is what Color is'
  persid: ''
- desc: it?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pardon me, yeah, it''s red

    because I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have a one in the first

    position of the vector that says'
  persid: ''
- desc: red is one or full on. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might also see red as 255, 004,

    00, or i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does anyone recognize that that

    location? Sorry, I think you'
  persid: ''
- desc: said
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s hexadecimal. So F, F

    means all ones and 0000, mean'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all zeros. So we''re getting red,

    but nothing else i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in this next bit, we have

    some JavaScript to initialize'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shaders, then we have

    triangle.js to describe the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle and we want to draw.

    And in the HTML, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specifying a canvas as 512 by

    512, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: this JavaScript is not current.
  persid: ''
- desc: You can tell by the var i
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway, so in our JavaScript,
  persid: ''
- desc: this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saying, when the page is loaded,

    we try and get the context for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the canvas. So the first thing

    is to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use the DOM interface to find

    the canvas in the HTML file. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s this first bit, and then

    do GL equals canvas. Dot get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'context WebGL too, so that tries

    to create a context for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'canvas to draw on, and if that

    GL variable isn''t initialized,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we have a problem. And then

    the next part, we''re specifying'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three vertices for the triangle.

    So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we open the viewport, where

    we set up a viewport, so from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero to 512 and zero to 512 and

    We say clear color is, is what?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, white, I
  persid: ''
- desc: so that we create a program
  persid: ''
- desc: that combines the context
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the vertex shader and the

    fragment shader that we have,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we say to use that

    program.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So our first step, our next

    step, is to create a buffer and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'load the data into the GPU, so

    we create a buffer, then we bind'
  persid: ''
- desc: it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the as An array buffer, and

    then we put the data from those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from those three vertices for

    the triangle, into the array'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer, and we say that we''re

    going to use it for static'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drawing. So later this semester,

    we''ll see other examples of that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then we have data in the

    buffer. So we''re making now the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connection between the buffer

    and the variables.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So a position is get attribute

    attrip, location program a'
  persid: ''
- desc: position. So we're looking
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to match up the a position in

    the shader with our'
  persid: ''
- desc: JavaScript,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we get a point We make the

    connection.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the data we have is two

    dimensional. That''s what the two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is, GL fluid is a type, and then

    the other parameters are'
  persid: ''
- desc: important
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for this use. Then we enable the

    attribute, enable vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attribute array a position. So

    we''ve analyzed the connection,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ve described the data that''s

    there, and now we render. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: render is setting the color bit
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s the effect of the first

    line is to clear the screen to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'white, and then we draw the

    arrays. We draw triangles based'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the data we''ve stored. So we

    start from index zero, and we'
  persid: ''
- desc: draw three vertices,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we get a red triangle out of

    this. We can do more complicated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things. That gives you a

    structure for Web GL, two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'programs and us. I apologize for

    not mentioning WebGL two until'
  persid: ''
- desc: today. You
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's talk a bit about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer graphics. So computer

    graphics is,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is all these things. So it''s

    hardware and software and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applications. So we''re dealing

    with all aspects of creating'
  persid: ''
- desc: images with a computer. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What do you think about this

    image?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone impressed? I
  persid: ''
- desc: does it look photo realistic?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, maybe gender or anything.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, we can. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can think of a number of

    applications. Lender is nice'
  persid: ''
- desc: because it's Open Source,
  persid: ''
- desc: so We can If
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a computer generated

    image, in case anyone was not'
  persid: ''
- desc: sure about that. I it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there are different elements.

    So what do we have to do to come'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up with a polished image like

    that? What are the elements or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the steps we need to do to

    create an image like that?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, we can just make a shape

    like this thing first, like just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like Bob after, we can just add

    the layer of texture on it, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Golden type of image. What we

    are seeing here this'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so we have the model
  persid: ''
- desc: texture.
  persid: ''
- desc: More material.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What else is missing? Lady,

    yeah,'

  persid: ''

    basic graphic system. We have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'input devices, then we have a

    CPU and then the GPU, then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a frame buffer that gets

    The contents of which get'
  persid: ''
- desc: displayed on the screen. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a friend buffer is, in a way,

    like a piece of film that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: exposing in a camera,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the frame buffer stores the

    image'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we''re Creating the

    recreation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we talked a bit about this

    other days. So here''s what a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cathode ray tube looks in a

    schematic form. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can have a vector display,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or we can impose scanning. We

    time, we can write the contents'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of a frame buffer to a display

    like this, but it''s need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'refresh the picture on the

    display before it starts to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fade. So that''s a limitation of

    graphic systems.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And here''s a depiction of the

    shadow mass we talked about last'
  persid: ''
- desc: day. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have a red, green and blue

    dots on the inside of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen, and we have three

    electron guns that are aimed to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'excite the phosphor on the

    inside of the screen, and to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pick those dots of color, the

    red, green and blue colors are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'close enough together so that we

    perceive a single color at that'
  persid: ''
- desc: spot.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s that''s the way we get

    a bitmap displaying on the CRT.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can talk. So here''s a

    wireframe model of that object'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pictured a couple of screens

    ago. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Has anyone ever heard of

    Sketchpad before? And it''s quite'
  persid: ''
- desc: cool if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So WebGL, two came from OpenGL,

    which came from efforts in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'European efforts, there was GKs

    and there was the core standard'
  persid: ''
- desc: in North America,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s an ensemble. When we zoom

    in on the left, it looks like a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very nice, high resolution

    picture, but if we zoom in, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can see the pixels, those

    individual samples that make up'
  persid: ''
- desc: the image.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s an advancement as

    well, going from wireframe to'
  persid: ''
- desc: polygonal models. I
  persid: ''
- desc: it so we can,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from that polygonal model, we

    can make it look much smoother,'
  persid: ''

    this semester. Environment'

    Terminator two? That''s an old'

    Terminator movies now it''s hard'

    the Terminator that was sent to'

    Terminator looked like he was'
  persid: ''

    transform himself. He so that'
  persid: ''

    make it look that much more'
  persid: ''
- desc: realistic.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, my examples are a bit old,

    but I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we can do bump mapping,

    so we have the same surface, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we treat the information on it

    differently so we can create'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more interesting effects. So

    we''re not adding complexity to'

    different ways. We''re'
