- desc: 'I''m turning on the

    audio recording a bit late'
  persid: ''
- desc: today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry about that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''ve decided that the midterm

    will be moved to October 30. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the graphics programming

    assignment one should use nine'
  persid: ''
- desc: colors
  persid: ''
- desc: to
  persid: ''
- desc: to display the gasket images
  persid: ''
- desc: not 12,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will Make an addition to the

    assignment description for that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we mentioned a little bit

    about the Z buffer last day, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: we have to enable it and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s take A peek at the code

    for this And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so vertex shader
  persid: ''
- desc: taking in the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position determined by vertices

    that we compute the geometry and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so in and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the type, Back, three, a

    position. In fact, three, in'
  persid: ''
- desc: color.
  persid: ''
- desc: So three
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position vector for color means,

    what are we passing?'
  persid: ''
- desc: RGB
  persid: ''
- desc: and a, no, a, i,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this shape vertex shader is

    doing very little, but it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'taking care of the fact that we

    passing a three RGB, and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: adding alpha and Alpha.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: in the vertex share, we're
  persid: ''
- desc: storing the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chord. Coordinate the position

    of our vertices in GL,'
  persid: ''
- desc: underscore position
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re creating For output, the V

    color. With that simple'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformation, we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics library, Shading

    Language is what We''re writing'
  persid: ''
- desc: in. It's like C
  persid: ''
- desc: so the convention
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The convention used By the

    textbook And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the variables that deal with

    attributes start with a, those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that deal with vertex shader

    variables start with V and deal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the fragment shape and

    start with the f, i,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can specify a single
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color For our gasket, and we

    could use a uniform very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'variable. Attributes are

    written. Attributes can vary'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the primitives, with the

    vertices the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can see in the fragment

    shader code, we do an in VEC for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for V color, passing that

    through from the vertex shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we say, out of that 4v color,

    and then in that form, V color'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the fragment
  persid: ''
- desc: shader. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then, from the fragment shader,

    we''re the passing along F color.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s a way to keep things a

    little bit more organized. Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: Are you feeling it at all?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, let''s look at the gasket

    for js file and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we want to self divide Three

    times, get our canvas from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'HTML file, get a context for

    WebGL two.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we specify a gasket four

    vertices on the unit circle,'
  persid: ''
- desc: initial tetrahedron
  persid: ''
- desc: with equal length side, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you might call it Sierpinski

    tetrahedron. You I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did an image back in 1991 on The

    desktop tetrahedron.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Would you like to see it? If
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have yet to use a make a 3d

    printed version of that'
  persid: ''
- desc: one day. Anyway, I
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tetrahedron inscribed in a

    sphere. So we have four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equilateral triangles on the

    faces, and then we do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: subdivision. So so
  persid: ''
- desc: we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pass the vertices the number of

    times subdivide and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so here's the part with the Z
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer, we enable GL depth test,

    and that turns on the capability'
  persid: ''
- desc: and all web, web GL,
  persid: ''
- desc: '2.0 implementations must support

    the sin but the death test,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because it''s a fundamental

    property'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's used in so many
  persid: ''
- desc: things. So So we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'set up our prayer program with

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: shaders.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So instead of just a buffer for

    vertices, we''re creating a'
  persid: ''
- desc: buffer for colors as well. We
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we create buffer called C buffer

    and bind it,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we go the color beta, and we

    have to flatten it, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're we may be using,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we may not just have the float

    32 format, so make sure we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just, just the data we have the

    flatten function, which I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'believe is an envy new may in

    zone file I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then the next bit specify

    we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: going to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have to Connect the color in

    the shader to the program'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s what this block and

    lines does, And then do the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the position data. So we

    have a position,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''re in 3d so we have three

    data points per position, and I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and there are flows So three

    times, four bytes, and then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: render and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we just Have four colors

    here, red, green, blue and Black'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're using color
  persid: ''
- desc: as a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as an index into the space

    colors, and we''re assigned the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same color for each With three

    vertices of the triangle of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: face if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we wanted to change it so that

    we would have different colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: on the face, then we could,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we could do color, color plus

    one mod four, color plus two mod'
  persid: ''
- desc: four,
  persid: ''
- desc: to get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three different colors on the

    vertices. So thus, so we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creating the color buffer of

    this the same size as positions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer. So whatever we put into

    the color buffer, the individual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data points, the positions, get

    us a color from the color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer, so that gives us some

    control Over the coloring the'
  persid: ''
- desc: shape. Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s a function to draw the

    tetrahedron. So the triangle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draws the triangle face. Tetra

    draws four triangles make a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tetrahedron, and then this one

    does the subdivision, so we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: the fractal shape.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in the render, we do a clear,

    GL clear, and we do the color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer red, so that restores us

    to the background color. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we do a logical or to say

    we should also clear the depth'
  persid: ''
- desc: buffer bit
  persid: ''
- desc: so we don't carry
  persid: ''
- desc: 'over information from the

    previous display. We''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moving this tetrahedron, so

    that''s less important. But if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'were, if we were rotating it,

    that might cause problems.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, Let's talk about Color. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'All So I mentioned coordinates

    because we have some choices In'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the way we represent Colors and

    positions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so that say
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the red axis is aligned with

    what we normally think of as the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'x axis. So we go from zero to

    one if we''re looking for an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eight bit, if we''re storing

    eight bits of precision for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: red value,
  persid: ''
- desc: we go from zero to 255,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so then Let''s do green.

    I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve drawn the blue axis

    going into the board. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'positive direction is going into

    the board.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what other way could I have

    drawn the blue axis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that could have come out of the

    board'
  persid: ''
- desc: too, right?
  persid: ''
- desc: I could say blue is this way. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have an eternal drawing queue

    here so it''s not more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'complicated diagram. I just want

    you to remember that'
  persid: ''
- desc: we have that decision to make
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we''re doing three

    dimensional We''re drawing things'
  persid: ''
- desc: in three dimensions.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, imagine these are parallel

    lines'
  persid: ''
- desc: and their squares and
  persid: ''
- desc: try And fix you
  persid: ''
- desc: that's better than I thought.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'red, green and blue and zero.

    How do we also know that? I of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the other name do we have for

    absence of color?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, you might even go so far as

    to say black. That might be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: history. Yeah, that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might be history, yeah, well,

    display is not really black'
  persid: ''
- desc: because,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because the display is on and

    there''s some light, so it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to completely black, and

    When you do printing. So this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: an additive i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we start from black and we

    add to it, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so If we add red, just red and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is green and this is blue

    in the corner here. So what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'happens if we add green and blue

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: it starts with a c3,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'letter three blanks fall in the

    C higher.'
  persid: ''
- desc: The Yes, but not like the pepper
  persid: ''
- desc: or cyan. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: I would say cyan.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s interesting. How some

    people, I don''t I think there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'only one way you pronounce

    things, but there''s choices'
  persid: ''
- desc: about whether It's a hard sea
  persid: ''
- desc: or soft sea.
  persid: ''
- desc: So cyan, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What other choices do? What

    other mixes do we have? Red and'
  persid: ''
- desc: green? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'six letters. I''m not going to

    give you any hints other than'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those six letters. What''s that?

    Yellow? Yeah, yellow. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And what about blue and red?

    Purple?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, but we have a fancier name

    for it,'
  persid: ''
- desc: fancy for all.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Magenta, yeah, so I''m not a good

    person to be saying whether'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'magenta is a cool version of

    purple, because I''m a little bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: colorblind. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so in the opposite corner

    here, where we have full red,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'full green and full blue, what

    does that give us?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Good answer. We have maxed out

    the color so'
  persid: ''
- desc: we see what on the screen.
  persid: ''
- desc: The opposite of black. Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you can see there. I hope you

    can see that there''s a diagonal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there, connecting black and

    white.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And then we get a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so I might see a color picker

    that looks like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so around the edges Are the

    hues, then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: can think about
  persid: ''
- desc: saturation. If
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can see six
  persid: ''
- desc: colors come out in so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a bit easier way to

    pick colors than'
  persid: ''
- desc: use
  persid: ''
- desc: RGB. So the idea is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the flavor. Bottom of the cone

    here, value zero, then we only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have black. So if we turn the

    value of the color down to zero,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re just going to get blacks.

    And if we turn it up to one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Then we get,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get weights here, and then we

    Add, if you venture out from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: center, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the center of this cone is

    gives us gray scale from black'
  persid: ''
- desc: to white. So we can,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can feel in grays here. And

    then, if we go out, we go'
  persid: ''
- desc: to saturate. So regardless of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So, we specify colors based on

    hue, saturation and volume and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we specify an angle here

    gives the color'
  persid: ''
- desc: to Hue
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and saturation goes from white

    for the top and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it goes from a gray value to

    a fully a bright color. So if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have saturated, if we have value

    turned up to one, then we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the bright colors, red, green,

    blue, cyan, magenta, yellow that'
  persid: ''
- desc: are at the corners of The Cube.
  persid: ''
- desc: So for any color, then we Have a
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is value, 01,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can get tints and tones of

    the color of a particular angle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we''ve chosen for hue based

    on manipulating the Saturation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and Value of parameters. If we

    fix the hue the angle around the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'circle, then we can get a

    variety of variations of tints'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and tones those colors. Does

    that make sense? So the text, it'
  persid: ''
- desc: has a nicer
  persid: ''
- desc: rendition of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cube tipped on its end, so you

    see the white'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'corner and then the other

    vertices arranged around. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said there''s an additive color

    model, or RGB is additive. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is there a possibility For a

    different color model? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subtractive like paint on

    canvas, yes, So we can Talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: about subtractive. You.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the idea is you start From

    white and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so from RGB I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think I should go up on that

    piece of chalk'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway. So for printing, we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use cyan, jet yellow, and we use

    a K. WHAT WOULD LIKE A?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'K, B, yeah, so we can use black

    as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we use K for black
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because they''re using B for

    blue.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we use black a because
  persid: ''
- desc: sometimes black
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comes up in printing. A lot of

    black gets printed. So instead'
  persid: ''
- desc: of having to make black by I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this might end up being a bit

    the paper might be a bit soggy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'after getting three coats of

    three different inks and and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'may be not convincingly black,

    either might be a little mighty.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s nice to use black ink as

    well, in addition to sandwich'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the yellow and out. So the

    idea is the ink'
  persid: ''
- desc: subtracts
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the white so we get color

    image. So we''re doing the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing in two different ways. So

    we build up an image on a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'display from black, and then we

    print it on a piece of paper.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re subtracting color from

    white. Does that make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe I can show you a version

    of I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a serpent ski gasket

    with a CHAOS game. So we could'
  persid: ''
- desc: change the point size and
  persid: ''
- desc: so If you can do two, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There we go. I so here''s an

    interface element to choose A'
  persid: ''
- desc: color and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can choose The desaturation

    value.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's, that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'container. Continuing from my

    board diagram the other day'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where I drew a few dots. You see

    that it doesn''t take long before'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the professional athletes who

    are passing the ball around'
  persid: ''
- desc: get control. That makes a
  persid: ''
- desc: very good approximation
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the fractal shape that we''re

    after.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i pray now, harm set of time,

    but I wanted to mention'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates again. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we''re describing three

    dimensional space, start with x'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and y. We can agree on what X

    and Y, X and Y, other range,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'percent do you ever need? You

    don''t normally think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can deal with this now, that''s

    not typical,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I suppose you could think of

    doing this as well. And all,'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's also not difficult.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then we have a triumph. So

    which way it''s positive?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how do we deal with these two

    choices? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so the way, I know we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can make this shape as well, but

    I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: that x cross y and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the thumb points in the

    direction'
  persid: ''
- desc: of the positive z.
  persid: ''
- desc: So when it's going away,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so X cross Y and Z comes out of

    the board. So this is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any ideas for anyone familiar

    with this? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, where it''s the right hand

    corner system. And then if we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if my left hand X, cross Y, Z is

    pointing away. So this would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the left handed system.

    Another hand.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'System is the choice of systems

    kind of arbitrary, as long as we'
  persid: ''
- desc: have three intersection planes,
  persid: ''
- desc: all like normal. If
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a variation set up. I

    think what MGM is kind of'
  persid: ''
- desc: neutral on the subject. I
  persid: ''
- desc: is something where and so we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can, when I was introducing we

    can use the X cross Y idea to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'decide what hidden surfaces for

    this'
  persid: ''
- desc: physical surface determination.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll talk about that later, but

    if we agree on which to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'orientate. Orientation of the

    vertices and the triangles that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we use in the models, then we

    can make use that information to'
  persid: ''
- desc: decide which faces are visible
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on a minute late, minute over,

    anyway, was that a helpful'
  persid: ''
- desc: discussion today?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ll ask a question about

    using orthogonal in the'
