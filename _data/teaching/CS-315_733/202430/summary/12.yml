- desc: Hello, Hello, Hello,
  persid: ''
- desc: how's everyone doing today? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s talk about Simon two

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: midterm and
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see where that gets
  persid: ''
- desc: us. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so my computer seems to be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better today. It''s not giving me

    two different mouse pointers on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the different screens. I''m happy

    about that anyway. Okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's look
  persid: ''
- desc: at the assignment do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is there any interest in making

    the Due Date Monday?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone strictly opposed to an

    extension. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m asking you to write a

    program and answer a couple'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions. So write a web GL two

    program that generates a 3d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hypo. There shouldn''t be two

    there a certain skis tetrahedron'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and builds a container around it

    that includes the tetrahedron.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This container should have a lid

    that opens while being connected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the rest of the container

    along a common edge.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: something like
  persid: ''
- desc: this. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that feels like a garbage bin.

    Let me try again for a king. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, that's not better.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a lid, so we have an

    opening'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and a lid that''s connected here.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: How's my drawing? Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think we got the general idea.

    Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thanks. That''s very generous.

    Okay, so that''s that''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: general idea.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s the sample from the

    code. Sample code from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'textbook. This is gasket four in

    chapter two. So that gives you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an idea of what should be

    included. I suppose you might'
  persid: ''
- desc: think of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you could put the tetrahedra,

    the sierpinsky''s tetrahedron,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inside a tetrahedron, and have

    and have one, one or more sides'
  persid: ''
- desc: open up and
  persid: ''
- desc: does that convey the idea? Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we should see the there''s a

    tetrahedron inside the'
  persid: ''
- desc: container. And so
  persid: ''
- desc: you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can use sample code discussed in

    class and the 315 lab. So for'
  persid: ''
- desc: those of you in 733
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you may not have seen this, so

    we''ll go over it a bit today,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not to belabor the point for the

    people who have done the lab'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'already. But if there are

    questions I''ll do my best to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them sorted out. Okay, so I

    repeated myself in a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way, I think thanks to me use

    Apple coat from the glass and'
  persid: ''
- desc: the lab,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I remember to acknowledge your

    sources, and then later on, when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I corrected the bit of

    instruction from first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment. Then I said the same

    thing, that you should not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forget to give credit where

    credit is due, and not represent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other people''s work as your own.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for the submission, I want

    you to submit a single zip'
  persid: ''
- desc: archive. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So Maybe I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so maybe you have Two PDF files,

    or a single PDF file that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answers both questions, the

    readme file and then A code'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directory that has the common

    stuff and and your own code.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So a note about adapting the lab

    code for the assignment. So Alex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has the shader code and separate

    files, which doesn''t always run'
  persid: ''
- desc: well. You click on the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'HTML file, the marker may run

    some problems with cores, so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think the easiest solution is to

    follow the textbook convention'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of putting The shaders inside

    the HTML file using script tags'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'energy. So here''s the link to

    the lab of three.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Alex has done a few things

    that are nice, a couple things,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, they don''t necessarily

    match with the textbook Code. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This isn''t a big thing in this

    in this code that it''s an issue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in other places, GL, dot, false

    doesn''t exist. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so instead of in the textbook

    code where he says, Remember,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'these are in column major format

    in The shaders.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Alex has done a Nice

    silication And We sell you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so We do a flat, put a trend,

    flatten the transpose, so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: takes care of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'switching from the Row, major

    format in the JavaScript to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'column Major form in the shaders

    and the GPU.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's
  persid: ''
- desc: look at an example. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in the lab code here, there''s

    Bridgette. Projection Matrix. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: we have m v so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in terms of vertices, we have a

    position.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Or I think he''s Alex, is called

    V position times MB times p, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that gives us the GL to

    position. So we apply the model'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'view matrix and then the

    projection matrix and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we start so we''re the way

    it''s done, by convention is to'
  persid: ''
- desc: post multiply The
  persid: ''
- desc: the viewing matrix
  persid: ''
- desc: with the transformations and so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what we start with is the Last

    thing that''s applied, because we'
  persid: ''
- desc: go through transformations and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is we can say we start with

    identity, and then we Do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: look at
  persid: ''
- desc: and Then we get the ball. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re building it out from

    this way. So you stay you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: start empty
  persid: ''
- desc: equals to Look at and
  persid: ''
- desc: then MV
  persid: ''
- desc: equals Mold MeV and
  persid: ''
- desc: Next form I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a variation On the boxes example

    in the lab.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I am looking at it from a

    different point of view. Here''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: an example of how a lid might
  persid: ''
- desc: move to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'illustrate the show The contents

    of the box of The container.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So the
  persid: ''
- desc: in the vertex shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t, I didn''t correct this

    one, I guess, oh, because it''s,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's not my No, it is,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, okay, I see I left the

    original code there, but I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: streamlined it a bit
  persid: ''
- desc: so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we take the V position, the

    vertex attribute position,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiply it by MV and then by

    The projection matrix to get our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points and then The fragment

    shader is just passing through'
  persid: ''
- desc: the color. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I haven''t used the matrix

    stack here I''m just resetting'
  persid: ''
- desc: the View after I draw each cube.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: start with look at
  persid: ''
- desc: so the first
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cube is moved on the x axis, but

    it''s still centered'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on still centered on the axis,

    just moved further down the x In'
  persid: ''
- desc: the x direction and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the translations are the same

    as'
  persid: ''
- desc: if we start with that,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we didn''t do a translate, we

    just did the Rotate, where would'
  persid: ''
- desc: we be rotating?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Right so we''d be rotating around

    that center as it is, but we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to rotate on an edge so we

    translate by one Half, one half'
  persid: ''
- desc: And up together. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That one''s Not a very good

    square, but you get the idea. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re doing a translate, so we

    have the center of the axis of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation on one of the edges of

    the cube, and then we do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation, and then we do another

    translate to put it On top of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the other cube.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So instead of resetting the MV

    matrix to look at, we can do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: push and pop
  persid: ''
- desc: so we don't have a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so That simplifies things a bit.

    Does That make sense?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Was that helpful? I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Should we Try it with Solid

    tubes? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions about about that

    at all? Bless You. You.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, should We talk about The

    midterm? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ll cover chapters One

    through Five. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: do a summary of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our discussions, some links,

    resources, and I''ll have that to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Father for Monday. And if we

    have questions to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do, whether we can do that,

    then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's going to be
  persid: ''
- desc: in person on paper,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I have more flexibility for

    The kinds of questions I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think that was the point we

    used In our example. What'
  persid: ''
- desc: you think about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that is that that as a question.

    Take'
  persid: ''
- desc: care. So I
  persid: ''
- desc: would say
  persid: ''
- desc: rotation on x means that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have this matrix the cosine

    and sine, and then if'
  persid: ''
- desc: I give you an angle different
  persid: ''
- desc: than 90, I'll give you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll give you the values to put

    in as well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we don''t have to memorize

    values. Just do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the process, go through the

    process. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: who likes that idea?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, one person, 2345, well,

    that''s okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Should we do some multiple

    choice questions? Do Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m How about give you a little

    bit of JavaScript or Shake your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'code to explain what''s going on

    with it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone like that idea for a

    question, okay?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any other kinds that come to

    mind? Well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Of course, some exams, I have

    a couple that'
  persid: ''
- desc: are based
  persid: ''
- desc: On this book,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s not an indication that

    so the discussions in class may'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have been different, but I''ll

    give you the sample exams and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'samples To in the hope they may

    be of help. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any Other questions,

    suggestions? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you have any that come to

    mind, let''s say by the end of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Friday, you can post them to the

    class discussion list, and I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will. I would certainly

    appreciate that that''s that''s an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'option, opportunity for

    participation in the class to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give you questions And what you

    think would Be good answers.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, do
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I thought maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: We could talk a little bit more
  persid: ''
- desc: about projection matrices, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it also indicate which slides

    that sharing with you, Maybe I,'
  persid: ''
- desc: more relevant than others Do.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so the comment about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re getting everything into

    the standard view volume and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what is The View? Volume?

    Make'
  persid: ''
- desc: any changes? What are the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points? We''re able to see? What

    core points in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what are the coordinates that

    we''re able to See without doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything, setting Up, viewing

    The transformations.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I didn''t put the z values

    in.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if the positive Z axis is coming

    out of the board, and so which'
  persid: ''
- desc: handed coordinate system?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is this the volume that we have

    to work with? Do clipping'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates, it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually minus one, minus one,

    minus One and on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can apply orthographic

    projection to'
  persid: ''
- desc: get perspective projection So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is I start with Our

    model view transformation. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all the transformations we have

    at the model. And then at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'end of that, we do the viewing

    the lookout to change the basis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the camera space. We do the

    projection transformation, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then when we go to perspective

    division, to go from 4d to 3d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we do the clipping, and

    then we project from 3d to 2d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so we wanted to the

    information as long as possible,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we want to do the use

    the Zen buffer, or the depth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer, to help us with hidden

    Surface Removal and it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So if we do
  persid: ''
- desc: orthogonal
  persid: ''
- desc: 'projection, we have an ortho

    matrix in MV, nu.js specify the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'left, right, bottom, top and

    near and far coordinates so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have this shape, the shape on

    the left, and it gets'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformed into the standard

    clipping volume.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we move the set the two steps

    that we need to accomplish. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we move the center to the origin

    translation then we scale so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the sides have length two,

    because we go from minus one to'
  persid: ''
- desc: plus one.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So two divided by right minus

    left, two divided by top minus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bottom, two divided by near

    minus far, and then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translation that we specify in

    the first step. So that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that gets us into the clip

    coordinates, the minus one plus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 1q and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this matrix M Orth takes the 3d

    coordinates and puts them into'
  persid: ''
- desc: '2d because We''re dropping The Z

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s an example with the

    center of projection at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'origin the near moving plane at

    z equals minus one, and the 90'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'degree field of view determined

    by The planes x plus minus z, y'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'plus and minus z. So that means

    going out at 45 degree angles.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so the field of u is 90

    because we have 45 and 45 and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the simple projection matrix

    for homogeneous coordinates, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have minus One in the bottom

    row. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: the point x, y, z.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can map parameters, alpha,

    beta, and after the perspective'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of vision, we get x, prime x

    divided by z, y prime, y divided'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by z and z prime is minus alpha

    plus beta over z,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that projects to the desired

    part, regardless of alpha and'
  persid: ''
- desc: beta.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we pick alpha and beta

    carefully, then the clipping'
  persid: ''
- desc: Volume is the default again.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're Stretching out
  persid: ''
- desc: so this,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stretching out this plane to be

    the same size as that, or we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think of we''re taking a

    truncated pyramid and turning it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into a parallel plate, but so we

    can easily get it into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clipping coordinate. So it''s the

    story, but it projects'
  persid: ''
- desc: correctly. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so our hidden surface removal

    with the depth buffer works if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we apply the normalization

    transformation first. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s some distortion, which

    might become a problem of small'
  persid: ''
- desc: businesses and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I anyway, wrote a time I see I

    hope today was'
  persid: ''
- desc: helpful.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'At any rate, I thank you for

    your attention'
  persid: ''
- desc: today and for time to see me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I rotating cubes. I have

    office hours tomorrow, but feel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'free to make comments online as

    well. So anyway, this is a bit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'early, but have a good weekend,

    and we''ll see you on Monday, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not before. Take care. Everyone

    you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not before. Take care. Everyone

    you'
