- desc: 'Hello, Monday, October,

    7, You.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So continue with chapter four. I

    want to bring to your attention'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a couple of events on Friday. So

    there''s the lunch'
  persid: ''
- desc: in Rick, 219,
  persid: ''
- desc: the lunch theater. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then there''s also the seminar at

    the reception to follow.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that was an education

    auditorium, but it''s been moved'
  persid: ''
- desc: to Rick, 219,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that makes easier for for the

    hospitality folks to arrange'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things and coordinate amongst

    different activities going on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the day that day. So the

    reception is in the lab calf,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who calls it the lab calf,

    besides me or lab Cafe anyway,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very close to The record. Key,

    One, Nine, I,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's F, not A T.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I'd like your input
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the Judea, Could you close

    the door? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thank you. Now we''ll see Whether

    it helps or not you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so inspired by a 16 by 16

    favicon. Anyone familiar with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'favicons, that''s the little

    picture that comes up'
  persid: ''
- desc: beside the website Like
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the F for Facebook there and so

    on. So.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I'm not
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to beat this or play with

    this point, but I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''m thinking, we''re thinking

    about doing u'
  persid: ''
- desc: r, CS, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then we have to decide which

    cupcakes to ice with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'foreground color and which ones

    to ice With the background color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to bring To make this A display

    so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so 16 and 16 being with more

    characters and'
  persid: ''
- desc: more characters,
  persid: ''
- desc: eight by eight.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Screen, so you can see that I

    have an app here to do the IBM'
  persid: ''
- desc: BIOS font to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is this related to class at All

    closely enough that I could'
  persid: ''
- desc: bring it up? I
  persid: ''
- desc: more food.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so?
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's look At last Day I
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: We use matrices. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so matrices can be used
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to specify transformations on

    points and'
  persid: ''
- desc: vectors.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If we want to do a three

    dimensional transformation, is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it sufficient To have a three

    dimensional Matrix, three value'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrix, if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have a three by three

    matrix to represent the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation, scaling and sharing

    that we want to apply to our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'model, but we don''t have a way

    to express the translation, So'
  persid: ''
- desc: you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to have a translation

    Vector and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have point P, we transform

    it, and we need to do the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'addition as well. So what can we

    make that simpler? The idea of'
  persid: ''
- desc: transforming
  persid: ''
- desc: our geometric primitives And
  persid: ''
- desc: you? Yeah, so
  persid: ''
- desc: changing His coordinates and
  persid: ''
- desc: bless you. I
  persid: ''
- desc: scale and shear. I,
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: your arms and lights and
  persid: ''
- desc: like This
  persid: ''
- desc: vector, a column vector and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a one by four array or one by

    four matrix and a'
  persid: ''
- desc: vector is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the extra component,

    w, x, y, z and w. So w is one'
  persid: ''
- desc: for points and zero
  persid: ''
- desc: or vectors. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how do we make that distinction?

    Because we think of a vector as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the difference between two

    points.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re subtracting 2.1 minus one

    is Zero And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s talk a bit about how to

    identify the axis On which'
  persid: ''
- desc: something is spinning. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So to begin with our spinning on

    the x axis and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s talk about how this

    could be made more clear,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because What we''re doing, if we

    choose to rotate'
  persid: ''
- desc: on y
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re left with the value that

    was set for the rotation on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'x axis, and now we''re

    incrementing the y axis,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then We can spin on the Z

    axis as well. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so how do we get back to
  persid: ''
- desc: our Starting position and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so what? What can we do to

    improve this display'
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's clear Where the
  persid: ''
- desc: axis is?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, Let's Do
  persid: ''
- desc: So Any ideas I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see it on the what If we do

    Something like I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so Do from the origin i
  persid: ''
- desc: And then We'll Say, I
  persid: ''
- desc: Comments, questions. Could
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you do an example of some of the

    teachers algorithms for like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tables? Let''s say just like a Q

    over, like the y axis on just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really some of the math so we

    can get Like that Central'
  persid: ''
- desc: Understanding. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: let's finish This. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we can see in the vertex

    shader the code for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: different rotations.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So remember, they''re column

    major. So we Bring the matrix.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: RX Is I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s going to rotate it with the

    origin. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s see what''s an angle we

    could rotate by'
  persid: ''
- desc: about 90 degrees if
  persid: ''
- desc: cosine and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so cosine of 90 degrees zero.

    Sine of 90 degrees is one'
  persid: ''
- desc: column,
  persid: ''
- desc: zero and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minus one and five cosine of 90

    is 00001,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, let the fiber routine.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pick a number between one and

    10,'
  persid: ''
- desc: seven,
  persid: ''
- desc: Next two
  persid: ''
- desc: and one more, five, one So.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we get seven and
  persid: ''
- desc: then it's minus five and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotate around the z the x axis

    by 90 degrees.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So We have plane
  persid: ''
- desc: set. 252,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we rotate by 90 degrees. We

    have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: we have two in the z direction,
  persid: ''
- desc: then minus
  persid: ''
- desc: 5y direction and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seven. So we''re staying put at

    seven.'
  persid: ''
- desc: We rotate between
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the let''s look at it from the x

    axis here. Let''s put x here,'
  persid: ''
- desc: y and z.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're at x to the seven and
  persid: ''
- desc: two and five, and Then
  persid: ''
- desc: we go to
  persid: ''
- desc: The I needed over explaining? It
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does that make sense? So we''re

    switching rotating around the x'
  persid: ''
- desc: axis.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we start with five two here,

    and what''s minus Five? Two.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re switching places. In

    that case, we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, So let''s write a sheets

    for y and sand, and then we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: multiply them together. So
  persid: ''
- desc: so CO, sign,
  persid: ''
- desc: minus sign, first column, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so what do we notice
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the columns or the axis

    about which we''re rotating? So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we rotate around x, the first

    column'
  persid: ''
- desc: is x,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s part of the identity

    matrix. And for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'y, we have the same thing. And

    then from S, Y and spy, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions back there? Okay.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what is the z column going to

    look like for let''s write'
  persid: ''
- desc: it as rooting around z you can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tell me what the said column

    will be for The Z rotation'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrix.
  persid: ''
- desc: Start at zero, next zero. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: Zero. Next,
  persid: ''
- desc: one, zero.
  persid: ''
- desc: Do that, right? I pronounced.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so how about for me? Let

    me see you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I believe that is square root

    of two over two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which happens to be point

    squares, point 7271, So One, you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotating around the Y axis which

    point is going to remain'
  persid: ''
- desc: constant under rotation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so, right, seven to a

    seven times Seven'
  persid: ''
- desc: plus
  persid: ''
- desc: nine, minus 7271, seven
  persid: ''
- desc: times, Five So.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's say, instance,
  persid: ''
- desc: eight line four and four. This
  persid: ''
- desc: 'One is minus four by nine plus

    three. Five, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's minus 1.4 so That's 8.4
  persid: ''
- desc: so two axis look at x In the
  persid: ''
- desc: net, we have seven And five,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and rotate by 45 degrees.

    Approximately'
  persid: ''
- desc: 8.4 minus 1.4
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I should have just done a 90

    degree angle again. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's do 90 here again so you
  persid: ''
- desc: can check my math here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Cosine 90 is zero. Sine of 90 is

    1000,'
  persid: ''
- desc: minus one And
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have minus two And then
  persid: ''
- desc: five and one and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, Let''s make this minus 90

    here. I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so let''s Do your Patience

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotate by x first and rotate by

    y, rotate by Z.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s what we''re doing in the

    shade right here. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: this is really good anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So so rotate my x Is unserved

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: and Zero.
  persid: ''
- desc: I throughout the time where we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i Well, double check the work

    here and see what we get for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: answer To transform
  persid: ''
- desc: so describing what I'm asking
  persid: ''
- desc: for, I prescribing project.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, thank you, everyone.
  persid: ''
- desc: Bye. Shop everywhere. Oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: Bye. Shop everywhere. Oh,
