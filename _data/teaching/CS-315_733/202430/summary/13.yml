- desc: Happy Monday you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for those of you who are

    eligible, this is the election'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'day, I encourage you to take

    time to cast your vote if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone a Saskatchewan Rough

    Rider? Fan? Yeah. Me, too.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, there was about 10

    seconds in the game between'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Montreal and Winnipeg that

    changed the outcome the outlook'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for Saturday''s match against

    Calvary here and'
  persid: ''
- desc: hope it's All for The Best. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I didn''t have the attendance

    set up for the last meeting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: '23rd because that was supposed

    to be our mentor when I set'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things up and I fixed in some

    places, but not another. So when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you go to that link now to do

    attendance, there are two of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them, so you can record your own

    attendance.'
  persid: ''
- desc: If you were here on the 23rd or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you had the opportunity to say

    you were here on the 23rd'
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So any questions or concerns

    about assignment two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s a sample from code. Alex

    car, those of you are in 733'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he''s the lab instructor for 315

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so here's the little video I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s no blading. Used it''s

    just you get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the colors from the vertex

    attributes in the East in The'
  persid: ''
- desc: JavaScript file.
  persid: ''
- desc: So here the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the box is made out of six cubes

    that are squished. That''s one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approach. There are others that

    seem okay? Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I have updated the links. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I created a class discussion

    about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, And here''s the link to

    submit a newer courses and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here the collection of the

    PowerPoint slides that you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: reference.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''ll look at seven, 7.3 here

    today, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: That will be the extent
  persid: ''
- desc: of our discussion You
  persid: ''
- desc: so should we go through
  persid: ''
- desc: No Winter. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen, you can see a pixel of

    the smallest person moving.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So each pixel on the display

    shows a sample how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we don''t think of pixels

    having shapes, not a square or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rectangle, but each point on the

    display is showing a sample of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the that we're representing,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'starting from Black. Describe or

    sketch how you would get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color white using the three

    primitive colors. How would it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'differ if you started From white

    and went to black? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we start from black, we
  persid: ''
- desc: have certain values of
  persid: ''
- desc: zero for red, zero for green,
  persid: ''
- desc: and zero for Blue. And
  persid: ''
- desc: same so
  persid: ''
- desc: this is red and
  persid: ''
- desc: This is green. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: this is blue. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so green plus blue is
  persid: ''
- desc: yellow And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah, well, it''s actually cyan.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: red plus green, yellow.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then blue plus red
  persid: ''
- desc: is Bucha in General, and then,
  persid: ''
- desc: style, okay, it's
  persid: ''
- desc: not Adding the
  persid: ''
- desc: no less,
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what Can we say about RGB or

    going from. So that''s the color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we use on our displays. Start

    from black or nearly black. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what can we what adjective can

    we use for RGB? Additive, yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: additive, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we start from white, let''s

    say we''re printing something,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we can apply cyan, magenta

    and yellow inks to get The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors by subtracting from

    White.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So CMY
  persid: ''
- desc: is
  persid: ''
- desc: subtractive i
  persid: ''
- desc: If we look
  persid: ''
- desc: at this cube on its diagonal,
  persid: ''
- desc: so we go From zero to 00, to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not Doing very well Here

    with My I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we'll See the colors
  persid: ''
- desc: of around the edge of the
  persid: ''
- desc: circle. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was trying to draw a hexagon.

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have a way to think about

    colors, which is a bit more'
  persid: ''
- desc: intuitive and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not perfect, though. So

    this axis from left to Lake is'
  persid: ''
- desc: the valley and
  persid: ''
- desc: in the distance from the center
  persid: ''
- desc: to the edge
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as we''re moving out, as we move

    along that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'path, we change the saturation.

    So we go from white'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we''re doing yellow. So this

    is white with a little tinge of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yellow. This is yellow with a

    tinge of white,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then you get full on Yellow

    at the edge. So if the'
  persid: ''
- desc: value is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero, doesn''t matter what the

    other'
  persid: ''
- desc: other parameters are. So
  persid: ''
- desc: this is an angle and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is just a value between

    zero and one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Displaying two. Represented that

    way. Does that make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I brought in the hue

    saturation value. That''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'necessarily part of that

    question. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe it''s a good idea to Well,

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe a good question is, use

    these four words In a sentence.'
  persid: ''
- desc: What do You think about That? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can take discrete take

    samples of A continuous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'phenomena to Create a discrete

    representation. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So What other variable do we

    have to intend that when We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'creating this discrete

    representation of a continuous'
  persid: ''
- desc: phenomenon?
  persid: ''
- desc: I The precision
  persid: ''
- desc: of The representation and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the precision of the

    representation is determined By'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the precision with which we

    store each sample and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one bit doesn''t give us very

    much precision. Black or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'white, two bits give us a bit

    More and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 4s that
  persid: ''
- desc: gives us
  persid: ''
- desc: '16'
  persid: ''
- desc: levels and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we need to save this to store

    information about the red, green'
  persid: ''
- desc: and blue values. So
  persid: ''
- desc: that gives us $16.7 million
  persid: ''
- desc: i Does that seem okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how do we represent A point in

    homogeneous coordinates?'
  persid: ''
- desc: How about A manager? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a TLA is a three letter acronym

    or abbreviation, because It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not really acronym, can''t

    pronounce it. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You don''t have to worry about me

    asking that. You don''t have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: Write
  persid: ''
- desc: that One down. You
  persid: ''
- desc: What's
  persid: ''
- desc: a feature of using WebGL two
  persid: ''
- desc: when it comes to interaction,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we don''t have to specify our own

    And our own witches and so on'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re able to associate covad

    functions with events. So when'
  persid: ''
- desc: something's clicked, we
  persid: ''
- desc: take the appropriate action. A
  persid: ''
- desc: 'long time ago, interaction was

    done by poly, had a big loop,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you just test that this

    happened or that happened, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: it would just go on And on or
  persid: ''
- desc: there's a typo there.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's Think about
  persid: ''
- desc: the case
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of code in the textbook. What do

    we have if we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics programs and we have a

    we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graphics dot HTML and

    graphics.js and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there could be more, but let''s

    Stick with these two.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone like to buy a vowel or

    make a guess or a consonant? Are'
  persid: ''
- desc: there any ease I
  persid: ''
- desc: one.
  persid: ''
- desc: Ah, yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have two shaders, vertex and

    fragment,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we put them in the HTML file
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what else is there? Wow, you''re

    good. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so we set up the canvas in

    the HTML file, and we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to connect to it. We''re going to

    create a contact, a web GL, two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering context attached to

    the canvas.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s In the graphics.js

    file? So'
  persid: ''
- desc: and set up offers and
  persid: ''
- desc: that Just go off So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a question about grow

    and Fauci that We''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: cover next chapter so You can
  persid: ''
- desc: ignore that On the screen. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are you seeing a little flashing

    up? Yeah, I wonder if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that was well timed with the

    flash. I wonder if there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something wrong with the

    projector okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: why are triangle strips
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important? The computationally,

    the most efficient'
  persid: ''
- desc: represents about any kind of
  persid: ''
- desc: objects.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It. I heard most of that it''s

    computationally efficient. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the most computationally

    efficient way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represent any kind of object, as

    opposed to using the context of'
  persid: ''
- desc: concave, which is
  persid: ''
- desc: at the context, which is a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disgusting community, yeah, so

    they''re good because we know a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle lies in the plane so We

    don''t have to worry about'
  persid: ''
- desc: quadrilateral not being a
  persid: ''
- desc: not being
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the same plane, you get that

    for free with triangles. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We don''t want three points on a

    line,'
  persid: ''
- desc: though, so that's the only case,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we don''t want to really thin

    triangles either, but we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: create a mesh
  persid: ''
- desc: With triangle strips,
  persid: ''
- desc: and we don't Have we can
  persid: ''
- desc: specify vertices. We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we get a large triangle,

    Maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 1v 2v 3f, v2 v3 v4 then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we get four triangles from

    six vertices and'
  persid: ''
- desc: as opposed to
  persid: ''
- desc: more triangles and
  persid: ''
- desc: each with three vertices.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re saving 50% on storage,

    because we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: duplicating values
  persid: ''
- desc: from
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re not repeating vertex

    values. So there are many ways'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we can we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and make our representations

    more efficient. And it''s not so'
  persid: ''
- desc: important
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we have six or eight

    triangles, but when we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: million or so, then it's
  persid: ''
- desc: more of an issue.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Why is the flattened function

    required in The code from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: tax code You
  persid: ''
- desc: extra JavaScript and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'capabilities and just creates

    account remember the exam i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Three, two, I would have to

    check that. Does anyone know'
  persid: ''
- desc: offhand? I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, well, I'll check that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Turn the projector off and now

    it comes back on this screen.'
  persid: ''
- desc: See whether
  persid: ''
- desc: it would be happy again.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how do we get
  persid: ''
- desc: any seeing in term,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say we have world coordinates

    that deal with kilometers? How'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do we make that huge scene that

    we''ve modeled? How do we make it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it fits into the minus one,

    minus one, minus one to 111,'
  persid: ''
- desc: cube.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: So, Oh, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: it's happy again. I
  persid: ''
- desc: Does That make sense? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: we do transformations.
  persid: ''
- desc: We transform the walls
  persid: ''
- desc: with you. And
  persid: ''
- desc: then we apply the projection and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what is that buffer? Why is it

    useful? Or how it is used?'
  persid: ''
- desc: What's another name for it?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, can We also talk about

    depth buffer? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so restoring
  persid: ''
- desc: for each pixel
  persid: ''
- desc: 'value we update we store a Z

    value'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we test whether, before we

    make a change'
  persid: ''
- desc: to the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the image that''s displayed, we

    test whether the new value at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the depth is closer to the

    viewer than the one that''s there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'already. So if the depth is less

    with the new value than the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'update pixel, if it''s Not

    closer, you don''t if'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything else that Come comes to

    mind so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So We can design our own

    path here and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s a lot of the code In

    Chapter five in the book is'
  persid: ''
- desc: great meshes, and If
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re familiar with Triangle

    strips, that idea of ink. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: can make a surface, okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: I think we're at the end of
  persid: ''
- desc: the day today. Thank
  persid: ''
- desc: you very much for your
  persid: ''
- desc: participation and
  persid: ''
- desc: otherwise,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have office hours tomorrow,

    in person'
