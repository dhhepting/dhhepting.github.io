- desc: 'Well, here we are

    meeting 21 You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So today, let''s Talk about, look

    at some examples from chapter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eight, Monday, we''ll touch on

    today chapter nine, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: Wednesday,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll do so maybe On Monday,

    we''ll show you some examples of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'warm, fast rendering methods.

    Wednesday, review,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think we can find some

    interesting demos to look at as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well. That seemed like a

    reasonable, reasonable plan. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes. Okay, so let''s look at a

    few examples. So I realize the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'website has some typos in it

    that throw up errors when I try'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and access the online version of

    some programs. So I render four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and five and some other ones

    generate an error, but we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: deal with them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can make global copies and

    adjust them so fix the typos. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s look at this first

    exam.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what do You notice about

    this?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, the triangle has jagged

    edges.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so So let''s have a look at

    the code and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have two vertex shaders and two

    fragment shaders. So the first,'
  persid: ''
- desc: the first vertex shader is just
  persid: ''
- desc: 'setting the position, and the

    first fragment shader is just'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'passing out a constant color. So

    this is going to be a red'
  persid: ''
- desc: triangle, or a red something.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then the second vertex

    shader, in addition to setting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the position, passing the

    position, we''re getting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture coordinates and so we''re

    passing those on to the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then we have in the second

    fragment shader, the here, input'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the texture coordinate,

    output of the fragment color,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we have a uniform sampler

    texture map. So we''re sampling a'
  persid: ''
- desc: '2d texture map to create the

    fragment color. And the way we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do that is use texture texture

    map, the sampler, and Then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture coordinates.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here we have our JavaScript.

    So we have texture coordinates,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 00011111000,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so those correspond to the

    vertices of the quad that we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'defining. And so here''s the

    triangle vertices and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re setting up two

    programs, one with vertex shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, fragment shader one and the

    other one, fragment shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parting, vertex shader two,

    fragment shader two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we create an empty texture.

    We make we set texture zero to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be active. Bind texture, the

    texture one that we''re creating'
  persid: ''
- desc: here,
  persid: ''
- desc: and we make a 64 by 64 texture,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we don''t and we release the

    binding of the texture here when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we say texture to D null. So

    then we''re going to allocate a'
  persid: ''
- desc: frame buffer object and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we help, so we have a frame

    buffer and a render buffer.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re going to attach to the

    frame buffer a color buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s in the texture that we''ve

    defined. So we''re going to get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the colors from the texture

    we''re it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is checking
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to make sure that the frame

    buffer status is complete do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the program so then we first use

    program One.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s just do the pass

    through to make the red have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: red color and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we''re going to render

    One triangle. Viewport is 64 by'
  persid: ''
- desc: '64'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clear color is gray. We''re going

    to draw one triangle. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to unbind a

    texture here from the frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer and from the render

    buffer,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re are going to make the

    texture. Are going to bind The'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture, texture one and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So, what have we done? This

    is a way we can so we have a 64'
  persid: ''
- desc: by 64 image
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we''re creating as a

    texture. So where is that image'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the on the screen here?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s not just the triangle,

    but it''s the background as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so to make it more jagged, We

    could do 16 by 16.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So Now let's see where Is Blue
  persid: ''
- desc: defined And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I missed it there. Here''s The

    blue i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this illustrates that We can

    have textures of different'
  persid: ''
- desc: resolutions and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not a great revelation, Perhaps,

    but it''s an interesting'
  persid: ''
- desc: Use of the frame buffers And
  persid: ''
- desc: so this, This
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the one. I referenced in the

    quiz I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve made a local copy so we

    can'
  persid: ''
- desc: make some changes To I
  persid: ''
- desc: it so I made it more diffuse,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I changed the color a little

    bit. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Here''s the HTML, following

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: shaders.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'To this was originally one.

    Let''s add'
  persid: ''
- desc: a two, and let's say But that
  persid: ''
- desc: also To be too I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have two that gives The

    idea. I shouldn''t. I should have'
  persid: ''
- desc: reversed the parameter changes
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there are two vertex shaders

    and two fragment shaders here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I added color based on the X

    the X value of the points. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is in vertex shader one. If

    the point is greater than zero'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in x, then it''s going to be red.

    If it''s less than or equal to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero in X, the color will be

    blue. So that''s the first vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: shader,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the first fragment shader is

    taking the V color from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertex shader and the and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'passing through to the fragment

    color. So pretty straightforward'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stuff. And then in frag, in the

    vertex two shader so we''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the the position, And we''re

    sitting up, passing through the'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture coordinates. We're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the second fragment

    shader is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going so we set up these

    parameters and we get the x and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'y from the texture coordinates,

    and then we''re doing a texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: map now.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'With x plus d, y plus d, x minus

    d, and Y minus D. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sampling other locations. So

    we''re getting four values for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the texture, and then we''re

    summing them and dividing'
  persid: ''
- desc: through by a
  persid: ''
- desc: value of S.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: if we're doing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four points and so we''re just

    competing the Average.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in order for this to work,

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what needs to happen? When do we

    call the program one with vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader one and fragment shader

    one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, Yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: so what About this one i
  persid: ''
- desc: What's different about it?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re actively adding points,

    so that requires a bit of'
  persid: ''
- desc: different approach.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there are two sets of shaders

    for this program as well. So in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader one, we''re specifying the

    position in ly, and we''re also'
  persid: ''
- desc: Passing the texture coordinates
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and vertex shader two. We have

    the position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in 2d and we''re also saying the

    point size And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so fragment shader one
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a uniform for the sampler

    2d texture map,'
  persid: ''
- desc: distance and the scale.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'another version of what we just

    looked at, that''s fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader one, and fragment shader

    two is passing through the the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, no, it''s not passing

    through. It''s it''s using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color that''s been set in the

    uniform. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have one that''s drawing and

    another One that''s diffusing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re creating two textures

    so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''re binding to the second

    texture to begin with. We create'
  persid: ''
- desc: those two programs and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we create a frame buffer

    object, bind to it and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we''re setting the

    locations of the points so'
  persid: ''
- desc: they're moving randomly. We're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So we set up the uniforms,

    point size and the color.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Then we switch to program one,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we set up the data for the

    vertice for the points that'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're going to Draw we're
  persid: ''
- desc: then we ask the texture
  persid: ''
- desc: and the parameters, And then we
  persid: ''
- desc: bind the texture and render it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re switching between the

    two textures we''re updating One'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then diffusing it into the

    other. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So once we''ve combined the two

    buffers, then we detach from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frame buffer, we''re going to

    render to the screen and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We adjust the adjust the

    particles,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we wrap it around if we need

    to, and then we substitute the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'data that we''ve already passed,

    so we''re just updating position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the vertices, and Then we

    swap the textures and do it'
  persid: ''
- desc: again. We're
  persid: ''
- desc: I have a better version
  persid: ''
- desc: of this,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But I''ll post to the COVID

    directory. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does that give you an idea that

    there''s lots of capabilities to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use within Web GL to that frame

    buffers can off screen rendering'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can be a useful technique in

    creating graphics if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so here''s the that Those

    ideas from a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: perspective.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So GPUs are very powerful

    texture memory. You can have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiple frame buffers and use

    floating point numbers as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is the eighth edition of

    the textbook, up to version six'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'he was dealing with Open GL. So

    that''s why he keeps mentioning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Open GL and and by God, bygone

    logging through yester year'
  persid: ''
- desc: seems
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so If you''re interested, there''s

    vulcan.org is developing Open'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Source standard for desktop

    graphics. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so texture objects reduce

    transfers between CPU and GPU.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Transfer picks data back to the

    CPU is slow, so we want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'manipulate the pixel going back

    to the CPU. So we have indeed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing image processing and

    general purpose GP, general'
  persid: ''
- desc: purpose competing with the GDU.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It. So the frame buffer objects

    like we saw the get the frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer and the render buffer, so

    they''re not associated with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'window system browser, and

    they''re not they can''t display'
  persid: ''
- desc: them directly.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can apply with texture or

    apply potassium to make them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'visible so it can attach a

    render buffer to a frame buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object and render off screen

    into the attached buffer. Then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the attached buffer can be

    detached and uses a texture map'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for an auto Screen render to

    default to the default frame'
  persid: ''
- desc: buffer so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we render to the texture

    that''s attached, then we can get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the sense of you can make

    incremental changes, so you see'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ant colony or Game of Life,

    however we want to think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, so we can visualize those

    things going on and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we first create an empty

    texture object, then create a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frame buffer object, attach the

    render buffer for the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image, bind the frame buffer

    object, render the scene, detach'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the render buffer, bind the

    texture and render with new'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have These two textures,

    and we''re going back and forth'
  persid: ''
- desc: between
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s this is setting up the

    parameters for texture one, 512,'
  persid: ''
- desc: by 512 texture image.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we create the frame buffer

    using similar Methodist other'
  persid: ''
- desc: objects. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when you create the frame buffer

    object, it''s empty, and then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have to add our resources render

    buffer to render into. We can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a texture which can also be

    rendered into. We if we want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do hidden service removal, we

    have to Add a depth buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attachment To the render buffer.

    Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Here''s a description of

    rendering to texture.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So For doing rendering to

    texture, we need different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'programs, which mean different

    shaders that we''ve been like'
  persid: ''
- desc: We've been discussing here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we''re swapping buffers, we

    switching them, and we might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need some other resources as

    well. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is the shader that gives

    us the red triangle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And here's the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here are the shades that do the

    texture mapping. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we set up the buffer with

    points, array, data, make the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'connection to the shader

    variable, and then we render the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle, 64 by 64 then the

    second render. So we''re using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the system frame buffer so we

    detach from the frame buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: we'd set up.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We turn off the vertex attribute

    array, and we''re using program'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two, which is dealing with the

    texture.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here we have a texture being

    activated, and we''re connecting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture one with our as our

    texture.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So for Buffer two,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re loading the data from the

    vertices through flat Then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: position
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make the connection with the

    shader And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we Have the texture

    coordinates and'
  persid: ''
- desc: So does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is the example of

    diffusion. So two types of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'agents, quote, unquote. So it''s

    not interacting with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'environment, and they are

    indicated by the different'
  persid: ''
- desc: colors. They move randomly,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the position

    information specified by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendered with rendering the

    texture, and then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diffusing by going back and

    forth and diffusing the image,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we get the sense of the
  persid: ''
- desc: passage of Time And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so initially we Draw the points

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So does that make sense? That

    one is drawing the position of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the points, and so the points

    are being updated each time. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we do a we do a rendering of the

    points, and then we diffuse'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them. We render lines to the

    texture, and we diffuse the'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture again. And
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is the diffusing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex shader one, fragment

    shader one, and this is drawing'
  persid: ''
- desc: the points
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and setting the color based on

    the uniform variable and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re using program one bind

    to a frame buffer. So if flag is'
  persid: ''
- desc: true, then we're going to bind
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture one and attach texture

    two to the frame buffer. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to render into

    texture two. Otherwise, you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to bind texture two and

    render into texture one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re drawing a strip of

    triangles and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to render the points we''re using

    program two we set up the'
  persid: ''
- desc: The attributes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the interesting line here,

    maybe is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: makes it hard for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me. It''s not actually, it''s four

    lines. So here we''re setting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uniform color for program two.

    So the first one is red and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'blue, so that''s kind of magenta,

    and then the other one is almost'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fully green. So we''re drawing

    drawing the vertices as points'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first half of the vertices are

    drawn in magenta and the others'
  persid: ''
- desc: are drawn in green. So
  persid: ''
- desc: then the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rendering to the display, and

    then we swap the textures and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we use texture two before,

    we''re using texture one, and if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we Use texture one before, then

    We''re using texture Two. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here they''re doing, reading

    the texture to see if the'
  persid: ''
- desc: if the green particle sees
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lands on a green particle, then

    it''s going to move. And if the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'magenta particle sees a red

    component, then going to move as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well to a different spot. So

    here we''re using green pixels to'
  persid: ''
- desc: do that. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can see
  persid: ''
- desc: some difference in that and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Here''s talking about the

    picking that we talked About'
  persid: ''
- desc: last day,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this conditional makes more

    sense to me than the one in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'code. So if color zero is 255 so

    if it''s red, then if color one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is 255 that means it''s yellow.

    Otherwise, if color two, there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no if there''s no green, but

    there''s blue, then it''s magenta.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Otherwise it's red.
  persid: ''
- desc: If color one is a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the green is set and blue is set

    at cyan. Otherwise it''s green.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Otherwise, if the blue is set,

    then it''s colored blue. And if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re not hitting any of them,

    then the color is background.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And
