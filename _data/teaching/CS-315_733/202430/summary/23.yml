    that''s Working you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, Here
  persid: ''
- desc: we are on day meeting 23 of 23
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we dedicated to review and

    questions. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the upcoming event that''s

    important next is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: violent town you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this. Am I working? I think it

    is so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things that can get you reach

    the back of the room today,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so find the exam I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Monday, December 9, here in

    seal, 112,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'At does that agree with your

    understanding? Okay? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: cut off for assignments and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for December 10, at one minute

    to midnight if you haven''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gotten assignments, if you

    haven''t made the due dates. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first one, the third was

    assignment. Three was due on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Monday at 2359 on the second and

    Simon. Four is December 6 at'
  persid: ''
- desc: '2359'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you can make those you still

    can get'
  persid: ''
- desc: marks with a bit of a penalty
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by submitting them on By the end

    of the day, on the 10th you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, So I''ve linked to the

    final exams from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the previous two, 730, threes,

    and I''ve also included the'
  persid: ''
- desc: midterms
  persid: ''
- desc: which
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I am taking you at I have linked

    to before, and the midterm from'
  persid: ''
- desc: our class I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have you looked at these

    already,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and what do you think about
  persid: ''
- desc: them helpful?
  persid: ''
- desc: Do you think they're too easy.
  persid: ''
- desc: Nobody's gonna say that, aren't
  persid: ''
- desc: they? Anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: let's look through them. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything more to say about

    pixels?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Any questions about pixels.
  persid: ''
- desc: So pixels are picture elements
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on display screen, we have

    pixels that have a value That'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sampled from the underlying

    phenomenon that we''re sampling'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'starting from a block screen

    describe or sketch how To get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'colors way, using the three

    primitive'
  persid: ''
- desc: colors
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That looks like a little Bit of

    A typo. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when we''re printing, we take

    cyan, magenta, yellow.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're starting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a white piece of paper, and

    we''re putting ink to subtract'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light from wavelengths of light

    so we''d get the color that we'
  persid: ''
- desc: perceive on the printed page. We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so continuous, discrete sampling

    and quantization. I know that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not necessarily a favorite, but

    I think it is. These are useful'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'concepts when we talk about

    computer graphics.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we take a picture of the

    room. Let''s say we''re getting a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re creating in discrete

    representation of the continuous'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'world around us. We might have

    mega pixels in the image, so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: have very high resolution
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have Very high spatial

    resolution,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we can also have a very
  persid: ''
- desc: substantial
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or very precise in This by

    storing a lot of bits with at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each pixel that we represent the

    sample we''ve assigned to a pixel'
  persid: ''
- desc: with a high precision,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a lot of bits. So if we take an

    RGB image, the standard has been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eight bits for red, for green

    and for blue.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: '24 bit color gives us access to

    about 16 point 7 million'
  persid: ''
- desc: different colors. The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so bits are cheap now, so we

    can store 12 bits per channel'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: we add alpha So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can have more than we need

    for most purposes where we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: enough.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So are these concepts used In

    Web GL to do? I,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I say yes for short answer. How

    do you represent a point in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'homogeneous coordinates? Why are

    homogeneous coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important in Computer Graphics?

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for 2d we''re dealing with an

    extra component we call W. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s an important thing

    that homogeneous coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'allow us to do in computer

    graphics?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Shearing rotations, scaling
  persid: ''
- desc: transformations.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, scaling shearing and

    rotation, those are all i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Those are all here. Yeah, the

    translating is the extra part'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s useful in computer

    graphics. So we can, we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represent translations and

    rotation scalings and shears in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the same matrix. So we can apply

    transformation just by matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplication, instead of doing

    the matrix this multiplication'
  persid: ''
- desc: and this addition so it gives us
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a handy, rough, handy format to

    store everything We need.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So what's an example where
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we use a translation and

    rotation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Just think of the rotation as an

    example of a transformation that'
  persid: ''
- desc: is in that Part,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think about a midterm exam

    question.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Perhaps,
  persid: ''
- desc: rotate it specific
  persid: ''
- desc: point, yeah, so we're going to
  persid: ''
- desc: translate.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Say we want to rotate around

    this point'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first thing we apply is moving

    the point from moving in the new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'center to the origin, doing the

    rotation and then moving it'
  persid: ''
- desc: back.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's a powerful example of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the Use of homogeneous

    coordinates That makes sense. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'who likes this style of question

    where I give you code and ask'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you to explain it. What? Oh,

    okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: I thought maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe the answer would be zero.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I''ll think about that

    in a bit.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So robotic arm has a shaders

    specified and Not much else.'
  persid: ''
- desc: It's just just the canvas I
  persid: ''
- desc: we have the interface elements
  persid: ''
- desc: in addition to The Canvas. So
  persid: ''
- desc: let's do
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're building the
  persid: ''
- desc: model
  persid: ''
- desc: 'arm by creating A base lower arm

    and upper arm you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what is an advantage of Web GL

    two with Respect to interaction?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so We''re not dealing with

    writing interface controls.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re just we can leverage HTML

    and the doctrine object model. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s the difference between

    grow and Farm shading? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: which one can be done in the
  persid: ''
- desc: vertex shader? Yeah, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you find shading in with the

    vertex shader?'
  persid: ''
- desc: No, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to compute

    intensities and vertices and'
  persid: ''
- desc: and interpolate. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the computation that the

    vertices involves normals,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and so we're computing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the lighting equations and

    using,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but we''re only doing that the

    vertices, and then we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: interpolating the value.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what makes long shading

    different but for using the'
  persid: ''
- desc: Frank and shader when advance.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that give us? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what do we interpolate with

    thong shade?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're computing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'normals, and we''re computing the

    intensity per fragment.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So is that more expensive? Yeah,

    but it''s worth it in many cases.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You
  persid: ''
- desc: so interaction of a light and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can refer to the lighting

    equation that we use to compute'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the intensity in the vertex

    shader and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Why is the flattened function

    used from The textbook Charlie?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'flatten just gives us floating

    point numbers to pass to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: shape pass to The GPU and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two. So how do we get from our

    model of a scene to the point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where everything is represented

    inside the clipping space, from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minus one to plus one and X, Y

    and Z and you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ah, sorry if anyone else had to

    hear that. I Transform'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have a number of

    coordinate systems. So if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think about the robot, robotic

    arm base and the lower arm and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the upper arm are instances of

    the cube'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the wave. So we take the

    position with those vertices and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we multiply By the model V

    matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: and the projection matrix the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what is the purpose of A Z

    buffer? We''ve been over that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: think I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to keep track of

    the distances'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the values in the frame

    buffer. So if we''re updating the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen, we test the Z buffer to

    make sure that the new value is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closer than the existing one. So

    we can update the image. If it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not closer than we don''t update

    the image.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So describe bump mapping,

    texture mapping and environment'
  persid: ''
- desc: mapping. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a this thing a problem with

    images as textures?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, could be,
  persid: ''
- desc: we can do area sampling.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What is an advantage to creating

    models By instancing a single'
  persid: ''
- desc: primitive I
  persid: ''
- desc: well, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it keeps things simple. We just

    have to specify the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformations as we create the

    instances and build our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'description of the Model, like

    in a tree or a scene graph. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I document the code. I don''t

    think that''s a good question.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Who likes that question. One

    person, okay, that means maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: half of you like it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll think about that as well.

    So then here''s the code that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have online and part of the exam

    i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i explain how sampling is

    involved in creating A computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generated images, Image, image

    using Web GL Two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from our discussion of RGB

    colors explain the intuition'
  persid: ''
- desc: behind Hue Saturation and Value,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what must be done to reconstruct

    an accurate approximation of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: continuous phenomenon? Them,
  persid: ''
- desc: bless you.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we want to sample it twice,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'twice the resolution of the

    smallest object that we want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: represent. The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How would you change the center

    of rotation for an animation of'
  persid: ''
- desc: rotating square,
  persid: ''
- desc: we have that on the board.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we talked about this a little

    bit to see visible surfaces. Why'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not just sort objects by

    distance from the camera and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draw them in order from furthest

    to nearest.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'work? Sometimes, but when might

    it not work? I an'
  persid: ''
- desc: object that was behind
  persid: ''
- desc: another object. Yeah, so if we,
  persid: ''
- desc: I think I took pictures of that.
  persid: ''
- desc: So from the top,
  persid: ''
- desc: this would work fine. And
  persid: ''
- desc: let this cause problems and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the Z buffer approach, we''re

    competing in depth for each each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point along those edges or those

    in those triangles, And we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'storing the depth in the Z

    buffer and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that gives us the it shows us

    the visible surfaces. Does that'
  persid: ''
- desc: make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t, but, well, I think

    it''s in the code from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'textbook. This works from there.

    I I'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't
  persid: ''
- desc: think I will include it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s just about locating the

    click the mouse position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'recorded on in the screen

    coordinates where we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mouse click. So the complicating

    factor with this that''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'handled in the textbook code is

    when the window isn''t at the top'
  persid: ''
- desc: left of the browser window and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what command is needed in the

    render function to ensure a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smooth animation request

    animation frame And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a take on the

    differences Between grow and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Fong shading.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'describe the difference between

    the interaction of a point light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'source and directional light

    source, determining ambient,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'diffuse, specular components of

    a computed color and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what conditions must be met for

    a surface to be lit i'
  persid: ''
- desc: So what's the difference?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if it''s a directional light,

    we have the angle of incidence'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the same for the everywhere

    in the scene, whereas With a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point light source, that angle

    will change the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in order for the service to

    be lit, it has to be visible To'
  persid: ''
- desc: the light
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I put the instance cubes code in

    The directory,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but we didn''t really talk about

    it. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not instance, cubes, instant tea

    pots.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a way to take one

    object, in this case, a teapot,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and instance it a number of

    Times, and control the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parameters per for each instance

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'describe, in general terms, how

    to model a robot arm made of two'
  persid: ''
- desc: cylinders.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Describe three features of frame

    buffer objects used to create'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this image from render, FB, dot,

    HTML and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve made this is a little

    bit more complicated version of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the triangle on the gray

    background on the blue Square. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''ve made two intersecting

    triangles. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so with the frame buffer, I can

    do off screen rendering, and I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can attach a Z buffer to the off

    screen rendering so I can have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The results of the Z the correct

    result of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the computation of the

    rendering so,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I can create the texture in

    an off screen buffer and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: use it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Use it to apply to the

    background and'
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's take a look at that. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the first vertex and fragment

    shader are creating the texture,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the second ones are

    using the texture and chair.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re creating an empty

    texture here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Allocate a new frame buffer

    object, bind, it and attach a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color buffer. So we''re going to

    use the texture as the color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer, and we''re going to add a

    depth buffer so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re going to we have two

    programs, create text, triangle'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture and use triangle texture

    so we create the texture by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using the program enabling depth

    test,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we do the geometry and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then We set the viewport clear

    color and set the colors so one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle is going to be red, the

    other one is going to be green.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And once we put that into the

    texture, we disconnect from our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'off screen frame buffer and

    reconnect to the one that''s from'
  persid: ''
- desc: the window system.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then we use, use the

    program, use triangle texture,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we draw the texture as

    normal here. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re generating a 16 by 16

    texture and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to Explain how the animated

    texture particle diffusion HTML'
  persid: ''
- desc: is done. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We didn''t talk about this too

    much, but the idea here is we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using two textures, and we''re

    using one as a source and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other as a destination, And

    we''re flipping them so we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing the diffusion and then the

    other one is drawing the new'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point, the new positions of the

    points. Does it look fun? More'
  persid: ''
- desc: fun than the other version. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there are a couple examples.

    I went, oh,'
  persid: ''
- desc: did I get through?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, that's it. Okay. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this a fun shaded cube with

    texture and'
  persid: ''
- desc: you see that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better now. This is a particle

    system,'
  persid: ''
- desc: deferred rendering so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this was mentioned as an

    application of the frame buffer,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Using frame buffers to do

    multiple passes of rendering and'
  persid: ''
- desc: what do you think about that.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re just doing depth of

    field, as you can Tell, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re using instance drawing

    here. I believe you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So blending with transparency

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: that's doing A similar I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ambient occlusion. That''s

    another example that was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mentioned for the multiple

    render passes in The textbook.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so in WebGL two we can make

    occlusion queries, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simplifying our model so we can

    exclude the parts that aren''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to be rendered. Here you

    get to see a little overview at'
  persid: ''
- desc: the bottom left. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I put a couple links in there

    for ray tracing and radiosity.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the old joke was i i guess

    it''s not, maybe an old joke, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the journey the high quality

    image takes a day or two. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the standard of the seven, the

    seven weeks per day or two, is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much bigger. A day or two is

    much different than standard'
  persid: ''
- desc: defense now. So
  persid: ''
- desc: as we get more power, we can
  persid: ''
- desc: do more things. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I was going to just highlight

    suggestions for the final exam'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions. I invite you to post

    them on this discussion, I had'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you write some for the quizzes

    last couple days, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I invite you to share them with
