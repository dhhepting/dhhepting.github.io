- desc: Good job.
  persid: ''
- desc: I How is everyone today?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyone watched the gray cup?

    Anyone pleased with The results'
  persid: ''
- desc: you
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: Here we are at meeting 18. You
  persid: ''
- desc: i so i anonymize
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cues backward to Victor and

    Sam and I pushed them through'
  persid: ''
- desc: our courses. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there was this disagreement

    that it was about the right'
  persid: ''
- desc: level of difficulty and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you can look at that And

    I''ve removed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the names associated with The

    comments. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's a question of what
  persid: ''
- desc: we can do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to make the final exam a fair

    assessment of your learning over'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the semester, so that it matches

    what we''ve done in class and'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: It's not too it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'challenging, but not too

    challenging,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And there is sufficient Time to

    Answer questions you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I say starting now, So I''d

    really like you to engage in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: idea of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create, taking part in the

    creation of an exam that is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fair assessment of your work

    this semester, and I say, please'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'consider suggesting Questions

    and Answers starting now doesn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mean you should guide your

    Horses during the class here and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'start typing away. But if that

    that works, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: wouldn't be too upset. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I will work out the example

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give you a few different ways to

    approach it and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so in that question and exam,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we wanted to move the center

    rotation to a point not at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: origin.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we wanted to, we
  persid: ''
- desc: in terms of code, we have, we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we Have a matrix, and then we''re

    going to multiply So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to specify

    translation to The new center.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we apply our rotation

    matrix and'
  persid: ''
- desc: does That make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: Is that a good way to get at
  persid: ''
- desc: the process of
  persid: ''
- desc: translating
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the this happens in a few cases

    where we want to do a rotation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of transformation from some

    point other than the origin, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translate from the origin to the

    new center. Apply the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation, then we

    translate center to the origin.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the first one here is

    specify. The first one specifies'
  persid: ''
- desc: the last applied. We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up so we''re doing the translated

    origin and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is x, F,
  persid: ''
- desc: is that still Okay? Do
  persid: ''
- desc: so I neglected
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a cut off date for the

    assignments after which you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wouldn''t get a late penalty, but

    after which you wouldn''t get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: Mark at All.
  persid: ''
- desc: So You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have our final exam On the

    ninth'
  persid: ''
- desc: so if you're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you''re struggling To get

    assignments in'
  persid: ''
- desc: on the due date, if
  persid: ''
- desc: It has to be In by The 10th And
  persid: ''
- desc: so there was a comment
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about clarifying what goes on

    with grow shading and Fauci'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s Take a minute to talk

    about where the calculations are'
  persid: ''
- desc: done for each of them and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, not everyone all at once.

    Vertex Can you repeat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that approach? Actually, it''s

    done in vertex shader and stuff'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the and stuff, yeah, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do we use normal vectors in Grow

    shading?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, we do,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but we use them all the end of

    vertices, so we''re COVID and'
  persid: ''
- desc: intensity. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re covering intensity at the

    vertex, So when we''re doing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: laying equation and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we perform the lighting

    calculations of the vertices,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then that gives us a vertex

    color, and we pass the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color to The fragment chair and

    output the fragment color the'
  persid: ''
- desc: fragment shader And interpolates
  persid: ''
- desc: that value
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to give us our image. So we

    calculate the intensity at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex, and then we interpolate

    the intensity the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader does the interpolation

    across The scan line.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So long, shading, really

    fragment shader and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so with grow
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shading, using the vertex

    shader, we''re interpolating the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intensity that we compute for

    the vertices, The faux shading'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the fragment shader. Does it

    interpolate intensities? Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: no,
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so with the font shading, we''re

    performing Lane calculations and'
  persid: ''
- desc: fragments and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so with long shading, we''re

    interpolating normal vectors,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and because we''re doing the

    lighting calculation at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'fragment level, then we can make

    a more accurate approximation in'
  persid: ''
- desc: our illumination equation,
  persid: ''
- desc: so we get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more realistic highlights,

    regular Highlights and'
  persid: ''
- desc: anything else?
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a question or comment

    about translucency and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that comes up In chapter eight,

    and we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: do alpha blending if
  persid: ''
- desc: and then two shaders and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I found a couple of old

    examples, but I haven''t had a'
  persid: ''
- desc: chance
  persid: ''
- desc: to put them into web or
  persid: ''
- desc: into example code.
  persid: ''
- desc: Forward of that, So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'oh, I would like to Just mention

    something About the midterm. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so to talk a bit about texture

    mapping,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so We have can map a texture in

    an image and it doesn''t have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be an image, a photograph. It

    can be a constructed image that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we create in our code.

    Environment. Mapping is another'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way to add cues about the space

    we''re in, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bump mapping is about modifying

    normal vectors to add detail'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that isn''t in the model. So

    We''re cheating A bit. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re getting extra detail

    for a little for a very good'
  persid: ''
- desc: price. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is from 2020, and the

    figures might be older than'
  persid: ''
- desc: that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone know
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how many millions of polygons or

    triangles per second for a'
  persid: ''
- desc: current graphics card,
  persid: ''
- desc: it's a lot,
  persid: ''
- desc: but we don't want to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we don''t want to spend all our

    polygons doing complicated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'models, or maybe physically

    accurate models of clouds and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'drain and skin that one doesn''t

    seem to belong in the list,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because If we want to in a game,

    we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those. Models aren''t aren''t the

    focus of our attention, but they'
  persid: ''
- desc: add realism and
  persid: ''
- desc: the ability to the setups.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: we do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture mapping to overcome to

    allow us to keep The polygons'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'low and still have realistic

    textures, realist,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'believable. Detail, I guess So,

    modeling In Orange and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a sphere that''s colored

    orange may be appropriate In'
  persid: ''
- desc: some cases, but it's
  persid: ''
- desc: too simple,
  persid: ''
- desc: and if we
  persid: ''
- desc: scan an Orange, a navel orange,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or a mandarin, Christmas orange,

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not spherical. You don''t see

    fruit at the grocery store.'
  persid: ''
- desc: That's sphere.
  persid: ''
- desc: But if we are, we don't
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to make the model, the

    geometry too complex to capture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all the features of the orange.

    Maybe there''s some happy medium'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between getting the basic shape

    and then adding details with'
  persid: ''
- desc: mapping.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take a picture of an orange and

    then map it onto the sphere and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. We can also do bump mapping,

    so putting the picture of an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'orange onto the Orange sphere is

    texture mapping'
  persid: ''
- desc: and changing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface characteristics is about

    now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have a geometric model on

    the left'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then a texture mapped

    version on the right. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then here''s an example with

    environment mapping.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the surface, the surface of

    the model is reflective, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s reflecting the environment

    that we specified for it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And here is a version of bump

    mapping,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can see
  persid: ''
- desc: the differences in the
  persid: ''
- desc: surface quality.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Here it looks a bit rough. Here

    it''s smoother and'
  persid: ''
- desc: it impressive or not.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re doing mapping at the

    end of the pipeline,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so after we've
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clipped the polygons out that

    aren''t going to be in the scene'
  persid: ''
- desc: and see you.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: we can either,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we want to go from The texture

    to the imp to the model we'
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's straightforward, but I
  persid: ''
- desc: we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a challenge to Get from our 2d

    texture to the 3d surface. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the different coordinate

    systems, so there''s parametric'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates that specify

    positions in our models, extra'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates, used to identify

    points in the image to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mapped, object or world

    coordinates, where the mapping'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'takes place, And window

    coordinates where the final'
  persid: ''
- desc: image is produced. The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is the parametric

    coordinates are are used'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to describe the object surface

    that''s going to have the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applied to it. Then we have

    texture coordinates s and t, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to map the texture

    coordinates to the parametric'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates on the surface.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then, as we get three find

    the points on the surface we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking to map to then we make

    the connection with the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates and sample texture

    At that point, and we get our'
  persid: ''
- desc: final image and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can think of x, y and z in

    terms of texture coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that it might be easier to do

    the other the other way. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a pixel, and we want to

    know which point on an object to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which point it corresponds on

    the object.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we specify s and t in terms

    of x, y and z. So me,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it might be easier to map to an

    intermediate object and then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then go from the cylinder to

    the surface. We''re interested in'
  persid: ''
- desc: texture mapping and
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we think about A sphere, we

    have an issue of how to not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so putting a square image onto

    the sphere is not going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: without problems.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you were giving a basketball

    or a volleyball or water polo'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ball as a Christmas gift and you

    want to wrap it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It might look good around the

    middle, But at the ends, it''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: problem. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so instead of doing a sphere, we

    can use a box.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So then it's a matter of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'putting square images on the

    different sides of the box and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when we go from our

    intermediate object to our final'
  persid: ''
- desc: One, we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to take care of the normals

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So here''s an example of

    accessing the texture and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Getting some aliasing problems
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we''re not sampling with

    high enough frequency to get The'
  persid: ''
- desc: blue stripes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So instead of point sampling. We

    can average the area, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: the slower we
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we think about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'where those dot samples are

    taken, if we average the area'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re not just taking one

    sample for the area That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'represented in the image and on

    the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If we look at all the values

    available there, you would'
  persid: ''
- desc: certainly catch some blue stripe
  persid: ''
- desc: here and here,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this one is pretty well

    centered, So it might not get'
  persid: ''
- desc: much blue at all. You
  persid: ''
- desc: so in Web GL
  persid: ''
- desc: 'steps to apply texture is for

    specified. Specify the texture.'
  persid: ''
- desc: You can generate an image
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or read one from a source file,

    and then we assign the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make it available, and we enable

    texturing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we need to assign texture

    coordinates to the vertices and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specify texture parameters,

    whether we''re going to wrap or'
  persid: ''
- desc: filter it and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is we go from the

    image at the bottom, bottom left'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the geometry of The top left,

    and then display this is the top'
  persid: ''
- desc: The top right.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here we''re taking an image

    and then mapping it on to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface that''s viewed in

    perspective and'
  persid: ''
- desc: it. So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think that''s pretty

    straightforward. So it''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'idea that we''re mapping the

    image on to the surface. So as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the surface changes, the viewing

    parameters change and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'perspective projection is

    applied, we get to see the image'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as if it''s pasted on to that

    surface.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have a geometry pipeline

    of vertices and texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'development pipeline with images

    that lead into the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: processor you
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can create A texture, image,

    indie.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the textbook as an example

    With a checkerboard image i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s an example where we''re

    taking a square texture and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mapping it onto a triangle. So

    then it''s a matter of specifying'
  persid: ''
- desc: the vertices
  persid: ''
- desc: in
  persid: ''
- desc: 'texture ordinance the triangle

    vertices. So we can see here'
  persid: ''
- desc: that A is mapped point 2.8,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'B is mapped, point 4.2, and C is

    point 8.4'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can
  persid: ''
- desc: manipulate
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the texture mapping that way.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this checkerboard pattern is

    a texture that''s applied I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing the rotation In

    our vertex shader, and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'getting the color and the

    texture coordinates And the'
  persid: ''
- desc: position as vertex attributes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re specifying, so GL

    position, that''s setting the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'position. And we don''t go

    further with that, but we set V'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color, a color, so Vertex Color

    is the attribute color that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ve read from our buffer. And

    V tech chord, V Tex cord is used'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assigned with the value from a

    tax cord. So the attribute that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ve specified the texture cord

    that we specified per vertex and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'V color in, V Tex cord in and

    out is our fragment color, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We have a uniform sampler for

    the texture map.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So fragment color is the vertex

    color multiplied By the texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s returned from that sound

    here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sounded like an alarm, and it''s

    very short lived and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to create the

    image and memory, and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'alternating black and white, and

    Here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re configuring the texture

    and we''re Pushing texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates
  persid: ''
- desc: with the quad so
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the texture coordinates are go

    from zero to one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and X and Y. Our s and t are

    zero to one and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the order is dependent on how

    they''re being pushed to our data'
  persid: ''
- desc: structure, the buffer and
  persid: ''
- desc: so I
  persid: ''
- desc: you can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see what happens is if you

    change the coordinates or the'
  persid: ''
- desc: mapping, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How does that sound? Does that

    make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions or concerns,

    applause,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so I'll do so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll have some examples discuss

    on Wednesday. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thank you very much for today

    and good rest of your life.'
