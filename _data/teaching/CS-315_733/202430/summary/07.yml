Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'welcome everybody to our seventh

    meeting of the semester'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and a Happy Wednesday. Seems

    like a quite a nice day outside,'
  persid: ''
- desc: isn't it last For a while you
  persid: ''
- desc: so Do child one through nine
  persid: ''
- desc: 'plus topics left from major

    challenges'
  persid: ''
- desc: to Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think I have the thing,

    everything set up properly'
  persid: ''
- desc: today, not like last day.
  persid: ''
- desc: Has anyone noticed a useful
  persid: ''
- desc: 'page in the today page? Has

    anyone tried that for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'themselves? Okay? Are things

    laid out okay between your'
  persid: ''
- desc: courses and my website? Okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take your own attendance. So

    response to responses. So I had'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a request. I realized I didn''t

    publish this immediately from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last day, but this is the same

    comment I had from last day.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There was a question about

    extending the submission time'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for responses so it would be

    closer to the class time. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'idea is that I get a chance to

    look at them beforehand. I so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s why it''s noon the next

    day. So I haven''t been deducting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marks, and I won''t, I won''t

    revisit the ones that have been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'submitted already, but starting

    next week, I will be more I look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for a bit more detail than some

    more of a thoughtful response,'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and doesn''t have to be just the

    concept that we''re Dealing with.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Could be a question or something

    about which you''d like to learn'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more, no more. So it''s seven

    marks for the semester. So I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to ask you to be a little

    bit more engaged in that. Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that seem alright?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so my apologies, my

    apologies for not having a quiz'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for before today''s meeting. So

    commented with the critical'
  persid: ''
- desc: fusion frequency
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve linked a couple sources

    from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Wikipedia, which I think is a

    good place to start, but maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: not a good place to finish. When
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re looking for things on the

    web, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: it anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: So one thing to think about is
  persid: ''
- desc: the flicker frequency, the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frequency at which a flickering

    light appears to be static to'
  persid: ''
- desc: the average human observer.
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we use that definition, we

    might say between 60 and 90'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frames per second would be

    required.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how does it relate to the

    film and video I mentioned'
  persid: ''
- desc: yesterday? I
  persid: ''
- desc: So video
  persid: ''
- desc: is
  persid: ''
- desc: '30 frames per second or 29 North

    American video, where the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'broadcast standard is NTSC is

    just shy of 30 frames per'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second, but the way we get a

    higher refresh rate, as I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mentioned this before, we divide

    the frames into fields. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'even lines are one field and the

    odd lines are another field. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that gives us 60 fields per

    second. So it seems like early'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'updating of 30 frames per

    second, but we''re using a trick'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to add some give the impression

    of 60 frames per second, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then with film. And I didn''t

    mention this before, for so 24'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shot at 24 frames per second,

    but with a double bladed or a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triple bladed shutter, so we can

    flash the same image, same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'frame, two or three times. So it

    gives the appearance of 48 or 72'
  persid: ''
- desc: frames per second.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So on the other side of things,

    if we''re lower than if we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more than 12 frames per second,

    I can be perceived as motion. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not necessarily smooth

    motion, but we get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: impression of motion.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So less than 12 we can perceive

    individual images. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so generally, the faster the

    better, I guess.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So when we see
  persid: ''
- desc: both fields and frames and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a few years ago, talked about

    1080 as A resolution, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: say 1080 i or 1080 he.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you know what those with the

    IEP referred to? Yeah, this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: interlaced and this is
  persid: ''
- desc: and this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'progressive. Anyway, so it''s a

    bit more information about'
  persid: ''
- desc: what we need to get
  persid: ''
- desc: sense of motion,
  persid: ''
- desc: any questions or comments? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we had some questions

    About asylum one. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the short answer to Can I

    choose, can you choose your own'
  persid: ''
- desc: colors
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is yes, and think about how the

    colors convey some meaning about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the structure of The of The

    gasket I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we have
  persid: ''
- desc: An array of nine colors.
  persid: ''
- desc: I won't say what They are. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So, 012345678,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''ve saved one act anyway,

    I could have done the dot, dot,'
  persid: ''
- desc: dot a bit sooner.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we have an array of

    nine colors. How can we use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation, the last two

    transformations for the last two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subdivisions or vertices, chosen

    depending on how you describe it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in your code. How can we use

    that information to come up with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in come up with indices into the

    color array? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense the

    question,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or if you have nine, so is the

    nine colors clear enough that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re using that we''re going to

    use nine colors because we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three transformations times

    three transformations, three'
  persid: ''
- desc: times three is nine.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, we're Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: so how likely it pick colors?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is talk about some ideas

    here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do my samples make sense? Let me

    look at let me show those'
  persid: ''
- desc: samples again. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so the subdivision one is

    similar same colors i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Who doesn''t want to talk in a

    computer science class? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we have, let''s say, a

    number between the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I don''t want to do the

    assignment in class, but I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: want To leave you hung up
  persid: ''
- desc: with a D thing. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's say I
  persid: ''
- desc: so We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have three transformations. How

    might we number them?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Say for the last transformation,

    we''re going to assign a number'
  persid: ''
- desc: we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would three be a Number we use

    for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'described transformation, or

    four I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we could use one, two and

    three, and we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do the same second

    transformation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'second to last transformation,

    one, two and three,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how do we convert that into

    an index into the array, or a'
  persid: ''
- desc: it. Okay, so let's say we
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's Call this say L
  persid: ''
- desc: and 2l to
  persid: ''
- desc: So instead of think of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a nice reach, each transfer, we

    can think of three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformations. So we''re

    dealing with base three numbers.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can put in L plus and then

    three times 2l.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we choose, if we have one,

    is a transformation for both of'
  persid: ''
- desc: them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I, so our first color used is

    from position four and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then, if we say transformation

    three,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we use three for both of

    them,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three times Three plus plus

    three is nine plus three equals'
  persid: ''
- desc: '12.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''ll give us some

    undefined value and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what if we think about binary

    digits? Do we start with one?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Binary digits or bits have value

    zero or one, and we start with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero because, well, because

    there''s two values per bit, so a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit can be either off or zero or

    one, it''s on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we start with zero when we''re

    dealing with arrays, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because zero is the first

    position in the array, is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'star of the array with No

    offset.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Am I telling you new things or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re just not going to

    participate today.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? So if we use 123,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re we''re not getting in this

    season the array. So what, how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could we change this? What

    numbers can we use to represent'
  persid: ''
- desc: the three transformations, 01,
  persid: ''
- desc: and two? Yeah. He.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then zero if we have zero

    here. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three times two plus two equals

    six plus two equals'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eight. So what choice do we have

    in country and indices for our'
  persid: ''
- desc: colors,
  persid: ''
- desc: so It can do
  persid: ''
- desc: three times 2l
  persid: ''
- desc: plus L or a,
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can flip them around.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any other possibilities? Any

    questions about that? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So another question is, Is it

    okay if all the subdivided'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles are different random

    colors or different selections'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of of of the nine colors we have

    in our table. Has anyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: looked at gasket tube and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tried to color it and make sense

    of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: structure there. So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the hint about the

    subdivision coloring the'
  persid: ''
- desc: look at how so
  persid: ''
- desc: so what do we Want to have?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we start with the triangle,

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''d like to call it again

    with three triangles.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Just imagine that''s the same

    size. Let me try again. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and each time we divide this

    again, let''s say we take the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first prime, the first

    subdivided, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so you want,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we want to pass the triangles.

    I''m going to pass. Make sure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re passing the little

    triangles as we recurse on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subdivision. Does that make

    sense? Okay, I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the midpoint perturbation

    stuff is only About who deals'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the curses of the vision

    only.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the idea is, you find the

    midpoint and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we move it a bit, not a

    whole lot.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not too bad, but something

    closer, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re passing that point to

    this triangle, and this'
  persid: ''
- desc: triangle,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the top of one triangle is

    kind of to the base of the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: one.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? Okay, I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any other questions or comments

    do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to talk about some

    other things in chapter three.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So about window resize events in

    particular, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is so it''s in the text, but

    it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also on the Mozilla, Mozilla

    developer network. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so There's some examples here. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, resize the browser window.

    Let''s try that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for drawing up, if we have a

    canvas in the window, then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can make sure that we''re

    resizing it to be if we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: square canvas
  persid: ''
- desc: or other shape,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then We can adjust it to fit in

    the window.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? It.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There''s also the touch

    interface, touch events. So if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have a touch screen, we can

    have our where we''re touching'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the screen with our finger or a

    stylus or other input device'
  persid: ''
- desc: like that you
  persid: ''
- desc: How this isn't gonna help us,
  persid: ''
- desc: since this isn't a touch screen
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyway, you can run this on you

    can access this on your phones'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or tablets. And so it gives us

    another option for creating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'events or interacting with a

    system you'
  persid: ''
- desc: I didn't get something else in
  persid: ''
- desc: here. I wanted to
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, that's all right. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Picking you want to interact

    with the models displayed On the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen, to select some part of

    it i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It seemed easier, hard to do. I

    gave a hint to My feeling on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that. I so It''s difficult

    because we can''t undo the things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we put together in the pipeline

    with the shaders and everything.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'If you think about the

    transformations being'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reversible, sense it can be the

    inverse operation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But what gets into the frame

    buffer is it''s hard'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to deal. It''s hard to interact

    with as we get Especially being'
  persid: ''
- desc: obligated to
  persid: ''
- desc: shading projections,
  persid: ''
- desc: etc. And so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m it''s mentioned here in the

    chapter about interaction'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because it''s important way to

    interact with it''s important'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interaction capability for

    computer graphics. So a way we'
  persid: ''
- desc: can Do this in web channel.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Secondary, draw something wall.

    So instead of ones being colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between vertices, we can have

    not a solid color face. Let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'think about a cube. So if we

    color, if we predict the colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the vertices, then we''re

    going to be integrated on each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'face. So we can redraw the cube,

    making each face a solid color,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then you can access the

    colors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You can select the point on the

    screen and where that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'selecting can be the color from

    the off screen, butter to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'determine the trace of that

    selected. So we''re going to deal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with that when we talk about

    frame buffers in a later'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chapter. But I wanted to

    highlight it here as an'
  persid: ''
- desc: interaction technique we're
  persid: ''
- desc: So then they also talk about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'building model on the screen

    interactively. So here''s this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CAD one, the CAD one program

    from the text to start with'
  persid: ''
- desc: black.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can add polygons by

    specifying one corner or one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pardon me, rectangles, but with

    one corner'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the other corner, and then

    we can select different colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we could keep doing that. I''m

    not sure where the limit is set'
  persid: ''
- desc: to be. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so can you see where the mouse

    is and where I''m clicking?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I so it's,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s an issue here about

    getting most point amongst'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinates.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's the code is designed to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'work when the when the window is

    in the top left corner, so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'works like we''d expect it to

    work, but if I scroll it down a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little bit, and I''m going to try

    and match this red rectangle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It has an account for the

    difference in position of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: window. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Let''s look at the source code

    here. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we have number of

    positions, the maximum. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re setting the number of

    position, max number positions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as three times the maximum

    triangles. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to store three or

    600 positions at most,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and because we have, I
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, yeah, here it is, okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So eight times max number of

    positions. So what does that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give us? So why is it eight

    Times max number of positions? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re in 2d so we have x and

    y values for each position, two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'times eight, or pardon me, two

    times four is eight. So a float'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is four bytes, and two of them

    in eight bytes. So that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s why we''re allocating out

    of space. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so that gives us a vertex

    buffer, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: then we're going and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to connect the a position.

    So let''s look at the shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: Next. I should do
  persid: ''
- desc: this differently. You.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the vertex shader is just

    taking is drawing the position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that we get from the a position

    attribute variable, and taking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this vertex color, the attribute

    color, and In the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader, we''re just coloring

    based on The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fragment color is assigned

    from vertex color we'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, maximum position,
  persid: ''
- desc: so why Is it 16
  persid: ''
- desc: times
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maximum positions for the color

    buffer, i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i, so Have four vertices for our

    rectangles, and we want To store'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the same color and for each

    vertex, We'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we need
  persid: ''
- desc: More time As far as
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so next piece in this Code

    is'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we get the menu so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s the menu. So do black,

    red, yellow, screen, blue, cyan,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'magenta, green, blue, magenta,

    cyan. Pardon me. You.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so mouse down, then we have

    we''re working with the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: buffer and
  persid: ''
- desc: so we get
  persid: ''
- desc: the two points From
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re getting the four vertices

    for the rectangle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we get t zero and t2 and then

    we make t1 and t3 by flipping'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the input already. So that''s how

    we get we''re the'
  persid: ''
- desc: rectangle, so we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now get these points and then

    input'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the so let''s imagine that''s

    rectangle, so you input two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'corners, and then you get the

    other two by flipping them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'around. So then we''re putting

    that data into the ray buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: for the vertices.
  persid: ''
- desc: And I shouldn't
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just point at my screen. I

    should use the mouse. So here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re doing the I we''re

    inputting the value so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ve just created into the into

    the vertex buffer, so we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'space for 200 points so logs, we

    don''t exceed that, we''ll be'
  persid: ''
- desc: fine.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we do, we loop through each

    of these four vertices and put'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the data from that vertex and
  persid: ''
- desc: and then with the colors.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re getting the same color

    into four different places in'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into the color buffer, and then

    we render. And for rendering, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draw the triangle. Try the

    triangle fan.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we go up
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from zero to the number of

    indices we have stepping by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four. So each four positions

    gives us a new triangle fan that'
  persid: ''
- desc: represents a rectangle.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: CAD program,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which doesn''t seem to be

    working, supposed to Drop'
  persid: ''
- desc: polygons.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There''s an interface design

    issue for you. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so let''s look At this One

    you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we keep we''re using

    polygons to keep track of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'number of distinct polygons we

    have, and then we''re drawing,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we''re rendering it, we''re

    drawing each of those polygons'
  persid: ''
- desc: as a triangle fan. And
  persid: ''
- desc: we give the start index of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the triangle fan in the in

    the above and the positions, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we look up for how many

    triangles To draw in that fan.'
  persid: ''
- desc: How does that seem? I it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we try and draw an

    hourglass with this, we''re not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to be successful. That''s

    what I''ve tried to do at least'
  persid: ''
- desc: these two if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so question to think about is,

    how do we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: more more involved shapes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Is it going to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what do we have to do to be able

    to create more involved shapes?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: that was even very musical.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, let''s look at these and

    these other pieces of code'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at the rotating square already.

    Let''s try to rotate square'
  persid: ''
- desc: three. Here we have a slide in.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It so I can change direction,

    but I can''t change the speed'
  persid: ''
- desc: anymore, unless I'm doing
  persid: ''
- desc: now it's working,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but still it doesn''t update this

    slider. So that would be a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exercise to think about, how do

    we keep all the interaction mode'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the different input modes in

    sync here for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here. We''re just imprinting

    points. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here we''re putting a pledge more

    points and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then it goes away, because

    we have more points than we know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what to do within the program.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions? So there is a

    question mark. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's try once more.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A so question about how to

    update the sliders so we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'input to be reflected over the

    different devices. So for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'changing speed, one way should

    be reflected'
  persid: ''
- desc: in all the different
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other ways we have to control

    the speed.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And then the mouse input,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because if we move this out of

    the corner, we''re not going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get the proper coordinates. So

    how do we deal with the window?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The canvases that aren''t that

    appear anywhere in the window?'
  persid: ''
- desc: You
  persid: ''
- desc: here we're generating. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a triangle, a triangle strip, I

    believe, and we''re coloring'
  persid: ''
- desc: based on the different vertices.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any anyway, we''re out of time

    now.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any questions or concerns about

    the assignment'
  persid: ''
- desc: before we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have office hour tomorrow as

    well? Description?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, sign up page that
  persid: ''
- desc: description boxes. Is that for
  persid: ''
- desc: us? Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the calculator just shows you

    how the marker is going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'evaluating it. So you''ll get

    comments that are generated by'
  persid: ''
- desc: that calculator. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks for doing.
  persid: ''
- desc: Have a good weekend.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thanks.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I go to office hours

    tomorrow, and I''ll be around if'
  persid: ''
- desc: you have questions for me,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and be reachable if you have

    questions'
