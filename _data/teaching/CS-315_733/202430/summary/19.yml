- desc: Hello!
  persid: S01
- desc: How are you dealing with the snow? It seems very wet hard to shovel. Sorry
    for the short notice about this, but I thought it better to be on the safe side,
    so I don't get anyone else sick. And then the roads aren't great, either, I hear.
    So so if you hear the doorbell again. That's just people coming in, so not to
    worry about it. So I missed the quiz before today's meeting, so I'll add an extra
    question or 2 to the next quiz before Monday's meeting. Did the announcement work?
    Okay to alert you to the Zoom Meeting today?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, but it was a little late.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yeah, I apologize for that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, it's fine. Thank you, though, for the announcement.
  persid: S01
- desc: So I've added some more detail on some sample code, 2 assignments, 3 and 4.
    Any questions about those. Okay? So I want, oh. I wanna go back to the can. You
    see the screen? Is that sharing properly.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S02
- desc: Thanks. So this example I've made by taking the shaded cube code and adding
    texture, 4, yeah. So we have 2 textures on the shaded cube. So I don't have this
    posted yet because I wanted to edit it. And I will share some. I will share the
    code with some interface. some interactive elements to select things. Okay. So
    here we have the cube rotating. So we get can see a bit of the highlights from
    the shading. And it's I realize the doorbell rings after somebody's been admitted.
    which is strange. Okay. so I'm opening the editor. Let me share that with you.
    So I've change the texture coordinates a bit. So it goes from point one to point
    2 instead of 0 0, and instead of 1 1 it goes to point 8.9. Let me change those
    back. So I'm glad you can't hear the doorbell. Okay? So I've changed texture texture
    coordinates there. So here it's back. So we see the whole texture on the face
    of the cube. So we're not. We don't necessarily one to distort the texture in
    the mapping process, but we can adjust the coordinates so we can see the effect
    of the texture coordinates with the texture mapping. Oh, the other thing. There
    are 2 textures defined in texture. Cube 4, a checkerboard, and the sign. So I've
    applied texture one twice. So here's the checkerboard. Okay? What are? Let's change
    the texture coordinates again, or the checkerboard any suggestions for values?
    What do you expect if we change this to minus one minus point 1, let's change
    this to point 9 and point 9 any other suggestions. Oh, did I switch to that? Okay,
    let's do one more change there. Okay, so that's that's the values for that's what
    happens with these texture coordinates. Well, let's just make one more change
    there, and let's switch back to. So this was caused because I put instead of 0.
    I put point 9. So now there just should be just smaller, smaller region. But equally
    okay. Here, let me share this screen. So I had put mine at point 9 instead of
    a 0. So that's that's the effect of that. But now let's see what I've so they're
    instead of 0. 0. They're point 1. They're point one smaller than the original
    coordinates. So let's see what happens there. So let's look at the code again.
    Here. see the effect of I think it's here. No, sorry I'm not keeping up switches.
    Very well here. so we have a repeat there, let's change that to clap to edge.
    So what I was doing is changing the wrapping method in. I will document this a
    little bit better. And the example that I'm going to post to the code directory.
    Okay. does that make sense? So what if we wanted to make the gold parts reflective
    and the black part's matte? So let me go back to the code here. And so that's
    with both textures applied with those the same coordinates. So we could have different
    coordinates. And the question was, How do we make this code. How can we get a
    a sharper highlight on the gold pieces instead of the black pieces? Any ideas
    or questions about that typing into the chat is just fine. So what is the shaded
    cube code doing? So we're doing the lighting calculation and vertex shader. So
    this is grow shading right? We're getting the intensity. Sorry I didn't switch
    again. So we're calculating the intensity at the vertex. And then we're interpolating
    the intensities across. So then we're we're accessing the color. We're accessing
    the textures and multiplying by the vertex color that's determined in the vertex
    shader. And they're passing that assign that to a fragment color a bit. And so
    we're not doing anything with the and with the lighting calculations in the fragment
    Shader, we're applying the texture, and that's it, or multiplying the vertex color
    with the the texture, sample, sample of the texture textures. Pardon me, there's
    2 of them. So what would happen if we used fong shading instead. So if we're doing
    fong shading, the the lighting calculation is in the fragment shader, right? So
    if we sample the texture in the fragment shader, and we're doing the lighting
    calculation there. We could have have the texture impact the shininess. Does that
    make sense? So I have this one other example. This is from the web fundamental
    web Webgl, 2 fundamentals. I don't think these links work. So they have different
    maps of the planet Earth. So he, this is part of the question. He talks about
    his code. So then it's hard to see if that's rotating or not, anyway. So this
    is the fong shader. And so that's computing inside the fragment shader. And then
    you apply the the specular map so you can modulate the the surface based on this,
    the map that we apply here, let's open in a separate window. Oh, I'm not sharing
    with you, am I? It's been a while since I've done this. So here's the Fong shader.
    And then we add, we sampled the specular map to to change the the reflectivity
    of the surface, the specular highlights that we see. Okay. So in the and the vertex
    shader. We're getting the position made. Position of the points transformed by
    the model of you. Matrix one of you. Well, so the vertex position is the the model
    matrix times a position. and the vertex normal is normalizing the. So we get normals
    for the surface. And then the texture coordinates are passed along as well. So
    here we can see the specular factor assignment here. So we're sampling the specular
    map. So we pass that as a uniform sampler. 2D. The specular map. So you determine
    the specular factor by applying the texture, applying the specular map as a texture
    with the vertex coordinates. So we're getting the radius. So the specular is then
    light spec like light, specular times, specular factor, times. the shininess,
    coefficient expression with the with the shininess. Oh, not shyness, anyway. And
    then we're passing out the fragment color there. So here's an example with, I
    think this is the sun in the earth. They're not all the same size, I think. Think
    the scale is off, if I remember from what I read about the question. So here we
    have a surface color sampler, a bump map sampler and a specular map sampler. So
    has anyone looked at these codes like samples from Webgl. 2 fundamentals you can't
    type today. Maybe I can't type anymore. Anyway. my eyes are watering. It wasn't
    supposed to be, anyway. So the question is, have you used web fundamentals? Web
    gl 2 fundamentalist code. So I will take on creating an example that's in the
    style that we've used from the set textbook examples because they're using a library
    here to do a lot of things that makes it a little less clear what's going on this
    TWGL. I used to remember I used to know the name that stood for a tiny webgl helper
    library. There's the page for the library. So it's I know in the lab examples.
    Alex is doing things a little differently. and what the textbook is doing, and
    the and there are a lot of good examples in Webgl, 2 fundamentals. But they're
    not in maybe easily convertible to are familiar organization of the programs.
    So I would say, try and take away the the concepts rather than the code per se.
    Does that make sense. So those of you who have looked at the code from Webgl,
    2 fundamentals. what's your been your experience? Is it easy to work with, easy
    to get what you need from it any questions or comments. so shall we adjourn for
    today? Do I have a motion from the floor? Sorry if it's if there aren't any questions
    or comments, shall we say. should we end end today's meeting? And I wish you a
    good weekend. and we'll see you on Monday. I hope in person I'll be in better
    shape and send me email if you need it. If you have any questions or concerns
    about stuff that comes up in the class. Okay. thanks. Take care. Everyone bye.
