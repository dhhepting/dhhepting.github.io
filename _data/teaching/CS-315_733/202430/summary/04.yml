- desc: 'How''s that for sound

    good? Okay, I I'
  persid: ''
- desc: better get The screen up here. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, here We are meeting for

    you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so we''re going to look at

    a graph that''s programming in'
  persid: ''
- desc: more detail today. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so first of all, happy Monday,

    there''s a link there for you to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'take attendance. You can check

    the past calendar for today and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see the upcoming events. I

    wanted to just comment about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'responses to responses on

    meeting two, as I made a more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'detailed discussion here, where

    there are questions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: difficulties.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you might want to take a peek at

    that if you have some questions,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and if you have questions about

    stuff is going on in class, if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re comfortable ask them in

    class. If you''re not comfortable'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'asking them in class, send me an

    email or post to the class'
  persid: ''
- desc: discussion forum you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, let''s see where did that

    go? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have class discussions

    here under the general area of'
  persid: ''
- desc: your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I have office hours, 1030 to

    noon, Tuesdays and Thursdays.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let me know if you have

    problems getting in touch with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me. Oh, I''ll try to be on Zoom

    during my office hours as well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that seem okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so part of the answers to

    reviewing the comments I made in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'response to a question, I

    suggested a video that I made'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with a presentation by a friend

    of mine from SFU his career in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'games and film. So that''s the

    video here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Computer Science alumni and

    Friends and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so What was missing? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we talked about having A

    model, texture or material'
  persid: ''
- desc: laying and viewing and
  persid: ''
- desc: So when the queue
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What if We don''t want To See

    through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are two sides of the

    same coin,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'visible surface determination

    and hidden surface removal.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there are different ways we

    can approach it. If we have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'complicated shape, a complicated

    model, then it might be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'worthwhile to remove from

    processing the side the pieces'
  persid: ''
- desc: that aren't going to be visible.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But we can also draw everything

    into the frame buffer and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just show the stuff that''s

    closest to the Camera.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Has anyone heard of A Z buffer

    before so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t Want to confuse that

    with Zed butter.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve been watching master chef

    with my wife, and sometimes in a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'compound butter. So maybe that

    would be Zed butter. Could'
  persid: ''
- desc: be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the next greatest thing, perhaps

    anyway, said buffer keep track'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of distances. So really drawing

    the closest thing. We''ll talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: about that more later on. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we want to remove hidden,

    hidden surfaces, what are,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what''s some intuition about how

    we might do that, like Castle'
  persid: ''
- desc: rays on
  persid: ''
- desc: the camera, if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it hits the surface before it

    touches the surface that you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying to reach, then it''s

    behind something else. Make'
  persid: ''
- desc: sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. I
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s a bit more like Zed

    buffer. I think I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so we''d like to simplify the

    model before we do processing.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So thanks for your comment.
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's look at the cube again. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so what information can we
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's say we're looking at I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re looking From here, and

    we see the cube. What I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What can we say about this

    surface so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the surfaces can have normal

    vectors, and if the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I realize I''m not going to be

    able To see this side from Where'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm viewing position I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll leave it there For now, But

    Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I So this is a comment. Let''s

    start by looking at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment one. So this is a

    common for people in 733 to take'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a look at the lab the

    instructions For lab one,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'setting up the Common folder,

    etc. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: a little
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bit so there are some bug fixes

    there and some good information'
  persid: ''
- desc: in the lab. Notes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'CS, 315, students. Do you agree

    that the lab I'
  persid: ''
- desc: the lab is good.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so there are two versions

    of the code, the jarpinski'
  persid: ''
- desc: gasket. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Has anyone ever heard of Benoit

    Mandelbrot?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I He's the
  persid: ''
- desc: father of fractal geometry.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a couple things here.

    So now, with UTF eight encoding'
  persid: ''
- desc: for your web pages,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can put the accent on the

    end like should be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sipinski was a Polish

    mathematician. So if you hold'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'down the anarchy, you''ll see a

    bunch of options.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t forget to spell things

    properly with the proper'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accents. Now that you have the

    available ability to do it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The Mammoth road called it the

    gasket as a joke. Do you know'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what? Well, here we have Mr.

    Pinsky gasket. He'
  persid: ''
- desc: so what's the gasket use for
  persid: ''
- desc: seal things? And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I wouldn''t be a very good

    protection. Or wouldn''t seal'
  persid: ''
- desc: much here.
  persid: ''
- desc: This one looks a bit better. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s a it''s a fractal, and we

    can construct from an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equilateral triangle, and we

    subdivide the triangle into'
  persid: ''
- desc: three, well,
  persid: ''
- desc: four pieces.
  persid: ''
- desc: But we don't. I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we add let''s not add another

    transformation, but if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accounted for the space in the

    middle, we could generate a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle in you. An inefficient

    way'
  persid: ''
- desc: we can keep going to Do this.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you see how we're getting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shape. So the first one, the

    gasket one, is using something'
  persid: ''
- desc: called The Chaos gain and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can generate the shape

    starting From a point anywhere'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we Want To I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we just keep applying

    transformations At random till'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we get enough points. What are

    enough points? You'
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe more than that. I'll
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let you think about that. We can

    talk about it if we have some'
  persid: ''
- desc: questions.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let''s say this is

    transformation. One, it shrinks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by a half and centered there. T2

    shrinks by a half and centered'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here, and t3 shrinks by half and

    centered There,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s our starting point. Which

    transformation should we apply?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pick an arm between one and 311,

    okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let''s, let''s just mark our

    transformations here'
  persid: ''
- desc: so We scale by half and
  persid: ''
- desc: next
  persid: ''
- desc: to two i
  persid: ''
- desc: Next,
  persid: ''
- desc: another 2k and
  persid: ''
- desc: should We do a three and
  persid: ''
- desc: then One and then a one and
  persid: ''
- desc: so drive this code.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s in the textbook and it''s

    linked to'
  persid: ''
- desc: watch how it the shame takes.
  persid: ''
- desc: The shape takes shame and
  persid: ''
- desc: does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes or no. Okay, let''s take a

    look at the code for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here is that UTF eight

    specification,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so everything we''re going to do

    require shaders, so we don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a default shader we''re

    going to going to start with a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simple one, perhaps, and make it

    more complex As we go through'
  persid: ''
- desc: the semester.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the fragment shader here,

    we''re specifying the color red,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we assign that to F color,

    for fragment color, And then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertex shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We have a point size set, and

    then we''re also'
  persid: ''
- desc: sending GL position. So that's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the that specifying coordinates

    where we''re going to draw the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point. So we get GL position

    from a position which is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'variable that we connect in the

    JavaScript and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's see.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re going to generate 5000

    points for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this onload is going to tell us

    when we''re ready to start our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'code so we don''t start executing

    before things are available.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s also a bit dated in this

    example, so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the code might be from 2020, or

    earlier. Anyway, you can tell'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not the latest version of

    JavaScript. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re getting the canvas,

    creating the context. If we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can''t get the context, then we

    throw an error and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we say vertices minus one

    minus 101, And one minus One I.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Know That's wrong Because
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in 2d We''re concerned with

    this. We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so anything that''s inside this

    window be drawn. Anything'
  persid: ''
- desc: outside will be not drawn. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when we get and in 3d we''d

    extend it to minus one and plus'
  persid: ''
- desc: one in z, we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can see here the shapes

    are drawn so they''re touching'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the edge and the Left and the

    top. If we had a different'
  persid: ''
- desc: background color, we could see
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the right is touching the

    shape The Edge as well. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we specify the vertices, then

    we add the vertices,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the comment about the point

    must lie inside Any set of three'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertices.
  persid: ''
- desc: Is misleading. I think I
  persid: ''
- desc: So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re adding that first

    position to our array of points,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then We''re doing selection

    of the transformation at random.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So math dot, four three times.

    Math dot random gives us a'
  persid: ''
- desc: number between zero and two,
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we add the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now. So we apply, in fact, as we

    apply this transformation at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that vertex J and B and then we

    add The point to the positions'
  persid: ''
- desc: array.
  persid: ''
- desc: So when we configure web, GL,
  persid: ''
- desc: I Think we
  persid: ''
- desc: have 512, ask.
  persid: ''
- desc: I Want,
  persid: ''
- desc: so the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'space minus one, one minus one,

    minus one to plus one plus one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is mapped onto this area on the

    display.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we create the buffer, bind

    the buffer and and'
  persid: ''
- desc: then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we transfer the data from our

    JavaScript array, and that''s why'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have flattened to remove the

    extra stuff that''s in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: JavaScript array. And and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we say it''s going to be

    used for static drawing. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then the last bit, get that

    duplication a position. So this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is going to associate the

    positions that you just put into'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the buffer with the name a

    position so we can access it in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shader, the vertex shader,

    if you remember that line, I so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the first one is a position

    block. So we''re going to get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'location for the attribute, a

    position, and then we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: to make a pointer.
  persid: ''
- desc: Was position locked,
  persid: ''
- desc: it's going to be
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two bytes or two elements under

    each GL float, so two elements'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of Four ways, each store

    coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the render function. We

    clear the color bit where we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clear the buffer according to

    the color we''ve set. And then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draw a raise so we''re going to

    draw points,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we''re going to start at

    zero, and we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to positions on length. So the

    number of positions we''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: created, which is 5000
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? So
  persid: ''
- desc: if you try, I might you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could try different ways to see

    the planes fill in one by one in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the gasket, line, dots, dot,

    HTML or JS example. So barnacle'
  persid: ''
- desc: described it as a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hitting the ball thrown in to

    the soccer field, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'skilled players will pass

    between themselves,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then you get some fancy

    gasket shape.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So really, after we''re finding

    these'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformations and the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ball gets arbitrarily close to

    the shape we''re trying to'
  persid: ''
- desc: approximate to.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I want to go through his slides

    a little bit.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So amongst the things of that

    response to responses on for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting two is the location of

    the'
  persid: ''
- desc: slides from the textbook. Do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any questions about what we''ve

    talked about already.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So gasket one deals with points

    and gasket two deals with'
  persid: ''
- desc: triangles. I
  persid: ''
- desc: So this gives us a little bit of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an idea how things are working.

    We''re using the GPU rather than'
  persid: ''
- desc: the CPU. GPU.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s controlled through programs

    called shaders. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have the vertex and the

    fragment shader,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s where the action happens,

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: then we see the
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't want to switch back.
  persid: ''
- desc: There's GL use program, which is
  persid: ''
- desc: called in the JavaScript to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Make use of the shaders to

    create the graphics I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'array. So we''re working with

    contain mode graphics and put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all the vertices into an array

    and send the array to the GPU to'
  persid: ''
- desc: be rendered.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we're storing the array on
  persid: ''
- desc: the GPU, so we don't have to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'keep incurring the cost of

    sending it from the CPU to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: GPU.
  persid: ''
- desc: And GP, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'GL 3.1, WebGL is based on

    OpenGL, 3.3 point zero. Es and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the embedded systems, we

    don''t have a lot of state'
  persid: ''
- desc: information. We
  persid: ''
- desc: let me see if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that''s the Code he''s talking

    about as an example.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So these are very

    straightforward.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Just pass through to here. It''s

    not even getting color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specified. It''s just sending a

    solid color, in this case,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'white, and we''re passing getting

    the position from the JavaScript'
  persid: ''
- desc: the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we make the vertices clear.

    The background is black. We do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the init shaders, and then we

    the init shaders in is a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function in his common

    directory, and then We do a GL'
  persid: ''
- desc: use program with the result so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we pass those four vertices,

    set up a position For those four'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertices,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then You draw a Triangle fan

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so We have minus 1n
  persid: ''
- desc: minus Five, I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so A triangle fan takes the

    first point as the center, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then next two points makes one

    triangle, and then with the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two points and makes another

    one. So that''s a simple, simple'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way we can make it more

    efficient.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There are a number of ways to

    interpret the data in The buffer'
  persid: ''
- desc: So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is why you don''t deal with

    PowerPoint a lot, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: if they're helpful,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for reference, then we can Get

    some guiding out of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have a few examples of a

    complete first program, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'square in gasket one and gasket

    two. So the viewing is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'simplified, because we''re going

    to be dealing with that minus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one, minus one, minus one to

    plus one plus one area and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the five steps describe The

    page in HTML,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we''re going to include

    the shader code there. It''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the only way that we can do it,

    but it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: it works for us,
  persid: ''
- desc: so we don't
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tinker with that. So we specify

    the canvas and the other HTML'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'elements that we''re going to

    access the JavaScript through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the DOM and we''re going to load

    specify the necessary files and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'JavaScript common libraries, MV

    new.js and so on. Then define'
  persid: ''
- desc: shaders in the HTML file and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to use script

    tags to do that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then the JavaScript file, we''re

    going to compute or specify'
  persid: ''
- desc: data,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'send it to the GPU. That''s what

    the Create buffers and so on.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then we render the data also

    in the JavaScript file.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So these are just doing the pass

    through.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re we''re passing the

    position'
  persid: ''
- desc: setting, the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ver setting, the position

    variable that''s built in, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here we''re specifying the Color.

    The fragment color is going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: be white and
  persid: ''
- desc: I Think I've got
  persid: ''
- desc: 'separated both shaders are full

    programs do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the thing with WebGL two we

    have that version 300 BS to'
  persid: ''
- desc: specify
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what version we''re using, So

    things go smoothly. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s A picture of a triangle

    fan. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so there''s a difference between

    whether we do triangles,'
  persid: ''
