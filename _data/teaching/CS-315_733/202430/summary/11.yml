- desc: How's that i
  persid: ''
- desc: Happy Monday you
  persid: ''
- desc: This is 11, number, 23,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so suddenly realized There was

    no quiz. It occurred to me last'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'night that I had not done that

    on Friday. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the assignment who is posted? I

    posted that before break, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now I''ve actually linked it to

    you our courses. So if you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looking in your courses for it,

    you can click here on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: description.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Click here for the description,

    and it will take you to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: description of the assignment.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You so they''re both programming

    and non programming questions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There any questions about the

    questions? Yeah, pretty exactly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what it says. But like, how do

    you determine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the highest quality image

    without doing extra work. What'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exactly are you asking for

    there? I don''t know. I even'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'asked to say anything on the

    first question mark. Saw for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that. I thought I answered it

    well, but terrific, sure.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I didn''t repeat myself. Did I

    miss it? Does have that like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the bottom of the questions

    thereafter I'
  persid: ''
- desc: can be defined transformations.
  persid: ''
- desc: No, I said just not
  persid: ''
- desc: supposed to do. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So thanks for that. Heads up. I

    will'
  persid: ''
- desc: clean that up.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the intent of discussion

    about how to create a high'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quality image without doing

    extra work, is it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'supposed to be related to the

    gasket? Or was that just like'
  persid: ''
- desc: its own separate question?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, it was related to the

    gasket. So if we have a stream'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s defined against 512 by

    512 do if we have US'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates that go from minus

    one to one and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: we're dividing the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two into 512 we''re dividing two

    by 512 so the sample, each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample, is assigned that size of

    space. So if we make, if we'
  persid: ''
- desc: don't generate, so we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can say this whole space, what

    happens to it under'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformations?
  persid: ''
- desc: So we start out with
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two and then we shrink by one

    half and we apply Another'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation, which tricks it

    by a half.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So is this? So we're getting
  persid: ''
- desc: two to one quarter
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so on. So it''s was asking

    for a discussion about when we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could stop how many, how many

    levels of recursion do we need'
  persid: ''
- desc: to get the size where we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, so the sample relates To

    the resolution of the canvas,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and Then further random or chaos

    game i'
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, that's,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's more than 250,000 points.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s probably a little bit

    of overkill. We don''t need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'generate that many points to

    generate a high resolution'
  persid: ''
- desc: representation of the gasket and
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can estimate I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so 2500 is too Few, but it''s up

    discussion about how we might I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how we might decide what

    reasonable number. So the issue'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here, because it''s random, you

    don''t have the same idea of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'precision with the recur

    recursive subdivision. So it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s a simple algorithm to

    apply, but it''s frustrating'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because it''s random and it''s

    hard to get precision, precise'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answers about it. So anyway,

    that was the kind of discussion'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that I was thinking of. Does

    that make sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I wanted to talk about major

    scenes and'
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm viewing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'less. I also want to say, if you

    have some questions about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignment two programming we

    I''ll have a sound a bit of code'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to illustrate some of the ideas

    I''m Looking for, and we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: discuss that on Wednesday. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so I promised no more Matt on

    the board. So I did'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it with Blake tack. I didn''t

    plug in the cable. That''s why'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's not working. You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, you see that all right,

    should I zoom in a bit? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'i can see the cursor on the big

    monitor that isn''t connected to'
  persid: ''
- desc: my computer. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so 50th anniversary celebration,

    we tried to use the owl camera.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But do you know what that is?

    It''s it looks a bit like an owl.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It turns its head 360 degrees to

    track who''s speaking. Then I got'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two cursors on my laptop, and

    anyway, it was not so great.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sometimes less technology is

    better, I think. Anyway, so here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have matrix multiplication.

    So we''re going to deal with four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by four matrices, so I''ve laid

    them out here, and I''ve labeled'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the entries in column major

    format. So a, one A, one one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through a, one four is column

    one A, two, one through two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'four is column two, column

    three, column four and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplying The A times B will

    give a matrix C and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and where we do the

    multiplication is we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pick a row, not just pick A row,

    take the row correspondence. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a one, so c1, one, take row one

    from a in column b1,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let me say that again. So to

    compute the value at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: position c1, one,
  persid: ''
- desc: we take row
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one from matrix A, column one

    from matrix B, and we sum them,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a, one, One times b1, one A,

    two, one times b1, two, A, 231,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'times b1, three, a, four, one

    times b1, four. So here are the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation matrices around

    different axes and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have rotation around x, y

    and z. So here is our example'
  persid: ''
- desc: from the other day.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Rotate around x by 90 degrees,

    rotate around y by minus 90 and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotate around z by 90. So this

    is not too complicated, but it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to keep track of the ones and

    servers because because cosine'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of 90 is zero and sine of 90 is

    one, because It''s all in the y'
  persid: ''
- desc: component.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the first step was to combine

    and multiply these y and x'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrices together.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That gives this matrix. And then

    this is the rotation around z.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So multiply those two together,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you get now, that matrix, so

    there''s no zero columns that I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'came up with on the board way

    back when.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thanks to Corbin for pointing

    out my mistake.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So then I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did something a little

    different. Here we took the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point we came up with in class

    seven to five. So then I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m going to rotate about that

    point. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the first step is to

    translate that point to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'origin. So we write minus seven,

    minus two, minus five. That''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the translation matrix to bring

    our new point for the rotation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the origin, then we apply our

    rotation matrix, and then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translate back and it. So this

    on the right is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplication of these two

    matrices, and then we multiply'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it by the third one to translate

    it back. And then you get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: final matrix.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you notice that the rotation

    is still the same.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The upper three by three, the

    left upper three by three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'portion is the same, but the but

    the translations are different.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how can I check that I''ve

    gotten to write that I haven''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'made another mistake in my late

    tech I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m not talking about writing

    latex, just to be clear, does'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone use latex For document

    processing? Yeah, it''s quite'
  persid: ''
- desc: nice, I think I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we''re rotating about the

    point 725, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what Should that point map to

    under the transformation?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yes, I''m going to resist doing

    math on The board. Let''s try if'
  persid: ''
- desc: so okay. I sun, Okay, I'll
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stop trying to understand why I

    can''t see a curse on my laptop.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So, 7250,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'times, seven, zero times two,

    five times one and'
  persid: ''
- desc: And two times, one let
  persid: ''
- desc: me try that again.
  persid: ''
- desc: '00, five times one plus two

    times one. So the first entry is'
  persid: ''
- desc: zero is seven part of me,
  persid: ''
- desc: then we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero minus two, zero plus four.

    So that gives us plus two, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: then 700
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minus two. That gives us five,

    so 725, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a fixed point under that

    transformation. So wherever we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'center the rotation and scaling

    and cheer, that''ll be the fixed'
  persid: ''
- desc: point of The transformation you
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that seem okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the nice thing is that we can

    do everything by multiplying'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrices together And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sorry, I''m having the same

    problem. I did'
  persid: ''
- desc: the october 11 event and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when we''re Talking about

    viewing with the computer,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have to position the camera,

    select a lens for the camera,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'which means a projection matrix,

    and we need to set the view'
  persid: ''
- desc: volume for clipping.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that just means that
  persid: ''
- desc: we we
  persid: ''
- desc: we determine what's visible. We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the default projection is

    orthogonal, and that''s what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re using in our examples for

    2d and for early ones in 3d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we specify objects outside of

    the view volume, they''ll be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clipped out so we won''t see

    them.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can reposition the camera.

    It''s more it''s originally at z'
  persid: ''
- desc: equals zero.
  persid: ''
- desc: We can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'move it back so we can see More

    objects and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: we
  persid: ''
- desc: translate by some distance and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s the effect of the

    translation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we can move the Camera to

    any desired position by sequence'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of rotations and translations.

    So if we were in the side view,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we could rotate by 90 degrees

    and Then apply the translation'
  persid: ''
- desc: to move the camera
  persid: ''
- desc: away. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it says, Remember the last

    transformation specified is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: first to be applied. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that means so we''re

    Multiplying the matrices'
  persid: ''
- desc: together to get The
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: multiplying them.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So remember, we did a

    multiplication like this first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we could start with identity,

    and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'apply rotation matrix X, about

    X, rotation matrix For the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation about y, and then

    rotation about said.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So the way To do This Is The
  persid: ''
- desc: that makes sense. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we talked a little bit about the

    look at the look At function or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approach to specifying the

    counter position i,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the camera and a

    position that We look at.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We have a camera at a position

    that''s where I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'looks out of the scene, so that

    we need something to look at. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that gives us one dimension

    of the vehicle. Coordinates i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right? So what else do we need

    to specify our other two'
  persid: ''
- desc: dimensions, other two.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Other two vectors are coordinate

    basis you'
  persid: ''
- desc: the camera could be We
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a suspected orientation for

    the Camera. How could we do'
  persid: ''
- desc: that? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what if I''m taking a picture

    like this of'
  persid: ''
- desc: the landscape orientation,
  persid: ''
- desc: if I want to do I want To do a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'core object or something in

    between, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we need to pick a direction.

    Here you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we specify the view out right

    here, Like'
  persid: ''
- desc: and how can we Get
  persid: ''
- desc: the third axis and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when should the third axis be in

    relation to These two axes? Why'
  persid: ''
- desc: can
  persid: ''
- desc: that's take a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minute today. What property does

    the third axis have in relation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the other two that are here?

    Yeah. Does that make sense?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It so we can find a

    perpendicular vector by doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cross product of the vector

    from the eye point to the look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'point and the left vector does

    that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Makes sense? Maybe?
  persid: ''
- desc: So when we're doing
  persid: ''
- desc: by default, we give them
  persid: ''
- desc: 'orthogonal projections. So that

    means that the ones that are in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the view volume are clipping

    coordinates x and y are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'preserved, but the projected

    value of z is zero, because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s we''re removing the Z, the

    depth information.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is a matrix that we

    could use to do that. Notice'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that it''s the identity matrix

    less than one for z,'
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that force is said to be zero.

    So he makes a note. In practice,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you could use that any matrix of

    n, set z equal to zero,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'center of projection for a

    simple perspective projection,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the center is at the origin, and

    the projection plane is at z'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equal to D, with D greater d

    less than zero, because positive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'z is coming out of the screen in

    our right hand, fourth system.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So negative z will be into The

    screen, into our model and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So here we have a top and a

    side view. So this we''re looking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'down the y axis here, so we have

    x and z. So the point at x, said'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is going to be mapped to the

    point'
  persid: ''
- desc: XP, at distance d,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so looking down the x axis, you

    see that the y projected point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is going to be At that this is

    D. So we can calculate x, p is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'equal to x over z divided by d

    and y, p is y divided by z over'
  persid: ''
- desc: d and z p equals d and
  persid: ''
- desc: so the projection is,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have The one over d term in

    the bottom row the matrix. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: get,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we get that perspective division

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s the view volume for an

    orthogonal viewing. Specify the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'left, the right, at the bottom,

    The top and the near and far and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so then we can also, here''s an

    example with the Perspective'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'view volume. That''s a few

    frustum, frustum and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it comes to a plane at the

    eye point, and then we have near'
  persid: ''
- desc: and far planes as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can specify left, bottom,

    left,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right, bottom, top, near and

    far. We can also specify a field'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of view and An aspect ratio and

    and an aspect ratio. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ah, so this is a perspective

    view volume.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can change The field of

    view and'
  persid: ''
- desc: and if we modify the Near
  persid: ''
- desc: So, you can see if we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'don''t set the near and far to

    include the models that we want'
  persid: ''
- desc: to see will get
  persid: ''
- desc: clipped and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can also change the

    zip position of The model. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is the one Daryl point

    out'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can Change the near The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so just to show you the shaders.

    The vertex shader is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re taking the model view

    projection, model view matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and a projection matrix from

    that are specified in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'JavaScript file. So we''re taking

    the attribute position,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'multiplying it pre multiplying

    it by the model V matrix, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then pre multiplying that by the

    projection matrix, so that these'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are uniform variables and so

    they''re not changing with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attributes, and then The

    fragment shader is just Passing'
  persid: ''
- desc: through the color and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we get we set up the

    Matrix Model view matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'location and the projection

    Matrix location.'
  persid: ''
- desc: We have the callbacks we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are functions in the MV

    new.js file. So we specify we'
  persid: ''
- desc: get the i vector and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the radius and the theta

    and the phi angles and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m just looking for where they

    specified. Oh, okay, so here the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'app, it''s looking at the origin

    and and the up is the y'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction, so not To pretty

    straightforward there. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s the function to

    generate the viewing coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Based on the eye position the at

    Looking at and the up vector.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So v is normalized vector that

    goes from the look at position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the eye position that''s v n

    is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the view direction vector cross

    with the up vector. And then u'
  persid: ''
- desc: is the cross between the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so n is the normal vector to the

    plane defined by the up and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'view vectors, And then u is the

    cross between N and V. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the view vector the normal

    to the plane that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: perpendicular
  persid: ''
- desc: to the
  persid: ''
- desc: viewing surface. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that gives us our three

    vectors, and then so to return'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and n. So this is the column

    major format. So n is the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'column and Then last entry, Not

    column Is I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the look at function creates
