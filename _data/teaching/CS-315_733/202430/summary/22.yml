- desc: 'So how''s everyone doing

    Today? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: How Does that Sound? Well?
  persid: ''
- desc: So here We are at the
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'touch a bit on chapter nine

    today, modeling and hierarchy.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it''s our first meeting in

    December today, and I saw'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re putting up a Christmas

    tree in the Research and'
  persid: ''
- desc: Innovation Center,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And we have our final exam in a

    week. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're gonna write in here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, that's about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all to sit all there is to be

    said about that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I wanted to point out that I

    uploaded enough I uploaded'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'enough data, filed the matrices.

    So the first page is the same.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Actually, the first two pages

    are the same at the bottom and'
  persid: ''
- desc: talks about the midterm exam
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question. So we''re using the

    application Matrix,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and we Are I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in this case, instead of

    rotating around, so So With this'
  persid: ''
- desc: rotation matrix,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what point about which point are

    we rotating? Just with rotation'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrix as it is?
  persid: ''
- desc: Is it 111? I?
  persid: ''
- desc: No, is it the origin?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what if you want to rotate

    around a different point.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have the idea of

    translating from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the origin to the center and

    rotation'
  persid: ''
- desc: translate center to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the origin so this gets applied

    first.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: that's what I've done here. I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're rotating around
  persid: ''
- desc: five minus seven and two and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have five minus seven and

    two. That''s translate origin to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'center, and we have a rotation

    matrix and translate center to'
  persid: ''
- desc: origin.
  persid: ''
- desc: So in this case,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the rotation portion of the

    matrix doesn''t change. You can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see the first three columns are

    the same as we started with'
  persid: ''
- desc: what changes is a translation.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have minus two plus five,

    minus seven plus minus seven and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minus five plus two. So that

    gives us'
  persid: ''
- desc: this transformation
  persid: ''
- desc: matrix.
  persid: ''
- desc: And so
  persid: ''
- desc: to verify that we have
  persid: ''
- desc: changed the center of rotation,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we specify, or we take our

    center of rotation and apply the'
  persid: ''
- desc: transformation matrix to it,
  persid: ''
- desc: and we get
  persid: ''
- desc: the same point. So that means
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the center of rotation is fixed.

    Does'
  persid: ''
- desc: that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: Is that
  persid: ''
- desc: too much excruciating detail?
  persid: ''
- desc: So I also added an
  persid: ''
- desc: example of a tune shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is using three
  persid: ''
- desc: js and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s look at look at the vertex

    shader that'
  persid: ''
- desc: large enough to See.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re getting the vertex

    attributes for the position, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re calculating the normal and

    I''m multiplying by the normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrix, and
  persid: ''
- desc: then the GL position is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transform position multiplied by

    the ball of U Matrix, by the'
  persid: ''
- desc: projection
  persid: ''
- desc: matrix I,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we calculate The Diffuse

    factor, and here we are using'
  persid: ''
- desc: four levels of shading. We're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea of The tomb shading

    is So'
  persid: ''
- desc: This look. Like
  persid: ''
- desc: it's meant the same way
  persid: ''
- desc: as the others.
  persid: ''
- desc: Doesn't feel like
  persid: ''
- desc: the light is changing
  persid: ''
- desc: as you don't see the
  persid: ''
- desc: sphere anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: I think The tourist snot is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the nicest looking example

    there. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is copied
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from the book''s website, but

    they made a simple typo. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: this isn't available
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to click on and experiment

    without making a change you'
  persid: ''
- desc: so here's The figure.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You can say it''s a robot. Maybe

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so talking about hierarchical

    modeling, the Taurus is at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: root, and thing and
  persid: ''
- desc: changes
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the tour Taurus torso Part B,

    impact all the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: angles And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what position should we Put this

    figure In? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what would make This a better

    program and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe some realistic constraints

    on the angles so we''re not i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doing things a contortionist

    couldn''t do.'
  persid: ''
- desc: But what else
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might make this easier to

    determine How the figure looks.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So This is a
  persid: ''
- desc: variation on
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample code that''s over it

    that''s been provided, but I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: added
  persid: ''
- desc: laying in shaming here.
  persid: ''
- desc: And animation,
  persid: ''
- desc: So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so all three pieces of the robot

    arm here are made from the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'cube. Let''s take a look at the

    source code and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing all the

    calculation for shading in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: vertex shader and the
  persid: ''
- desc: fragment shape were just passing
  persid: ''
- desc: through the colors, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ve computed the intensity at

    The vertices, and then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interpolate between the vertices

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so something interesting here Is

    that we have a geometry.js,'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we're adding a
  persid: ''
- desc: So you've seen something
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like this before In the labs and

    elsewhere, I think you'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have a cube object.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can say my cube and give it a

    side length,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we don''t give a length, then

    we get the unit cube. Then with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the cube, we can have texture

    coordinates, triangle vertices,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle vertex colors, triangle

    face colors and triangle normals'
  persid: ''
- desc: And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can translate scale

    and rotate and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we also have
  persid: ''
- desc: cylinder object to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and a sphere object, then we

    have'
  persid: ''
- desc: a gold material and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we define the ambient,

    diffuse, specular and shininess'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'values For that gold material,

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: we have a Light and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'checkerboard texture which we

    can apply and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this lets us work With cubes

    and other shapes, spheres and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: on. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have 36 vertices, because

    we have six faces of the cube,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two triangles, each with three

    vertices. So that makes'
  persid: ''
- desc: a six times
  persid: ''
- desc: six is 36
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so in this case, we''re

    specifying parameters as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'constant. So say the Base Height

    and Width, lower arm height and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'width, and the upper arm height

    and width.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then there are three angles,

    first one for the base. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'having a vector of three angles,

    theta, and the angle at index'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'zero is for the base angle

    index, one is for the lower arm,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and two is for the upper arm.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so here we create a queue and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the gold made from a gold

    material,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: with a basic light and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are the callbacks For

    the plane, for the angles of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: robot two
  persid: ''
- desc: 'uniforms, then we have called to

    function base. So it''s using a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scale function to change the

    unit cube into one that has base'
  persid: ''
- desc: width and base height
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and base width. So that''s X, Y

    and Z dimensions.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the instance matrix is

    positioning the base'
  persid: ''
- desc: in space. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''re multiplying the

    modeling matrix with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instance matrix, and then we''re

    drawing the base transform by'
  persid: ''
- desc: that matrix. And
  persid: ''
- desc: x. So for the upper R,
  persid: ''
- desc: we do a scale, and then we
  persid: ''
- desc: the position the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'upper arm with a translation,

    and then you multiply instance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix by the model view matrix,

    and then pass passing that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation matrix to the

    shader as a uniform,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we''re drawing the

    vertices again. And the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'same thing happens with the

    lower arm.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when you''re rendering it you

    off.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I added
  persid: ''
- desc: the function
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the changes in the angle so they

    just loop and have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the have looked like the robot

    is a bit of control. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: it so based on that enemy,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that varying of the angles, so I

    set The base lower arm and upper'
  persid: ''
- desc: arm angles
  persid: ''
- desc: based
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be based on the ankle sign. So I

    get it to do something always,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we
  persid: ''
- desc: render the base and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the first slide in the render

    the base'
  persid: ''
- desc: is going to update the slider
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the current value, so It''s

    keeping the interface accurate.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So to enter the base, we through

    the long view matrix as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation with the rotation angle

    of the base around the Y axis,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we call the base
  persid: ''
- desc: so we set model view matrix
  persid: ''
- desc: outside of base.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We call the base and Get that

    render.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Then we we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''ve sent first of all the

    model view matrix to be the'
  persid: ''
- desc: rotation of
  persid: ''
- desc: the base
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then the render the lower

    arm. We''re multiplying the model'
  persid: ''
- desc: V matrix and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by the translation. So we''re

    going moving up to the base'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'height, and then we''re applying

    the rotation and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here. So we''re really doing the

    rotation and then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translation, because the last

    the last matrix specified is the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'first one applied, and then we

    do the lower arm,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we do the upper arm.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the law of U matrix that

    we''re working with accumulates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation. So we''re always

    at the point of where we need To'
  persid: ''
- desc: draw a new piece.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? So
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just An Introduction to

    hierarchical modeling. So we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'start with a prototype object,

    like a cube or a cylinder, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so like in the code, we called

    my cube'
  persid: ''
- desc: to instantiate it,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And then we do the

    transformation, scaling,'
  persid: ''
- desc: rotation, translation
  persid: ''
- desc: to put it into the scene,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'into our Put them into our

    robot, robotic arm,'
  persid: ''
- desc: for example, we
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can think of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parts having, each having a

    transformation, a scale, rotate'
  persid: ''
- desc: and translate and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right? So that''s helpful in the

    sense that we can think about'
  persid: ''
- desc: a primitive,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we can apply a

    transformation to it'
  persid: ''
- desc: and create
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a more complicated model based

    on instancing the same shape'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'over and over again. But if we

    just'
  persid: ''
- desc: list
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the scaling, rotation and

    translation, that doesn''t tell'
  persid: ''
- desc: us about
  persid: ''
- desc: all the parts fit together.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can think of a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'car and the chassis and four

    identical wheels.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The rate of forward motion is

    determined by the rotational'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'speed of the wheels. Does that

    model of a card'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have some limitations, or is

    that a good place To start? You?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Four wheels. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so that's okay if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we want to go in A straight line

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: well, we can have an idea
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of making the Car turn,

    irrespective of what direction'
  persid: ''
- desc: fields are going. I
  persid: ''
- desc: that was
  persid: ''
- desc: about the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is another

    representation of the model. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t really reflect the

    relationships. Either.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not clear how the speed

    parameter is'
  persid: ''
- desc: impacting the car.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, let''s see if we can come

    to better representation. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graph, we can think of nodes and

    edges.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Edges can be directed or

    undirected, and the graph can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a cycle, a directed path,

    and it''s a loop.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So a tree
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is a graph, but each node except

    the root has exactly one parent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'node. So we start from the root

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: we go down to leaf nodes. So
  persid: ''
- desc: that's can be an effective way
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of organizing a model. So if we

    think of a tree model for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: car, we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have the chassis, and then we

    have the four wheels,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and there''s a parent, child

    relationship between the chassis'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and each of the four wheels.

    It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here we can think about the

    wheels being identical, so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: have the chassis and wheel,
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each of the directed arrows,

    directed edges, pardon me,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'indicates one of the four

    wheels, so we have right front,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'right rear, left front and left

    rear.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So dag stands for directed

    acyclic graph. So We have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction here, and no cycles

    while.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can think about how to use

    these structures to convey'
  persid: ''
- desc: information about the model
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s a robot arm and so

    each of these three are parts.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have the cylinder base,

    lower arm and then the upper arm'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the instance, we have

    scaled the instance,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so The upper arm is bigger than

    the lower arm. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assuming the lower arm, this

    should be the upper arm and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is an articulated Model,
  persid: ''
- desc: and when we put
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the pieces together, we''re

    translating to the top of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'base and then to the top of the

    lower arm.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And adding the next pieces,

    we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so following this setup that

    we''ve looked at in the code, we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can specify the state of the

    model by giving those three'
  persid: ''
- desc: angles and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here are some relationships

    in The robot arm case'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the base rotates

    independently and'
  persid: ''
- desc: and the position of
  persid: ''
- desc: the base
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is specified by that one

    rotation angle. Then the lower'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'arm is attached to the base, so

    its position depends on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation of the base must also

    translate relative to base and'
  persid: ''
- desc: rotate above connecting joint.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the upper arm is attached to

    the lower arm. Its position'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'depends on the base and the

    lower arm.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So they''re all connected. So if

    we think of this in terms of'
  persid: ''
- desc: matrices.
  persid: ''
- desc: We have rotation of the base
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can set m to be that first

    matrix,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we apply and we apply that

    to the base,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we translate,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'translate The lower arm so it''s

    on top of the base,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we rotate lower arm around

    the joint so we have a have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotate lower arm, translate

    lower arm and rotate base.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this matrix will specify the

    lower arms'
  persid: ''
- desc: position,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we add to that matrix M

    by doing the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'rotation for the upper arm,

    translation for the upper arm,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then here, the rest
  persid: ''
- desc: of this
  persid: ''
- desc: is determined here.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re adding on to the

    matrices.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So because we''re accumulating

    the matrix matrices, what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'happens if we change the order

    of drawing and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You''re going to come out as you

    would expect you'
  persid: ''
- desc: No, I Don't think so. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is, you can think of

    this a tree model of the robot.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the base is the root node,

    and then there''s one child of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the base, which is the lower

    arm, and then one child of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lower arm, which is the upper

    arm, and the upper arm is a leaf'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'node. So there''s no more No more

    pieces we could transform. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could add fingers, appendages,

    and to the end of the robot arm.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We might put spheres in the

    joints so we don''t have obvious'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'points where it doesn''t look

    like the arms. So we''re not just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'touching cube transform cubes to

    Get the arm, but we Have more'
  persid: ''
- desc: convincing representation and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that could be a problem. I guess

    the arm,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we have the physical

    interpretation of'
  persid: ''
- desc: this, the arm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is Pushing, will push the pace

    over, but I haven''t I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I haven't.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So adjusting the sliders, I can

    have that happen, but in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: animation doesn't happen.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so we can think about a

    structure, how we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: deal with the data structure,
  persid: ''
- desc: the thing to draw, the matrix
  persid: ''
- desc: relative To the parent
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the Children of that parent,

    I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so a more complicated example is

    the figure I'
  persid: ''
- desc: I Don't know what

- desc: happened to the figure from this
  persid: ''
- desc: drawing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t make it into figure, dot,

    HTML example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but the structure is similar. So

    it''s torso is at the root, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have head, and there are two

    angles for the head, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the left upper arm, right upper

    arm, left upper leg, right upper'
  persid: ''
- desc: leg.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then the left lower
  persid: ''
- desc: 'leg, left lower arm, sorry,

    right lower arm, left lower leg'
  persid: ''
- desc: and right lower leg.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So like we did with the base and

    the upper arm and the lower arm'
  persid: ''
- desc: for the robot arm, we can
  persid: ''
- desc: can use functions to
  persid: ''
- desc: organize for
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we have a matrix
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that can be applied after the

    torso'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to move the head and and the

    upper arms and legs, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'falling down the lower arms and

    legs.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when we display the figure

    we''re traversing from the torso'
  persid: ''
- desc: through the other pieces. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we talked about 11 angles on

    the slide before, because there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are two head angles, so you can

    tilt One way and the other.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when we''re doing this, think

    of a stack. We can'
  persid: ''
- desc: set the model view matrix
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and draw the torso, and we set

    the model view matrix'
  persid: ''
- desc: to m times m h1
  persid: ''
- desc: and M h2
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we specify the

    different pieces.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re compositing those

    matrices before we draw slowly,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'draw the torso and then the

    right upper arm, the right lower'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'arm. So this is how we traverse

    and apply the matrices and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s the idea of using The

    push and pop operators'
  persid: ''
- desc: to save our matrices and
  persid: ''
- desc: so when we get So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we''ve drawn The left lower

    arm and it can pump the matrices'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then go on to the right

    upper arm.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sorry, we would push first, then

    to the right upper arm and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: right lower arm, and then
  persid: ''
- desc: Pop at The End and
  persid: ''
- desc: so the idea is that We Get the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, Daryl doesn''t figure any

    more than that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So does that make sense in terms

    of a general way of of'
  persid: ''
- desc: operating? If
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you go, questions or

    concerns.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you for today, it
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t really specify what

    parameters'
  persid: ''
- desc: a lot of you was thinking about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the line for option one so it

    select option One and for option'
  persid: ''
- desc: two,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and for option one and point

    elevation,'
  persid: ''
- desc: And then the spiral center
  persid: ''
- desc: radius and the height the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, okay, thank you for today.

    So our last meeting on Wednesday'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will go over towards finish.

    COVID reports, understand things'
  persid: ''
- desc: and reviewing okay. Thanks
  persid: ''

    care. Everyone.'
