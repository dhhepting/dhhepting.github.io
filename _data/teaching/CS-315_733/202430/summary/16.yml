- desc: 'So what kind of shading

    have we used so far? What''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: way to describe it?
  persid: ''
- desc: Would You like a vowel?
  persid: ''
- desc: Wow, yes. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what other information Can we

    Add?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Models and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light. Yeah, We can add Lights.

    We''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when can we add to describe how

    the light is going interact with'
  persid: ''
- desc: a cube? Let's say I
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can add
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material descriptions, or we

    have the model of the surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can get different effects

    when we Apply the'
  persid: ''
- desc: when that Surface is lit. I
  persid: ''
- desc: so We can think about
  persid: ''
- desc: describing The
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'plate that comes back from

    interacting with the surface. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can describe in terms of

    ambient, diffuse and specular'
  persid: ''
- desc: components and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so shading, a proper shading,

    gives us a sense of three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dimensional quality jumping out

    of the computer screen. So we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about the types of lights

    we can use and interaction with'
  persid: ''
- desc: materials, and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''ll talk about how that

    can be implemented on graphics'
  persid: ''
- desc: hardware.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the first one looks like a

    circle. Does the second one look'
  persid: ''
- desc: like a sphere? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s not terribly convincing to

    me. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we agree with this assessment

    that the light material'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interactions on each point have

    a different color or shade, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we don''t see a flat color.

    That''s the variation of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: surface.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in addition to light sources

    and material properties, we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also take into account the

    location of the viewer and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: regulation of the surface so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We can think about scattering

    light in the scene and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'light strike surface A. Sun is

    scattered. Sun is absorbed. Some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of that scattered light strikes

    B, some scattered Sun absorbed,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some of the scattered light

    strikes a and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So that''s keeping track of A lot

    of interactions and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have a description of

    scattering and absorption, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it doesn''t have a general

    solution, and we can ray trace'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using ray tracing With perfectly

    reflective services and again,'
  persid: ''
- desc: an accurate model.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you can see there''s a lot to

    keep track of. If we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to do an accurate

    rendering, we''re it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So in this picture of global

    effects, we see the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: source,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Shadow, multiple reflections,

    and here''s A translucent'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface. So in that case, some

    length reflects and sun passes'
  persid: ''
- desc: through the object The
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so global illumination isn''t

    suited to graphics hardware. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the graphics hardware

    pipeline.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But we''re happy if we can make

    it look reasonably good. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there are some techniques to be

    used to simulate global'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'illumination effects. Light

    strikes an object is partially'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'absorbed, length of strikes an

    object is partially absorbed,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'partially scattered, reflected.

    The amount reflected terms of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color and brightness of the

    object. The surface appears red'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'under white light, because the

    red component of the light is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflected and the rest is

    absorbed. The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflected light is scattering

    back, and depends on The smooth,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'smoothness and orientation of

    The surface You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what kinds of legs are

    available for computer graphics?'
  persid: ''
- desc: I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Are you talking about like

    directional and positional'
  persid: ''
- desc: or Yeah, so I
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we specify This a position of

    a light in the scene and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s, we have the leg Coming

    from a point, so it doesn''t have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any I need. Geometry is just a

    point, and light is emitted in'
  persid: ''
- desc: every direction, if
  persid: ''
- desc: we specify direction
  persid: ''
- desc: it's like when we move
  persid: ''
- desc: 'object off to infinity, whereas

    if we''re looking at something'
  persid: ''
- desc: close,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the directions are quite

    different from the eye to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different parts of the scene. If

    you move that off to infinity,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then the projectors become

    parallel and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so when We think of a

    directional light, the light has'
  persid: ''
- desc: a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s a directional light

    source that we see most days?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we take a white light

    source and restrict the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we restrict the directions in

    which it is emitting, If'
  persid: ''
- desc: so then we have a Spot like I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we talked. We''ve talked about

    These ambient Light. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can Cover up. We can we

    make stuff look good or look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better by adding some ambient

    light to account for i'
  persid: ''
- desc: to account for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'terms that are too hard to

    compute in your graphics'
  persid: ''
- desc: pipeline And
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: if we have a smooth surface and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the more it reflects like A

    mirror. So we get the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: bouncing off of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if The surface is rough, we get

    more scattering. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have diffuse, the

    specular, the ambient'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'components, And we have four

    vectors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So L is the direction of is the

    location of the light source to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the viewer. That''s V then we

    have a normal to the surface,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and we have the perfect

    reflector. So this is that''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'direction in which light would

    be. If the surface was a perfect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflector, the light would

    bounce in that direction. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the normal is defined

    determined by local orientation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the model. The angle of

    incidence equals the angle of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflection. The three vectors

    must be co planar. So we have L'
  persid: ''
- desc: to the light source,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the perfect reflector is the

    angle of incidence, which we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'find by looking at the angle

    between l and n, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then the reflection is that same

    angle. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it so we can think about another

    type of surface, inversion'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surface, perfectly diffused

    reflector, so it scatters. It'
  persid: ''
- desc: doesn't have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s the opposite of the perfect

    reflector that we saw.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'None of light reflect is

    proportional to the vertical'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'component of the incoming light.

    The Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re taking the cosine

    between the light vector and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: normal vector.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So most of the surfaces are

    neither ideal diffusers or ideal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reflectors. Smooth surfaces show

    specular highlights due to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'incoming light being reflected

    in directions concentrated close'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the direction of a perfect

    reflection and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re interested so we can

    see specular highlights in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'region Around the reflected, the

    perfect The perfect reflection'
  persid: ''
- desc: reflector you
  persid: ''
- desc: so fun proposed
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a term that makes the highlight

    stronger when the viewer is at'
  persid: ''
- desc: or near the perfect reflector,
  persid: ''
- desc: and it's a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that highlight is going to be

    much less apparent If the viewer'
  persid: ''
- desc: is not looking in that direction
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can
  persid: ''
- desc: try different values To get
  persid: ''
- desc: the effect we want you.
  persid: ''
- desc: So to handle ambient light,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we have an intensity term for

    The ambient light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the reflection coefficient

    light from the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the Light from a point source

    is proportional to the distance'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the source from the surface,

    and then we can add A term like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this to attenuate and soften The

    effects of the light.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have in the farm model

    nine coefficients for each point'
  persid: ''
- desc: source,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nine absorption coefficients and

    the shininess coefficient.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for each color component, we

    add the contributions across the'
  persid: ''
- desc: sources and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so This is where the halfway

    vector becomes more efficient'
  persid: ''
- desc: and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so here''s An array of teapots

    with different parameters In the'
  persid: ''
- desc: blend faux model.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we have the light vector and

    the Uber vector specified in our'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scene, so we can compute R from

    L and N. But how do we determine'
  persid: ''
- desc: n for simple surfaces and
  persid: ''
- desc: so how do we deal with the
  persid: ''
- desc: Timing In the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again, suspension, disbelief,

    that''s a cube. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so On the surface of the queue

    and that'
  persid: ''
- desc: Normal is
  persid: ''
- desc: easy to define
  persid: ''
- desc: what happens when a group,
  persid: ''
- desc: then we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a bunch of triangles to

    make up a surface. So the marble'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the surface of the triangle

    is clear, but What about where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it meets up with other

    triangles? So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like, what about that edge or

    This corner?'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can interpolate the
  persid: ''
- desc: so the normal to the sphere. So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at a point on the sphere, we

    have a 10, the tangent plane,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and that allows us to do the

    cross pride, to get the normal'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Here are some details about

    competing normals For triangles'
  persid: ''
- desc: you
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can this is a little bit

    about calling Back faces. You.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So when we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do the vertex per vertex,

    shading calculations are done'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for each vertex, which makes

    sense.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So We Could we
  persid: ''
- desc: so we could use that
  persid: ''
- desc: attribute approach Changing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the color, or we could do The

    shading and'
  persid: ''
- desc: in The vertex shader and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we have the normal for the

    triangle, but in the case of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sphere that we can see here, we

    want different normals at Each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex, even though it''s not

    quite correct mathematically, We'
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we set the normals
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at each vertex, then we get

    smooth shading, But we see the'
  persid: ''
- desc: edge of the sphere Model and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s called Grow shading

    involves averaging'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The normals of the triangles

    around The vertex and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so with corrosion, we want to

    have that normal vector for each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex so we can apply The

    modify the limb form model at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'each vertex And the interpolate

    vertex comes across each'
  persid: ''
- desc: polygon, the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So where can we get Highlights

    if we''re doing garosha,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because what we''re doing is

    we''re doing'
  persid: ''
- desc: the whole calculation for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vertex so if the light The

    sprinkler highlights correspond'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the vertices of our wall,

    then we''ll see the highlights'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'come out, because in the vertex

    shade, we''re computing vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color that gets interpolated by

    the fragment shader.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in Grow shading, it all depends

    on the intensity values at the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertices, because those values

    are interpolated.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So Fauci says find the vertex

    normals and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like we''ve done before, but

    interpolate the vertex normals'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Across edges, and interpolate

    edge normals across The polygon'
  persid: ''
- desc: And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what''s the advantage of Fauci

    compared to grow shade? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What''s An advantage and what''s a

    disadvantage. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: let's say
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the point where the

    specular highlight would Be most'
  persid: ''
- desc: pronounced.
  persid: ''
- desc: So in Grow
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shading, we''re calculating

    intensities at the vertices, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re interpolating the value so

    we don''t get the highlight and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but in Phong shading, we''re

    interpolating the normals. So in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fragment shader, we''re doing

    the calculation with an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approximation to the surface

    normal. So we can get we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: capture these highlights and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so that''s an advantage.

    What''s a disadvantage'
  persid: ''
- desc: is this a little bit more work
  persid: ''
- desc: or a lot more? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because instead of doing the

    four vertices of a quad and or a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle strip, we''re doing the

    calculation not four times, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'once, for each fragment, for

    each pixel. Does That make'
  persid: ''
- desc: sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s a bit more complicated. I

    so'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not clear where the light is

    going either. Well, it is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because you can see the surface.

    The'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it. So anyway, in the shaded

    cube, oh, we''re out of time. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: knew that because of the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re doing the lighting and

    the faux calculation in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex shader, and then fragment

    shader. We''re just assigning the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color to the fragment color.

    Thank you for today. Have a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: rest. Of your Wednesday.
  persid: ''
