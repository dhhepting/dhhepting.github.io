- desc: I forgot
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something. I just forgot

    something. Yeah, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: time. Okay, it's 232, 230
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s see if The projector is

    going to work today. You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I called them about this on

    Monday last week, and I got an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'email today saying the ticket

    was closed. I tried they had'
  persid: ''
- desc: done
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They had done something about

    it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, that''s looks better.

    Fingers crossed.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has anyone heard of fractals

    before anyone hear that word?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I''ve done a Web GL

    program I''ll share with you a'
  persid: ''
- desc: bit later,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that generates shapes like these

    and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and I just wanted to share with

    you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are screen captures,

    and this little icon is in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'middle and says, Apple thinks

    this is a plant.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So it thinks this is a Norway

    maple. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: and this one is an aloe vera. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wrote, wrote, wrote a book

    called the fractal geometry of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'nature. He talked about fractal

    shape which are self similar,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'being very good at describing

    natural objects.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So they were being computer

    graphics and'
  persid: ''
- desc: some years ago,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and like I said, I''ll share my

    web channel two program with'
  persid: ''
- desc: you,
  persid: ''
- desc: just needs a bit of cleaning up.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I thought I''d go over the

    midterm. I''ve started marking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it, but I''m not yet complete.

    Haven''t completed that yet,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but I thought we could go Over

    the exam questions, does that'
  persid: ''
- desc: seem alright?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Post a questionnaire for you to

    give me some feedback about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: exam later today, I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I tried to follow your

    suggestions about making short'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer Questions. I didn''t do

    multiple choice per se, but I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but what do I want to say I took

    a lot of the questions are well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some of them are directly from

    the midterm we talked about in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class last week. Other ones

    questions are rephrased the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material that I was getting

    after.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the window is 512 by 512

    pixels and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what''s the width and height of

    the clip space? Does it depend'
  persid: ''
- desc: on the size of the canvas?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, no,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I saw one person put their hand

    up, maybe more. Yeah, it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'related to the size of the

    canvas. Anyone know what the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'width and height of the clip

    space are? Yeah? That''s two,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because it goes from minus One

    to 1x'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the proportion is two divided

    by 512, one over 256,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I also so. People who did one

    over 256, squared. That was also'
  persid: ''
- desc: a k.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have a
  persid: ''
- desc: the model in terms of
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we get to eclipse space, we

    have everything expressed in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'range minus one to one, minus

    one to one minus one to one. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: then we now
  persid: ''
- desc: 'map that into Window cord.

    That''s so'
  persid: ''
- desc: We're
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if we had 16 by 16, then we''d

    have 25 by 16, one, eight.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: we still have the
  persid: ''
- desc: same range
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between minus one and one, but

    we''re dividing it much more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coarsely, so there''s a bigger

    proportion. Of the clip space'
  persid: ''
- desc: per pixel.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Any questions or concerns about

    that? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you have a question or

    Comment? Okay?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we can think of RGB as three

    RGB as three coordinate axes. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: we go from black to white to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this Hue Saturation and

    Value.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Looking from the top, we have

    Green. Red, Green,'
  persid: ''
- desc: Blue, Janta, Cyan and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I imagine those are equally

    spaced around a circle.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So from the side we go, value

    zero to one, black to light.'
  persid: ''
- desc: These are grays and
  persid: ''
- desc: and we go from white to
  persid: ''
- desc: the pure colors. And
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is s the saturation and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we go, if we have red, let''s

    say we go from white to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different shades of paint, and

    we get more and more red until'
  persid: ''
- desc: we get to pure red color. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s just a bit of the

    intuition behind it, any'
  persid: ''
- desc: questions or concerns? Applause,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we create a computer graphics

    image, we are Taking'
  persid: ''
- desc: continuous renowned, I
  persid: ''
- desc: discretizing it and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fidelity of the represent of

    our discrete and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the fidelity of our

    representation depends on Two'
  persid: ''
- desc: Things You
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can see the number of

    samples we''re taking. We have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'camera with how many megapixels

    as you can.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Have 10 megapixels, so that''s a

    lot of samples. And the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing is, how much storage are

    we allocating to recording each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample? So if we just have one

    bit per sample, we get a very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'high resolution black and white

    image. But if we store 32 or 48'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bits per pixel per sample, we

    get a lot more,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A much higher quality

    representation.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that seem Okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'show between red, green, blue

    and sand, Bucha yellow, RGB is'
  persid: ''
- desc: additive. CMY is subtractive and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''ll use RGB on displays and

    use CLI for printers and'
  persid: ''
- desc: bless you.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So why do we sometimes have, or

    oftentimes have black ink and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because if we want to print

    something in black, if we don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have black ink, We have to print

    it three times in cyan, magenta'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and yellow, so we in 30 will get

    Black. But'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we''re using ink, the paper

    might get soggy.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s much easier to do one pass

    with black instead of three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'passes of full cyan, magenta and

    Yellow, Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the object space, we''re

    thinking'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of The representation of the

    models, cubes, spheres, whatever'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'an image space. We''re dealing

    with,'
  persid: ''
- desc: pixels, screen coordinates and Z
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer is an image space

    algorithm, because we''re testing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the depth of points and clip

    space and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ace, is that Okay? Any

    questions?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Triangle strips and this is the

    same question from the midterm'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we looked at last week, except

    are there alternatives? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more efficient than triangles

    because we don''t have to specify'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three vertices per triangle, we

    can link them together so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so Latin will convert the data

    into a float, three, Two array'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we can pass to Web GL and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, Then the next three

    questions related to This. No,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I so let''s use For Visible

    Surface determination and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going To be using the

    physical search determination,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it has The depth with each of

    each pixel. So if depth,'
  persid: ''
- desc: new pixel value
  persid: ''
- desc: is less than the
  persid: ''
- desc: store nine And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if the new value that we have

    for position on screen, if the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'depth of the new value is less

    than or closer to the viewer,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then the one in store e update

    that pixel with the new value,'
  persid: ''
- desc: And then we update the buffer.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, okay, does That make

    sense? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what three things do we need

    for the lookout, a way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'specify the position of the

    camera i'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So i is where we''re we have our

    where the camera is Located, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we have E and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A And then we specify an up

    vector and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so that gives us two directions,

    and then to do The cross product'
  persid: ''
- desc: of the vectors we can get. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'our moral Thank you, our third

    coordinate axis.'
  persid: ''
- desc: I Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I gave you some share Code

    and JavaScript here some'
  persid: ''
- desc: fragments and
  persid: ''
- desc: so I recall that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we talked last week, I

    About exam questions that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Questions about, what does this

    code Do?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Were favored by some people. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this is a very basic vertex

    shader. It''s just taking the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex position that we''ve set

    up in the JavaScript and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attached it to the a position

    variable. Then the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader is just setting a

    constant color.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And here''s the bit for the

    JavaScript file where we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'setting up the vertex buffer and

    associating a position so the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'after vertex attribute position

    with that variable that links to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shader, the vertex shader.

    So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so If we''re going to make

    per vertex colors? What''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: first thing?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We have to change something in

    each of these bits in the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader, the fragment shader and

    The JavaScript.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, let''s start with a vertex

    shader. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we need an a color.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so a color would be in, and

    B color would be out, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'does That make sense? Okay, what

    About the fragment shader I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we carry the color we''ve

    created, we''ve assigned In the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex shader as an out V color

    gets passed out of the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader, and then we connect it.

    Here we say in V color. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then, instead of assigning F

    color to be a constant red,'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1001, and we say f color equals

    V color.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so what do we need to do in

    the JavaScript? So Buffer. Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we just, we''re going to use

    the same structures we have for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vertex buffer, except for

    colors, and we''re going to make'
  persid: ''
- desc: it a four
  persid: ''
- desc: 'black, four or four positions

    per color, and we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: going to link The
  persid: ''
- desc: color buffer to a color I
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's this basically, except
  persid: ''
- desc: in the vertex attribute pointer
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could be color location, And

    instead of two, it will be A'
  persid: ''
- desc: four and
  persid: ''
- desc: does that seem okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I was being too clever with

    this next question. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is a bug that I encountered

    in my own code, the one that'
  persid: ''
- desc: generated the fractal shapes
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what I could have said in

    question 11, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: three by three Matrix and
  persid: ''
- desc: and dream do
  persid: ''
- desc: so What the output? So I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get that point, since it''s

    identity matrix, that''s not very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interesting, but it''s easy to do

    the math on the board for that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I have a VEC three that I''m

    pushing to'
  persid: ''
- desc: positions
  persid: ''
- desc: now the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I have three values for each

    position, because I''ve, I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'been pushing back three two

    positions. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But what am I telling it to look

    for in the second last line? How'
  persid: ''
- desc: many? Yeah, two values.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And because I flattened it, so I

    don''t have the idea that, Oh, I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just need two of the three

    values from the vector, three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that are stored in the array.

    And'
  persid: ''
- desc: so i get i
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what happens is, let''s say

    these are guys are pushed to'
  persid: ''
- desc: positions.
  persid: ''
- desc: And I'm going to get a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense? So we have

    data for three'
  persid: ''
- desc: positions that were in we're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sampling or taking values off

    out of that vertex buffer two at'
  persid: ''
- desc: a time.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? I
  persid: ''
- desc: instead of
  persid: ''
- desc: let's do put them
  persid: ''
- desc: out like this,
  persid: ''
- desc: so 001, 0.5 0.5 the
  persid: ''
- desc: so we get those two,
  persid: ''
- desc: those two, those Two,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and those two. So this one is

    what you expect. This one too,'
  persid: ''
- desc: but these aren't.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I really want to have 00, 10,

    0.54, 0.5 0.5'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve split that over two, so I

    should get 00, 0.5 0.5 0.25'
  persid: ''
- desc: 0.25, and point seven.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does That make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay? I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does anyone recognize that

    Matrix? I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Oh, this is in that matrices dot

    pdf,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so describe The effect of this

    transformation, a rotation and'
  persid: ''
- desc: you can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say more detail about how

    coordinates get flipped and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how would I would you go

    about computing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transformation matrix At centers

    the above rotation at point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five minus seven, two. So what

    do we need to do?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we had our rotation, but we

    want to apply it to a point'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s not at the origin, yeah,

    I thought you had your hand up.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So what do we need to do?
  persid: ''
- desc: Or Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can write that as a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re going to do minus five

    plus seven,'
  persid: ''
- desc: minus two.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then we''re going to apply the

    matrix, and then we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: go
  persid: ''
- desc: 'five minus seven, two and to

    move'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can bring that as

    multiplications as I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we can do the rotations,

    And then you do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three. So we get, I think it''s

    minus 314, three. I might have'
  persid: ''
- desc: the signs mixed up.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So how do we verify that we have

    the rotation centered at that'
  persid: ''
- desc: point, applied to 572,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and she had the same one back.

    Yeah, that''s just like we did in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class. We took the center of the

    rotation. So because it''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'center of the rotation, it''s the

    fixed point. So the image of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'center of rotation under the

    rotation is the center. It''s the'
  persid: ''
- desc: same thing. So yeah, can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you go back to number 12? I

    think you might have skipped it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: It was on that previous page,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the last 20. Oh, yeah. How does

    it work? You'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I''ve noticed that some people

    are answering it after they''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'made changes in question 10, but

    I would say it''s it works'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because we have a good set of

    defaults, because things are'
  persid: ''
- desc: lined up. And
  persid: ''
- desc: we're looking down the Z axis.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we don''t need to do a model

    view matrix or projection'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'matrix, to get something to

    display on the screen.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then the limitation part,

    well, what''s the caveat if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to see something on the

    screen?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What''s the limitation? You have

    to have coordinates and what'
  persid: ''
- desc: range and
  persid: ''
- desc: I Wonder if we had a minus 10. I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'would we be able to see

    something that has an x'
  persid: ''
- desc: coordinate of minus 10? No the
  persid: ''
- desc: minus one work.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the same in y, so the

    coordinates have to be in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'clip space if they''re not they

    get clipped. We never see them'
  persid: ''
- desc: again.
  persid: ''
- desc: That makes sense. You.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So here''s, this is chapter Six,

    lighting and shading. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so have a look at the code For

    shaded cube and'
  persid: ''
- desc: shaded cube to the
