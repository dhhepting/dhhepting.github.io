It seems to go against what I understood pixels to be before today._\n\t* Pixels are discrete samples of a continuous phenomenon\n* _If a pixel can be any shape and size how do all screen appear to show non-stretched images?_\n\t* Pixels as discrete samples of a continuous phenomenon do not have size nor shape. On modern screens, these samples are displayed equally spaced in x and y (resulting in a grid of squares). To avoid stretching an image, preserve the aspect ratio\n* _I would like to know more about what is aliasing_\n\t* Aliasing in computer graphics refers to jagged features apparent on what should be smooth lines and curves. It is a problem of insufficient sampling\n* _It was mentioned that a part of our participation marks could be gained through wiki contribution. What is meant by this and how do we contribute to the wiki?_\n\t* I've added some information in UR Courses (under the Participation topic). It is not strictly necessary to sign up to edit the wiki, you can just do it (see [Using Wiki](https://docs.moodle.org/404/en/Using_Wiki) for an introduction to wiki editing\n* _How can we get to volunteer to participate in research through the participant pool?_\n\t* Opportunities to participate in research will be advertised on UR Courses\n* _Would it be possible to get the course lecture slides?_\n\t* Yes.
