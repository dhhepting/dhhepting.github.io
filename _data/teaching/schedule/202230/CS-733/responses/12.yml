important:
- desc: learnt about essence of LHS /RHS in co-ordinates, learnt about effects of
    changing vertices and use of gl.Triangle, gl.triangle_fan &amp;amp;gl.triangle_Strip
    . and the advantage of gl.str
- desc: It was a wonderful experience in learning how changing the number of points
    changes the output(Triangle example). Moreover, how structure of the matrix and
    points in that plays an role in rotating the cube.
- desc: I learned about how to rotate and translate a cube in WebGL.
- desc: Today I learned how LH/RH impact our description of models and how to rotate
    a cube.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is how we do rotation and translation
    of cubes
- desc: Positions of cube and how shape changes without moving the points and Rotation
    matrices.
know-more:
- desc: It was a good lecture about the rotation matrices and how to change their
    positions
