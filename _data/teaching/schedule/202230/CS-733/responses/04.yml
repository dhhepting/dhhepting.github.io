important:
- desc: The most important thing I learned was the most important elements of image
    formation. The session contained significant contents about the image formation
    including objects, viewer, light sources and attributes. We discussed these factors  in
    the class.
- desc: Discrete representation and sampling issues. In addition, information about
    image formation was also very interesting.
- desc: Today I learned about the staircase effect, commonly known as aliasing. I
    also learned about the anti-aliasing approach to address sampling issues. Apart
    from these, there were discussions about image formation and ray tracing.
- desc: Staircase effect is called aliasing
- desc: The most important thing I feel I learned from today&#039;s class is the difference
    between vector and raster images.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt in class was representation of discrete
    images as well as how ray tracing and light can play a major role in visualization.
- desc: Staircase effect aliasing
- desc: I learnt about various colours in graphics through html &amp;amp; js.
- desc: About pixels
know-more:
- desc: coding graphics  with webgl
- desc: I would like to know more about ray tracing, I have not read about it before
