difficult:
- desc: Homogeneous coordinates are quite tricky to understand and also by using that
    designing the movement is toughest thing i can say
important:
- desc: understood the JSs code for rotating cube, was very interesting.
- desc: I learned useful knowledge about translation and rotation in WebGL.
- desc: Today we started chapter 3 and learned about animation. I learned how to move
    an object on the screen with WebGL. I also learned about homogeneous coordinates
    and animation frames (canvas).
- desc: The most important thing I have learnt today is the rotation of objects and
    the way we can increase or decrease the speed of rotation.
- desc: I learned about the animation and interaction topic with the example of rotating
    square graphic.
- desc: Displayed animated square and its Working
know-more:
- desc: The most important topic of the session was about creating computer animation.
    We learned the basics and did a demo.
