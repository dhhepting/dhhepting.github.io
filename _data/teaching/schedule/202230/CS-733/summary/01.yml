Audio-Transcript:
- desc: 'Okay, I''m gonna record

    the audio and then I''ll put a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transcript up later. So won''t be

    on Zoom. But this is the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'software that Zoom uses for its

    transcription. So I won''t I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'won''t reveal any identities like

    I did last time. I mean, same as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'last time, I won''t associate any

    names with things that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'published. And I don''t think

    this will have names because it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t have a class list to

    work. From.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So anyway, because of the. So

    the textbooks that we''ll be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'using is not available in

    hardcopy. So it''s the eighth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'edition of a well established

    book.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I have it on my Pearson

    account. So that''s why I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hooking up my laptop to show you

    I didn''t rehearse this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shortcode cord over here. Okay.

    Do you think consent look like?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Me? Yeah. My wife did. Okay, so

    let''s see sn 33.'
  persid: ''
- desc: is documenting
  persid: ''
- desc: 'orange arrow, so you can call me

    whichever you prefer.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Stick with one of these two

    things.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So you''re meeting in the

    classroom 313 here and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'beyond. So no. These things very

    stays very fine.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'My writing large enough for you?

    Okay, any questions about those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, here''s our your courses so

    I''m just going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I haven''t finished setting it up

    yet. So I can many things but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll make it available to you

    now. You can access the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'attendance like if you like? So

    is it brave enough to see this'
  persid: ''
- desc: for
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so something I did I don''t

    remember whether we discussed it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in 730 or whether it was in for

    28 Before anyway so based on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'suggestions, I implemented a new

    idea about today tracker'
  persid: ''
- desc: so, this is my first try
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so for everything that I have

    scheduled because I hate three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and half hour blocks between 830

    and five shooting. So here I am.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The correct length for the

    meeting. For today. And if if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'during the semester on a Tuesday

    or Thursday, we don''t say no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting here. I thought that was

    a reasonable compromise'
  persid: ''
- desc: so anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: there's that and you can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let me know what you think about

    that and other things on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: website.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I don''t have the meetings

    listed here in the schedule that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you conserve, and further

    there''s meetings here because'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they had all the other

    activities. So maybe I''ll put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them in, in in his link in his

    events as well. But I haven''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'done that yet. Anyway. So like

    we did before the response to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meetings. So we''ll open up the

    end of class and then it''ll be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'closes at midnight or one minute

    to midnight. So just a quick'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thought about what you

    discovered or'
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway, we'll keep that going.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And so we''ll have the syllabus

    up on Tuesday, we will discuss'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it then it''ll be like the other

    basically like the other classes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are like like 730? Start out

    with'
  persid: ''
- desc: so it took me so I
  persid: ''
- desc: 'got so I was assigned in class

    last month. And I said well we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should get a textbook with the

    tech getting that result. And so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I found this one very, the most

    recent and it''s using WebGL'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'WebGL 2.0. And so they talked

    with Pearson about getting an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exam copy and they didn''t. It

    took them a while to realize'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that there was no hard copy of

    this textbook so and then their'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'website is really terrible,

    because so they have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'distinction between the US and

    Canadian sites is one is E and I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pass us is pearson.com/e and so

    dash U S and the Canadian site'
  persid: ''
- desc: is pearson.com/en.ca and dash ca
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so it''s not clear and you I have

    I don''t have time to rant.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, so I''ve got electronic

    access but as of yesterday'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t have the link up for the

    textbook. So let me just check'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if it''s not today There it is.

    Okay. So you can rent for 5315'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or you can send nothing else I

    guess. So I guess that''s a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing to rent it I don''t have

    experience. This is my first'
  persid: ''
- desc: experience with an E textbook.
  persid: ''
- desc: So your experience together
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not sure whether you went of

    what''s available directly from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Pearson. You might want to check

    that out too. I guess we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'check that out in the second

    year.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Looks like they do have a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'knack for the eighth edition.

    Maybe an earlier edition they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have an imprint. Okay, let me

    see if I can go to pearson.com'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then another misadventure.

    On the website. They had a chat.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I got connected with somebody

    there was a person with a chat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and they said, Oh, are you in

    Canada? Sorry, I can''t help you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to call this 800 number and I

    called that and got voicemail in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any way. You think and these

    days that people would be a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little more cognizant of the

    fact that good websites are'
  persid: ''
- desc: important.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now it's gonna take know
  persid: ''
- desc: now are back in the US
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this has been a price that''s

    strange Okay. So I just make a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'note your eighth edition is only

    online that you know'
  persid: ''
- desc: are there
  persid: ''
- desc: issues
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sake let me know how you make

    out with that so, I''ve seen some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'paperback, some Amazon for I

    think the six was maybe even the'
  persid: ''
- desc: seven conditions
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I find having papers nice to

    make a physical book is nice to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'work with. But there are

    advantages so it''s easier to'
  persid: ''
- desc: keep up to date. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the LinkedIn code and so forth

    in electronic version.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I mean, so we''re talking about

    principles of computer graphics.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s it''s not going to depend so

    much on the addition. So thank'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you if you have an addition with

    WebGL'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whichever one you prefer to

    choose amongst those. So I won''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I won''t say anything separate

    the digital one.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Having said that, I haven''t used

    this book lately, so I can''t see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how much difference there is.

    Between'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'editions so I''m skeptical now.

    Okay. So this is a fancy looking'
  persid: ''
- desc: cover for the dish anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so basically there there

    are 13 chapters. So we''re gonna'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'focus on the first I would say

    nine chapters. And then touch on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things from the last for this

    course of the semester so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: have 26 meetings
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm gonna take
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pictures and post them. I

    upgraded my website to bootstrap'
  persid: ''
- desc: '5.2. And so where I put the

    media in the carousel was going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very fast by default, so I had

    to find out what option had'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'changed so it wouldn''t give you

    seizures. It almost did me'
  persid: ''
- desc: the important things.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I believe it''s web GL 2.0 is

    based on OpenGL'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ES three point out and this has

    been'
  persid: ''
- desc: around for
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a while which I think started

    with Silicon Graphics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or they were one of the

    companies involved. So when I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'taught computer graphics, last

    time, there weren''t really GPUs'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'around. So concepts are the same

    but implementations are a little'
  persid: ''
- desc: different.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re going to focus on the

    graphics programming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re also want to leverage your

    past experience'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so you''ve been doing things with

    React'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and no JS Right. So there''s lots

    of different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'load lots of different

    libraries. 3d Jas there''s.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ll talk about we''ll talk

    about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'concepts and do some programming

    with in WebGL. But the details'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of environment will be not so

    important.'
  persid: ''
- desc: seem okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any questions?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'My writing still legible maybe

    that last line does'
  persid: ''
- desc: need some help.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. So in the text we talk

    about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Babylonians and the ancient

    Greeks who drew pictures to'
  persid: ''
- desc: communicate ideas
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if I''m drawing a picture to

    say here''s my house. Cats a'
  persid: ''
- desc: little bit more
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more abstract. And it''s not very

    accurate. So you wouldn''t take'
  persid: ''
- desc: measurements so if
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''d said Well, here''s this isn''t

    really my house. I''m not gonna'
  persid: ''
- desc: try and draw my house.
  persid: ''
- desc: In case you're wondering.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe that's a better detail.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m still dragging on the

    board but the theme is this one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give more. Does this one read

    like it''s a flat drawing are?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The city folk something that''s

    three dimensional.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there''s a couple of things

    going on here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the text to talk about a

    pendant plotter model. So this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is like our whiteboard model.

    Graphic system. So we''re just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tracing out shapes on the board

    on the whiteboard with a pen.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'The pen and a plotter would be

    more accurate because it''s like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a CNC kind of device. I mean,

    it''s plotters controlled by'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computers, so the movements are

    quite precise. I''m not very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'precise drawing with a

    whiteboard. So if I''m drawing on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the whiteboard or drawing pen

    plotter'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there is no limit to the

    complexity of the image'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because the last thing prints

    out, I guess I could change the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pen. I mean, there''s I guess

    there''s some practical limits,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but theoretically, there aren''t

    so many. You can just keep'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trying and the paper will. As

    long as paper doesn''t come'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saturated with ink. It can keep

    drawing a very complicated'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'picture. So in terms of computer

    graphics displays, we don''t have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that luxury. Because we know

    that we have to keep refreshing'
  persid: ''
- desc: the screens on our displays.
  persid: ''
- desc: There's two kinds of limits
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the first was a cathode ray

    tube'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Those are both V''s once a V ones

    are I can say the baby food was'
  persid: ''
- desc: not ours. Anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: 'soon as you remember if you ever

    heard of Ivan Sutherland'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Sketchpad system I bet I could

    find a video to post about.'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1963 Here''s a vector display and

    the idea is dependent the light'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on the display could follow it

    anywhere because it''s just it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'moving like on a surface level

    of paper with like a pen and a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'potter so the electron gun is

    exciting phosphorus on the back'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the display. But it can the

    whole display is coded and so it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can drive very complicated

    shapes like we can with a pen.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s what''s the limitation

    of cathode ray tube in terms of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'complexity? So if the phosphorus

    gets six excited, doesn''t have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to keep and remain excited. It

    loses this synergy after a while'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of display will fade. So if

    you want to keep the same'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'picture on the screen, we have

    to refresh it. So that''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'practical limit. So we don''t

    have any'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can we don''t have any

    geometric constraints, except'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that the whole shape needs to be

    drawn within the time it takes'
  persid: ''
- desc: to refer
  persid: ''
- desc: 'before it begins to fade again

    so that makes sense. So a raster'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'display makes things into a

    grid. So rosters related to'
  persid: ''
- desc: rake.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can imagine ranking lines in

    the sand perhaps I''m not sure I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'remember that. The connection

    with raking but I''m not sure'
  persid: ''
- desc: what the metaphor or how
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about what''s the best way to

    communicate that to present is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that so then on a CRT we had a

    shadow mask so and I''ll have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll show some pictures next day

    about this so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the idea is that we can have

    a pattern so again, the problem'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is about going from the top to

    the bottom of the screen within'
  persid: ''
- desc: the time it can be refreshed.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this case
  persid: ''
- desc: 'trace a line and then go on to

    the next one. So with the vector'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'display, retracing out just the

    geometry of the picture we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wanted this that we have in mind

    so like I wanted to show this in'
  persid: ''
- desc: a beautiful image of this house.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then I would just program these

    movements for the electron gun'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and if it can be done quickly

    enough then this image will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'appear to stable on the screen.

    But if I''m doing it with with a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'raster system and I''m going

    through scanning each line so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s nothing here until I get

    to this point'
  persid: ''
- desc: when that gets communicated
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a system to focus on the

    beams on a particular part of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the screen. It''s called a shadow

    mask. So we''re going to activate'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to fix the point on the screen

    here and then scan to the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'line. And wherever there''s a

    line then we''re going to turn on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the dot and we''re going to

    energize the God on the screen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'corresponding to this point in

    the drawing. So we''re converting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things from a mathematical

    description, to'
  persid: ''
- desc: do discrete
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample versions. This is a

    process called scan conversion.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''re scanning and converting it

    into display. We''re converting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this ideal version of the house

    into something that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discretized for the display

    we''re using'
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: So over time we've gotten
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so the first way is just had an

    offer non color so two colors so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that could be wrecked. We could

    represent that with one bed. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then it might have been a color

    on the screen might have been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'orange or it might be green. But

    it was just a new one. And so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'over time we''re able to when we

    do the color color monitors. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have red, green and blue dot for

    each point on the screen and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they can be excited to different

    levels. And so the standard way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ve talked about computer

    graphics, we use eight they''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'been through each have red,

    green and blue. So that gives us'
  persid: ''
- desc: '256 Color 256 levels for each of

    the red, green and blue and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'together that gives us about 16

    point 7 million colors there''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'more than we would need and

    we''ll talk about that some more'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we can think of vector and

    raster or bitmap images as two'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'important distinctions about how

    images are how we can represent'
  persid: ''
- desc: to store and to display images.
  persid: ''
- desc: So anyone familiar with pixels?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What''s a pixel? Sorry, I didn''t

    hear you. I heard an answer. Go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ahead. Yeah. Well this

    presentation on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen as well as part of a

    screen so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what does that give us what we

    need to work?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So let me say Excel is short for

    picture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, so smallest part of the

    screen smallest.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Smallest addressable
  persid: ''
- desc: pixel how to shape
  persid: ''
- desc: you agree with that okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So there is a big discussion

    years ago so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s say according to Barry

    Smith'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was at Pixar. I''m not sure. I

    have to look him up again.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, so his argument was the

    pixels don''t have geometry'
  persid: ''
- desc: because there are samples
  persid: ''
- desc: so when we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you seen in place seen the

    images on the web for example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that start out to be square and

    rectangle and somebody''s face'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gets stretched to have my

    favorite BIM through some kind'
  persid: ''
- desc: of science fiction
  persid: ''
- desc: device.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So a fan sending that 16 By nine

    which is I think the resonator'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'aspect ratio of a 4k display so

    to make it simple we could have'
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're going to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Go. Did I do my math right 16

    times 990 plus 5444 34 zeros so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when you''re creating an image so

    there''s a sampling quantization'
  persid: ''
- desc: or precision?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s a question mark at the

    end I think that should be timed'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quit a five minutes early.

    Anyway, so that makes sense. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we''re talking about

    capturing an image so, you have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a special resume resolution and

    are going to sample the image'
  persid: ''
- desc: the phenomenon
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and in this case, we''re going to

    have 141.4 4 million samples'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'forgot to the decimal point

    correctly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we decide which which

    precision to record each of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those samples. So if we just

    stored one bit, then it would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's either on or it's off.
  persid: ''
- desc: We can go up
  persid: ''
- desc: '24 bits gives us a lot more.

    Precision gonna be so eight'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bits. Red, Green and Blue. This

    is not the state of the art'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anymore. I think talk kids are

    common. book mentions 12 beds'
  persid: ''
