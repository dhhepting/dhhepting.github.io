- desc: Some of these dry erase markers are more reasonable than others. Don't be
    negative anyway so we talked about last day so I was so we have to know which
    is which and be mindful that there are two ways to two valid ways to have coordinates
    okay so which is this one so x and y and Zed goes into the screen goes away from
    us with a right handed coordinate system x times y Zed points out so this would
    be
  persid: ''
- desc: this would be the right hand system that way what do you
  persid: ''
- desc: think I had this worked out should be x? So the one with the wonder I'm doing
    this three axes. This is one it's new to me. I always thought of x times x cross
    y and then this downward points in the positive direction
  persid: ''
- desc: So, x cross y so this is the left handed coordinate system
  persid: ''
- desc: so x and y and Zed that works an X and Y and Zed works x is your thumb that's
    why,
  persid: ''
- desc: why is your index finger and your middle finger Z positive Zed
  persid: ''
- desc: oh no no it's not see it said
  persid: ''
- desc: we supposed to spell things with the EU like colors with the EU and the last
    letter no but is that that might also be because it's French
  persid: ''
- desc: you have some skeletons in Canada from French. So you see this for center
    sometimes anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: feels like like a Star Trek show or a greeting that some alien races Star
    Trek anyways,
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't wanna get too far off track. So left handed and right handed. So we
    have to know what which one are dealing with or
  persid: ''
- desc: so that we can
  persid: ''
- desc: keep keep a standard standard. So what are the what's the benefit? That we
    can keep the understanding of how
  persid: ''
- desc: white how points are organized in the model?
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's the question. So when we're
  persid: ''
- desc: thinking about modeling objects in computer graphics, then
  persid: ''
- desc: we don't so if you want to model this table, we don't do this. There's no
    hard surfaces involved.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how do we so the property is a service you'd like to model is
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's it's not it's completely opaque so you weren't let's think about the
    first first thing we talked about last day. In our first example code
  persid: ''
- desc: cube what what properties of the cube
  persid: ''
- desc: Do you want to preserve
  persid: ''
- desc: my making sense of my questions.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm trying not. I'm trying to encourage some answers.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what did we notice about the order of
  persid: ''
- desc: points affecting the way the cube was drawn? So let's go back. Let's have
    a peek at our example from last Day. should do 10 minutes here
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's no password see if you click on attendance yourself you can just
    get to the screen
  persid: ''
- desc: I tried when I tried to shoot well, I didn't. I didn't exhaust every possibility
    but I was trying to get the QR Code image to show up and then I was trying to
    get with the scanner on my phone and it would take me to your courses but then
    you would have me do the the two factor authentication and then I wouldn't I couldn't
    get back onto the attendance page. So anyway there is a QR code.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is the original one and then we I made a change. Then we see we haven't
    changed the points. But the order of points has created
  persid: ''
- desc: a problem with the geometry because we have some conventions that we're not
    following anymore. Let me change this to the lines reaching into points. Should
    come back
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: remember what a mistake I've made in declaring?
  persid: ''
- desc: Are Did I do something different? Morning? Let's common without even see if
    again. Think points may not work. Yeah, I just want to
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's different colors for each vertex.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we notice from that other example that
  persid: ''
- desc: the other one has vertices out of my vertex out of order
  persid: ''
- desc: what do you notice here about the colors? Gradients?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so the gradients and some some corners and edges are
  persid: ''
- desc: can't stop this one. You can see this quarter is nice. But other ones. You
    can see the artifacts of the triangle of the way the colors are being blended.
    Across triangles.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay so if we take
  persid: ''
- desc: the points from here
  persid: ''
- desc: so, let's go through them and check that so why don't we start from the bottom
    point five minus point five minus point five. That's correct.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then this one is not the same
  persid: ''
- desc: point 5.5 minus point five
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's try that again.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, we can fix it. So these are all the same notes are all the same. So
    at the front, the points in the front face and then the points in the back face.
    A different set and then here we see the same pattern minus zero from start out
    with this point minus minus and then we have x is minus and y is positive and
    then x and y are positive and then x is positive and y is negative. do that same
    thing okay. So
  persid: ''
- desc: selling better
  persid: ''
- desc: so six sides off triangles. So one of the issues here is that we're using
    triangle fans so what is that? Doing?
  persid: ''
- desc: Triangle? Fan
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can save some space here right so what if we? So if we start here we
    can represent maybe let's start. Let's start where we can see let's start with
    this point
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can specify a fan and that gets three or six of the 12 triangles involved.
    So a fan is retaking. triangles that have a common vertex and then if we went
    on the other side of the cube so. So you can also
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe it's better this way
  persid: ''
- desc: can make we can save some space in modeling in the number of vertices we use
    based on careful placement of careful arrangement of the vertices Computer habit
    out for me Let's go back
  persid: ''
- desc: to our cube here and. Okay, so we have four dimensional four by four matrix
    and these matrices are in column major.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that means
  persid: ''
- desc: from we read the first four elements are the first column, second for the
    second column, third column, fourth column So, notice the last entries in the
    first two columns are zero.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that means that we're dealing with
  persid: ''
- desc: transformations that are going to preserve lines and then the other feature
    here's the last column zeros and then finally one. So this if it's if we end up
    if there are multiplications with a value that's not one we'll divide through
    by it to be able to express points with with w equal to one.
  persid: ''
- desc: So these are the points so here we're doing rotation
  persid: ''
- desc: we can do scaling as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: If we wanted to scale so for scaling, so what is this matrix do? How do we
    know this? What's another name for this matrix? Now what if he wanted to scale
    an axe? Where would I? Well, where would I put that information? So
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm gonna scale quantity along the x dimension.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm changing one value in which which column and row would I change this one
    this one okay, is that am I changing?
  persid: ''
- desc: X or is that going to change said
  persid: ''
- desc: let's make it twice as big Okay, so if we have x y Zed One? Does that make
    sense okay so that's how what if we want to change why it's not that one the sooner
    that one. Yeah. So that so the interesting thing that we can do was
  persid: ''
- desc: almost genius coordinates is we can specify a translation in
  persid: ''
- desc: in the same matrix so what we're going to look at the values here in this
    the first three values in the last column
  persid: ''
- desc: so what translation should we
  persid: ''
- desc: apply anyone want to
  persid: ''
- desc: suggest some numbers?
  persid: ''
- desc: About
  persid: ''
- desc: a four, two
  persid: ''
- desc: so then x prime becomes so it's x. We don't take any wires that contributions
    but then we add eight to it and then for y for y know Zed plus four and Zed is
  persid: ''
- desc: two Zed plus two.
  persid: ''
- desc: And we end up with one. So with this single matrix,
  persid: ''
- desc: and we've we've Express we've done scaling and translation. And here's the
    way we would
  persid: ''
- desc: specify rotation around different axes. So those rotation matrix matrices
  persid: ''
- desc: so what's, what are we rotating? around with a matrix like this where's the
    center of rotation? Get on rotates around on the x axis. at the origin.
  persid: ''
- desc: So rotating around positive X axis but it's
  persid: ''
- desc: we're not off somewhere in space. We're at the origin of the coordinate system.
    So if we do X Y or Zed we're always rotating around this
  persid: ''
- desc: center so because we have a coordinates to find the word driving the queue
    equally around the center sort of rotating around.
  persid: ''
- desc: can see that we're always rotating around please position the cube at the
    origin of the coordinate system.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what are the rotating it stays in the middle so what if you want to rotate
    around a different point? So
  persid: ''
- desc: that's for everyone. corrode hair I'm different. Why do we need translation?
    matrices? So this origin of where do you want to translate? Let's try two in the
    x direction
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. So it's doing some translation would it be good for us to put things
    back?
  persid: ''
- desc: This is Art inverse Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: well, we're out of time. So we'll talk about changing the center of rotation.
    Next day be a little more we'll get to see more material on Thursday. Thanks for
    today and we'll see you on Thursday.
  persid: ''
- desc: What about the second segment it's not a website to do. I talked about it
    in class last day
  persid: ''
- desc: on the board, so I'll write it out onto the website and get back to my office
    Your time is they thanks have a good rest of your day.
