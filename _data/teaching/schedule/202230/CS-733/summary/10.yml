- desc: today so I didn't hear back from anyone about the assignment one right so
    today when try this one
  persid: ''
- desc: yes we weren't sure if the colors should be all or we should make separate
    colors separate programs it should be like this should it be like this or should
    there be three colors
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah okay so I first of all I want to check whether this is working for you
    yeah it's not working for you it's working so what how's it going wrong there's
    an error for me so let's just say that it can open a WebGL to context
  persid: ''
- desc: the submission are there we supposed to do things or
  persid: ''
- desc: not so you also have computers science account right no
  persid: ''
- desc: we have accounts here okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so GitHub is fine See, you're all being very quiet in class. So doesn't help
    me understand what's going on. So, I mean, as computer science students, me being
    a former computer science student, I understand that
  persid: ''
- desc: introverted is is the way to be is the predominant mode of being so This is
    a little bit of a DM here on what's going on that's just to be a smiley face.
    Yeah. Okay, so let me know what's going on so NEMA when we looked at things yesterday
    there were some things that worked for you and some things that didn't so what
    about the things that we're working
  persid: ''
- desc: on some codes
  persid: ''
- desc: I can see that there's
  persid: ''
- desc: anyone else having problems but it's still it's still generating yet tools
    fail to load source
  persid: ''
- desc: short we don't have to install any mGluR new instance you have yet just using
    browsers
  persid: ''
- desc: so having
  persid: ''
- desc: a think about
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so the browser's working for MTV sofritas I'm not sure but yeah like
    you Well, I'm also not using rules so that loads the source that's a good thing
    anyway. Just close this
  persid: ''
- desc: using different browsers
  persid: ''
- desc: Chrome is a new web console just buy
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's work on a gamma Yeah, okay. So
  persid: ''
- desc: the thing is that my company is fine it's just
  persid: ''
- desc: over caring about ever getting a picture
  persid: ''
- desc: that's less yesterday I can say
  persid: ''
- desc: be able to go Yeah, that's an issue because the code is running so you're
    getting good. value associated as the GPU is making
  persid: ''
- desc: sure they need to get the gun strips The first thing he sees was Kenny was
  persid: ''
- desc: on fire another thing we can talk about searching for that message. But it's,
    it's not related to the worksheet. So it should be fine.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. Just wants to know if for the assignments. This is the output like one
    corner and then like unknown another corner or are you seeing this? You have three
    columns.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I haven't forgotten What's your question?
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is the output we live in. No, we'd like this.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. Hello, let's look at the source for this. So my first question to you
    was about whether you could run this so everyone's able to see this picture. Okay,
    so that okay, that's first thing
  persid: ''
- desc: to work on Tuesday, but we need to do an assignment he will explain it
  persid: ''
- desc: to us one. Going to put a checkmark there that everyone is just the bird confirming
    that this is.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so what I asked for was, what about adding three or nine colors, right?
    So let's look at the source code here. Okay, so we're doing one color here. The
    fragment color is going to be red. So we looked at examples of how to make different
    colors, right? So I'm asking you to combine that code with put the ad add the
    color changing code into this framework.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so what I so what I'm working on for the structure is I'm going to put
    the code that we're modifying into meetings. And I'll rename them. But I've got
    comments here, but Where'd they come from? So this is the author's gasket one
    dot HTML file from Chapter Two code.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I've listened to ES lint for advice about how to write the JavaScript.
    So I've cleaned up lots of things here. Well, this isn't the job. This is HTML.
    You can see it more here. So I'm using single quotes for strings or not. I've
    taken out the extra semicolons.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this one is this one is just dealing with positions and regenerating 10,000
    positions. So you're we're setting up the GL context, graphics context.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's interesting. If I did the Unicode, and was the accent and then
  persid: ''
- desc: it says, so can you assume that
  persid: ''
- desc: sounds like a good idea. It's, I just think it's me who needs to zoom things
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so we have the variables with global scope here and then so I'm, I'm
    cute, I'll investigate why this isn't showing up as the proper Unicode character
    with the end with the accent. Anyway, so we have three vertices minus one minus
    101, and so forth. Uses first vertex as a starting point. We add that first for
    starting point to the positions array. And then we want to compute the next position
    by choosing one of the three vertices and then moving the point halfway towards
    that new vertex. That's what this says and then add that new position to the add
    a new point to the position that's great.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what's the way to add color based on based on how regenerating let's say
    we want this one, this area to be red,
  persid: ''
- desc: green, and blue. So how do we decide which colors to? Any thoughts about that.
    So we looked at two models. So we did a single color in the vertex and fragment
    shader, right.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then we also did a we associated color with each vertex. That's the other
    model that we used.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's go back and say, so we had three vertices. So this is vertex zero,
    right? Because it's minus one minus one. And then the next vertex is zero and
    one. That's this one. And then the third vertex is one minus one. That's this
    one. So how are we using the vertex numbers in this code?
  persid: ''
- desc: which variable are we? Already using to select the vertex so remember, we're
    starting with vertex or was it we're starting with vertex zero. That's our starting
    point.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's let's trace a bit of this code. Okay, so we're doing a for loop,
    sorry, i equal to zero. So i is the index and the positions array.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that means we're going to first access the starting point. And what else
    goes on here? What's the variable reuse? What is J used for?
  persid: ''
- desc: The next point.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's contributing to the next point. So what's what are the possible values
    for J? Let's ask that question for the random functions zero. Yeah, so random,
    it goes between zero and one. And then we're saying multiply by three, so we're
    getting good values between zero and three are 01, and two. So J is selecting
    the next vertex. So let's pick so for tracing this code, so we're going through,
    we're starting position zero. So we're accessing our starting point. And we're
    choosing one of the vertices so 01 Or two. So what's the value for J?
  persid: ''
- desc: Let's simulate a random number one, okay. So then we're going to this so we're
    adding these two together, and then we're multiplying by half.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's half the distance between this point and this point, which is going
    to be here, right? So that's right on the edge. But let's say because we were
  persid: ''
- desc: we've picked vertex one What color should we assign to that point? If we if
    we follow this I won't read. So then we can create another buffer for colors and
    ratting points. So I guess we could say the starting point would be green, and
    then they could do red. And then if we
  persid: ''
- desc: say go back, if we say pick, point two, then I mean vertex two, and we get
    a blue color. So a way to add the colors is keeping track of what's going off
    and transformations and then adding elements to the colors array that match the
    points.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? yes or no okay so let's let's take some time today and
    go through that then
  persid: ''
- desc: so I just encourage you from going forward that we ask questions before assignments
    due and let me know if you're having problems okay I don't bite I looked like
    maybe I do sometimes but
  persid: ''
- desc: so I just want us to get some hands on experience here and learn by doing
    all questions are welcome even though I ended up with I end up breaking some examples
    I'm will fix them together and let me see how well I can do here now that I know
    where the Windows PowerShell
  persid: ''
- desc: is no I think I've been a little coffee today so I apologize for that need
    to make an alias for this I don't have to Okay. Okay how's that for disability
    any questions? You Okay let's leave this terminal here let's go to the
  persid: ''
- desc: JavaScript file okay so let's make an array for colors that seem okay so let's
    so do you need vector two or what size vectors should we have two colors so we
    can do four because they were good do RGB and alpha
  persid: ''
- desc: so, what color should the first one be we don't have to do this okay what's
    the value for the red channel? It says the audience participation time numbers
    between zero and 1.5 Okay next there aren't any wrong answers as well. If you
    give me an average of not between zero and one that's the wrong answer. Any numbers
    between zero and 1.5 Maybe we'll just go through that list so he said one five
    so by bar for this next 1.6 9.69 Okay JT point eight
  persid: ''
- desc: '283'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay Next is 0.04 okay who's next okay
  persid: ''
- desc: okay are you thinking okay, not one but next 2.4 Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: fine 26
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay so now we have three colors Everyone okay so what is the line what are
    we going to do here add colors
  persid: ''
- desc: so which color so we're going to associate we've defined three colors for
    the three vertices now how do we record the color for the next vertex for the
    next point that we're generating
  persid: ''
- desc: going to do with the value of j so let's try that V collars okay so now we
    need encode associate or colors with shaders okay so make a buffer and called
    C buffer so we're doing a creating buffer and then binding the buffer
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're that's what we're dealing with so we're not just two dimensions we
    have four dimensions right so before they're
  persid: ''
- desc: actually To be enough and then we say so look all right okay so now let's
    go back to our HTML file let's change this chord forget so just to be clear if
    we're having problems getting a graphics context you'll see this message what
    do you do the canvas your browser doesn't support the html5 canvas element
  persid: ''
- desc: so now that would be the message you see on the screen instead of a picture
    if you're having problems with getting WebGL setup.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's just comment this out anything you can see that it's going to cause
    problems
  persid: ''
- desc: so look like we've done what we need to do let's see. Strong right okay stop
    the change I should do the JavaScript file And it worked and I didn't make the
    computer beep or so so this can happen that we do things right the first time
    but don't be discouraged if it's not the right if you don't get the result the
    first time so how do we add nine colors what's the way to to make it work with
    nine colors would you buy nine triangle yeah so
  persid: ''
- desc: in a triangle there will be three different colors allow me to cut out the
    middle
  persid: ''
- desc: so this will be 00 anyway so you can see that we can if we keep track of not
    just the last vertex but the one before we can make this so it makes sense what
    you think I'm sure not sure about what
  persid: ''
- desc: to share about whether we have to use three or nine colors are we allowed
    to are supposed to use three colors for the first one and the language on the
    second one
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe go back and see what I said exactly So, aside from the assignment because
    this makes sense and how you would assign colors
  persid: ''
- desc: you can use you can do both with three nines or you can you can do one or
    the other I will add some requirements today so, however you understand this so,
    the show examples of both three and nine colors
  persid: ''
- desc: that would be fine because that makes sense. It's just supposed to be a warm
    up If I didn't change the date. So this is due to this due tonight changes on
    your courses any other questions about this with three new customers the way get
    started
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so here's the example squared dot HTML that we had yesterday and so I've
    printed out some more information here
  persid: ''
- desc: besides the wind so I'm just allowing 10 points I think exit it
  persid: ''
- desc: so once I get to the limit, I say can't store any more points so, printing
    out the most X and Y the relative position so this is x and y is the point in
    the screen inside the browser window and the relative X and Y is related to the
    corner of the of the canvas and then here are the coordinates in the clip coordinates.
    So minus one to one and minus one to one. So what I've done here is I've added
    some I've added the see the content distribution network locations through bootstrap
    5.2, the latest version. So let us look at the code that I have created here
  persid: ''
- desc: or they've modified here so the first part is making it responsive so it's
    I'll give you the link for that. So read some more about it
  persid: ''
- desc: so what is added to the HTML file? So I said it's in the body. Let's use We'll
    make divs and then use the card class and then the header
  persid: ''
- desc: most input and the card body I've made a row so I'm doing in red so one is
    so in a row there are 12 columns
  persid: ''
- desc: so I've allocated for for the display and eight for the canvas here so the
    first blank was for the cascading style sheets she heard me and this last one
    is for the JavaScript
  persid: ''
- desc: So then here's the squared.js that goes with it so I haven't then the ES lint
    on this so I'm just saying Max position and max number of positions and.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you're getting the width and the height of the rectangle from the canvas
    and then on mousedown. So this is the left position and the top position so that
    we're using that
  persid: ''
- desc: sorry our most position becomes real up to the top left corner the rectangle
  persid: ''
- desc: and then here I'm displaying the information shown during this test if index
    is less than max num positions to prevent screen from redrawing when it runs out
    of space
  persid: ''
- desc: which is what happened in the original screen went blank and because of a
    JavaScript error that said they've run out of space
  persid: ''
- desc: so I've added a test here in the listener so I'm not sure not going to process
    the event if it's I don't have any space left to store it
  persid: ''
- desc: and then render it also testing to make sure that I'm not dragged to access
    a point that is beyond an index value that's beyond storage that makes sense
  persid: ''
- desc: so for assignment two I'm going to ask you to do a bootstrap kind of interface
    to a program from Chapter Four see you I haven't added bootstrapped this for that.
    I don't remember if we talked about this one source sure we can Okay, so there's
    another example. So basically, it'll be for the next assignment will be to improve
    the code, the interactive code that is provided it's called trackball I think
    it's name blog. Write that up and post it today. Right be fixed
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's look at that code that's the first one from chapter four so it's
    doing different color for each vertex so here's the other option is to make it
    use solid colors for the vertices Erica we'll start learning and reloading we're
    doing for time, seven minutes Okay, so we have our vertex and fragment shaders
    fix a spelling mistake right away so we're we're using, we're specifying the ad
    rotation angle. And then we're taught we're changing between x, y and Zed axes.
    So we have the angle and then we find the cosine and the sine of the angle. And
    we use that to create these matrices. So we have rotation and x there a rotation
    in y, rotation and Zed, so these are all using the angles in different positions.
    So cosine x x. So anyway, the cosine and the sine, minus side my and then cosine
  persid: ''
- desc: and this one's using the wind, Roger, Y rotation matrix. It's using the value
    from the y. So we have x, y, and Zed, so then, you're using the set of values,
    so we're creating a four by four matrix. They're using a month, how much? And
    what genius coordinates pardon me. So this lets us do the rotation and translation.
    So we don't have any translation. You can see that these are all zeros. So the
    new position each time is this rotating rotation matrix in Zed AMS rotation matrix
    and y times the rotation matrix and X and times the position vector so remember
    the vertex shader is giving us new positions so see if the one they brought is
    better so then our new position is going to be x times b y plus sees that
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm gonna go through and do the multiplication so our new product A so that's
    the way we get so we can compose this matrix so whatever kinds of transformations
    we want to do, we end up with a four by four matrix not usually going to see anything
    we won't put anything here will be zeros at the bottom and a line. This could
    be the translation components, but in general, this is the way we have four by
    four matrix and we're going to multiply and then apply it to the different points
    to get our new points. So that makes sense. So in this case, GL position so that's
    the position we're getting from or that we're giving to the
  persid: ''
- desc: to WebGL, to draw the new position of the cube and here again, we're just
    doing the fragment color does the vertex color that we get and we're getting that
    from a color and we saw how we modified the colors
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway, I guess we're sort of out of time here. So we can take a look at that
    and we'll talk about we'll start talking about the key example next day. So that
    makes sense. So it's helpful today to feel confident about writing WebGL programs,
    more confident about this not really well. So the two examples, so the chaos that
    HTML slash n j s And the subdivide HTML and JS files those give you a basis for
    what we're doing landmass for the assignment so just you just need to modify those
    now the color chaos that's another example of so let's go with that and if you
    have problems and questions post them to you our courses so that everyone can
    see them and maybe contribute to solutions
  persid: ''
- desc: can extend into
  persid: ''
- desc: Sure so we'll do it for the fifth of October and 2359
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: you're gonna talk to me a bit more right I'm not holding on to what Trump
    has to say that I understand it's not easy to always talk so we'll try and I'll
    try and dissuade questions with better check ins gonna be one of the signers okay
    thank you for today say you can be different colors are the same colors that makes
    sense
  persid: ''
- desc: like no I think it is because it is fully occurred to me that because always
    using the previous value for storing suppose every time to check the new position
    we are just taking the previous one for that previous value we just need to do
    it double to nine different colors
  persid: ''
- desc: we can we just talk in the hallway? Yeah, just wait for me to clean up here
    and say. To be with
  persid: ''
- desc: You
  persid: ''
- desc: You
  persid: ''
