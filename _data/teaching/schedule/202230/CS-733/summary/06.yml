- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: I got the meeting names set up from the calendar but there's some issue other
    issues anyway so I'll show you that I have a show that have the grade books Gradebook
    Setup according to the weights we discussed. So participation is 10 marks
  persid: ''
- desc: so there'll be five assignments worth eight marks each. No talk about the
    first one today, and they're spread out over the semester
  persid: ''
- desc: is there a comment? Why no
  persid: ''
- desc: said something okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I propose so I said Minturn date midterm exam to be determined. 10 marks
    so you wrote it out. Thank you very much. The third. Monday the 31st Tuesday's
    the first need to so any discussion about that?
  persid: ''
- desc: We have the other 734. So on November 3, the midterm for that
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: should we make it later you make it the next following week. Next week is
    fall break.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah
  persid: ''
- desc: that could work or that will work okay, any discussion at all Bertha?
  persid: ''
- desc: So now carved in stone
  persid: ''
- desc: let me just change that on here believes now appear in the calendar. So I
    can
  persid: ''
- desc: give a little more detail about this.
  persid: ''
- desc: But to get started. So the program's in chapter two, the code on the interactive
    computer graphics.com website and chapter two talks about generating a gasket
    so do you know what a gasket is? It's something to just seal a joint I guess.
    I'm encouraged to look it up. Let's do it. I think of it like a washer or something
    like that
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah a shaped piece of ring of rubber or the ceiling the junction between
    two surfaces and an engineer or other device.
  persid: ''
- desc: Can you show some images it's not easy to understand. What it is like
  persid: ''
- desc: well so
  persid: ''
- desc: so Pinsky gasket so it's made more properly called a triangle. But it is called
    the gasket because or Benoit Mandelbrot would call it a gasket
  persid: ''
- desc: because of a sense of humor so that shape doesn't look like it would seal
    much. There's holes everywhere. Maybe I shouldn't try to explain Benoit roundabouts
    humor so it's a fractal shape as self similarity, so the whole triangle is repeated
    at different scales. So we can generate the shape and a couple of ways we can
    think of
  persid: ''
- desc: and a few ways we can think of
  persid: ''
- desc: transformations that shrinks space each vertex of the triangles so we take
    the triangle and make 50% coffee here so the whole triangle is made up of three
    copies. One, two, and three. And each of those copies is made up of three copies
    123. So what I want you to do is with the example programs in chapter two, as
    a basis write some code. First use the chaos scheme approach with sets will choose
    at random which which transformation will apply to a point and then we can color
    the point based on the transformation that's used. So we can do more colors than
    three. We can also do nine which would be the last two transformations that are
    applied. So if we do this random application, we're generating points. And so
    the approach is we just generate enough points to fill in the shape.
  persid: ''
- desc: So in this case
  persid: ''
- desc: the three transfer the three parts are equal in size so so each contributes
    1/3 to the whole shape. So we just generate a large number of points and we get
    a shape that's
  persid: ''
- desc: reasonably complete. So the other way to do this is to take points our triangles
    and So an analogy that you can think of is that there are three football players
    on the pitch and the ball gets tossed in to one player. Let's say it starts here
    and this play and then we make another point. If it's it's not a perfect analogy
    because the balls moving. Let's say the players have telepathic powers. They can
    move the ball towards themselves by half.
  persid: ''
- desc: Wow. Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's that one position. We take the ball halfway. Halfway it's moved
    to that player. Flag so with a few points. We don't get the shape but if we have
    enough points, then this kind of shape emerges.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I don't want to
  persid: ''
- desc: talk too much about the algorithms but enough that you get some sense of it.
    That
  persid: ''
- desc: was really complex to understand for me like the cross you have drawn there.
    So what is that?
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's do it. Those are the points are the ball positions and the ball
  persid: ''
- desc: being moved
  persid: ''
- desc: by some fixed Python randomly you have a look at
  persid: ''
- desc: those. So we're moving wherever the ball is time t the next position will
    be past the distance between the current position and the player.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so here's
  persid: ''
- desc: some code. So, the idea is
  persid: ''
- desc: we initialize the first three vertices.
  persid: ''
- desc: So those are the players.
  persid: ''
- desc: permission from teenagers Okay, I'm gonna copy this onto my web page. So we
    can edit this Well that didn't work. I didn't rehearse that. Part.
  persid: ''
- desc: Strive that Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can
  persid: ''
- desc: I won't do this again.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll have things
  persid: ''
- desc: set up on my website. I. Looks better Okay, so we have our fragment shader
    here vertex shader? Going to have to do one more thing
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so the reason that's not defined is that let's try that again I'm just to
    sanity. I'm gonna leave that for now and see whether it's gonna work is not the
    right file. It gives me the budget the file name
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah I just think can choose to envy new great
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks very much so I won't do this again in class let's make a change here.
    Let's do 10 positions
  persid: ''
- desc: let's make the correct size Evening What happened? To my?
  persid: ''
- desc: Computer just not happy with me. Today. Shouldn't shouldn't that work
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm going to start with a computer so you may wonder if I've ever touched
    a computer before. Well, I'm doing have I'm less familiar with Windows computers.
    So that's part of the issue
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway oh that's all right me too. I just killed it so the idea is
  persid: ''
- desc: let's let's start with a point that's going to be on the shape. So let's pick
    this one is P zero and this is for text 123. So some may call it a vertex
  persid: ''
- desc: go ahead to two okay. So we start with this drawing so then we move from point
  persid: ''
- desc: A to point halfway This is between the first point and the vertex so then
    we get the point plank. Okay another vertex find the midpoint between this point
    and the vertex so that's a vote here somebody else give me another vertex one
    one Okay, so if we did one again, the remove that way or the one again or be here
    one moment okay, so now it's getting pretty close to halfway between one and three.
    Now three again. I mean three know what? That's too far. Let's see we're here.
    We have a really are here
  persid: ''
- desc: now let me guess tos.
  persid: ''
- desc: About three now then if we applied a bunch of ones and we get another point
    there. And then if we said twos then
  persid: ''
- desc: get this point, this point, this point
  persid: ''
- desc: if we did the other way, ones that way.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can see that there's a shame
  persid: ''
- desc: developing out of this business requirements we don't get a big sense of this
    structure. We're just putting enough points to fill in the details. We don't we're
    not guaranteeing that we're getting every piece of the shape this way because
    we're just generating points.
  persid: ''
- desc: So an alternative is to think of a triangle and to draw a triangle so we start
    out with this triangle
  persid: ''
- desc: then we can generate three intermediate triangles. So we're copying, copy
    the whole triangle and put it into this spot here.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we can do the same kinds of things. So we
  persid: ''
- desc: we make
  persid: ''
- desc: three triangles again. And each of these sub triangles and we can subdivide
    each of these triangles again we can keep going. So first, we have one triangle
    and then we get three triangles and then we get 927 243. My mouth is still okay
  persid: ''
- desc: and based about three.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this question makes sense how many triangles how many levels do we have
    to go somewhere we're building a it's not a binary to to train every tree
  persid: ''
- desc: in financial players,
  persid: ''
- desc: it's not infinite. So what if the transition so we can do a recursive algorithm?
    So if we have our vertices and minus one minus one
  persid: ''
- desc: equals say.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how do we convert coordinates here into a stopping condition based on based
    on the size of triangle So, question makes sense wrote a time
  persid: ''
- desc: mercifully
  persid: ''
- desc: not immersively for me because I enjoy being here with you
  persid: ''
- desc: for reset
  persid: ''
- desc: you can just forget the issues I had with the demonstrations today. And come
    back Thursday and we'll look at some code and some will be right on track as soon
    as questions
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this isn't I don't mean to make the assignment is just a way to get started
    and doing some things. So it's a little bit of a little bit of brief revisions
    and commenting for the code that generally exists in chapter two. Okay, anyway,
    thank you for today. Take care everyone and see if there's any and I do have office
    hours if you want to be able to come and see me so I've updated the pictures on
    the web. And I'll get the other stuff sorted out.
