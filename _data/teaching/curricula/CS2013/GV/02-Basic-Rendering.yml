  desc: "This section describes basic rendering and fundamental graphics techniques that nearly every undergraduate course in graphics will cover and that are essential for further study in graphics. Sampling and anti-aliasing are related to the effect of digitization and appear in other areas of computing, for example, in audio sampling."
