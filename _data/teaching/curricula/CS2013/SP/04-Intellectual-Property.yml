  desc: "Intellectual property refers to a range of intangible rights of ownership in an asset such as a software program. Each intellectual property 'right' is itself an asset. The law provides different methods for protecting these rights of ownership based on their type. There are essentially four types of intellectual property rights relevant to software: patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks. Each affords a different type of legal protection. See cross-referencing with the Information Management (IM) Knowledge Area."
