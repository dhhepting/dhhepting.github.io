  desc: "Sustainability is characterized by the [United Nations](http://grawemeyer.org/1991-the-united-nations-world-commission-on-environment-and-development/) as 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.' Sustainability was first introduced in the CS2008 curricular guidelines. Topics in this emerging area can be naturally integrated into other familiarity areas and units, such as human-computer interaction and software evolution. See cross-referencing with the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Software Engineering (SE) Knowledge Areas."

topics:
- label: t01
  desc:  Being a sustainable practitioner by taking into consideration cultural and environmental impacts of implementation decisions (e.g. organizational policies, economic viability, and resource consumption).
- label: t01
  desc:  Explore global social and environmental impacts of computer use and disposal (e-waste)
- label: t01
  desc:  Environmental impacts of design choices in specific areas such as algorithms, operating systems, networks, databases, or human-computer interaction (cross-reference SE/Software Evaluation/software evolution; HCI/Design-Oriented HCI/sustainability)
- label: t01
  desc:  Guidelines for sustainable design standards
- label: t01
  desc:  Systemic effects of complex computer-mediated phenomena (e.g. telecommuting or web shopping)
- label: t01
  desc:  Pervasive computing; information processing integrated into everyday objects and activities, such as smart energy systems, social networking and feedback systems to promote sustainable behavior, transportation, environmental monitoring, citizen science and activism.
- label: t01
  desc:  Research on applications of computing to environmental issues, such as energy, pollution, resource usage, recycling and reuse, food management, farming and others.
- label: t01
  desc:  The interdependence of the sustainability of software systems with social systems, including the knowledge and skills of its users, organizational processes and policies, and its societal context (e.g., market forces, government policies).
