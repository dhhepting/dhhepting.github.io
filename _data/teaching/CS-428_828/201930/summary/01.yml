- desc: Maybe Ill put it up here. Okay, so in 2019 we have 26

    meetings and heres our schedule. So the first meeting today I

    kinda have a feeling that microphones helping. Is that true?

    Yeah. Okay so our first meeting today now the big on everything

    that I envision being there is there so muchmaybe I didnt say that Okay, so
    maybe Ill just fix this right

    away so I did an underscore instead of a hyphen was a problem.So Im using Jekyll
    as a static site builders anyone encountered

    the static site builders are particularly Jekyll. And what do

    you think of not not mine, but your experience with it? Do you

    like it or is kind of weak to build something. Okay. change and

    to changeSo if Im trying to think of this as a teachable moment here we

    have a rapidso when were iterating, so I dont have this. This is an

    environment that lets me change things quite quickly so I dont

    have to become attached to it. So its its a good environment

    for doing some prototyping and experimenting because I can make

    changes and accept what Im doing in front of class. It goes

    quite quickly. I apologize for the Capel.So while were waiting for that, I thought
    Id show you go

    through the syllabus.
  persid: ???
- desc: 15pm. So,

    September 5 today until December 26. No, theres 26 meetings.

    And our last meeting is December 5. And our final exam is

    December 19 2pm, to 5pm. So I have a couple office hours or a

    couple of blocks of Office Hours 1030 to noon on Mondays and one

    to 230 on Wednesdays that seem feasible for everybody. If it
  persid: S01
- desc: doesnt work, and you want to get ahold of me outside of class,

    you can do that as well. So its not a problem, but Ill be

    there eagerly awaiting visitors during those times. Does

    everyone know? Were computer science were calling us 308 point

    two two is I used to say that it was in the alphabetical section

    of the department but its not anymore because Dr. haber moved

    so messed up the the ages were enough back lawyer but so in case

    youre looking forso heres the CS now. Heres the womens washroom mens
    washroom

    stall. These are important drivers. Here, us the hallway. Thats

    my rendition addition to the floor plan, the pertinent parts of

    the floor plan.Okay.So office hours you can use Call us an office phone number.
    Send

    me an email.So were going to use your courses. And I havent set up your

    courses yet with your enrollment. So Im going to do that

    tonight. So tomorrow and certainly by Tuesday, well see the all

    the details of where youll have access to the, to the course,

    and grade book, and so forth. So the content for the course is

    going to be on my website that I just added. And itll be,

    thatll be published later today. So you can access that as

    well. So those are the two URLs that I have for the website. SoI really like the
    quote that follows is by a guy licklider, who

    was head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects as an

    associate Association in the States, and he wrote this in 1960.

    And I thought its interesting. So Ill just do my dramatic

    reading here. Well, not so dramatic, perhaps. But, in short, it

    seems worthwhile to avoid argument with other enthusiasts for

    artificial intelligence by conceding dominance in the distant

    future of celebration. To machines alone, there willnevertheless be a fairly long
    interim, during which the main

    intellectual advances illuminate will be made by people. And

    computers working together in intimate Association. a

    multidisciplinary study group examining future research and

    development problems of the Air Force estimated that it would be

    1980 before developments in artificial intelligence, make it

    possible for machines to do much above to do much thinking or

    problem solving of military significance that would leave say,five years to develop
    this human computer symbiosis, and 15

    years to use it. The 15, maybe 10, or 500. But those years

    should be intellectually the most creative and exciting time in

    the history of mankind. So we didnt get military really

    significant code computations in 1980. If we had maybe be

    dealing with Skynet as well, for those who like the Terminator

    movies. I had a picture once in the slide presentation. Okay, sothis is going
    to be a practical class that were going to take

    on projects to design to redesign. Well, maybe design but

    redesign interfaces and applications throughout the course of

    several stages, so look at an issue. Im jumping ahead a little

    bit here. So therell be establishing requirements, designing

    alternatives, prototyping and evaluating. So the reason well,

    Ill ask you to take a look at an existing project is an

    existing interface, maybe on the web, or on in some otherapplication, and an application
    thats accessible to people.

    Its not just, its not a bi subscription, something with

    something that is available, doesnt have to be open source

    application. But the idea is that we want to get feedback from

    others. So we dont need to have access to the code where were

    going to do is design improvements to the interface. So were

    going to start from understanding what the problems are. And

    then going on to how how we could improve those interfaces. Andthen creating a
    couple two alternatives, doing a preliminary

    evaluation of them and then creating a more detailed final

    version that will be more like looking at the application

    running on a computer. Although itll be prototyped and wont be

    running on the computer, you will wont be dealing with the code

    from the application, well just be presenting a more authentic

    mock up of the interface. Okay, so thats the bulk of the

    project. Thats what well be doing with the project.So there are other ways.
    So we have opportunities to do some

    writing opportunities to participate in class. So Im going to

    do participation a little differently. Im going to set up

    attendance, so you can take your own attendance in class. And

    then Ill give a few other opportunities to to get some

    participation points. So let me tell you about Korra. The whole

    free break down. So we talked about evaluation. So we can think

    about evaluations being formative and summative. So the firstpart of the formative
    evaluation is, what do we need to do? Are

    we on the right track? And then this summative evaluation

    happens at the end, we say, did we meet our goals? So everything

    up until the final exam is a formative evaluation. And then

    well look at the final exam as being an individual assessment

    of learning. So Id like your help and designing the exams, both

    the midterm and the final exam. And I have a condition that you

    must pass the file and pass the class. So if its close, Im notgonna you dont
    have to worry. I mean, Im not looking for ways

    to fail people. But if, if you have an ad going into final and

    you get a 20 on the final. That should that would give me some

    pause. Okay, that makes sense that, so its a small detail, I

    dont want to I dont want you to be concerned by it. But I just

    want to make it clear that we have that as well.So we have 30% for individual
    assignments, which will be smaller

    assignments really kind of related to the project. And the

    project will be a few, several assignments for different steps.

    So the project, midterm exam will be 10% final exam will be 25%.

    Participation will be 5%. And I have a discretion of 5% plus or

    minus. And so theres also will be an opportunity for research

    credit. Has anyone taken a class from you before and taken

    advantage of the research credit? Well, I know the union ofthose who is going
    to be smaller. But the idea is that we do

    computers, computer science department does research where we

    need to have people come and look at interfaces, perform tasks,

    we had some things with games recently. So we give research

    credit. So if you volunteered as a participant in the study,

    then you get a bonus mark that you can apply to whichever

    classes youre taking the next Second participant pool

    participation. So, this class definitely does, because Im theone who runs the
    participant pool. And so you could if there if

    there is a study, Ill let you know about it. I dont want to

    hear about your participation in the study, if you do decide to

    participate, because this is intended to be an arms length for

    me. So before the end of the semester, Ill get a list of

    participants and then those marks. Okay, so the idea is, its a

    question of ethics, which well discuss a little bit from time

    to time in class. But we dont want to give so much make thebonus so large that
    youre you feel coerced to participate in a

    study. But we dont want to we want to make it not not zero, so

    that, you know, we can acknowledge your participation without

    changing your behavior. So if I said, Ill give you 75% 75 bonus

    marks if you do this for me, how many people wouldnt be

    inclined to do it? No matter? And then we wouldnt be so

    concerned about what I actually wanted you to do? Do you think

    theres a couple of people in front here who are nodding thatthey might do it,
    even though they didnt want to anyone in the

    back, the back is more resolved. more upright, theyre not goingtouse do something
    just for a pass in the class. Thats good.

    Okay, so from the schedule, I can only schedule a few important

    dates. So this is the fifth Ceylan 12 days, which is I think,

    Im gonna have to figure that out. 19 for beats, so its

    Tuesday, the 17th. Im going to go with Tuesday. So thats the

    for add or add or dropping the class, this class or any others

    this semester. And its also the day if youre dropping to get

    100% tuition refund. October 1 is the deadline for 50% tuitionrefund. And were
    15 is the last day to withdraw. So Im not

    gonna w on your transcript or to get a W on your transcript and

    not MP or something like that. So important dates may actually

    go to the correct. I tried to do that. But Im not going to do

    it. You can test it later, if youd like to see if. Okay, so it

    looks a bit better. Were still getting work in progress. So

    whatever.Im connecting the topics with the ACM IEEE curriculum report.

    So Im not going to uncover any more problems with my links

    right now. But before Tuesday, if you clicked on the links at

    all, itll go to the right place. So what I want to do today, so

    are there any questions about the syllabus? So, yes,so you talked about the project?
    Is there gonna be a group

    project?I was just gonna talk about that. So I would encourage you to be

    a group project for for undergraduates, especially if you do so

    what Ive said in the past is if youre doing if youre doing a

    masters thesis or masters or PhD thesis and you have a research

    project that has an interaction, interactive, interface

    component that you can productively study as the project and you

    can do it by yourself, but everybody else should be in a group.

    I think And I know how many people love group projects. I knowyoure all secretly
    putting your hands up. So. So its an

    opportunity to work through to develop some group work skills.

    And well talk about ways to avoid signal problems in the group

    and work through them before they derail that your semester.

    Hows that? Okay, so did the syllabus. So that will be online,

    shortly. So Id like to do today is just talk a little bit about

    human computer interaction. And how does it impact us? And maybe

    we can, we can think about why human centered softwaredevelopment is important.
    And maybe think about why those two

    things are connected.So does anyone have in mind a strong example of a good interface

    theyve used or bad interface?Anything youd like to share? So lets think
    about some of these

    examples. webpage. So there are web pages that are good, and

    some that are less good. What whats an example of a good web

    page? I think thats a good one. The main page for Google

    thinking about how to use real estate, which one here, you want

    to talk about? Thats right. Both of them were sampledtesla.com in a minute,
    and the other examples if you can think

    about what makes a good website, soDon Martin is the genius of this design for
    Google. So you can

    say simple elegance and fortune important.Its also clear what can be done at
    the web on the website. If I

    can search for a Tesla. My son is enamored with tests and

    listen, we were in Vancouver for a little bit and he kept

    wanting to vote.Not so many around here, I think know how they, how they do in

    January and February. Okay, so any other thoughts about good

    websites? You dont have to say that. You know, they wont kick

    you out for saying the University website is not the best. Okay,so lets go to
    the testing website and see what comes up. Lets

    look for Tesla in Canada. So this is also they say, well,

    Google, perhaps is that we can see that. So Elon Musks mum was

    born in Regina. Maybe this is why I dont think she lived her

    very long, but this is why they have an English Canadian version

    on the website. Thats what the E n underscore ca the note.Okay. So what do we
    want to know? So I guess this is the Model S

    model three. Reserve now, only $322,000. Heck, Ill get to. So

    its notits not clear to me that the energy is it looks like energy is

    another model. As you can see a home powered by Tesla. So I

    guess these are solar panels. Our wall solar panel Okay, anyway,

    so sorry, it looks nice does the website but so if we have we

    look at a website without an understanding of a goal in mind.

    And we might focus on different things than like somebody whos

    looking for a Model X as a different experience. And we just

    looking at all the features. So we can evaluate things in termsof a walkthrough,
    you can start to say, heres the interface and

    let me see what I notice. Or I can say, lets have it, consider

    a task. Tell me how much is a Model X. Make sure Im sitting

    down. Right so so we will uncover the different things. So the

    joys of new content This is up close and personal one where the

    classes dont end at the same times. Just one of the many

    features.Okay, so as you have our website is nice as passwords. Theyre

    better than just some previous view of our career coaches

    perhaps better than the actual current that change all as you

    upgrade to the best. Well, thatsthats not what I was. I wasnt thinking about
    your courses, we

    could certainly. And later in the semester, Ill give you get

    you access to your courses course to experiment as a teacher.

    Okay, so this is what I would say is the original website.So rather than Tesla
    its hard to compare. We can we can say

    that we have to come and get so I think if youre late in class,

    you can walk up the stairs and continental side door here. So

    thats the way to go unless you want to be the center of

    attention.So maybe it doesnt look quite as nice as the Tesla website, but

    its not selling us hundreds of luxury cars.But then we need, maybe we can make
    some comments of how it

    looks how inviting it is. Right? So currently, theres only a

    few seconds that people have that a website has to make an

    impression. So based on this first impression, would you

    consider looking further at the University of Regina? So what is

    this some issues?Theres a lot of information on right off the bat. The its

    almost just looking at initially it was those, Id say its

    almost too much to have going on right off the beginning with

    without having a scrolling picture. And theres the I said they

    theyre trying to tell us the bar things like the feature

    stories and upcoming events, but just it just looks like theres

    too much information right off the bat.Its a bit like youre watching, say
    CNN or something like that.

    face, multiple faces and graphic and then they have text

    crawling along the water. This is multitasking, its kind of

    its not always. Sometimes its more fiction than reality.

    Anyway, any other comments like this?So lets take a look at the extractor. So
    the personal website,

    we know were going to go there to buy a car or some sort of

    shingles, silver shingles were our products. What kinds of

    things can we do with the rujak website?Mark different kinds of users that that
    are worried about this

    is the first this will be the lecture that comes as the first

    Google search for you are some people dont go here yet. This is

    the first place. But also this will be the homepage for all of

    the computers at the end, like the different departments if you

    click home, itll probably come over here, right? So they want

    to get links to all of their specific things they use every day,

    but also someone whos considering going here this is the firstpage they hit.
    So its like an ad but it also is more functional

    just like surfing cars.So is it right? Is it a good idea to have so many things
    going

    on? on one page? Or do we want to be on the wrong page the main

    page divided below the I need to bring my cat exerciser. I mean

    laser pointer to be able to do this. I cant wave pointing out

    and I know not to do this. Well, anyway, so split a feature

    stories so that we can Programs your course info visit apply.

    And then we have. So that still gives us the About Us facilities

    and academic properties and academic units. Federal collegesresearch teaching.Okay,
    so lets write and not connected. So I can find a person

    thats worked well enough search classes and build schedule is

    this are getting into maybe something more like a less good

    website. When you have a like this visual Schedule Builder is

    better than what it was before. Just try to register for

    something and have you know, four or five other CRMs friends.

    Stop once.Welcome, try it. Be sure to watch the instructional video before

    you attempt anything. Thats a big claim to that theyre gonna

    find the optimal schedule. Oh, step one. Choose a term. But then

    it says select course. Step three. wasnt too bad. Except I

    wonder what happened to step two. Anyway. So I dont want togive a definitive
    discussion or current list of criteria for

    good websites and bad websites, we need to think about what we

    want to accomplish with them.So its not just websites, it can be mobile devices,
    games.Really, its anything. We talk about interaction, we can think

    about things which go beyond computers, and so is anyone heard

    the phrase Norman door before? So well talk about that. So

    doors without any computer aided technology. CAD isnt Computer

    Aided doors. I just thought Id throw that one out. Anyway. So

    anytime, people are VH contexts rage ci, we have people, h h for

    humans, anything where people are trying to do things using some

    technology. Thats the context that were considering. So if youthink back to
    human centered development, for Software

    especially.So is it important if we involve people in the process of

    designing interfaces?we involve students in the building and creating a visual

    Schedule Builder. For See, what was the other one? Im finding

    classes? And should we have a coffee break? Im just thinking,

    four to 515 is not a great time for high energy, innovation.

    Lets see what is the department? Coffee service? Are we for

    time? So run through the syllabus.And see. So I thought Id just give you some
    other inspiring

    quotes. Well, Ill just give you the link because its five

    oclock already. And its the first day you can find that. This

    is one I like. And I got this from reading a book written by a

    chef. But its a quote this second one is john Muir, who final

    the Sierra Sierra Club. So Im going to try and pick out

    anything by itself, you find it hitched to everything else in

    the universe. So we can we have to think about things for manyperspectives in
    when Im designing interfaces. Anyway, I said I

    was gonna let you go early. So theyll be alright, if we stop a

    few minutes early today.So this microphone still says are you off? And I dont
    know what

    to do with it.So all right, can you bring back the 10 cards, and just leave

    them on the desk here, please. Thanks very much, and well see

    you on Tuesday.To be able to explain
