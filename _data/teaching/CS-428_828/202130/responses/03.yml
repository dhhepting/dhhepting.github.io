important:
- desc: No matter what the design is to be human-centered, we need to repeatedly test
    and get feedback from users in order to improve and refine a better design.
- desc: Today&#039;s meeting was interesting about the Norman door, actually, it happens
    to me many times and that is correct about &amp;quot;Push&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;
    Pull&amp;quot;. Whichever doors are confusing doors are often called Norman doors.
    As the design of the door tells us to do the opposite of what we are supposed
    to do as it gives us a wrong signal. As we can say that Norman has taken a controversy
    in saying that the design research community has had an impact on the innovation
    of products
- desc: The Norman Door is an example of the bad interaction design. Design with wrong
    signal or do not gives feedback when people interact it is considered as a bad
    interactive design.
- desc: about the course description.
- desc: Todays meeting was primarily focused on a video showing a good door design
    and was summarized that a good door has only a push panel as thats all a door
    requires and here door is an analogy for user interface and the single panel design
    showcases simplicity and purpose.
- desc: Norman doors...and how usability could be improved
- desc: Watched the video later on Norman Door and was quite an eye opener. Key from
    the video are the principles of discoverability and feedback.
- desc: In today&#039;s class DR. Hepting was trying to figure out how to resolve
    his website issue. We talked about Norman doors.  Its a door which everyone gets
    wrong. It symbolises a design what if we continually get the something wrong  its
    actually the fault of the design and not the user. And of the the red flags is
    that when everyone gets it wrong then its definitely the designs fault.
- desc: I liked the professor presented us with the video. The video gave me a impactful
    reference to compare the design with the real world(Norman doors)
- desc: 'We talked about Human center design.  What are the bad design door.s    Norman
    doors: A Norman door is one that is badly constructed and leaves you unsure whether
    to push or pull and the design tells you to do the opposite of what you are actually
    supposed to do. This door gives us the wrong instructions and needs a sign to
    correct it. It came from the name of Don Norman that write a book about the design
    of everyday things. In this book, he tries to learn us the principles of correct
    design.'
- desc: Prof had some issues with is website. He discussed about the group and individual
    assignments and lastly he also showed us a video on Norman doors which also had
    issues and we ended up listening just the audio.
- desc: All about Norman doors and just got to know we can have our own website on
    uregina domain. Saves all the AWS costing. Thanks :)
- desc: I watched the youtube video to learn the concept of good design and bad design
    using the norman door example.
- desc: After watching the video, I realized that an obvious and effective slogan
    is very important.This gives people a clear idea of how to use it.
- desc: Learned a case of a design problem, which is Norman doors. Also discussed
    ways to improve door design so that the direction of the door is discoverable.
- desc: 'I suppose this design was intended to introduce an extra step in the door
    opening procedure, a speed bump, if you like, to reduce the possibility of the
    door being opened accidentally. From a usability point of view, we might immediately
    reject any system that should have detailed instructions to inform the user to
    perform a simple task like an interesting idea: the door is designed in such a
    way that it is &amp;quot;less usable&amp;quot; to deter users from using it except
    when necessary.'
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about today&#039;s topic &amp;quot;bad gates&amp;quot;
    because we were only able to listen to the audio but the video was frozen. So
    I want to know more about that.
- desc: I would like to know more about the specifics of the project.
- desc: Today only part of syllabus was discussed and would like to know more about
    the actual topics and chapters that we will be covering in this course. Also would
    like to know more about that is expected in project. I would also like to see
    and know about your website once all the links are fixed.
- desc: The video related to Norman doors mentioned discoverable functions. This suggests
    an end-user that is unafraid to experiment with a system. How do we as UI designers
    encourage this fearless approach required for self-discovery?
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture we didn&#039;t discussed that much. In future, I would
    like to learn more about the websites and their interface designs.
- desc: The syllabus is discussed in the class which includes assignments, projects
    and final exam so I am exited to learn the course by giving my best performance
    in all the work.
- desc: I was not able to attend this meeting due to internet connection and I have
    sent you a mail regarding this. But from my class partners i got to know that
    you made us learn about the Norman view door.
- desc: We know more about project and I&#039;m excited to do project
- desc: We didn&#039;t really cover anything today... I&#039;d like to know more about
    Norman Doors I guess.
- desc: I would like to know more about the video link that professor showed today
    but unfortunately we can watch it but could hear it, so I would just watch it
    and know about it.
- desc: 'The subject description : what we have to done in this course like what type
    of project we have to work on.'
- desc: We discussed about what was taught in previous class, basically Dr. hepting
    designed HTML website where every resource for lectures are available and Today&#039;s
    class we discussed about how norman-door principal is used and what are their
    basic applications on how human-being minds are manipulated by confusing them
    with error in Push &amp;amp; Pull of the Door..
