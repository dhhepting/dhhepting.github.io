difficult:
- desc: "Today\u2019s class discussion was about the modern voicemail and marble answering\
    \ machine. Also i have read the nine dot problem article that means to think out\
    \ of box . I believe when you have to think out of box there is no box or no limits\
    \ to think about a creative idea."
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand is why we never considered making
    a more graphical UI for voicemail. Sure it works fine, but wouldn&#039;t it be
    more nice? Or is the UI just our keypad when accessing our voicemail? I guess
    it works, but it&#039;s not labeled and the options have to be repeated a couple
    times if you miss it.
- desc: The voicemail dilemma was really confusing for me. I feel like the UI for
    that probably can&#039;t be any easier than it already is unless we package into
    a separate application (Which would have major implications on all the existing
    phones)
important:
- desc: "Today we did a little experiment that how zoom\u2019s breakout rooms work\
    \ which was quite interesting and important for understanding the gulf of execution\
    \ and all. We also discussed about project which is again an important thing that\
    \ we have to choose our own groups."
- desc: In todays lecture we discussed about the the breakout room interference and
    also about current voicemail system and some changes that we would except in coming
    years.
- desc: I have read the nine dot problem article , which i found the interesting one
    and  also something new to learn. Its basically a kind of classic lateral thinking
    practice, where we have to think out of the box to solve the shown problem. Though,
    every person has their own way to solve any  issue but i think that when your
    are thinking most creatively there is out of box, it just simply your unique way
    to tackle an obstacle or puzzle.
- desc: When we encounter any design problems, we should change our thinking and direction
    instead of being limited.
- desc: I learned about a new kind of answering machine known as marble answering
    machine today.
- desc: "In today\u2019s lecture we had a discussion about marble answering machine\
    \ and we also talked in comparison with modern voicemail systems. Also also talked\
    \ about history of the nine dot problem"
- desc: First we have discussed about the joining the meeting rooms and did attendance.
    Learning the history of the nine dots problem.
- desc: We talked about the nine dot problem and discussed the influence of Durrell
    Bishop&#039;s marble answering machine today.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture, we just have the group discussion about today topic
    as well as our first individual assignment.
- desc: We had some pretty interesting discussion in the breakout room.
- desc: History of 9 dots. In 1992, Durrell Bishop, then a student at the Royal College
    of Art, came up with an original answering machine design that is considered as
    one of the first tangible user interfaces (TUIs). The machine spits out a marble
    each time an incoming voice message is recorded
- desc: today we have discussed about nine dot problem. we have discussed the way
    of &#039;outside the box&#039; solution for the puzzle and also other ways.
- desc: The most important thing I learned is that the nine dot problem is a classic
    lateral thinking exercise.
- desc: we have discuss about marble answering machine and difference between marble
    and modern answering machine.
- desc: Durrell bishop marble answering machine
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we talked about the nine dot problem which was very
    interesting remembered the old days when we use to do this which requires thinking
    outside of the box. We had a breakout discussion where we discussed about the
    marble answering machine which was a very interesting concept. Though some of
    the features of that concept is already existed there were some new features like
    sorting messages which includes saving important messages &amp;amp; deleting non
    important messages and so on.
- desc: We talked about the marble answering machine and how it can relate to modern
    voicemail systems
- desc: Durrell Bishop&#039;s Marble Answering machine example, discussions
- desc: i learned about the history of nine dots problem
- desc: Was from the history of the nine dot problem. It encourages us to think outside
    the box and we can have many solutions to same problem. Marble answering machine
    was also discussed in the class.
- desc: I have learned about marvel answering machine.
- desc: In Today&#039;s clase we had a really good conversation about how Marble Answering
    Machine concept can be used in today&#039;s world with use of some Arduino + RFID
    + Telecom API Technology. We had breakout group discussion and this was the most
    interesting part of todays class
- desc: Making a suggestion means telling another person what we think that they should
    do or what we think is a good idea. We are giving our opinion about what action
    another person should take. It is important that we are able to make suggestions
    or recommendations because we need to do this often in our professional and personal
    life.
know-more:
- desc: In this session, we continued our lecture about gulf of evaluation and execution.
    We discussed these terms in more details.
- desc: We learned about the 9 dot problem and the marble answering machine. the implication
    and impact of it in the modern voicemail system.
- desc: If the concept from Durrell Bishop&#039;s marble answering machine has been
    used in practice somewhere to make life easier when using answering machines
- desc: Is there a more interesting or creative solution for nine dot problem
- desc: I was not aware of todays discussion topic as I had not seen the video. So
    I will watch the video and would like to know more about it and how Durrell Bishops
    marbel answering machine is similar or different from modern voice mail system.
