difficult:
- desc: 7w8uoe
- desc: Is how to empathize with teachers for that assignment. I have never really
    been in that position, and doing this assignment will help me realize how difficult
    and how much professors actually prepare for us students when it comes to using
    the urcourses moodle site and such.
- desc: How to design a good Empathy Map. The concept is strange to me
important:
- desc: "The reading that compares sympathy and empathy suggests that empathy is more\
    \ valuable than sympathy as it achieves a greater understanding of parties in\
    \ distress. It is crucial to consider needs, abilities and disabilities, and cultural\
    \ backgrounds and experiences of one\u2019s audience with an open mind in order\
    \ to better construct technology to serve them. In order to do this, we need to\
    \ first practice empathy.In UX, empathy helps us to identify not just the instant\
    \ dissatisfaction of our users, but also logic"
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we discussed about the Assignment1 requirements and
    its due date.
- desc: In this we discussed about our first assignment empathy maps, how emapthy
    is different than sympathy, and how UX professionals practice sympathy over empathy.
    Looking at the UX article, the importance of us as computer professionals having
    a good user experience is paramount and something we should strive to deliver.
    i think, without practicing empathy in UX we will not be able to understand how
    people feel and how we can acknowledge them.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture I learned about HCC basic terminologies like 1.Gulf
    of execution - it is the interaction between the user-goals and computer-comments.
    2. Gulf of evaluation is the information given to user about bitmapped display
    from computer as the feedback about the current state of interface.
- desc: Understanding the gulfs of execution and evaluation. Both are vital to a user&#039;s
    experience with an application
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we have learned about the creative confidence and what
    is difference between sympathy v/s Empathy. One should able to solve the particular
    problem with a creativity. &#039;A creative mindset can be a powerful force for
    looking beyond the status quo&#039;. And also waiting for starting the assignment
    which will also test our creative mindset.
- desc: In David Kelley&#039;s video, I learned everyone has creative ideas to help
    others in designing new thing or redesigning. We should have our creative confidence
    and believe we can change the word a litter bit.
- desc: Today&#039;s meeting was about assignment 1 and I learned a figure about gulf
    of evaluation and gulf of execution. Users always face two challenges. Users try
    to interact with the system. User try to give some input to the system and then
    the system gives some feedback to the user. Evaluating the feedback and understanding
    what to do next is the  gulf of evaluation. When user gives input they want to
    understand how to use the system which can be referred to gulf of execution.
- desc: today, I learned about what to expect from the meetings and I am looking forward
    to learn more
- desc: Sympathy VS Empathy in UX
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting professor went over the personal assignment regarding\
    \ and the gulf off evaluation and execution. It describes how to make the prototype\
    \ of what user wants and how to get feedback and improve the products and how\
    \ it is a cycle."
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture was really impressive. We learned about how to build
    creative confidence and also some basics terms of HCC like gulf of execution and
    evaluation. In addition, Dr. Hepting explained about empathy map of the first
    assignment.
- desc: the most important thing I learned was that &amp;quot;New opportunities for
    innovation open up when you start the creative problem-solving process with empathy
    toward your target audience.&amp;quot;
- desc: In  this meeting I learned about the gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution  that
    helps us to figure out the current state of system and what we can do to interact
    with the system and  change it to new state. Successful evaluation requires perceiving
    the system-status indicator and interpreting what it means.   Execution requires
    both planning an action based on an understanding how the controls work, and actually
    manipulating the controls.  Now using a bridge we can support user interactions.
- desc: 1. In today&#039;s meeting I learned about David Kelley and watched the video
    on &amp;quot;how to build your creative confidence&amp;quot;
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting the most important thing i learned is about creative
    confidence, Doug&#039;s story was really very emotional and motivating which illustrates
    that by creative problem solving process we can get ideas for innovation. The
    way in which the healthcare for children and parents were changed the design of
    the rooms was excellent. Moreover, we also discussed about assignment 1 looking
    forward for this activity.
- desc: gulf of execution &amp;amp; gulf of evaluation diagram
- desc: Doug assembled a group of professionals to address the issue, which included
    employees from a nearby science museum, youngsters, and healthcare staff. The
    final outcome was an inventive, design-driven approach that completely altered
    the children&#039;s perspective. Doug is the Lead Design Architect for two important
    innovation accelerators and holds six utility inventions more than 16 registered
    designs. He also educates new product or new as part of GE&#039;s &amp;quot;creativity
    at workplace&amp;quot; campaign.
- desc: Was about gulf of evaluation and gulf of execution. We also talked about interacting
    with the system. The first assignment was also introduced by the professor and
    the use of empathy map in it was also explained.
- desc: It was a good session, we got came to know what we have to do for the assignment,
    also the diagram drawn on the board for easy to understand and came to know a
    things about gulf of execution, gulf of evaluation and still more to learn about
    the user interaction with the computer. Looking forward to learn more.
- desc: Some positive influences are drawn from Doug Dietz&#039;s adventure series.
    First of all, patient satisfaction scores increased by 90%. Children no longer
    suffer from anxiety. Instead, some of them ask their parents if they can come
    back tomorrow. It makes it easier for children to maintain their stability during
    the procedure, which in turn prevents doctors from having to repeat the examination.
    This lower need for anesthesiologists means that more patients can be examined
    each day, which greatly affects the fi
know-more:
- desc: Today we discussed a little bit about empathy map and I know we are going
    to discuss it again on Monday. So, I would like to know more about empathy map
    that how we use it in human-computer communication..
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, I get the information about the empathy map of the
    first assignment.
- desc: Assignment 1 and how to proceed that
- desc: we learned a bit more of the Gulf in user design. but I did go through the
    4th and 5th TED video materials and that was really inspiring and i wanted to
    learn more about how people get the best feedbacks from the users and what are
    some of the best possible ways to approach the improvement process
- desc: For now the assignment 1 is not completely clear to me i.e. what to do. Please
    if more details can be provided on the expectation for this assignment.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, I learned how human and computer machine interact.
    It is also vital to learn how interaction going on between human and computer.
- desc: I would like to know more about the kinds of activities that can be added.
    An example/demonstration would be great.
- desc: I would like to know more about the resources for the course.
