difficult:
- desc: understanding the best design choice for the coffee machine
important:
- desc: Today we again discussed about the coffee machine that how a person can make
    a double double or triple triple. Some people suggested that there should be options
    to doble double or triple triple but then if a person only wants double cream
    how does that going to work. So it was interesting to discuss about the design
    of coffee making machine.
- desc: Today we discussed about how Tim coffee machine interface could be improved.
- desc: We did quite good discussion on the limitations in tim hortons self serve
    interface
- desc: i like how you used the coffee machine to explain the class topic.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we discussed the coffee machine and how to improve
    its interface and design.
- desc: in this session we discussed the design interface of Team Horton&#039;s coffee
    dispenser. We talked about possible improvements that can be done on such devices
    to increase their proficiency.
- desc: We had a discussion on how the milk, cream and sugar dispenser machine can
    be improved.
- desc: importance of design interface and metaphor for self serve coffee machine.
- desc: The importance of communicating with the user more clearly on the function
    of a system
- desc: In Today&#039;s we have discuss an example about Tim Horton&#039;s like how
    it interface while making a coffee or drink.
- desc: We continued the coffee machine today and talked about the metaphors.
- desc: In the class of today, we discussed the metaphors for the interface of the
    lab caf coffee station. The gulf of execution is not properly minimized for the
    interface of the coffee station.
- desc: We talked about our project in group discussion
- desc: more clear on the metaphors and coffee machine example was more clear as we
    progressed
- desc: Metaphors in Lab caf
- desc: I learned about different aspects of designing a vending machine, there should
    be lots and lots of thinking process before designing, like empathy map and gulf
    of evaluation.
- desc: Today we had a detailed discussion on lab-caf interface model with lots of
    new ideas.
- desc: "today\uFF0CI dont have much to say"
- desc: Was opportunities for re designing the tim hortons coffee machine.
- desc: Discussed the design aspects of the Lab Cafe Coffee Machine inside of the
    University of Regina.
- desc: Todays class we discussed and was the most important part was about the Tim
    Hortons Self-Serve machine in our university, What are different possible scenarios
    and their Metaphors &amp;amp; also About Electric Car Dashboard with big screens
    to control
- desc: Today we were diving deeper into the possible solution for Timm&#039;s coffee
    machine. We address a great point about the quantity of sugar. the flaw is we
    do not know the specific amount of sugar. the possible solution would be by disposing  the
    weighted amount of sugar
know-more:
- desc: The metaphors were really interesting. I will look more into videos to better
    grasp this concept
- desc: Not sure at the end of today&#039;s lecture i got a clear idea on what the
    metaphors are to describe the Tim Horton&#039;s machine
- desc: I would also like to analyze more interfaces of different products to make
    the concept strong. Today, we talked about coffee machine interface, and analyzed
    its functioning.
- desc: For today class we had a coffee machine case study, I&#039;m just wondering
    why is the machine dependent on cup size? Isn&#039;t a double double a standard
    of 2 packets of sugar?  It would be better if the machine was labelled with single/double/triple.
- desc: More examples on Metaphore concept
- desc: I am curious what some &amp;quot;metaphors&amp;quot; could be for the cream
    and sugar dispenser interface, as well as which user needs are unmet by such a
    design.
