difficult:
- desc: Acquiring a number of users representive of the target population for evaluation.
important:
- desc: Discussed the topic of evaluation of a interface.
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting, we discussed about evaluation and its two kinds\
    \ that is formative and summative."
- desc: Today, professor talked about the topic interface  evaluation of user and
    data , and their was two kinds of evaluation that is formative and summative
- desc: In this session, Dr. Hepting started to talk about Evaluation and I learned
    so many new things in this regard.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture, we have learned about metaphors, web applications
    example, fitts law and GOMS KLM.
- desc: We talked about the user inputs and response.
- desc: 'Professor discussed about the evaluations of the interfaces. Evaluations
    can be done empirically. There are many ways to collect data in evaluation. Such
    as: open-ended questions, Likert scale. We need a fair amount of sample from the
    real users to perform the evaluation properly.'
- desc: Users evaluation of an interface and how to collect data and information and
    what kind of methods to use whilst collecting and interpreting data.
- desc: user evaluation of designs
- desc: Approach to evaluation, especially looking at it from the empirical and the
    analytical perspective
- desc: 'Today, I understood two kinds of evaluation: formative and summative. Moreover,
    Professor also discussed the application of those kind in human computer interface.'
- desc: The most important thing I learned about today&#039;s class was about how
    crazily dependent we are on technology these days.
- desc: today we have discussed the evaluation of the interface which includes how
    it gets evaluated and what factor matters in this process?
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we leant about the collection of data regarding user
    interaction and how it could help us in making better platforms
- desc: Today&#039;s class was a reflection on how we are dependent on technology
    and how to talked about kinds of evolution formative and summative
- desc: Today we talked about evaluation of design in detail.
- desc: Process of evaluating the design
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we discussed about the project and project&#039;s
    grade.
- desc: Discussed a method for collecting and evaluating user feedback.
- desc: Today&#039;s class was very interesting as we were teach in the old school
    way instead of learning it digitally, Teacher helped us learn it on the white
    board discussing about metaphors on Professors website and the issue with upcoming
    activity today. I am so interested to learn more in this way as it helps remember
    more than digitally (Screen share)
- desc: Software design and estimation play the key role for software development
    process. Different methods are used for architecture design and detailed design
    evaluation. For architectural design stage a technique that allows selecting and
    evaluating suite of architectural patterns is proposed. It allows us to consistently
    evaluate the impact of specific patterns to software characteristics with a given
    functionality. Also the criterion of efficiency metric is proposed which helps
    us to evaluate architectural pa
know-more:
- desc: We discussed about evaluation today which was nice but I want to know more
    about our next assignment which is due next week I think, so are we going to discuss
    that in class or should we just read the instructions on your website and start
    doing that?
- desc: Can you explain the next group project to the class ?
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, the professor showed us the evaluation of users and
    data.
- desc: Today I learned about evaluation and would like to know more about the process
    that goes into evaluating a interface.
- desc: metaphors about snapchat still confused me, and would be interesting to touch
    up upon more
- desc: i think the valuation discussion today was really interesting, I may be interested
    in having an example of the whole evaluation being applied into practice
- desc: Discussion Doneee
- desc: For today class, we talked about developing a framework to evaluate the search
    interface designs with recruiting participants. When we are designing consent
    forms for participants, we have to clarify the purpose of our study. I&#039;m
    just wondering about the situation that we want to deceive participant during
    study. what about this situation?
- desc: How to process and evaluate user input and data
- desc: Is about improving interface design.
