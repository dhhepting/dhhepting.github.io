difficult:
- desc: today I learned about the case study of Dark UX done by ACM.  We come across
    various kind of tricky advertisements daily, which don&#039;t notice, that they
    are tricking us, and redirecting us to some other site, which causes harm to our
    system or data.
important:
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture we discussed about Ux dark interface&#039;s case study
    but in the main zoom room only not in the breakout rooms because nobody discussed
    anything.
- desc: discussed about dark UX patterns in advertising
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we discussed about dark ux patterns"
- desc: grate meeting today, i got an insight as to what it is like being an meeting
    host on zoom as i have never been a host before, also learnt about the redesign
    opportunities for zoom.
- desc: Todays we had discussion on the ACM code ethics and also the dark UX pattern
    in breakout rooms

- desc: We talked about the reactions in zoom meeting and the ACM code.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we discussed about a case study about Dark UX Patterns.
    In the case study the referencing was not done in a user friendly way.
- desc: What was discussed in class today was the interface of zoom reactions and
    whether reaction buttons with emojis makes more sense than a simple yes or no
    response as it maybe tries to capture a more broad range rather than a binary
    one.
- desc: Zooms organization of participants...and case study on dark UX
- desc: Dark Patterns
- desc: The most important thing that I learned was about the additional features
    in Zoom Meeting.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, I learned about dark patterns in advertising, ACM
    codes of Ethics and ACM Ethics case study.
- desc: For our today meeting we talked about the dark web ad&#039;s patterns. How
    our case study is presented? There is no information about the specific principles
    and navigable click and the details about what the Principe is if the cases studies
    talked about applying the code and more details. The relevant pieces of code ethics
    are part of document.
- desc: "Today\u2019s lecture we have learnt about acm ethics and discussion about\
    \ urcourse page design."
- desc: Tricks set up by developers on the web applications.
- desc: Today we discussed about ACM ethic and case study on dark UX pattern also
    we had a breakout room discussion on that.
- desc: We talked about dark ux and ethics
- desc: I learned what is Dark User Experience
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we discussed about the dark patterns in advertising.
    Also, the ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.
- desc: Was about the changed that can be made in zoom for better experience of the
    user. Then we did breakout room discussion.
- desc: Today the Professor discussed about the ACM ethics and also let us all in
    the breakout rooms to discuss about it.
- desc: discussed about Dark UX pattern.
- desc: The things that stuck out to me in class today were Dr. Hepting&#039;s jokes.
    I don&#039;t remember much else from today&#039;s lecture but they were a nice
    distraction from midterms.
- desc: Humans interact with computers in many ways; This is considered the interface
    between humans. Duplicates desktop and internet browsers. Used for speech recognition
    and synthesis systems, the graphic and media interface allows humans to interact
    with embodied agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other paradigms. The
    growth in the interaction between interaction and the computer has been in various
    overlaps in its history. Instead of interfaces, adaptive interfaces, rather than
    passive interfaces, dif
know-more:
- desc: in this session we continued our last session lecture and explored deeper
    about the topic.
- desc: We discussed about Zoom - &amp;quot;Reaction&amp;quot; interface. Topic I
    would like to know more bout are the consequences to the company when they have
    dark interface on purpose (similar to case study from breakout room)
- desc: I am curious to know who the designers of Zoom intended as their audience.
    It does not seem like it was intended for a classroom setting. Is there a better
    solution with the classroom setting as the intended application?
