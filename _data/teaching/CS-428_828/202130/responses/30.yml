    done
- desc: Today we have discussed about the group testing meetings and annotations with
    shared content during the zoom meeting
- desc: For today lab, we talked about the testing groups and test schedules. At the
    second part of the class we worked on zoom whiteboard to figure out how we can
    draw  shapes and hoe this interface works regarding class contents.
- desc: Todays meeting was very useful as we finally get some response for testing
    our interfaces and at the end of our lecture we talked lit bit more about annotation.
- desc: Got in contact with my testing group

- desc: During our meeting today, we discussed how to complete our testing of interfaces
    before the next part of the project is due on Monday.
know-more:
- desc: The main discussion of the session was about participation of testing groups.
- desc: I would like to know that how many the iterations of &amp;quot;Understand-explore-materialize&amp;quot;
    should be generally used to get a good design.
