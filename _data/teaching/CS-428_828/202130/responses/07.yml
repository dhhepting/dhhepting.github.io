difficult:
- desc: Is there any way to compensate the golf of evaluation with the golf of execution?
- desc: Metrics for gulf. How can we conclude some &#039;X&#039; implementation has
    high gulf or low?
important:
- desc: about the radical empathy is that it allows us to notice people and imagine
    yourself, then take actions which indirectly helps our society to work better.
- desc: "Today\u2019s meeting was a quite interesting one as our topic of discussion\
    \ was features of design of a page. I think observer o of objectivity is one of\
    \ the most important features of design to take into consideration for  that \
    \ Bluetooth toggle bar page."
- desc: Learnt a few mew Mac features and I am enjoying the interaction in the class.
- desc: It was an quite interesting open class meeting. I really like this way of
    discussing instead of breakout rooms. Also, i would like to make a note on that
    Bluetooth toggle bar page. I feel like colour is an essential element of design
    and there must also be consistency between all design elements.
- desc: In the meeting, I learned the concept of design, we need to consider the user
    experience.
- desc: "In today\u2019s lecture The most important thing I learned about was how\
    \ important it is to have consistency in interface designing. We had a good discussion\
    \ about on/off switch label and \u201C+\u201D task for windows Bluetooth interface.\
    \ I totally agree with author of that document who was tricked by it. Also read\
    \ few documents on Radical Empathy + HCI"
- desc: 'In Today&#039;s class we have learnt about the evaluation and execution.
    Like every interaction, users must overcome the couple of challenges about understanding
    the current state of a system and figuring out how to change it. Evaluation: Understanding
    the state of the system Execution: Taking action to accomplish a specific goal'
- desc: We talked about evaluation and execution that what kind of interface design
    make user understand the system by some example.
- desc: that there could be so much discussion about an on/off switch!
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discussed about a real life example of gulf of evaluation
    and gulf of execution regarding the Bluetooth interface of windows. The gulf is
    more in this interface as the present state and future state are confusing in
    the windows interface for Bluetooth.
- desc: Is that even simple designs such as the Bluetooth on a computer needs great
    clarification in the case if someone believes that the other setting indeed is
    on, it will be hard to convince them otherwise if that is what they have thought
    to be right the entire time.
- desc: emapthy map, switches and assignment 1
- desc: It was interesting to see how a simple Bluetooth button display could be the
    centre of discussion of human interaction with computers. This has opened my eyes
    in regards to the how careful we should be when designing interfaces
- desc: More clarity on the Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation, especially after
    reading the textbook and todays lecture to clarify with an example on the board
- desc: Today, the class was discussing about different design about the functioning
    of the switches. There were some interesting ideas about bluetooth switches which
    intrigued me when it was compared to the gulf.
- desc: in today&#039;s meeting, I learned how the two UX gulfs work and how to reduce
    the gap using different attributes of interface.
- desc: "So the today\u2019s class was so important and we discussed the real life\
    \ example of the Bluetooth interface for the two UX. In addition I came to know\
    \ how important the consistency is in the interface design. Last but not least\
    \ is that I got some knowledge about beautiful and ugly interface design"
- desc: "We started with discussing about our assignment and then carried on with\
    \ discussing what was wrong with the bluetooth toggle on/off button. This pretty\
    \ much lasted the whole session and we didn\u2019t have time to go to breakout\
    \ rooms in the end."
- desc: Today we have learnt about  the gulf of evaluation and execution works
- desc: The discussion about windows bluetooth settings page really peaked my interest.
    Contrary to other&#039;s beliefs, I feel like the button provides all the necessary
    information and Microsoft did a good job with that. The colour scheme and the
    dynamic button makes is perfectly clear what the status is
- desc: Got to know about how representation can increase or decrease the gulfs.
- desc: Today we discussed more about gulf of execution and gulf of evaluation particularly
    taking Bluetooth design that in what manner it should be designed so that the
    users can understand it easily &amp;amp; also to overcome large gulf. There were
    many different views from the students and had a great discussion on that views.
    Talking about the design of Bluetooth we can enhance it by defining it and giving
    some explanation or some kind of indications over there and also colors defines
    the intensions in a better way.
- desc: I came to know about how to start with activity assigned to us and in class
    we also had a discussion on color toggel button which was interesting to listen
    about. What I feel is the color alone is enough to distinguish the feature of
    the button so no need to text if its on or off the grey and blue color itself
    says a lot of things.
- desc: In design, the space distribution method must be taken into account in order
    to obtain a successful and distinctive design. Color is an essential element of
    design, where design needs color to appear more clear and beautiful, and color
    has the ability to distinguish between good design and bad design, and between
    beautiful design and ugly design. Accuracy The designer must take into account
    accuracy in all the details of his design, no matter how small. Objectivity Observance
    of objectivity is one of the m
know-more:
- desc: In today&#039;s discussion we discussed about how we are going to do the assignment
    1. That was so important to discuss because that gave me a clear view but still
    I want to know more about it.
- desc: 'I would like to increase my knowledge about the two UX Gulfs: Evaluation
    and Execution. For example, we talked about the Bluetooth icon on the system;
    how it works and how it is designed.'
- desc: I would like to learn more about the radical empathy
- desc: I would like to learn more about the course final project and the requirements.
