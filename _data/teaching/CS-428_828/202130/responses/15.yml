difficult:
- desc: The delicate role of the balance between a simple interface and a complex
    set of features desired with a coffee machine
important:
- desc: we discussed about the interface of self serve Tim hortons coffee machine.
- desc: "Today\u2019s meeting was quite interesting one as we have discussed a lot\
    \ of stuff. One of which was tim hortons interface design. In the breakout rooms\
    \ we have also discussed the major limitations in that interface."
- desc: The new design implementation to the self served coffee at Tim Horton&#039;s.
    and ideally it should be from left to right in steps and not right to left.
- desc: We learned more about metaphors and the new topic we discussed today was Mental
    models.
- desc: "we had a discussion on joystick-tapes and how it confuses user. Also same\
    \ for tims coffee machine from lab caf\xE9 - for milk and creamer."
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we have discuss student&#039;s doubt about the project,
    that how to describe in a user&#039;s perspective.  What sites student can select
    for their project. At last, we have discuss some points about Interface Affordances.
- desc: We discussed about the group project and design issue of the coffee machine.
- desc: From the interface of coffee, the potential pitfall I found in the discussion
    is that the setting for milk/cream and coffee should be consistent, like the sugar.
    Some may do not want to take milk but may end up taking the milk instead of coffee.
    Therefore it should be made clear to the customers with an easy and not misleading
    interface.
- desc: Discussion around interface i.e. faucets and coffee machine
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was that facebook was down globally
- desc: Today I have learnt the most important topic about the project assignment.
    Also, we discussed good and bad design of a tap and Tim Hortons coffee machine
- desc: Today we talked about a Coffee machine design and what are the weaknesses
    and how we can improve it. I learned a lot about this topic when I was discussing
    with my teammates.
- desc: Today we talked about different project topics and then we discussed about
    problems in faucets interface of the image provided by professor. Then we had
    a breakout room in which we talked about the interface of a coffee machine, the
    problems in it and how should it be redesigned to make it convenient to all kind
    of users.
- desc: We talked about the Tim Hortons coffee maker and how its interface could be
    improved
- desc: Bad design examples like joystick tap, lab coffee machine.
- desc: Is about the design and the way it matters for a person with different needs.
    We had an example of tim&#039;s coffee machine for this.
- desc: Went over group project and discussed questions asked by students from the
    previous lecture. Questions were related to activity description, individual description
    as well as potential topics.
- desc: We had some discussion about the project assignment. Then a topic about good
    and bad design of tap and Tim Hortna&#039;s coffee machine. Later on discussion
    of the same in breakout room.
- desc: We discussed about the global outage of Whatsapp and other social media outage.
    After which the most interesting part was discussing about How the Self-Serve
    Tim Hortons Coffee machine works and their user drawbacks and how it can be resolved
    in our breakout groups
- desc: I learned that the dispenser for sugar and milk in the lab building is unnecessarily
    confusing and could use an interface update.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we did an exchange on how to improve the design performance
    of Tim Horten&#039;s coffee making system.  The exchange of different opinions
    helps to develop work dynamics and obtain excellent solutions to improve the performance
    of designs.
know-more:
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we discussed about the good and bad designs.
- desc: in this seesion we continued our design interface discussion and explored
    it more deeply.
- desc: How websites we use everyday could always be improved or adjusted to better
    serve the user
- desc: Pitfalls in Lab caf
