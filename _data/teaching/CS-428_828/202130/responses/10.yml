    individual assignment.
- desc: In today&#039;s discussion , we clearly discuss about empathy mapping. i was
    somehow confused about this topic before to make empathy map for assignment. but
    now, i have better idea to do the first step in design making. thanks prof:).

    us to better design several applications
- desc: Clarity on some aspects of the project assignment
- desc: professor showed us the empathy map of the experience using mysaskhealthrecord.
    We also got to know about some technicalities of assignment 1.

- desc: In today&#039;s lecture we mainly talked about MySaskHealthRecord website
    how to operate it, how we can get the vaccination certificate. We also talked
    about the new updates after 20 Sep that before we need to validate pin and now
    we don&#039;t need to do that. In addition, it was mandotory to logout before
    but after the updates now the users automatically gets logout when the session
    expires which is really good for the users. We also learned how to create an empathy
    map by taking an example of this website.

- desc: We discussed about mySaskHealth Rewords &amp;amp; Empathy Records
- desc: Learned more specifics about empathy maps
- desc: In this lecture, we discussed some government pages and how the pages were
    designed and their emotional impact on the user.  In my view designs have a mystical
    relationship with the user influencing the user&#039;s destinations in navigating
    the web and extracting the professional anchor from emotional browsing
know-more:
- desc: In this session we talked about empathy map which I am so interested in knowing
    more about it.
- desc: The uofr website has a number of login portals such that not all logins are
    shared and it is not always clear which login should be used. This seems to conflict
    the guideline heuristic related to system status. What other heuristic guidelines
    would be used to improve this system?
- desc: I would like to learn more about the syllabus
- desc: I learned about Website design choices and i would like to learn more about
    how much is enough for websites with limited usability
- desc: Today when we were talking about the design of the Sask health website, I
    really interested about the section that how user can validate themselves in their
    system. I realize that this part is bottle neck as every on was complaining about
    the speed of responses.
- desc: How to develop a user oriented application?
- desc: Currently, the syllabus is not posted on either UrCourses or the Website.
    I was wondering if you could add a link to it so that we can reference it.
