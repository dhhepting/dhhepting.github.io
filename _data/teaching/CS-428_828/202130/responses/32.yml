difficult:
- desc: no confusion today
important:
- desc: discussed about mean, median and mode
- desc: in todays meeting ,we just did that feedback thing of interface and i think
    it is quite fair to use that.
- desc: Using the new way to do class group discussions via whiteboard on zoom.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we discussed about the features and metaphors to
    help us to imagine.
- desc: We talked about indexing in interfaces and saw an example by searching for
    Fitt&#039;s law in the textbook using index.
- desc: Even things like indexes ought to be thoroughly evaluated to be useful for
    users. ie Fitt&#039;s Law
- desc: In Today&#039;s class, we have discussed abut the baking bread index is an
    good interface? and how many iterations of Understand-Explore-Materialize should
    be generally used to get a good design? and did breakout discussion about Zoom
    interface.
- desc: We discussed about the index of a book which is the interface of system.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we rated the index of the book considering it a interface.
    Professor also discussed which metaphors can help the Zoom breakout room more
    useful to the users. I find this discussion very interesting.
- desc: indexing for interface design and the usefulness.
- desc: The annonate feature during Breakout is great
- desc: Discussion on how breakout rooms are useful to us in the zoom meetings
- desc: I leaned how we could use statistical concepts to obtain the analysis of time
    taken.
- desc: Assignment and recipt book
- desc: "The most important thing that I learned in today\u2019s class was about the\
    \ recipe book"
- desc: Today lecture was about the zoom break out room design and provide some metaphors
    that are related to this design.
- desc: Today we talked about improvements to be made in the index (as an interface)
    of interaction design book and also discussed about metaphors of how to make a
    use of zoom for discussing breakout rooms what improvements to be made for that.
- desc: Fitt&#039;s law example using index of the textbook- how easy to find the
    fitts law section from the index?
- desc: we discussed about the  index (as an interface) to &#039;Interaction Design&#039;
    and we discussed how many iterations of Understand-Explore-Materialize should
    be generally used to get a good design?
- desc: Discussed user experience of textbooks index at the back of the book. They
    vary between textbook editions.
- desc: In todays class we had discussion about the good and bad index design of our
    HCC textbook.
- desc: discussed about mean median mode
- desc: We discussed about todays assignment due questions then also most interesting
    part was about the cook book index menu for bread - Yeast recipie
- desc: I thought an index would be something straightforward and didn&#039;t realize
    it could succumb to bad practices in user interfaces, but judging from the textbook&#039;s
    index it is very possible.
- desc: That the user should always be able to quickly undo what they are doing. This
    allows product to be explored without fear that actions are not adjustable. When
    the user knows that errors can be easily undone, this encourages them to explore
    new options. Conversely, when actions are irreversible, the user will be overly
    cautious, which leads to anxiety and a slower exploration experience.  Probably
    the most popular user interface where users have the option to &#039;Undo/Go back&#039;
    are text and graphics editors, Und
know-more:
- desc: Today we discussed about the interface design of index in the book. We rated
    the interaction design using annotations which is always interesting to do. We
    little bit discussed about submitting the assignment and also about whether breakout
    rooms are good for discussion or not and what makes it good.
- desc: i was going to ask for an extension for our assignment but not anymore. The
    lecture was grate can you explain what we need for the next and final project
    .
- desc: The idea of how we would be able to use prototypes in real place scenerio
    for jobs.
- desc: In this session, we continued our discussion about annotation and talked about
    some new aspects of it.
- desc: we rated index for interaction Design and I would like to know more about
    Project part 4 and final exams.
- desc: I would like to know more about the proper use of Understand-Explore-Materialize,
    and what to do different in separate iterations in order to get a good design
- desc: Hypothesis testing when conducting experiments
- desc: What to infer from the result of a t-test?
- desc: Is about our next project.
