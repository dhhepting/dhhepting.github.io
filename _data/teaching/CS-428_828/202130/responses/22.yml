difficult:
- desc: Why Harvard would have their site layout like that, rather than having an
    index of things to go through, but having it appear like a list while it actually
    being a search bar is not very new user friendly
important:
- desc: discussed about Harvard College Open Data Project
- desc: it was a grate class, it was interesting to see the Harvard data and other
    related topics
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we discussed about the data catalogue and metaphor
    of it.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we have discuss about the Metaphors inn which we have
    discussed about HODP.
- desc: In today&#039;s breakout discussion, we discussed the metaphors of Harvard
    open data catalogue. We found out few issues with the interface and system which
    I will discuss at breakout discussion forum.
- desc: The most important thing i learned in todays meeting would be that of how
    metaphors used for design interface should convey what the actual capabilities
    are and it was made clear with the example of the Harvard open data project&#039;s
    data catalog.
- desc: data catalogue and how it can be utilized
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting, Dr. Hepting talked about the steve jobs movie and\
    \ humane interface. The computer should make the human do the work than necessary."
- desc: today we have look at the Harvard College open data project and discussed
    about how it works and what are the faults in the interface that needs to be improve?
- desc: For today group meeting, we talked about  what do you expect to be able to
    do with a data catalogue and the metaphor help us to understand what is possible.
    We considered Harvard&#039;s first open data catalog for our topic.
- desc: Today&#039;s topic was on &amp;quot;Data Catalogue&amp;quot;, I learned about
    the metaphors, that how a single metaphor can convey a lot of information. whatever
    is the design or prototype is but the metaphor , actually tells the information
    about that particular design , thing or prototype.
- desc: Today we discussed metaphors of Harvard open data project. We also had a breakout
    room in which we discussed about data catalog of it and improvements to be made.
- desc: Comparing Harvard&#039;s data catalog with some metaphor.
- desc: Discussed the design metaphors of the open source data provided by Harvard.
    This was done in breakout groups and summarized within the class.
- desc: 'In todays meeting we discussed about a metaphor: Harvard Open Data project
    and for the same we had a breakout room discussion where we had discuss about
    the data catalogue and how this helps us understand the problems. It was a good
    discussion.'
- desc: Discussed about Harward students&#039; concentration website.
- desc: harvard has a lot of data on hand, but it is not very accessible - at least
    in the data bank, there is a surprisingly small amount of data and it is hard
    to search for anything specifically
know-more:
- desc: In this session we talked about a specific problem and discussed it in the
    break-out group.
- desc: We were discussing Harvard student concentration.
- desc: Would like to know more about HODP and also about evaluation if interface
- desc: Another lecture to shed more light on Evaluation will help
- desc: I would like to konw how to use data as much as possible to help design
- desc: About upcoming project.
