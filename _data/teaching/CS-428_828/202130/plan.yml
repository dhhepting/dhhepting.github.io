    - desc: Any software interface with which your group members are familiar and that is accessible for others to use.
      persid: DHH
    - desc: If each team member has to create 4 empathy maps (in a group of 4), do
        they also need to create one for themselves?
      persid: SSS
    - desc: Yes and we will discuss in class
      persid: DHH
    - desc: Hey, don't you think rather than us finding our own groups it would
        be better for us to just use our breakout room as our group for the project?
      persid: SSS
    - desc: No. Breakout rooms are not the right size, but you could use your breakout
        group as a foundation for your project group

    Individual-Assignment-1:
    - desc: You are asked to empathize with a teacher using UR Courses to design
        some content that you will present to your hypothetical students. This
        content will consist of 1 activity in UR Courses and 1 resource in UR
        Courses. Access to the resource is to be based on the grade for the
        activity. As the teacher, you will use UR Courses to create your
        content. For the assignment, you will reflect on your use of UR Courses
        and create an empathy map for that experience. Lastly, you will consider
        any issues you encountered while creating your content in UR Courses and
        describe any opportunities for redesign. Focus on identifying problems and
        not presenting solutions

    - desc: I've put some URLs to show the process. The first time I visited the site
        (hard to pin down what to call it), I was still logged in from the other
        day so then I logged out and had a hard time finding the login screen again
        but I did find it and then after a detour to a page that reported "Bad Request"
        I found myself logged in again. Is it enough to remind people to log out or is
        it better to invalidate the session after some time has expired?
