Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon, everyone. My. Little laptop from. 2017 it's. Not very happy
    with me today it's. The fan is running. And it's well, maybe it's just not my
    laptop it's also Internet cuz he things are. seem to be not working great quickly.
    Okay, so i'm gonna mute everybody, for now, and you can. turn your souls on. See.
    there's a microphone on summer. Yes, happy election day we'll talk about that
    as well. well. it's. Finding where we need polling places. And I believe. was
    open for 7pm. So i'm going to be going out this afternoon to the former costco
    to place my vote. I don't know how many. polling places are being put into that
    one building. Imagine it's quite a few. Okay, so. Any questions from last day.
    Let me first get to our. Meeting. number nine today minus 38.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have a quick question regarding the assignment I one.
  persid: S01
- desc: sure.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So it's the last section I already submitted it last night so last section
    was like opportunities for redesign So are we supposed to like. Like. Correct
    those opportunities first or like implement those opportunities and then say that
    we, we have changed is this this because we felt like this was. Not a good option,
    or are we supposed to leave that, as it is and then say, these are the opportunities
    are these are the new things that can be implemented and that, in my opinion,
    is going to be better than the. One we have right now, because what I did was
    like I changed those first and then I said okay Previously, it was that but I
    changed it in this this section and this this way. And then I said Okay, this
    was the problem, and now it is better in this way, and then I said okay now as
    a measuring it with the latest version and latest modification.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm not sure how you can change your courses. You can contribute to moodle
    and there's a whole process of making changes. Yes, so i'm not asking for solutions
    at this point i'm asking for you to identify issues. So not not even here's the
    issue, and this is sound effects it. But here's the issue. it's enough just to
    talk about the issues that you find.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. Okay now.
  persid: S01
- desc: Sorry, I didn't hear your response.
  persid: DHH
- desc: said okay now I get it first I was thinking about like. What I made in that
    activity and what I needed to change and in terms of make it even better or a
    better experience right, but now I think like it's more about what I can do to
    change my activity, as well as what your, of course, is limited to maybe.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, so we'll talk about that. again. i'll add some qualifications to sign.
    sessions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you.
  persid: S01
- desc: you're welcome. So I made myself a student. So that wow. not giving too much
    time too. Much to look at here. So i'm going to share my screen and I didn't.
    I didn't give you much OK. So now. So we've got the attendance taken care of.
    I must say that i'm impressed with the attendance module. Because it. reacts.
    To my current role so when I was a student. I can record my attendance and when
    i'm the teacher. That I can. show you the password. doesn't give me any permission
    problems in between. There, there are other modules that. don't work so smoothly
    between the different views. Okay. Any thoughts from last days discussion so last
    day we looked at. Look at the marvel answering machine. breakout room selection
    interface. Any questions or concerns. me. Okay, so let's. Look at the election
    in Canada would say. you're not sure if you've got. Voter information card. tells
    me where to go. and His phone number. Oh, I said. Oh, I said. Okay, but let's
    say I didn't know. I didn't have a voter information card. let's see let's see
    university political. Okay, so anyone worried about that response. Let me see
    if I can. fix it. Okay anyone. Just by raising their hand. who thinks that air
    is a. nationally and. well. i'm curious, if you want to explain your choice of
    the movie then for your reaction. don't be shy, this is a safe space. And i'm
    not trying to make light of anything. So I know I know that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's not easy to speak.
  persid: ???
- desc: In front of the group.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Was that the error, because of entered a. Different pin code or something
    like that.
  persid: S01
- desc: I didn't know the air was. I. didn't capitalize the most of. The letters of
    the postal code. So here's. The correct one. We don't necessarily know it's correctly
    try it so i'm going to try one. Okay. I want to just see if it needs the space
    as well. let's try. It so it's happy with space. let's see if it's happy with.
    You space. Well, I can't put one in one space. And if I hit tab. Just advanced
    the next field. So it doesn't let me put more more than one space, and so let
    me go back to the lowercase. I wonder if now it's just. it's correct. it's do
    it well. So, if you look at the script. If you look at the URL that's invoking
    the script. So there's okay there's. there's the pasta. let's see. If I change
    it to the aspirants. Can you see. The address bar where a lot of fun very well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S01
- desc: So now I can't get the error message again. Let me try it. I can't recreate
    that air. So I guess that's good news. bad news, maybe the first time i'm going
    to that web page I might get. something unexpected. Okay, so. let's look at the
    title here. So let's go back to our. Okay. So. It seems to be working okay. i'm
    not sure what caused the air in the first place. So what you need to vote. So.
    This heading says it's going to give you information which need to vote. Is is
    there. Are those buttons answers to. This the at the buttons below those four
    buttons they describe what you need to vote. So I guess it's indirectly. Saying.
    So I guess I need to know where i'm supposed to go. Okay, so let me try. Okay,
    so here is the instructions. So we're. Working on both it depends on whether it's
    election day. I can go into the location, the law, I can go to the polls. which
    are no longer. it's no longer the case because it's fast. Fast September, for
    your team, which was last Monday. and vote now. So what is vote now. I have a
    guest with that is. going to save my man. So is it helpful to. To have this information
    clickable. Even though it's. One could cast. Today today's date. and make these
    unavailable. Okay, so I know where to vote. And I know the poll number. Okay So
    what do I need to vote so. So I need to know where where to vote. three options
    to prove your identity and address. So one of these pieces of ID your driver's
    license any other car addition by Canadian Government with your photo name current
    address. Option two. Okay, so I just need to show one piece of that i'd be. Option
    two is. So option one. Show one show one piece of photo ID one piece of government
    issued photo ID. option to. Voter card plus another. that's a bank statement or
    utility statement. Option three if you don't have a game and still vote. If you
    declare your identity and an address and writing as someone who knows you who's
    assigned to your polling station both true. person doing about you must be able
    to prove their identity and address person converge, only one person. Okay, so
    here. I know what pieces of idea I need to vote, so I need to have Government
    issued photo ID on my voter card plus another. thing that shows my address. Okay
    i'm gonna see if i'm. registered. Okay next. Yes, Okay, yes i'm 18 years of age
    or older. So manage my. specify my address type on my address. Okay, so i'm okay
    to vote. that's good news I guess. So I want you to think about. How easy or.
    Difficult that processes and what kind of. opportunities. or unmet needs, there
    are. The voters in seeking out some information. About. How they how they may
    vote in the election. Okay, so. here's the first part of the project so two weeks
    from today. that's an extension. of your. empathy individual assignment. it's.
    The same. same kind of activity. would like to bind them for the group members.
    So. let's say said, you can you can pick any website, except for mine. Is i'd
    like to. have some class discussions about issues with my website. So, remember
    that design thinking process. So. So, to understand we'd like. To empathize. That
    research develop an understanding of our.
  persid: DHH
- desc: users.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. In order to make this more tractable in a semester. Like like you. To
    do. That look for a website that you use. So something for which your users. within
    your group or. Maybe they're within your group your represent more than one. category
    of user, but so to understand. From the users perspective, what. can be done with
    the website or application study. So we're not. getting into something we're going
    to make changes to the code and. we're going to focus on the interface. and we're
    going to look. For issues on that needs. Which there are large bolts of execution
    and evaluation. So we're going to look at the interface design. And we're going
    to present.
  persid: DHH
- desc: we're going.
  persid: ???
- desc: to explore. possible improvements to the interface over the course the project.
    So you want to think about. The characteristics. of yourself as a user. Doing
    like activity. On the interface. So, each one of the group can do this. And then
    create an empathy map each activity. So we're a group of four. So each person
    does. allow for each activity on user. So four times four so 16 portal. And then,
    as a group. defined specific aspect identify specific aspects, the current interface
    that cause problems for the users and look. For example, the roots of those problems
    identify whatever user needs making a mess. So we're not. looking for solutions,
    this will focus on the problems.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: I just want to go over something about group assignments group work. So. i'm
    going to provide you with the opportunity to reach your group members, including
    yourselves. As a way to give you some feedback about how well the groups are working.
    So we start with 100 points. For your group and then. We assign points sort of
    together total of 100. So if all group members contribute equally. So the Google,
    for then each group member will get from five. If you feel that you have not contributing
    equally okay points unequally explain live than this. So please be thoughtful.
    Please be thoughtful in your rating. So not not. don't do it in a careless well.
    So if you don't provide a rating. Is if you made an application, so we have a
    group of four it's like you're giving everybody 25 months. So. Based on the calculate
    based on the inputs, so if everybody. did a rating. So then. The highest point
    total get gets a way to one. And the lowest point total. Yes, Sir, if they're
    different so we get a point well that's less than one. account. not going to sign
    away less than 0.5 so. So that this is her own. person events one. That means
    100% of your mark for your assignment. So if somebody has a point five. The group
    is indicating that group member. should get 50% of you. So these are suggestions
    for me. and give me information so. it's not. taking them as. This is. Something
    which i'm required to act. So I just have a couple of examples here three examples
    I guess. So if everybody. Say Thomas. The rates Thomas is 2025 minutes, and the
    other three members of this group. 25 so everything works out so they gets remarks
    or 100% of the earned mark. In this case. A new goal allocation so Thomas. says
    he deserves 9700 points. So Richard doesn't agree that Thomas. is done. Your share
    of work so. makes this allocation, so it gives Richard three that gives Thomas
    three he says. He deserves 2015. Other points. So we get these all. Its weight
    so Thomas would still get. Get all of the urn mark and then Richard would get
    sick or two thirds of your mark. And, Harold and saw you would get afternoon.
    Little calculator here. i'm just giving you a color coded. So if it turns up red,
    then you haven't made the call came up to. 100. So, how did I do explaining that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I had a question about the group members um do we have any rules about who
    are not or we could just choose any one.
  persid: S03
- desc: You can choose anyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, and it should be a maximum or or by.
  persid: S03
- desc: i'm suggesting for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, great Thank you.
  persid: S03
- desc: Welcome
  persid: ???
- desc: And the minimum sizes three. Or we could do it by ourselves.
  persid: S04
- desc: For undergraduates.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Minimum three. Thank you welcome.
  persid: S04
- desc: So we're out of time again. So this is. i'm finding. With my. camera on the
    second screen or video on the second screen. And just looking at my. browser window
    that i'm sharing on my main laptop screen. You that's not. The best way to do
    it. No one's. asking me questions yeah audio. So. Maybe it's better to have a
    column. A column of. of your smiling faces. on the screen. With me online. laptop
    screen. So there. So we can think about that in terms of. Another example. What
    advantage.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Over.
  persid: ???
- desc: Experience you get from your courses into. Your courses is one thing, but
    soon as another thing. They kind of experience you get these. different tools.
    want to put to find a partner. But we can look in so many places. for areas that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: could be improved.
  persid: ???
- desc: The same okay. Next up here comes up. It should let you go. Enough on Wednesday
    okay.
  persid: DHH
