Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon. For the last time. For this class for this semester. don't
    want to be too definite about. The. being the last one. share my screen. Doing
    this. Oh here, let me show you something fun I think it's fun anyway. Can everyone
    see the Red Square, with the line and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S01
- desc: it's a little video here we go. it's not quite done yet. there's no sound.
    So it's not quite finished yet so there's not about another two seconds, so it
    ends up with. Where it started from the line. Any thoughts about that. Anyway,
    so it was doing that for that and then my appearance social media for the department
    think we'll see. Anyway, so that was the. One of the fun dip. he's going to share
    with share with you so i've done that thanks for your. Your feedback. That was
    something I started doing with my master's degree research. which I finished here.
    Just over 30 years ago I. defended in March of 91. When I complicated in May of
    that year and. Some other things anyway. So I want to get back to the class stuff
    here. meeting today. so happy Monday last time. Well, you won't be meeting on
    the 22nd. i'll be around that during the final exam. Anyone go out today so minus
    32 with wind chill. When I was young. going to elementary school, maybe, maybe
    high school as well, they would. They used when show them different ways that.
    Often in January, well, maybe December to January, February there'd be warnings
    exposed pleasure trees and less than 30 seconds. and wind chill is minus 100.
    So they agree calibrated the venture warnings, so the less scary and maybe more
    believable. anyway. So here's attendance. This is a student that's why. So, give
    me a second here, while I show you the student. And I want to show you and then.
    i'll switch back to teach instructor and we, the attendance password. Okay, so
    here's where the link in the meeting will take you. To that final exam online.
    You click on it. it'll say you have one attempt allowed. This is not be available
    until December 22 9am to noon. So will be a three hour. window there. Okay, so
    that's what I was. Showing off my student role. what's. missing the ass but nothing
    else missing, yes, my chat box there. Okay, so here's the link to that final exam.
    I showed you a moment ago. So I want to get your feeling on. It. there's a miscommunication
    with you my wife them all. On the weekend, I was out doing stuff and I said i'm
    going to go to save by. Anyway, so here's. here's this screenshot from. So, protect
    the names and. ingredients. The innocent the news. People and the. Items well.
    anyway. So i'm going to make a stop or safeway and then my wife text me things
    that I should get it safely. which you don't care about the details. But I was
    driving so then replies. i'm driving focus turned on i'll see your message, when
    I get long going so it seems like it's coming from me. But it's not. Anyway, so
    the one item that all I leave here is, I had to get more close on next. When I
    saw that, and so I gave the thumbs up. I thought, everything was fine. I didn't
    see this part. Because I thought here's me giving the last message. So without
    without. Without reading carefully. I saw that. and I was to get more calls on
    next. Because I had I had written this thing about safeway which I thought was
    here. And then I saw the then my wife added another item from the list so. here's
    where things things, why should get it safely that weren't called small next then
    here's the cost on nexus mentioned after I stopped driving, so I saw that right
    away, I said thumbs up okay i'll get that so I got that, then I go home I. realized,
    I was in trouble. So if I explained that situation clearly enough. Anybody. Okay.
    So I wrote this to my life i'm going to go to safeway. And then she wrote back
    and said here are things I should get that you wrote back, while I was driving,
    so the system replied. That i'm driving focus turned on i'll see your message
    right you get one going. And then she send it an additional message. So. Not referencing
    this other thing that she. She sent me she sent me a second message after I was
    driving focuses turned off. Well, close on next project saw. And then I replied
    back and getting that it's fine when I got home, I was in trouble. whoa okay.
    So how many any. Anybody. willing to defend me on on this. Yes, so that's right
    I missed the previous message, because. I thought I looked at the screen, I thought
    this was not, I was looking at it carefully, I thought this is my message here.
    So I said I thought Jesus you're buying with safeway. one item I can handle that
    will be fun job. So no I didn't get any other notification so. So, Michael has
    a good suggestion thanks Michael. We have a different color. For the autofocus
    message. automatically message that comes up. That would help indicate that. This
    is not the knee and was so. My wife to realize that. i'm not replying to her.
    and When I look at the screen i'd say Oh, this is mine. So let me see what happened,
    while I was away, while I was. Driving my little seen this message the odds new
    scheme of things I should get at safeway message would have increased substantially.
    The other thing. it's mentioned digestion well I understand justin's comment is
    that. If. If the message sent. Well, focus was on appeared below the. appeared
    again. Once the focus is turned off or. Some appeared below this last message.
    What would it be possible. So I didn't get a notification. That anything had happened.
    differently accepted this. This message appeared in my. In my chat with my wife.
    Any other questions. i'm thinking i'll just put a whiteboard up and you can. Or
    we could annotate screen here actually. yeah i'll do that. By the names and haters
    and just. How about you give me it. Anyway, so if you're able to give me a checkmark
    or. or some kind of. If you're. If you accept if you could stop my argument with
    that's why I didn't see this list of things to get at safeway. or giving an x
    if you. think that I should have. shown that non to do things differently.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm a little ignorant because I don't know now iPhone, but I do ipads. Does
    focus mode not have. Some sort of indicator on the top right corner of the phone.
    Like a half moon or something. Or am I mistaken, it was something else.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah so that would be do. not disturb. I think. So my phone tells me when
    focuses on. That I don't see any should say that i'm working on I will see where
    that's. see if I. focus. Well okay. So I have a choice between do not disturb
    driving sleep work or personal. anyway. So I know that it's not going to lend.
    To me this isn't a question about indicating focus and having me look at someplace
    else on the screen to see whether do not disturb or different icon is up there
    it's about. just looking at. So my attention is that on this window here about.
    here for the backs of the arrow somebody do is not as lined up properly. So my
    attentions on this chat stream with this i'm message screen or whatever. And i'm
    wondering if there's a way that an indicator could. Something could be indicated.
    To me to. Some to make the. To focus my attention on the message above the i'm
    driving the. i'm not seeing messages when i'm driving. message. One point to hear
    here, you can see my cursor right. So, to me, the issue is. This. Blue bubble
    look like something when I had written. Just before. And I took it that way, instead
    of realizing there was another message after my last message. That make sense
    Jeffrey.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: anyone else have questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I do have a question on the group project.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay well i'm not i'm not going to spend the whole day on this. But so i've
    got it looks like four people voted. and the others who want to. I just. want
    to ask if there's questions about. My miscommunication with my wife over the weekend.
    My description of it. And so, if you have a checkmark. you're agreeing. you're
    not agreeing with me, you can see, my point of view, want to say that I was right.
    Certainly i'm not asking them for that kind of commitment from you. If you can
    see my point. Market checkmark or some kind of. Positive symbol. or scribble scribble.
    And if you. don't see my point. But an ex or something else. So i'm not calling
    them precisely or they're not 3232 marks on the screen yet. anyone else, want
    to vote. So if i'm. If i'm taking my wife's perspective. I should read my text
    messages. Not just react to them. So there's all the information there that I
    need to find her original message in my list of things I should have gotten safely.
    But then. that's that's putting a little bit extra on the user. To. deal with
    the shortcomings of the the application on the phone, I think. that's my perspective.
    don't get very far with that at home. Maybe she won't believe me that that. Well
    anyway let's take a picture. kind of this discussion and. Well, maybe i'll I won't
    report back. Okay, anyway, so Jeffrey you had a question about the project.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, very short one do we submit. Or is it okay to submit a YouTube link.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay that's mainly the only sq.
  persid: S02
- desc: And then you can choose just make sure that. Well, I guess.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's Either that, or like.
  persid: S02
- desc: No just.
  persid: DHH
- desc: One driver or something. that's all.
  persid: S02
- desc: Via YouTube link is fine, but I just if you want to restrict it just make
    sure that I have access to it. yeah and the marker as.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, that sounds good, thank you yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: you're very welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just wanted to add to that question, so all we have a YouTube link for the
    video, but we also have like a PowerPoint presentation, but the video on commerce
    the PowerPoint presentation and everything to do, which is summit both or just
    the link.
  persid: S04
- desc: Link would be fine.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you.
  persid: S04
- desc: you're very welcome. Any other questions. So the exam will be some. mixture
    of. Multiple choice some some things that will be straightforward to go through.
    it'll be marked by the system. But but checked by me so. If there's a situation
    where there's a question. you'll be able to ask questions of me after the marks
    are done now, we should make sure to review them that i've set things up. That
    you haven't been cheated out of them are marked by the system. And then there'll
    be. one or more questions that have involve you. Writing something. And then.
    Well, more. Maybe some kind of design oriented questions. some kind of analysis
    questions that will won't be able to mark by the computer by the system. But i'll
    i'll mark. foley on my own. So i'm. so open to suggestions about questions on
    the exam so beyond multiple choice questions. Charles popular. So specific quests
    specific questions about specific topics. The kinds of. form of the question.
    The material that. should be tested by the question and so forth, those kinds
    of. Suggestions i'm i'm open to receive. So I have a list of. Previous exams.
    And it's fairly complete. it's available, both on my website and through a link
    on your courses, I believe. So I can keep my office hours, going from. Between
    now and the exam salvia help. Tomorrow, have an appointment. That intersects the
    office hours so. So. Maybe not tomorrow. Another in general, I would be able to
    keep my office hours. that's a help that's really have your hand up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So I have a question about execution, we expect them. To.
  persid: S05
- desc: Somebody got somebody else's your microphone on.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, go ahead and small.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, Professor I was asking about the execution so should we expect the instructions
    from the topic we have learned in this course and. The topics we have we have
    been taught or like from the.
  persid: S05
- desc: From the whole book so it's based on what. What. we've done in our meetings,
    particularly we've done in the project. And assignments, and so forth. So if if
    we never touched on it that won't be something that I would ask you about. That
    make sense okay. Any other questions. Jeffrey do you have any other questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: nope just brainstorming. Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Abraham.
  persid: S02
- desc: brings it over yeah. yeah yeah so. I promised to change the wording of the
    breakout room rating. And I was looking at it, then I saw us. Some people were
    doing. Doing different things are some people have done some things already in
    some, some of which were more like we discussed on Friday. So. Here, let me go
    to the. Can you switch to that screen. Go ahead zakiya.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just had a question about the final exam format So are we going where they
    said open book or closed book with Procter track just wondering about that.
  persid: S04
- desc: No we're not doing proctor track. So the idea is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So is it that we will be able to refer the notes for. All we should expect
    to be treated like.
  persid: S04
- desc: Well, I think it's. Multiple choice questions and. and so forth. and So I.
    had intended to to make it a two hour limit. But if I can. apply that just to
    the. The short answer questions that are. means so you'd have some extra time
    to do. so that you can serve complete the. short answer multiple choice questions
    in a subset of the time. And then we deal with the longer design oriented and
    analysis oriented questions. After completing. The. lock that would be. more profitable
    for me so i'm. So it would be more. The idea is that the bulk of the exam will
    benefit from. Having an open book. or not so it's based on. you're putting into
    practice the ideas that we've had already discussed over the Semester. So that
    makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah. One question I have for the exam is is it sequential or. We could just
    access any questions we want. At a particular order.
  persid: S02
- desc: So. they'll be different for everybody. I think you can you can read through
    them all. and answer the ones you want to go back.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: I believe that's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because i've written final sequentially in a nightmare to me. yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: So I won't make you do one question and then. And then. The next one, and
    the next one, and so on. Okay, so let me. Get back to her it's. REACH your breakout
    group. Change the question. So I will. revert the ones that have been submitted.
    In case you'd like to change them when you're not required to okay. So I have
    a direct message about how many questions you can expect. yaks he sees see. The
    xp CTS no no so then. expect. i'm not sure about how many short answer questions
    will do. But there will be the one or two. That would be a bit more involved deal
    with analysis and design.
  persid: DHH
- desc: sounds fine to me. Okay.
  persid: S02
- desc: Thanks Jeffrey. Okay, well, I guess we're a minute charter of our ending time
    but. there's no other discussions. No, no other questions. i'll just say thank
    you very much rear engagement, the Semester. and hope to see you in person. you're
    on campus winter.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Time, thank you, Professor for the class that was a great support from you.
    toward the whole semester.

- desc: No thanks very much.
