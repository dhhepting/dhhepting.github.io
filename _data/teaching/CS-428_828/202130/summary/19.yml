  persid: S00
- desc: Good afternoon.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor.
  persid: S02
- desc: Professor.
  persid: S03
- desc: Writing it's a good thing right. Happy Friday. Somebody rather Mike on all
    the moving things around in their place. Sorry, I was gonna remind you to talk
    this afternoon. But now I can't find the link to it. physics, but not Professor
    says about science in stem. i'll try and send you an email later on, so find it.
    My computer's not very happy today. And running a lot. Just slow. So here I am
    sharing my screen with you. So under administration, I have a link here for the
    center's returns, with a comment about the weather outside today. Then they went
    see Alfonso days goal for Canada on Wednesday night. Thursday morning to see that
    clip. If you missed it that there's a link there that goes to the CBC story. And
    there's a little video clip of that goal. So we talked earlier in the Semester
    about whether Canada has a chance to advance the World Cup. So they were doing
    well, by being unbeaten before, but now. They actually want to gain. At home,
    and be in Toronto. For one against, Panama. Do you think there are chances have
    improved. So Martin, let me ask you do you think canada's chance qualifying for
    the World Cup.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, they will.
  persid: S04
- desc: Do you think they're on the way now or just better chances.
  persid: DHH
- desc: They have good players, they have this player is playing with the band Munich.
    Which is playing really good. This year they have good options. And I think now
    the third or the fourth so they have good good chance to go different.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah, so I think they're in third place in the top three qualified. yep so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah there was one question.
  persid: S04
- desc: Anyway, okay so. Then going on to the other question and answers the password.
    and hope. Okay. there's. Anyone so the marks for the individual sangha one were.
    posted I think earlier than than Wednesday when I send a notification on Wednesday
    after class, you can see that. One thumbs up, but I can see. it's good news.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I have them markers email, you can send me an email to the marker that's
    on your courses link there's in your courses. Hello sending. Okay. Let me go back
    to. There, a couple of responses from last meeting I thought we comment on here.
    So question was can we make our prototype out of paper so yeah the low fidelity
    prototype. is intended to be. Something you're not. you're not investing a lot
    of time. and make it perfect because we invest a lot of time and running a bit
    of code to the position the elements on screen and. So on, then the less the less.
    inclined, you are to make changes to it. In the week should still try and use
    a ruler and. and print legibly and all those kinds of things. So the way you do
    the low fidelity prototype so you might have more than one screen, so you drive
    screen. On separate piece of paper and then. When they're testing it you say.
    So, if you look at that testing video. Now, had a chance to look at it already
    but. that's a nice introduction to how to do tests so that's testing a website
    that you can imagine that if you. If you present a picture of the interface. Over
    zoom. And then you. get people to talk about what they're going to do, like they
    didn't. Say press a button here, and then, which would advance to the next screen
    that you have them show the next piece of paper. With a drawing of that screen
    and so on. So that's how it can be a cast of the low fidelity prototype. That
    answer your question or concern about. The low fidelity prototype. Okay, seeing
    one will say yes, it is addressed. Now, but we can revisit it. And then the other
    question is there was, is there a strict set of metaphors using thinking about
    interfaces. So I would say not. Because. different communities might have. Different
    metaphors. Some of the metaphors that. And the graduate students who are. So we
    talked about. Application maybe like faith. Well, Facebook or snapchat. Facebook
    is becoming. A little more onerous to deal with me. and using it less frequently.
    There are a lot more options in. My perspective and. So the metaphors but snapchat
    let's say. There might be a metaphor.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That that.
  persid: ???
- desc: becomes well known in that interface that may not extend to. Another group.
    So that i'm saying snapchat that there are lots of possibilities, so that. might
    have a reference for something that. were some jargon that. Particular Community
    understands but isn't so well understood outside that community. And so those
    can be metaphors as well. So the purpose of the metaphor is to help. develop some
    structure for losing the new user. so that they can relate the new capabilities,
    the interface. or just the capabilities in interface. And how to use them to a
    familiar structure for them. So using. Looking at the meetings on my web page
    is like looking at the calendar. Words like looking at a. list. With something
    like that. So wondering have a metaphor, we can. bring in some other details that
    will. help people to understand how to access functionality. If the metaphor.
    isn't familiar. or it's not used consistently, then I can introduce more problems.
    So the answer that I would say, is there isn't a strict set of metaphors fees
    are thinking about interfaces. That we're not just restricted to. graphical user
    interfaces or direct manipulation gestures. Okay, I feel like i've been on i've
    said enough. Mr show stop talking. about that. Okay, well, no response to the
    way for that. Any any thoughts about theatre the metaphors used in Facebook or
    snapchat. Whether whether they're successful. Okay, so i'm going to ask you to
    do your. Your breakout groups here. so on should look at the design of my. course
    page for the Semester. action. So this is what the course page for the offering
    looks like. So I was thinking about metaphors for meetings. If you can think about
    metaphors. that are used in. On this page or. Are on meetings, particularly. So
    you can focus on any part of. The design, so what metaphors are being used or
    could be used. So if there are metaphors. which you can you can identify are the
    used well. it's something to be done better to. improve your experience on the
    page pages. on my website here. The question makes sense for the breakout groups.
    thumbs up in one yes so. On I have a yes from the chat as well. Okay, so i'm going
    to create breakout groups. On other thumbs up okay that's great. So there's 29
    participants in 29 students in class today so let's do for breakout groups. So
    we can have a lively discussion, which you know. So. i'm gonna try assigning automatically
    today, so we get a bounce. distribution. Center as last day we had one that was
    much bigger than the others. So let's take about 1010 or so minutes now think
    about that and then. we'll get back together and continue our discussion. Okay.
    Here we go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just noticed your shirt is sort of have that. same look as the background
    of your website. Sir, excuse me, anyway.
  persid: S06
- desc: For the the teaching part of the website yeah. So, is that a good discussion
    about things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah we had a good discussion about the metaphor of your website.
  persid: S02
- desc: So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So in our discussion we we are thinking. About calendar you showed us in your
    website and. In this, in this case of the calendar, it seems like it's the calendar,
    but it's the number of classes, we are attending. I mean, first class second class
    third class something like that.
  persid: S02
- desc: Would you like to. share your screen. i'm gonna let you share your screen
    i'll stop sharing mine. If you want to look at a particular example.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, I can do that. So for this part of the calendars here, we see that 15
    1617 so at first glance, it seems like this is the first day of the month. Is
    the I mean this is the 15th of October 16th of October, when we actually go deep
    and understand things know properly, then we see that yeah it's 19th 19th class
    and is actually Friday 15th October. So that's kind of a issue if we consider
    it. But. There is no other way, I think there is. There is a way to solve it,
    maybe. But I am not i'm not so. comfortable that. And another thing like in the
    upcoming events we can. We can consider it like yeah it's kind of a plan for meeting
    is kind of a to do list for us in the course. Am I going to the right track or
    am I lost.
  persid: S02
- desc: No so. So is it helpful to have meetings presented this way.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah you said earlier it's like yeah what we have to do what we need to do,
    what are the task left we we we, we have to go, I mean we can have a clear vision
    of that.
  persid: S02
- desc: Any other thoughts about this, I mean.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh no that's it.
  persid: S02
- desc: No i'm i'm in from other people in class.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: turning off my sharing screen or I can keep it.
  persid: S02
- desc: You can keep it for now okay. So there's a question about screen sharing in.
    breakout rooms.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. I don't want to put people back in breakout rooms now but i'm not sure
    that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It was talking about in the breakout room.
  persid: S02
- desc: or knee.
  persid: DHH
- desc: They screen sharing was not enabled in the breakout room so.
  persid: S02
- desc: No i'm just i'm not sure that it can be.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It can be done.
  persid: S02
- desc: So yeah we'll we'll try and i'll try and remember that for next time okay.
    So anyone else have thoughts like to share from your breakout discussions. One
    person so. It doesn't sound and listening prevent me encouraging evidence that
    you had a good discussion about this. One person. is going to talk to me about
    it. So let me Let me pick on somebody who commented on my shirt not pick on. The
    Jeffrey do you have any thoughts from your groups discussion. or. If if these
    meetings were okay this meeting setup is okay. or were there other ones that might
    be as good or better. or their metaphors.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just Professor for our group, which is group one also have Jeffrey we thought
    of other metaphors like one with talk about was agenda.
  persid: S07
- desc: mm hmm.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If that would be a different metaphor, then also Bulletin. Somebody suggested
    will attend. Okay, another one was called organizer. Those were the tree we briefly
    discussed.
  persid: S07
- desc: So again, can you tell me a bit more about Bulletin.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, in terms of bullets and. we're trying to relate it like normally when
    you have like. Your typical bulletin, if you. Like if you have like your news
    bulletin, like the kind of like what the plans are the former kind of.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay, so. Just Bolton, is it something with bullet points.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Not bullet point pass fail. No. just the same way, I mean I. I wish definitely
    could also add four more points here because he was the one who really mentioned
    the option of Latin.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay. Okay. So maybe I should ask nashville to stop sharing your screen in
    case other people want to share their screen. Please. Okay, so thinking about
    a particular page for meeting. So I have the the summary and the responses. For
    each meeting but. Would it be better to have links to go beach to navigate between
    them more easily. Would it be better to have links. To the previous me if I said
    before, upcoming events. upcoming events and then summary of last meeting and
    responses to last meeting. As links. In order.
  persid: DHH
- desc: summary of the meeting is not generated yet as the classes already happening,
    so I think the link of the last meeting. Maybe helpful in this page.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah okay. So this is from last meeting, and then I can go to the summary.
    And then so two people look at this. This a useful thing. And then I guess their
    responses to. That the thing I noticed is that there aren't any I don't have links
    to navigate amongst these would it be good to have the same idea of. The response
    of navigating to the responses, but having. pagination control. or. Going back.
    So if I do the previous I did navigation for the responses, so I could go amongst
    the responses. Like for meetings. And then, so this is more like a calendar isn't
    this view. So the Monday Monday the 30th of August was our first meeting, and
    here we are down on meeting 19 halfway through. So, the reason I made these links
    to. I did it this way so that i'm not. Changing the content. Based on when reading
    is generated, but just as a summary of meeting 20. There is no some because it
    hasn't happened. that's so that I can. use these links in. This is the page that
    I copied into your courses. And if you record recommends it. The list of meetings
    page in your courses Jared from this page and the website. So I haven't seen as
    a key and the main theme of the class, so what i've. indicated as a theme for
    classes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So yeah right on top, where you have Friday 15 October 2021 so probably. You
    mean topic that we're going to discuss from it's helpful like even when we're
    studying back from maternity or anything like that, rather than clicking on the
    drop down to see what we did, I could have an all of you, at the very top.
  persid: S08
- desc: So the theme here. yeah so I notice. I didn't want to. Go back tonight. So
    the theme here, so I could put that ran right up at the top. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah just minimizing the number of clicks trying to, for example, navigate
    to the different meetings to find content.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay. Or maybe Is it better to have it. displayed on this page.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah then works to like it's like a quick summary at first glance, on everything.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay. So I see him out of time again. So i'm. i'm surprised that there was.
    I guess I wouldn't i'm not saying that this amount of discussion was. equivalent
    to the number of comments people have I. Maybe it's not so easy to share and discussions
    about my website, but i'll tell you that i'm not so attached to it that. i'm interested
    in your comments about how to improve it. So i'd welcome those. either in class
    or on your courses form. So with that i'll say goodbye for today have a good weekend
    take care and i'll see you on Monday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And i'll have a little.
  persid: S02
- desc: thanks you too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: bye.
