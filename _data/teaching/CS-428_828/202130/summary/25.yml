Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon, everyone and happy Friday. let's see. Okay, see how smooth
    things will go here. something's not happy that I didn't catch. I don't see what
    the problem is so. we'll go wash. Have Halloween party plans, this weekend. Anyone
    playing can dress up. So for Sunday night anyone expecting to get kids trick or
    treating. Make it go and get some candy for our House but. likely it'll be in
    by the occupants the House rather than. kids. When when my kids were little there
    were a fair number of trick or treaters around, but last year I don't think we
    had any. So it's kind of sad. anyway. So I think i've updated the dates everywhere,
    for the assignment to. So we have our meeting now then your opportunity to respond
    to meeting 20 foot this meeting so open until midnight. Before the night. Now
    sure I changed that group rating oh. So that's this is funny. See, if anyone else
    thinks this is funny. So I created the century CEO groups rating of view. As a
    way to. have something appear in the gradebook. So you can see the value calculated
    based on your group members rating. So I. there's two parts to this, so I changed
    the ratio group assignment due date to Monday. But I neglected to change this.
    And this one. doesn't have a submission, so the seer groups rating of you. Is
    do it's not do because there's nothing to submit. Is anyone appreciating the humor
    just so far. If following my explanation of. what's going on. So i'm curious if
    there any. responses. I don't see any. So for the gallery view of class now. When
    I. When I click to open it I don't get a very big one. So if i'm starting. From
    the hide thumbnail view some non occupying screen space, then they go to the gallery
    the grid view pardon me. Then I get six. Six of you. Six participants at a time.
    Okay, so Martin, what is the attend come. And I can take a guess at that, but
    you have to explain your question a bit more. Oh code okay yeah i'll get I haven't
    done it yet we'll do it very shortly. So that's. That makes our discussion in
    the chat here about attendance. makes me wonder if it's. it's it seemed like a
    good feature to have. If people joining a meeting could. join the chat. That has
    existed for the whole meeting. So you wish, you could scroll through the scroll
    back through the comments that were made. So it's not clear. When people join.
    Because. we're talking about. code at 1239 and then. Also 1239 every done with
    attendance so. It would be nice to have the chat appear for everybody in that.
    Was joining the. The meeting or yeah this session. anyone have any thoughts about
    that. I think we should suggest that to zoo. Anybody want to use their microphone.
    So, yes it's a great feature a great feature request you think. Or is is it or
    I mean that would be a great feature.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it depends on the context, but it should be an option to enable it
    if the host wants to.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: That would be a. possibility.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think this is a case where someone will channel i'm not sure I could see
    the previous chat we have never experienced it but based on that if they can do
    it in the chat room I think it's possible in the meeting room as well, but they
    have been implemented it, yet I don't think so.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I so. The comment from Ashley about. Whether. It would be. You get our
    different class meetings run together. I think, because we terminate. The meeting
    and. We have. single URL for meetings but. You we start them up and closing down.
    And so we. We have separate records so. I think. The continuation over meeting
    boundaries wouldn't be a problem as far as I understand. So. It took me away that
    the chat. conversation took me away from the communism to make about the grid
    view of participants so. If people. and your reactions were. So i'm gonna. This
    is the audience participation part so get your reactions winded dialog box palette
    whatever out. Okay, first of all give me. Please. Okay. I wasn't talking to Ashley
    was that request. So what I observed. Is that in the grid view.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and on my personal view, I see disclosure human computer communication class,
    this should be in person discuss shouldn't be reminded. You need communication
    if people need to see people in person. So. I don't know there were so many classes
    were delivered in person, this semester, they were able to do the squares, not
    many people here, not many students will not even 20 students on your with 30
    students will they were able to manage this class in person.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well, thanks I appreciate that comment. So there's 49 students all together
    class.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Still, they were able to break it into two sessions everything were possible.
    But again, you know, sometimes things so not easy We do understand we are in a
    pandemic. But. You know everything we're manageable there are so many pluses are
    delivered in person, I hope, next semester. We are coming back to school. and,
    hopefully, things will become better yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: I agree. So. One class i'm doing online, which is meant to be online so irrespective
    of the pandemic. And the other one is going to be a hybrid. Offering so half the
    people in person.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: it's good it's good to at least you're seeing someone.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah I know. it's tough, I find it tough as well. Because we're whereas beginning
    of the Semester so as as of August 16 I was able to come on campus. The. Well,
    I was able to come before that. But they were checkpoints at the entries and I
    had to sign in every day that I came. So I was excited that staff are coming back
    on the 16th of August. But since then. I mean I expected that there'd be more
    activity on campus than there has been. So I come to my office and I. Do my. zoom
    meetings from here in my office, but I really don't see other people. Occasionally,
    see a colleague in the hallway. So. it's better but it's. I would like it to be
    better, more quickly than it has been. So I I empathize with with your sentiment
    Martin.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.you're welcome.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. yeah so that's an important perspective. That we can talk about. The details
    of interfaces. That. We can remember to connect. These details of interfaces to
    people. And we're not we're not just talking about. Some abstract concepts. we're
    talking about things that have real consequences. mean last day we talked about.
    life or death immediate life or death consequences. But there. There are other
    sometimes more subtle consequences. That we have. To deal with we're dealing with
    technology. anyway. So. Anyone who wants to talk about that some more we can do
    that. So what what i'm what I was getting at. Is when you react. So if you click
    on an emoji to react. Something I say. And if any does anyone can anyone. want
    to try that again. So do give a reaction Okay, so I see 12345 okay. So what I
    notice about. So my expectation is. And I can. Because. reactions are. All available
    on the same. dialog box or pop up window. So now we did emojis so. Now i'd like
    you to do, yes or no. Is Friday your favorite day of the week, yes or no. i've
    seen. Oh it's one. One no vote at least. That doesn't give me. doesn't take me
    to people love answer yes or no. And so here's another design feature suggestion
    I would give to zoom. Instead of requiring me to set up polls. For impromptu questions
    if I give me a yes or no question. How about. giving me a summary or running total
    of yes or no votes. In the. In the chat. So if I said yes or no is Friday your
    favorite day of the week. Then we could just see. people's reaction to us that
    could be just a very quick form of all. That would be a good thing for me. Because.
    No matter how much I think i've got things sorted out ahead of time. There are
    things i'd like to do in class and. And then, if i'm going to create a Pole and
    it's just. So frustrating to do at the moment. anyway. So, the last thing that
    I want you to try is. raise your hand. So. Now now my display is reacted differently
    to this. Because when you click when you raise your hand. Your rectangle goes
    to the top of the list. So I think Nicholas was the first one. So what I. What
    I can observe is. So my expectation is when you react. I because everything is
    on the same. same dialog box all those controls all those reactions are available
    at the same spot. Then I I figure if you're reacting in any way i'm going to see
    that the rectangle is going to be promoted. To the to my view but that's not the
    case. Only raising hands changes. promotes your your. rectangle. So you can turn
    them off now, if you like. Okay, so before I forget let's do the. So as a key
    and avast you so. Do you have something. To add to the conversation.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No, I just forgot to lower my.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. there's the password for attendance. So. Following from last day. I
    found one article one blog post about dark patterns in advertising. So i've included
    the link here. I feel like. There can be some. Investigation about. How many times
    people. click on ads they don't want to, especially on a mobile device. Trying
    to scroll through something on your phone. And many times you get. taken to an
    ad that you're. That you're not interested in. That also leads me to the thought
    of. We think of this as a game. what's a mobile game. Using. guess how it is using
    adsense or like sort of like having a blog. and Using the Ad placement algorithms
    that Google provides you. or. Whatever whatever ad. and services, there are. We
    can sell space. And allow you to sell advertising space. To have those ads is
    sure that the minds are the traps in the game and you got to go from one from
    top all the way to the bottom. Without getting caught. I don't know. If it's a
    one like that. idea for a game. Nobody likes my idea okay now i'm hurt. Oh, is
    that is that, yes, about my idea okay thanks thanks to boss. If it wasn't don't
    you don't need to clarify. Okay. So I posted the link to the acm code of ethics
    into the chat last meeting. But here, it is here, it is again. So it's not really
    about patterns. But I wanted to include it, because then the acm case studies,
    a cm code of ethics ethics case study about dark ux patterns. is about what we've
    talked about, but I just I wanted to create a separate link provide you with a
    separate link to the acm code of ethics. So one pattern, I wanted to talk about
    so in the textbook we talked about the Swiss army knife. navigation pattern. Has
    anyone. heard of that before.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: If you have the latest edition of the book it's on page 45. So. At first I
    thought. And you are courses, with the hamburger menu. they're not you know they're
    not using the. The pattern correctly here. Because the. it's not how I expected
    that the hamburger media to react. But then occurred to me that Well, this is
    really maybe the Swiss army knife navigation pattern. But it's not exactly like
    it's illustrated because. Oh wow a new version of Java is available i'm gonna.
    hold off on that. So in the diagram in figure 13.4. The menu. is hidden on the
    side and so. So. This behaves. A bit more like the Swiss army knife navigation
    pattern as described on that page in the textbook. What have boots illustrated
    in the textbook is the icon moving as well, so we. So. The hamburger icon would
    be around with your courses. Is in the header so. The header would also be animated.
    So when the menu. pops up POPs out of the side. The icon would slide over as well,
    everything was slide over. And then return when you click on this stuff to hide
    the menu. So i'm prepared to give you our courses or moodle get more credit. Through
    the use. Of this. navigation after. anyway. So I was talking about. Ethics case
    study. And it's already 10 after. So i'm going to. Create for breakout groups.
    And i'm going to give you. let's see some will say seven minutes. will make make
    four groups so they'll be about seven. per group. You can assign yourselves to
    the group. and discuss the ethics case study that link there. And then we'll come
    back for. Three minutes discussion. Okay, so the room should be open. To discuss.
    Slow take up the breakout rooms, I see. there's still 15. Okay 14 scan better
    now so discuss the link case study about dark ux patterns and also common about
    the ui. Or the case study. turn on screen sharing. Okay, any thoughts about that
    case study. anyone think of gambling is a especially dark.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah like I guess like this is a study of those options those icons are those
    links which we see in all of our site which are intended. Which are region made
    to trick us users. and Like. It will take us to that link, which is, which is
    harmful, which may harm the user, maybe by any fault. program or maybe any virus,
    it can it can it can be harmful to the US so so these dark. You expectorants are
    maybe for. like this study is for. Like design designers who are designing in
    these patterns to trick users.
  persid: S04
- desc: Case day is presented. So my thought. Because i'm sure you're interested to
    hear what I think all the time. Is that there's no information about. This specific
    principles. And the principles that they're up listed here. aren't links are clickable
    links to navigate or getting pop up. A detail about. What the principle is. So
    it's a little frustrating and it's not as useful as it could be. If it. If the
    case studies talked about. The. Applying. The code in more detail, I thought.
    And maybe. The relevant pieces of the F code of ethics. Part of the document.
    Here are the principles that are most important. And here's why they. they're
    violated by this kind of example. Okay, so i'll ask if anyone who agree with me
    or not so give me a yes or no, if you agree with me. about my. idea for presenting
    the case study. 1266 yes. Oh, and once somebody's crying. Well, they stopped crying
    go back again. I know are those tears of joy or. tues a sentence I don't know.
    open for interpretation I guess anyway. Thank you for joining me today for our
    25th meeting this semester. I appreciate everyone's involvement. And I wish you
    have a great weekend happy Halloween and we'll see you on Monday. Okay, thanks,
    a lot take care, everyone. And if you'd like to turn on your cameras wave. Before
    you go for the weekend that would be fine too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have a good weekend.
  persid: S05
- desc: thanks you too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: weekend.
  persid: S06
- desc: Thanks i'm gonna go dressed up as a grizzled old man. Nice you if you think
    i've got look for that. anyway. Have a good weekend everybody take care.
