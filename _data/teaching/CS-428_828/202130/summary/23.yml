- desc: Good afternoon. Yes, thanks Jeffrey happy Monday, yes, well, I have happy
    any day that we get the chance to meet like that's right. shouldn't just be reserved
    for friday's. Any day of the week is class for some celebration, I think. So Jeff
    a good weekend. rough riders one Finally, why I feel goal after losing two straight
    by a field goal and each. I thought it was going to be. quite so close on Saturday,
    but. they're getting close to snatching. defeat from the jaws of victory. So.
    wow I didn't realize, there is an event going to that in saskatoon. With it, I
    guess, there aren't any. Public health or restrictions. Did they did they show
    you the did you have to show the vaccination. Well that's encouraging at least.
    Okay. Okay, so. let's talk about. it's not the second individual assignment. And
    next project installment. Which is due, on Friday, I believe. let's do our attendance
    first. There is a password for today. switch the student. So I can show you what
    you'll see. Okay, I guess, because i'm not an either of these groups and I don't
    see the due date that's why. So there is a. Okay, because i'm not in those groups
    I can't even do it. So let's. let's switch back to my normal and go through the
    process of adding me to those two groups. So I can click on the links. The settings.
    users. And groups. myself to this group. Now, is where the market as well, just
    to be safe side. groups. do the same thing for the other. The Grad section here.
    switch my role back student. Okay, so that I didn't know that submission status
    was clickable there. And i'm not sure why. The first one is. As blue text on grey
    background and the other one is white text in the Gray background. anyway. So
    this should be description. There we go for undergraduates. Then here is the description
    of the graduate one. Okay. So if anything's not working, I think i've got things
    linked correctly, with a few most any problems I won't go through and test them
    right now. Well, maybe I should. So you can search within Chi confidence. So there's
    that. link to the acm digital library. This one. yeah so that works too. Okay,
    so I think this should be good. So for the students in for 28 and giving you the
    choice of what you'd like to do. It doesn't have to be. written report necessarily.
    i'm open to your suggestions what things and i'm given a few examples there. So
    it just needs to be related to some of the topics that are. on my list for our
    course okay. So I included here a link to the video. About flight for one that
    I mentioned on Friday. So the heading is now broken by our land caused. This massive
    group just crash into in Miami. there's some other. There are some reenactments
    of the sequence Canadian show called mayday. did a piece, but. This is maybe a
    little more to the point. Okay. We talked last day about that Harvard. Open data
    catalog. So, as you think about how we might presented. A catalog. Okay sure let's
    talk about project, part two. So the idea is. Once you do think about. Okay, so
    we help to help to get the exact idea. What what. is not exactly. What what part
    of the.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So I was a little confused when going through the project so first in the
    first two, paragraph it says that you get to have two metaphors and then. Based
    upon those two metaphors design like choose one activity from the project and
    then describe it, and then in the rubrics direction it gives like two different
    ideas it says like. First sketch your first idea and described that idea and there's
    a middle part that says iteration of the district, or something like that, so
    I was like a little confused, are we supposed to like. kind of like. give it up
    metaphor first or just go through by the rubric presidents and even in the rubric
    I was a little confused about the second part that's the iteration of description
    I didn't like understand what it means.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah okay. So the idea is. is to think about two different start with two
    different metaphors come up with two different metaphors that could help to organize
    information on the interface. So that help users understand what's available and
    what they can. Do with the interface, and how they interact with them. say if
    it's a calendar. or an agenda or Bolton board. To you, if you say it's like a
    Bolton Board of said calendar it's like an agenda. Then there are certain things
    expect to be able to do with those things and then. So you present information.
    According to what. People are. you present the information in a way consistent
    with metaphor. So. The trade off that if you make it too precise then people might.
    Have. To specific an idea of what they can do. With the interface. If you have
    it. To to general. Then doesn't provide enough guidance so. So they just pick
    up pick out two different metaphors and. And the different let's say the calendar
    and the agenda or. Will keyboard. And how. What what come at what capabilities
    does that interface make available. Consider concert in in. respect to that metaphor.
    And how does it present information that metaphor, so that the gap ghosts of execution
    and evaluation are reduced. So I think the records consistent, the only thing
    that i've talked about. differently here it's. The interface process description
    iteration. interface a iteration process description interface be iteration process
    description. So the idea is maybe you don't. You don't need you can acknowledge
    that you're not getting. The complete answer the first time around. Or maybe there's
    some improvements that can be made. If you're in your first idea, and when you
    present so it's, not to say that. You have you have to get to the point of. perfection.
    But you might want to. in discussion with your group say well Maybe this could
    be improved or. use a different label here for this controller so on. See. See
    you don't have to. argue that you've come up with the perfect solution. or. were
    to say admitting that you. You had some discussion about these things. And maybe
    it's not maybe it's enough to say here are some questions without even a face
    that will test. will explore during testing. So if the ideas you're not. risking
    marks by admitting that. This isn't the finished product that you're presenting
    here. That make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes. So just to like sum it up so first we have like draw sketch let's say
    like from our group project we made like four activities and we choose one activity
    from that. and based upon that and how we think about like how to improve that
    we are giving two ideas of improvement and we're sketching those two ideas onto
    paper or maybe on any interfaces or something like that and we're saying we are
    giving a metaphor for that to ideas like this is. Maybe like according to this
    this kind of metaphor, will help the user to understand the new idea or activity
    that are we are proposing like and after that we'll.
  persid: S01
- desc: start with the metaphor, and then you're going to try and think of the metaphor
    after you created the interfaces right. Okay, so think about. The activity, this
    is like. Using account here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: This is. This is like using a jet, then the phone way. So. I just want to.
    In case, our. So it's important distinction. We start with the metaphor, and then
    we sketch the interface that. Are the interfaces that go along. well. An interface
    for a metaphor, so the idea is to have two different interfaces for the same activity
    same task. But the different because they. fall different metaphors. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah that makes sense okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: So. And I know some people are scared of. That scared but. or Mary of drawing
    by hand or. ruler, and so forth. So if you absolutely need to do a sketch in some
    drawing tool red lines of restraint and. The text will be nicely labeled. that's
    okay. If you have to do it. I would understand. But don't get attached to. i'd
    say don't do it in a tool that allows you to convert that into. To code or or
    things like. I don't want you to come to attach to your. sketches that you draw
    this point okay that makes sense. That was response to Peters question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, thank you.
  persid: S02
- desc: you're welcome. OK, so the iteration process description is is just. it's
    an acknowledgement that. you're not finished designing yet. When you design at
    the stages and have to perfect. me I guess you'd like maybe the issue, the little
    red flags that you. Might notice. With your sketch at this stage, they could say
    well. Once we did this, I realized, we discussed it and we realized that this
    should be a little different. me. know or we we started out by saying. submit.
    let's move on the button, but then we enter change to enter or something. My I
    don't think i'm adding any value discussion anymore. You have any more questions
    about the assignment part of project, part two.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Is Professor one last question. For the metaphor, that we are choosing so
    let's it. doesn't metaphor always have to be related to a real life situation
    in the sense, not a digital. But can we also give the metaphor as a like a digital
    let's say we are doing an e commerce website designing and something like that
    and we're giving a metaphor, maybe for another. digital platform, and I say we
    are giving a metaphor for Facebook so would it be validated it or do you have
    to give like a real world situation that's not digital.
  persid: S01
- desc: So is the example. So I would say. When you if you have something that. The
    target group of users is familiar with, then you can use that as a metaphor now
    it's going to say about Facebook, is, I wonder if. If they have consistent metaphors.
    You can say it's like. Adding to your story or whatever.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: I mean is that do they stick with. What my feeling is that Facebook has changed
    quite a lot over the years.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah no I was just giving an example like.
  persid: S01
- desc: I just I understand that, but so. I think anything. That that's a reference
    point for your target. User group. is fair game is can be used as a metaphor,
    you know it's like. liking things on Facebook or. Less moving more stable one
    is an example. yeah. So you're not stuck with. Having. To think of a non digital
    reference. I mean that might be appropriate that maybe it's not. But again, everything
    is it's. You want. To be able to transfer. The idea of making the connection is
    helping the users to transfer their experience. With this other setting. From
    this other setting to the new one. so that they understand what kind of capabilities.
    are available in your interface by thinking about connections with. The metaphor
    you're making. The metaphor you're using.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah that makes sense perfect.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep Thank you.
  persid: S01
- desc: you're welcome. Anything else it could. come up. So we started talking last
    day about. What we might do or. What kind of metaphors there are valuable. And
    I thought it was just looking. i'm scared and can you see the suggested list here.
    Thank you can. i'm never sure what's going to come up and since. That is a catalog
    there we go. So. A catalog is a complete so whenever dictionary and says well
    okay so it's from Oxford. Maybe. it's interesting how they had different spellings
    you know. As part of the entry and then the examples. Of course, being Canadian
    this is. The puppy you and after the gene. Whether the party. So complete list
    of items typically in alphabetical. order. So it's not quite clear what systematic
    order is in. Your is for these. items. So here's one we haven't looked at the
    morning. fitness classes. So that link promised us to download something. Are
    we down now. Well, this. is done. To stop moving one still loading. let's finish.
    Well, maybe not. yeah I think it's downloading. Not as far as. The graphic is
    concerned. it's happy to see that TIM hortons is we open on campus. Maybe starting
    today. OK so again it's lying about download. So if we're looking at. The definition.
    catalog a complete list of items typically one in alphabetical order or other
    systematic order. So does that seem like a reasonable definition. So does it seem
    like we could. create an interface that. That embodies that. idea. of a complete
    list of items typically not work, wherever systematic order. So what are some.
    Everybody. This is page reflect a complete list of items. it's featuring dozens
    of publicly available data sets around Harvard. That include. Since being complete.
  persid: DHH
- desc: There is no categorization by the alphabetical order of our by category I
    think. Some important features.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah so. Okay, so we're not getting the list that you have a complete list.
    So, with the idea of many more to come what's. yeah that sounds that. doesn't
    really encourage us to think that we've got the last. mean that the list is changing
    that's fine so today they're say 150 data sets. And tomorrow, there might be 200
    or next year next semester, there might be 300. So that. So if you wanted to think
    about. A complete list of items, so you might think of. How many different. units,
    there are. On campus which would collect data like published data. and Maybe give
    a fraction say. I don't know let's see. We could explore that a little bit might
    say. Still learning. Look at the source side for the greenhouse gas emissions,
    so that goes to the office of institutional research. And then, it has a factbook.
    So the fact brokers and tenants of general sources of information that the university
    if you're part of a Harvard office looking at institutional data to support a
    specific. Business process or questions, please contact us circle back books are
    available for download, although they may not be accurate are consistent with
    definition current definitions are reporting practices See also harvard's common
    data set and other resources. So the fact book, we could say is see how much of
    that is published. Then, before we go into that the common data set hmm. What
    does that entail. see more information about the data Center initiative. So that
    this feels like kind of maclean's survey of universities kind of data set. We
    can Canada. I could be wrong, but they haven't. Is common data set, and this should
    have this really. Very detailed explanation. let's look at what the common data
    set for Harvard is for 2021. you're not going to go download that considering
    together paged. Never to load anyway. Here we go. Maybe I can post this file since
    we're. Basically, at a time now. So I just. want to get back to our idea here,
    so a complete list of items. Because the catalog is a complete list of items.
    In in some kind of systematic order. So, of course, being a certain age that I
    am. I remember when going to libraries and actually having to look through card
    catalogs. Reading. books and so forth in the library. We typed on two cards that
    were placed into. order. And I want to say by library of Congress number University
    of Regina. There are other ways to urbanus books as well. So the advantage of
    having a digital version. So it might say the day the catalog catalog is like
    a library catalog except that we can change the order of. Change the criterion,
    by which we're ordering. The entries. For example. Okay. That makes sense. Okay,
    so. we'll see you on Wednesday, I also have an hour tomorrow one to two. And if
    I don't see them see you Wednesday have a good day take care. and we'll continue
    with a thought or two more about. This interface not not to pick on Harvard but.
    let's make some connections to. topics that are of interest to us. Okay, thanks
    again have a good day have a great day take care, see you Wednesday.
