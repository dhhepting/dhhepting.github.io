- desc: Good afternoon. Everyone have a good break. did anyone have a good break would
    anyone like to say. That the break was good or not. Not like you're reporting
    for almost everybody in the class. So maybe a smaller shrinking portion of the.
    population is interested in the rough riders one, so they have a home playoff
    game this year. I went to the game, on Saturday in the snowmobile suit and it
    didn't freeze, but I wasn't. comfy cozy all the time either well mostly my gloves
    were not up. Today is a little bit more slushy. strange to get a fog alert. Yesterday,
    from. The weather network. But again, strange weather is the new normal. So I
    went to. An equity diversity inclusion workshop for science. Over. Well, we could
    go yet tomorrow on the ninth was. So they used. zoom in some interesting ways
    so i'll try and do one of them today. They. shared this. Is a shared screen. And
    then. Sorry, I was just so the comment about being muted and I thought I don't
    think i'm muted. And I sure, as I can tell i'm not so i'll continue. So I didn't
    mute participants because. There seemed like somebody had their microphone by
    mistake and that was. Because there was an assumption on my part, but you can
    unmute yourselves. And I certainly encourage you to do that. When you have something
    to share. Checking the website didn't build. today. Okay, so i'm not gonna. Take
    a more time in our class meeting. issue. let's do the attendance. So I want to.
    talk briefly about the formative feedback. I got so there were 11 responses another
    49. And I think, regardless of whether you. submitted a response which is bottomless.
    We should still change the setting now, so you should be able to. see this on
    your own computer. So this is a summary. So i'm not sure that the average rank
    is very helpful indicator. With the average score so. By being always in one being.
    Never. gets a bit long maybe a bit more. So. I do worse. It using class time effectively.
    Along with the best. With encouraging student participation and treating students
    with respect. So here's the breakdown of responses. In case you're interested.
    So I want to. Talk about what would you like to change about the courts. So the
    first comment. I understand that to be a little bit more structure. Less. variation
    on. Learn. Less improvisation, perhaps. So. I feel like things are flying around
    today because. Like yet. Though I have. The plan in mind. Something comes up so
    it's not working. The technology is not working for me like today, a little bit.
    Then I. have to. improvise or debug. In the class time. And I must say that. doing
    it. talking to my computer and Sam now. is leaving lot well. there's not the easiest
    thing to do it in Washington others. So I would say, though. That. The experience.
    That we're having with the technology on my laptop here in my office. Is what
    I think usability designs about user user interface user experience is building
    design. design of interfaces and thinking about. These real life issues that come
    up. This is really. Not a not. The central and not tangential course. Okay. So
    instead of changing i'd like to add prototyping using software, such as adobe
    and fig. Yes, the password is just. yeah thanks. So a question. That we talked
    about. before the break in. terms of zoom interfaces before. joining a meeting.
    A class meeting or any kind of meeting in progress. Did we. Is it possible, or
    is it. Something to consider about providing. chat history, from the start of
    the meeting. So people can. scroll through and. catch up by reading the chat.
    Okay. So prototyping software. i'm. Like my first inclination to adobe. But that
    doesn't mean.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That.
  persid: ???
- desc: If you're comfortable that you shouldn't use it, so I. am thinking more. More
    about tools that are free to use and. Possibly. Free as an open source. Okay,
    so. So I know you can do a prototype. In PowerPoint as well. that's not a free
    tool but. that's something that a lot of people have access to. Okay, sometimes.
    feels like classes are not content rich. and discussions revolve around science.
    So I guess that's both a feature on the bug. What. I mean. So, in general, the
    courses range to to go through this design thinking process. i've tried. To bring
    up materials that support the different stages were in. boss, you had your hat,
    you have your hand up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, I have comments about. This feedback i'm just wondering, and this is
    not so true because we already have on the materials for this course. We do we
    have to do something practical in class if we want to do, practical works in class,
    so we have to talk about the projects, the details of assignments, so we can easily
    access to the contents of discourse but it's hard for us to figure out how we
    can do our work. that's why i'm deciding this feedback.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. i'm not trying to. We got some feedback going on here. than me. Trying
    to. say there is a problem with any comment i'm just. So if we're meeting in person,
    sometimes I would play the videos. I would play videos in.
  persid: DHH
- desc: class.
  persid: ???
- desc: And do more work on the whiteboard. and try to. write legibly and make comments
    about my struggles with writing clearly on the whiteboard. So it's it's a challenge.
    So I would say, I feel like they're content rich, but not. Not in terms of. yeah
    not. Not in terms of package media. anyway. Okay, so the comment about. direction
    in the class so. The direction we're following is. Based on the project assignments.
    And we're halfway through the Semester and. I haven't learned anything new. That
    feels just the same as another class i've taken with Dr happening in the past.
    Okay, so we're actually more than halfway through about three quarters the way
    through. We have 38 meetings in today's meeting 29 and. So. feedback that i'm
    collecting it's. about my. Is what my heart in your learning. But i'd say there's
    also. A role for you to play in your your learning. So. So anyway. i'm open to
    suggestions about. make things more. more interactive and I know that. For example,
    I. Like William shatner. tend to have long pauses at times when i'm talking. And
    that's whether i'm in front of class in person or. I think it's only worse sometimes
    now that i'm. Talking head. Poorly lit with the fluorescent light bouncing off
    my. receding hairline. So. So I. I have the same a similar outlook in different
    classes, that I teach. So i'm trying to also. encourage student participation
    in those other classes. So I. appreciate everyone's comments, and I would. encourage
    you to reflect on. opportunities. I don't want to feel like i'm getting. Sorry,
    to. get off topic this as much as I am on topic. Some days. So the breakout room
    discussions i've tried a few things differently. And I was in a breakout room
    discussion in my workshop. And I. I felt. I felt. The same. I was not. eager to
    volunteer things. Within the breakout group and then. But I would have done it
    had there not been other people. directing the discussion. So understand the dynamic.
    And i'm. Trying to experiment with. With ways to. Make the remote online. Experience
    better. So it's still working progress. will be fine, of course, can be conducted
    in person, I think it's more fun in person. And I miss being an. front of. A group
    of your smiling great. room full of your smiling face. guess anyway. When I learned
    to do is next was show you this. idea of. annotating. Security. So what i'm looking
    for is a way to make. Make your annotations anonymous and I don't see that as
    an option.
  persid: DHH
- desc: you're muted.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I saw that this.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thanks Jeffrey. So zoomed in like me. sharing my whiteboard Let me try that
    once more. text. So I think. You can annotate on shared content anyone like to.
    Try that out. Okay, so ice I see there's one person is able to annotate but. Nice,
    I saw your name as well there. Is there an option for you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't think so let me try again.
  persid: S04
- desc: To hide your name. Oh here hi Dan names of vanity. Well, that was so under
    more. Okay now you're. To annotate anonymously. Okay. So this might be a. Better
    approach for breakout rooms, that I can. write the question, not in here. you'd
    be able to see it. Okay. yeah. start again. Okay. So i'm going to save this picture
    and post it. So I feel like we. made some progress with. chat is far more convenient
    okay. that's. that's point well taken, so I think. What the opportunity is. With
    the annotating a screen is you can do it anonymously. Well i'm just seeing that.
    I see somebody's name.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So you can also annotate by. typing you have. If you click on text.
  persid: DHH
- desc: text doesn't seem to me. I don't know why. Maybe only one person can enable
    it other time.
  persid: S03
- desc: i'm not sure. Well don't erase those. picture oh.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: alright. So any. Coordination issues with your testing groups. or any other
    issues with the projects before we. Before we say goodbye for today. So. Is there
    a chance, the project we pushed in Monday. I think that would not be a problem
    with that would be helpful to you. tried to copy somebody direct message into
    the. into the chat for the didn't work so. i'm done fighting with zoom today anyway,
    so I hope. got a little bit of a. Better ending than a start and that's that's
    how I felt about today, so thank you for your. participation. And so i'll make
    the change. To the part three to. You, on Monday. and we've got office hours tomorrow.
    And then we'll see you on class or class time on Wednesday. And they care everyone.
    bye. Thanks up. Stay say.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you so much. Thanks.

- desc: I think marvel is a free tool
  persid: S15
- desc: any other tools that you can suggest or tried?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't agree with this comment, discussion about the topic of assignment
    makes the course more interesting and we can apply what we learn from discussion.
  persid: S12
- desc: Exactly!!
  persid: S16
- desc: I agree with Nazmul. We are going through a process together in our group
    assignments. There are some readings from the textbook that complements the class.
  persid: S13
- desc: can you try annotATING? PLEASE? Please :-)
  persid: DHH
- desc: typing in chat is far more convienent
