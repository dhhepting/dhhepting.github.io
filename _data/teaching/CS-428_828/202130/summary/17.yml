Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: So I just added a couple things to. yo line here. Maybe has regenerated yet,
    let me check. We share the screen first. Okay, so their responses from last meeting
    up. and as well. Okay, so let's do attendance first. So look right so we're crew
    to do attendance. Okay. I don't think I think i'm still let me check well. Sure,
    let me check on the status of my post question to Google. question. yeah. No,
    nobody likes my. Most. Let me add it to our. URL to our. pages, so you can have.
    So a question. About that so adding at view equals one. seems to give. The best
    display of information, so why is that not the default. Why do we default two
    weeks. worth of sessions and week and then we have to. Perhaps. Then we might
    end up with. Like me, clicking on the wrong line and that could. be confusing
    for some people. In some ways, maybe it's a bit like. And the choice between cream
    and milk. and pressing the wrong one and spilling either cream or milk. Is a capitalist
    and under the right spouse. anyone have any comments about that, I guess, to finish
    that thought okay. So you got the pastor Dan. And this is done. Then I lost my
    place. Okay. tense. up here already. And i'll publish this, this is my local web
    my. My laptop. Now publish it after the meeting today, so far, one of the product
    is due today any questions about that. Would anyone like to have a bit of a group
    time today. Let me do a poll see what works. So I don't know why can you can you
    see this poll window here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: S01
- desc: No.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I don't know why. It came up with the previous one. I didn't. get a chance
    to. create a new one, so. Now i've got. Things. As manage my screen space very
    well zoom. keeps popping up and wanted places over top of the things I want to
    type in. Maybe let's just me. Okay. All. Let go up to a minute here. Okay, so
    got 32 out of 34 or 33 I guess because. i'm included in the 34. So we have a two
    to one. To two votes in favor of group time. versus to everyone says we don't
    need group time today. So. we'll spend will reserve some time for that. So I just
    wanted to say, also about office hour we'll do an office hour today, immediately
    after class. To make up for the one that I missed yesterday because my appointment.
    And then the department meeting that we had. Okay. No i'm not sure i'm getting
    spitting beach ball death of my MAC here. not sure why that's happening. stopped
    spinning. My still sharing Can you see you see me go through that. I don't have
    a little okay so many other women. Why don't we take 10 minutes now for group.
    group time. And then. Then we'll finish up with our rest of our discussion today.
    Okay. So i'm gonna make 13. You can choose your own based on your project groups.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: Excuse me. Okay, so any questions or concerns that came out of your group.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Time today.
  persid: ???
- desc: not really. One thing. We can't help but notice is that. Like it's a for me,
    as well as a nother member of my group. Like in comparison to our project groups
    and breakout groups. Like we're actually able to talk and work together sort of
    deal because our breakout. groups. are really small, because it is listed that
    there's eight people in our breakout groups, but maybe only two people show up
    so to do. So yeah we were just thinking about that there's nothing that concerns
    me about our project group so okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: So. Last semester when winter, I tried. breakout groups that were generated
    random. And I tried different sizes. So I started with think five or six, then
    I made it up to about 10. But I thought. It might be helpful to have a Brit. A
    breakout group over the Semester, so that. Some discussions could be carried on.
    So this is a perfect example of what we're discussing. In terms of an interface.
    So I have. It as a designer for the class i'm thinking of. an outcome that i'd
    like to achieve. And i'm which is. Discussion in small groups. and I have had
    some experience with the platform over the past year. And thinking that. Having.
    assigned breakout groups through discussions. might be more helpful than having
    them formed a random. But I understand. We don't have all 49 people.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: Here today so there's. there. In my. Maybe maybe a good trade off would be
    just to say. You can select your own groups. But make the number of groups. dependent
    on the day. And maybe not have. breakout group discussion forums, but have maybe
    have maybe that's the place to put the wiki. associated with breakout their discussions.
    And then, if we have like we do today 31 students. And then we could say do for
    breakout rooms. So I know not all I have a feeling that not everybody is actively
    participating people login and they go do something else. I have that suspicion,
    because some people don't go into breakout rooms, when I say going to break up
    go into your breakout rooms. That might be a better approach. So i've given you
    my designers perspective. And from your user perspective, you see. Oh there's
    only one person in my breakout room and it's not fun, or maybe two people. And
    it's. it's not a good way to do discussions. Like. catch.
  persid: DHH
- desc: My drift and. I just I don't I I do do not know, like what could be a potential
    solution so ideal to that it's like do you just merge assigned breakout groups
    that are less active than others are sort of ideal I don't know.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah. So. Maybe after the long weekend when I do breakout groups i'll just
    i'll make up a number. Based on the attendance for the day and. invite you to.
    US and maybe still lets you choose breakout room, so that you can. So actually
    here's a question, do you do you see who's already in the breakout room when you
    join when you select it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You can through desktop i'm not sure mobile.
  persid: S01
- desc: OK. So maybe. We could just do. group breakout group MOD. Whatever we have
    so people are in breakout group eight or seven I guess or seven parts and we have
    three of them so. Seven month three is. one. Right. So you could. could do it
    that way. Not you could do it, we could do it that way, we could try that. make
    sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It does. Hopefully, would work. abraham's a more straightforward with a no
    but yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: So Abraham we were talking my thought was if if we have seven assigned breakout
    groups where. People are. You know, given ideal circumstance everybody's there,
    we can get together with those five or six or seven people. and have discussions,
    each time and then we can continue the discussion. So sometimes that doesn't work,
    though, so when we have. Not as not full attendance we. could make up a number
    of groups based on the attendance, so we have 32 let's say. Then, that would make
    for groups of eight students. And then. Still, let you assign yourself to one
    of the group pointed to a breakout group. breakout room pardon me. And if you're
    in breakout group number seven a suggestion that I had was. Use the modules operator.
    So this different math is time so I said four groups so that means we want to
    have. 123. or four so seven divided by. Four has remainders three, which is what
    the modulus operator does so, if you're in group seven you could try going to
    group three. I don't know if i've made that more clear, I hope I. I improved the
    clarity, a little bit. But we can. Oh. Thank thanks for that comment. Okay, so.
    I have an error that I can't. spot. So i'm not i'm not showing the stuff on my.
    On my locally hosted web page so here's the raw source code that i've just talked
    about. So this is it. There is a response from last days meeting that said something
    that was most difficult to understand. Who is that the best design choice for
    the coffee machine for the. cream and sugar dispensers cream milk and sugar dispensers.
    So. Is there always a best design choice. yeah so maybe for a given user or. A
    given group of users, there might be one that's better.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But.
  persid: ???
- desc: We don't know offhand. Design involves a lot of trade offs, so we talked about.
    Trade offs and metaphors. We want to have a metaphor, to help people understand.
    The new functionality that's available. So this is like. So, putting sugar into
    your coffee in the lab calf it's like taking a spoon and you putting. As many
    spoons of sugar as you'd like. it's not exactly like that, because the spoons
    are different sizes, based on the different cups sizes, you have. So we don't
    want to make it too specific. And we don't make it too general either. And so
    the purpose of having a metaphor is to help people understand the new functionality.
    So we can. We can force them to think about in a certain way. We can encourage
    them. So, so there are a number of trade offs there so other other trash might
    be, there are some limits on the design of the milk and cream dispensers based
    on. How. The dairy provides the milk in the cream. or. It might be some other
    technical issues. So these are. pieces of. These are different pieces that we
    have to win against each other, I guess. So what the second point I wanted to
    talk about. So okay understand the best design choice, so we have to understand
    the users. And we. need to trust the process. The creative thinking, the design
    thinking process that we've. discussed and seen examples of. So if we trust that
    process. Then we'll. we'll come up with a good decision for the the people who
    are. we're trying to serve by with the interface. So I want to talk about my own
    experience with Twitter, this is a few years ago. And I haven't gone back to Twitter
    sense. So I was trying to advertise an event one day. And I want to make sure
    that certain people receive the notification. So I sent the same tweet. With with
    different names in the Ad side address two different. Different accounts are different
    users. And I ended up. Having my account locked on Twitter. So I had to scramble
    with them. To. Traffic to have the account restored that day and I. promise to
    not do it again. But where the problem occurred, for me, was. I was thinking of
    Twitter like email, I think. That I need to address messages to people, and so
    I didn't know how to. achieve us or direct message kind of I wasn't I don't think
    I had. No oh. So there, there is a mismatch between what I thought I should be
    doing in the interface, and what Twitter thought I should be doing an interface.
    So. I ended up with a not a great positive experience and then. I decided that
    Twitter just wasn't. A crucial part of my. Online presence. So. I can see a show
    of hands or. A yes reaction. How many people you are using Twitter reasonably
    regularly. No okay. No. Who knows, one yes. Two yeses. So for the people who are
    using Twitter, who are the two of you who answered yes. What kind of how. And
    you wanted to tell. New people about it. Somebody you want convince somebody to
    join Twitter. How would you describe. The interface, what kind of metaphor, would
    you. use would you you'd say Dr happening, you can. Twitter isn't like email it's
    like. Something.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Well, one of the most interesting point I would like to talk about is that
    any time if we hear some new news. Most of the time from the social media it's
    always like rumors and fake news, but if someone from. Like a celebrity or a well
    known person who is verified on Twitter they post something officially that is
    like considered as a news. So for the part why I use Twitter is for stock market
    news or let's say some for cryptocurrency the best was when Elon musk tweet something
    the cryptocurrency price rises so Twitter was the best part.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay. I appreciate that. you're using a. service, so I guess. that's the modern
    message service that's way news is communicated.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Now, but from a user perspective. it's not like email it's like. And, and
    you use it you just reading Twitter. You reading other people's tweets or do you
    tweet yourself.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No, I don't tweet myself, but I use it as like a from user perspective it's
    like discussion forum kind of thing, so if someone posts, and then we can reply
    on them like I had to most of the time I replied on post my own tweet. But that's
    how it would, if I personally feel as a user perspective it's like a discussion
    forum kind of thing, so there is a main like. author, who posted and then other
    one other people have to like take and reply or respond or the poster quit.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: If people retreat, I understand that, so you can pass it along to people you
    it's like. Marking this is more important because you're retweeting it. But you
    said now but. it's like a discussion forum, but if you don't write your own tweets
    you read you retweet. So, but if you reply isn't that like Kurt writing a tweet.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, we can relate it as writing or tweet but on the states like a nested
    in it, like the way it's presented on the wage it always shown in nested form.
    And also, you can read it, a comment, if you if you want to do that, but yeah
    so it works both the way you can also consider it as a discussion forum like what
    also buskers like a tweet.
  persid: S03
- desc: huh.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But there's one of the most simplest form of like social media.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay. Any other comments about Twitter. Okay, so I guess we're out of time
    today. So we had some good discussions about a few things. So we'll leave you.
    And i'm going to switch over shortly so i'll be available in my office our. Starting
    at 132 30. In my office zoom meeting. Anyway, for those who don't won't join me
    there or won't see you there have a good long weekend and happy thanksgiving.
    Take care and see you on Wednesday next week. enjoy the last bit of warm weather
    more much whether I guess it's I have 17 today, I think. Anyway, take care, all
    the best see you on Wednesday bye.
