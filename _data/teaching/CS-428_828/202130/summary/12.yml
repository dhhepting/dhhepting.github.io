    password is on the screen and in the chat as well. So I got a message from Sebastian.
    Both. recruiting participants for his study so boss talked about his. His class
    so Sebastian. is also not using the participant well as I recall. So. So, like,
    I told the boss, in future, you should specify a proven method of the computer
    science participant pool that would make it they'll give you more options for
    recruiting people. To go ahead and take a couple minutes and tell us what you're
    doing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you so much for allowing me to talk about my study, so I am a Grad student,
    my name is Sebastian Gomez and i'm working under the supervision of Dr olin Haber.
    And we are actually doing a study on how students how Grad students conduct cross
    session cross device study in academic digital library, where they continue. started
    tasks on a device, and then, after some time they pick up their task on a different
    device and how they how their behavior various in these activities so. We are
    recruiting Grad students PhD and doctoral students and masters students who. Were
    from the computer science department so that's why I wanted to come in here and
    talk about it, so if you want to participate in this study, a semester, students
    and if there are any PhD students, please. You can email me, and I can schedule
    a study session based on your availability and.
  persid: S01

    and then I will assign you a task, and you will search on that task in a given.
    search interface digital library search interface similar to how you how the digital
    library of our university works, so you will. enter your query, you will have
    a list of documents you will collect some of the documents and then. It will expand

  persid: S01
- desc: Thank you, thanks.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, thank you Sebastian okay. bye bye. Okay. Okay, so then attendance so
    here i've posted on your courses an incomplete list of project groups based on
    the emails I received. So i'm going to click on that and then have a look at it.
    And then and. Then we'll. Add any other groups today. That that have come up but
    I didn't. retreat from my email. and we'll make sure everyone's in a in a group
    for after today okay. Now post, the link on your questions. So I think iPhone
    arrived late, so this post. Your tenants password once more. So remember. The
    helpful renaming of. Your zoom window ID username you'd like to be called and
    then your China. ID. here. The ID from the your email account.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And china.ca.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so I know there were some discussions. In the project discussion group
    from and Martin was involved in one of them it's Martin here today. Okay, so without
    singling anyone out. The people who are posting in the group discussion. Can you
    write in the chat. or use the microphone. To tell me about your group. Okay, so.
    If you haven't had luck in finding a group. we'll make sure you get assigned to
    a group today. Change the groups are to add a group. I go to the users. So click
    on the gear sign here. And then go to users. And then groups. So i'm going to
    add another i'm going to add members to group eight. OK, so now. Okay. Okay. So.
    Kevin and. tn will get you sorted out in minute. So if we're doing think about.
    The interface that i'm using here to make groups. If you're doing this. What if
    well if you're looking at me. and listening to what i'm saying isn't doing this.
    What kinds of things, would you write on an empathy map.
  persid: DHH
- desc: My first word Ruby it's pretty convenient. For the same part. Being able to
    choose the grill then. assign yourself.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So you're not assigning yourself i'm assigning. The is teacher mean you don't
    have. The chance to do this for yourself. As students but. yeah it's. So flexible
    interface. But is it quick.
  persid: DHH
- desc: can be quicker, but still I don't think it's that bad so. Because we are,
    I think the morn new interfaces are like more quick modern in the sense, like
    the other platforms, that we are used to create a group let's say discourse and
    stuff like okay let's add it quickly and stuff but. I think, given the circumstance
    of our institutional based and. All the other functionality, as I say, it's pretty
    quick.
  persid: S04
- desc: So. Is it helpful to. So I mean it seems like some reasons so i'd like other
    people to get involved the conversation as well. um. Not that bad and. You know,
    for the institutional interface or the sounds. So sound like reasons to lower
    our expectations about. The interface.
  persid: DHH
- desc: My. perspective was just taking an example of that said this quarter is only
    built for that purpose, so just to communicate and then share and make groups
    and channels. But I think your of courses is not like just focused on that particular
    thing, so it is also focus on so many other things as well, so that was my intention
    of saying institutional. Not lowering the standard but saying that it is just
    not focused on making groups and discussion, but also other things, and it is
    actually heavily focused on the other things more I guess so. That was the reason
    why i'm here.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay. anyone else, want to chime in about this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: As prefer, for I do put my comments in the chat box. i'm just wondering why
    the search bar below instead of on top. of one of the comments I made then I don't
    know if there's an option to select multiple to death, at the same time.
  persid: S05
- desc: I think there is actually the multiple selections Okay, but I mean, so you
    can experience this interface. From the experiment, you are courses. Where you're
    all teachers.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I heard a thought on this so other than what Peter mentioned usually in the
    interfaces when you add someone it goes to the right side of the screen, whilst
    here it's inverted goes to the left, so if i'm used to putting things on the right
    side, this might confuse me as a user.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah so there's also the extra step of going through. You have to go to the
    bottom of the screen okay now let's go back. yeah anyway so. The fact that you
    might have the list on the left and then the new. That we've swapped the columns
    here from the usual. interfaces can be problematic. I agree. When the search bar
    is at the bottom, which makes people scroll. This hard to fit everything on the
    one screen so we're scrolling and clicking a lot.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Also, what is the order of the usernames presented.
  persid: S07
- desc: I think it's alphabetical.
  persid: ???
- desc: starts with K. yeah.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah and the fact that the columns are so narrow. We have to scroll sideways
    to. see all the information. Okay, so. So I think so. Many of these have been.
    Many of the groups. You typed in the chatter are listed there, I think. yeah so
    I agree with justin's comment that if i'm making if my goal is to assign students
    to one group. We can make better use of groupings here, so I could say i'm working
    on the project grouping. But they don't. Have a way to use the grouping. In the
    assigned groups. So if I wanted to say. Let me. fill out the project, the project
    grouping. So here I am adding another one, I have to go down to add and remove
    users. Okay, so we should have. So for 49 students, we should have 10 groups of
    four and three groups of three. That works out nicely, I think. So if we go back.
    Okay, so. Go back to groups. and check on our progress here. Three 711-711-1519
    20 320-731-3538 41. So we need two more groups of four. So be nice if I could
    just say fill in the rest. But that doesn't work. Here I can I can auto create
    groups, but I can't. just say make two more groups of eight two more groups of
    four. There is a way here too. So i'm going to pick. four people here who are
    in two groups. i'm doing this. command. click here, so I can make a selection
    of. Several people the time. So they should be four people left with two wearing
    only two groups. So let's go to overview. let's do the project grin. So the first
    eight groups or start with group eight so jeffrey's Ikea harpreet Singh and sandy.
    you're in project eight Abraham on you, Michael and Martin or a group project
    nine. And project 10 is Amish. cattle and Smith. There you're in 10 and 11 is
    nima as well and have us. 12 his progeny. We go up and Wilson. Project 13 is precious
    mix mix in. Our knee minjun. You can. Take me to task for my pronunciation later.
    well. I apologize, but please help me to do better. So. If n G and arm, Mr deep.
    Projects 13. Okay, so how did that go. So question about the columns so let's.
    So columns change there but. I don't think they change. Maybe a bit. We can't
    drag them out to be any bigger they're not controllable. Make the window bigger
    than they can go bigger. yeah so it'd be not a bad thing to be able to close down
    the other column to just have the main window. That would be a helpful thing.
    Okay, so. You see if I can just update this. will take out. I just leave names.
    In the final version for analyse, you can know which group you're in. Okay, so
    there's that. Okay, can everybody see that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, sure okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So we do a breakout room with the project groups. I didn't say that everybody.
    So i'm going to create 13 breakout rooms and then. And then pick them from the
    list of. What project group list. let's get that back up. Okay. Does that make
    sense, what i'm asking you to do.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just joining your assignment group I mean if i'm 11 I turn number.
  persid: S08
- desc: record from.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thanks for today have a good day and we'll see you Wednesday.
