Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good afternoon, Professor happy Friday.
  persid: S01
- desc: thanks you too. So I have my own experiences with poor interfaces today already.
    web now application that I was. Trying to use to compose a note to somebody. And
    not once but twice I. had written a bit of a message and then. I lost. My note
    without. saving a draft. realize it didn't say when I back. And I thought Oh,
    maybe I did save one. So I found something that looked like we really will draft
    most desired composed, but then I couldn't access the text from them. So it was
    a very frustrating experience for me. I have another example to share with you
    as well. The first one to tell you the story about Jeff raskin they will not as
    anyone heard that name before. So anyone see the Steve Jobs mood. Jeff raskin.
    So I was gonna say if anyone's seen the Steve Jobs movies. A couple years ago.
    You made a brief appearance and both of them. passed away a few years ago, but
    he wrote a book called the main interface. He was one of the designers behind
    the MAC the first apple MacIntosh computer. Well, and that one made me think of
    endless. So he proposed. As his first love interface design. Computer show. do
    no harm to a user's work or through an actual harm to come to a user's work. Does
    that sound familiar to anyone. way that's phrased no I haven't said the password
    yet. What did you think about that for a second, while I get the classroom. Just.
    Not sharing my screen, so you have to trust me. When I say i'm doing. So does
    that. Anyone familiar with. Isaac asimov story ago. Sorry, is what androids in
    the three laws around rights and the first one is. do no harm to people. or through
    an actual harm to come to people. So it's the same principle. That seemed like
    a good stay good first law for interfaces. of interaction design. So then these
    last cleared what other ones we said, the second one might be. The computer should
    be no should. not make the user do any more work things absolutely necessary.
    So there are some tedious tasks. The computer could look up one of my favorite
    ones as. well. Looking at postal codes and addresses. typing across the board.
    We should be able to get the address. For them, for us. Unless you want to make
    the people. Know unless you're testing the people. Make sure they're not trying
    to. Be somebody else's address or something like that. There are times when. We
    also want to. So maybe we shouldn't computer shouldn't require or interfaces shouldn't
    require people type in things that are easy to verify and. easy to pull from a
    database more accurately more consistently. than people might be able to take
    them themselves in the movie also less variable. data. So another example of typing
    impossible as one, so they won. encounter this problem, so when you type in possible
    without. I think we have an example, this semester. You type in the first one
    with small letters. or spaces are too many spaces or small spaces between them.
    So the postal code for universities as for s 082. So how do, how do we answer
    that correctly. So instead of. Testing users of all the to. enter the postal code.
    You can give some. Some hints or we could just reformat. brothers or lowercase
    uppercase. So just make as far as 082. And then we can also. Look, for ones that
    don't have spaces, or more than one space or. Some other character in between
    when. We can do our best to make them into the proper format. The way that we're
    not avoid we're not putting extra work on music. But I think an interesting interpretation
    of. The amount of work necessary is. We don't want to. disengage the people. Were
    interacting with the system, the point where they're they become. This is they're
    depressed the return key here is some tasks, but we don't we don't ask them to
    engage in. Meaningful cognitive creative work that's being done in the interface.
    So there's an example from. flight for one. night. just occurred to me as we started
    talking about my experiences with. Anyway, so there's a video on our most. Of
    the flight for on so this is a brand new plane. crashed into the Everglades on
    moonless night. Because, ultimately, the. indicator for flatlining gear. to evolve
    in your pocket. That would light up on the years down the burnt out. there's a
    host of. This was a system within a plane, with a new. autopilot system. So all
    the people, although captain. Captain. Captain. Well, focused on changing the
    ball. In the star tonight, what happened was there in a good mood disengaged.
    The autopilot. and Because they weren't. involved in wine, the thing that focused
    on changing the light bulb. We didn't realize the problem, the. wire situation
    they thought it was too late. So that's the case where we want people to do more
    things. The amount of work necessary for people to be. tips and engage. me activity
    during the CLS also on the new newer one, we also have. kind of haptic feedback
    the steering or shaker something if you going to do. Things like this, so. Make
    sure that you in the loop driver. So I had some links to that material. In the
    summary. So make sense. So here here's the other interface. With giving you some
    grief yesterday. Just gonna share my screen in a second. So I was I encountered
    this mercury open data project. It was pointed out, as an example of. What universities
    are doing want to provide access to open data. So just occurred to me. may consider.
    well. How well the. metaphor can conveys what's possible the interface so. You
    think about the metaphor. What it supports and what could be improved. make sense,
    so I just had this big one piece attacks. The copy the text from link here that
    we're going to visit in second school now. The description. So we're student talk
    to the group that aims to increase transparency and solve problems on campus these
    in public Harvard data. flagship product is targets first open data catalog when
    we gather dozens of public Harvard data sets and agreed upon story. use data science
    and data visualization techniques to analyze data on campus safety faculty gender
    disparity student government election turnout and trends and concentration popularity
    to name a few. So the ones that are going. To go look at the. The data catalog
    and second. When. So is this. what's this first at that Well, this is part of
    the open beta catalog but then, this seems to be separate it's wrong. So let's
    look at the trends and concentration popularity. So. That. that's a separate into
    comment. Anyway, so it's. So here's the open beta. So it seems to me the data
    catalog is a model for. You say there's a catalog. used to be, that is very exciting
    to get the sears catalog at home. And should be. thick book with 10 pages in full
    color pictures of all kinds of things. that are available. They don't have anymore.
    So i'm curious. So what do you and i'm going to ask you to maybe think about this.
    going to. Good schools. doesn't matter what you expect you to do with the data
    catalog So if you have any expectations and. there's the metaphor. Okay, so there
    is a question for breakout groups so it's. That seemed clear enough. So we have
    36 participants so. Why don't we do five breakout rooms and then i'll let you
    choose you. So. let's aim for seven or eight people okay. So do 10 minutes for.
    The breakout discussion. So if you have if you're at the breakout room that's
    the number one through five. You can go to that one. And then, for the people
    who. were six or seven add your songs to one of the other five groups. and looking
    at the number of people in the group so. I think we should be able to see four.
    By. seven or eight people in my group of one of the five breakout groups breakout
    rooms okay. So I realized that i've turned my video off here and now i'm. Trying
    to resume and find where the button is under all windows. i'm back again. So any
    thoughts about my question. The data catalog.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We had a good discussion about it.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So, from my group. We were expecting like. The data data will. Show us the
    data and will and, as there was a download option we thought that we would have
    the option to download some data set from this page, but there was no option to
    actually get. This kind of data set I mean wrote it as it.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah why I was trying to decide myself yesterday and I noticed that the first
    four or five links clicking downloaded didn't send me that didn't give me a bottle
    of fountain download. And if I i'm sharing my screen now I think stuff I click
    download download on the first one. I get a. spinning icon. So it seems like it's
    working but. I didn't get anything other than the spinning icon to say that there
    was. Something going on some progress happening. So let's just go back here and.
    So here's the. And the other thing about this is this first entry will greenhouse
    gas emissions, I go to the source site. It lands me at the office of institutional
    research. And then. I don't know which one to go to so. It shouldn't be an active
    link because it kills it comes back to the same page. So do I look under factbook
    accreditation people or contact us under the fact book. So I can instead of being
    directed to this link originally. The sustainability greenhouse gas emissions
    in the fact book. And up of the homepage of the office of it's crucial research
    and then I have to figure out where to go from there. So the click on what page.
    So this is really this. The same thing as a download link now. So I had that experience
    with a few things so. Anyway, i'm sorry I didn't mean to hijack your your conversation
    your comments about the your experience, so what else did you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Know it's good, thank you for showing us what you have figured out. We also
    figured out something like that, but your experience was like in detail.
  persid: S01
- desc: well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And, and I also we also find out that in the category section they're actually
    filtering the data, rather than showing the categories. I mean they're making
    a combined starts like and operator, when we are just clicking one a category
    they're taking it as a filter search and just showing that specific thing.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Oh he's not kind of category they're just making it like a filter. I think
    so because, when you start multiple topics I mean you select multiple topics they
    actually show nothing because they take it as an end operation, not a water person.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It was.
  persid: S01
- desc: Yes, so that's right so good observation to Michael. So it looks like it's
    a menu. Then. We don't expect that. behavior to be able to click on these different
    things. and have them stay highlighted so it looks like one thing, but then it
    behaves differently. So that the system other way, to say that what you were talking
    about non-small. So what did you. Do you have some next expectations of what you
    could do with the data Calvin like.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For me, I sort of being able to open data thing is in a collection of open
    data they expected it to be kind of homogenized collection of different data points
    with possibly some nice visual representation of the data. Possibly a metric to
    comparing the different data sets along some common metric. I didn't expect an
    index of links, which is what it is.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: And then. We will. Clearly labeled links, as they are downloaded so our site.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I think. there's more pointed that out as well that that's all the down
    there's nothing to download right.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: well. You think there might be. and see if I could go to this, the Harvard
    shovel API. I think that gives me a warrior. Yes, I can't be reach check there's
    a table and Harvard EDU. let's see if a person has been in data. So, again it's.
    This one is data but it's not. One of the form to download one thing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah actually it, it could have named as a view more more information, but
    download naming about them download doesn't make any sense.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: And I was inclined to send them a note, then I can identify an email address
    when you want to be responsible for this. will be interested in hearing from my
    comments about. Your experiences with it. But very about my comments about my
    experiences with the open data catalog. So. Okay, so I wanted, I put down the
    assignments and projects. As. The theme for the day so. I. Put. The second individual
    assignment for for 28 and a 28 on my page not put the link in. should be there
    under assignments. Anyway, so there's that and. Maybe for Monday we can. If you
    have some ideas about where the data catalog could be and. Making that metaphor,
    more consistent and how you might. approach you redesign this. catalog for the
    people at Harvard. and any ideas that come up so we, we can talk about on Monday
    and we'll have some time for. Project work if you if you would like. Okay. Anyway,
    okay i've kept you now couple minutes late, I apologize. Take care have a good
    weekend. See you on Monday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.you're welcome.
