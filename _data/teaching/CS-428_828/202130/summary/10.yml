Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon. So any thoughts about the. election. For those of you who
    are able to vote.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Class till we get i'd say what. Co hosting.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay i'm gonna. mute everybody and just. microphones on. Not to discourage
    you from turning them on but. So we don't are not all talking at.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Once.
  persid: ???
- desc: well. it's. interesting time that we live in isn't it. let's see scenes. Well,
    I don't want to get too far into the weeds here. OK, so now i'm sharing my browser
    window. Okay, so our meeting today is number 10. Okay, so let's. Get attendance,
    first of all. can see the audience here. So problem with his direct. These windows
    icon mouse pointer. Manipulation kind of interfaces they have to be able to see
    the controls to. activate them. So there should be a password for today posted
    into the chat and you can also see it on. The shared screen. Which i'm going to
    close now. Well i'm going to close that window anyway. Okay, so i'm just wanted
    to. I highlighted a couple. comments from their responses last meeting. So why
    do they not reconsider the designer move these weaknesses of their work. So my
    response to that is. So do you think it's uncommon. To find interfaces that have.
    Issues. Then what concepts that we discussed that could explain this phenomenon.
    So. Open it for your chat or audio comments. You want to show it on mute unmute
    yourselves just raise your hand first Okay, please. Carol do you have. A comment.
    Can you unmute yourself, please. anyone else does anyone have a comment about.
    Your response to my question. So when people when designers create interfaces
    that are difficult to use. and Have issues for people to work through. Why is
    it still. An occurrence. When is it still happen. Quite regularly.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can you repeat the question. or put it in the chat.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well it's also in the stream chair is that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Which 1am I supposed to be looking at.
  persid: S03
- desc: First, why did, why did they actions elections Canada not reconsider the designer
    movies weaknesses of their work. So, then, the question was is this uncommon that
    we find. interfaces that are difficult to use or. difficult to follow. Were the
    gulf's of execution and annihilation are large. So what what things that we talked
    about that could explain the presence of these. kinds of interfaces. Okay. You
    have your hand up first you put them. Okay well we'll call and then. anyone wants
    to. add something to the discussion, please raise your hand. Go ahead, sir. Thank
    you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So from the previous day's discussion I just think that we found only one
    error that was the. Capital or small cases there right we're putting on the zip
    code there and it was having a. Sudden air, but the error didn't operate the second
    time, so if we are talking in that context, so I can say, maybe you know the election
    yeah they can it's an easy fix they could easily put some of that. You know a
    little bit of effort to fix that thing and it's not a big thing we know that,
    but the thing is maybe you know their main priority is not that and also maybe
    the target is not for like a. Long term goal is just a short term thinking people
    gonna be used it for like one day today and stuff so didn't like care about it
    that much maybe So yes, I said, obviously it's not like a perfect one, but I don't
    think it matters like to too much. Because.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay anyone sure okay so Sarah thanks i'm just going to try and engage some
    of the students. On conversation and so thanks for your time. So it's only happens
    once every two or four years that people go to that kind of website. If they go
    to the website they they're interested in voting and they're not going to be put
    off by some usability issues. That seem like a good. to know.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, yeah it does, and we have a good Greek calm comparison, for that matter,
    like you know this kind of collection and government matter we have one, on the
    other hand, like we have that. government of Canada website, which is like. Really
    regularly or maybe weekly maintained and they're trying to fix every single error
    that defined and something like that, and then there is this election vote kind
    of stuff that is on going on and they don't really care about this kind of small
    minor mistakes.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay, so. Sarah i'm going to ask you to let some other people. He Okay, so
    I see that Peter has his hand up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, so I don't know if I fully agree that it doesn't matter, because we are
    going to use it for just one or two days, because at the end of the day, your
    website portrays the organization, so you should put something out there that
    should be. There should at least be effective or yet dosing for some difficulty
    when using so my view I just say, maybe more of like a user centered design approach
    was not followed. Or maybe they didn't get enough users to test the website before
    they pushed it out there that's my own take on this yeah.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So for me, the postal code issue, which only popped up. When. I tried to load
    it the first time I couldn't recreate that error on my browser. That wasn't the
    only issue it's like. There are problems with. The dates. I found that so. Even
    on election day there were still. It was still information about advanced polling
    in mail and balance. Which weren't applicable, so those could have been. Disabled
    on the screen. And the way they said, what do I, they had asked the question,
    what do I need to vote. There wasn't a clear connection with with those. buttons
    under the what I need to vote. Question and so that. There there wasn't a. Solid
    connection between. The question and the ones that provided further information.
    So, to me it seemed like they could be going off. Leading. The citizens astray.
    By not having a clear connection, so we asked the one want to know what I need
    to bring to vote. And just have clear clear answers about that. So it's not just.
    Whether there. there's a generate. error messages and. Their their. issues are
    more subtle than that. I think. So we've talked about empathy. and sympathy and
    apathy.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That.
  persid: ???
- desc: Are which are different approaches to. understanding our users. So it's not
    always that we have designers. Who we're wanting to understand and empathize with
    users. So I ended That way, there are still lots of interfaces that have issues.
    that's my take on it. So the selection. Like super bowls and pandemic protocol
    street borders as a story and the leader post the vagina newspaper. and At one
    point, I heard that the former costco super bowl is the largest super Poland Canada.
    But I didn't in the Leader co star rating it says one of the largest so i'm not
    sure. Because we have the largest TIM hortons and Canada, that we also get the
    largest super bowl in Canada. And I don't know that those two are.
  persid: DHH
- desc: related.
  persid: ???
- desc: it's my attempt at humor. on a Wednesday afternoon. Nice move, you have something
    to say.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm sorry I already wanted to say hello time picking up regarding your. concept
    of fixing the website of election election Canada, but you've already pointed
    it out.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Thanks. Anyway, so I was concerned when I went to the super bowl on one day
    off to work. That they were well the. The parking at that place that old costco
    is not very good, and so I think the longest period I was waiting. One spot was
    trying to pull into the parking lot. And then they had. two lines, so they divided
    divided the falls. into two groups of your. What one side you went through the
    front door. And then there's another door on the side with them. If you remember
    the group of Poles. and They broke down the polls. We had a series of. lanes demarcated
    by sharp shopping carts tied together ropes. So you found your. it's a bit like.
    traversing a tree. So they said, if your goal is a fan. Say 100 to 200, then you
    went. To the right and if it's between zero and one and 99 then once the left
    and they kept breaking things down. So, ultimately, the line at the pole that
    I was. Getting at was very short there's one person ahead of me. That went very
    quickly, and I was able to get out very. Very quickly, so. From my experience
    with with that place. was quite positive. So it's also easier to. It may be easier
    to. design and debug something physical than something on the website. So anyway
    i'll leave that article with you, so the election 21 election 2021 link is there.
    To read about voting in China. So the comment about empathy maps. So let's take
    on an example today for that and I have a link to an article about empathy mapping.
    So just to go through the comments yesterday there's a website for the project
    have to be a social media site, or can it be of any kind. So it's really any software
    interface that your group members are familiar. And that's accessible for others
    to use so websites are probably good but. Because they're easy. easy to get other
    people. Trying to look at that was satan's one. But it doesn't have to be so.
    It. What I want you to do look at something that's existence and something you're
    not going to design. A brand new thing we're going to take a look at something
    existing and see where their issues. So. Each again at the project if each team
    Member has to create for empathy maps in a group of four leave to create one for
    themselves So yes, so that's. Do an empathy map for yourself completing a task.
    In that interface. And then you empathy maps. The tasks that. Your other TEAM
    members. indicated as well. So here's a suggestion that seems good on the surface
    hey don't you think rather than finding a set than us finding our own groups would
    be better for us to just use our breakout room as our group for the project. So
    no I don't think that. Because. record rooms are up are between five. between
    six and eight So those are larger than the groups that I wanted to focus on for
    the project. But you might. For your group of eight you might find. The side that
    you can do to project groups. within that group of eight. You there might be some
    overlap between the breakout room in your project group. I think that's okay.
    Peter you have your hand up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, Professor please related to the question on the empathy map the fourth
    party Max by group member. So if i'm to run and putting my for my colleague who
    is in my group do I have to watch him or her walk on the website on come up with
    empathy map or I take her activity or his activity do it myself then draw the
    empathy map.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah you take that at their activity, the activity they've identified and
    you do it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, thank you.
  persid: S05
- desc: You do the math for you yourself with that activity.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks okay.
  persid: S05
- desc: you're welcome. Okay. So I summarized a little bit. I hope I hope that I hope
    is helpful for the individual assignment so you're. Trying to summarize the discussion
    we had yesterday. Although I took zoom until this morning to finish transcribing
    the audio. So that's why it's been uploaded just recently. In the summary. But
    anyway, so for Simon when you're asked to emphasize with the teacher using you
    are courses designed some content that you will present to your hypothetical students.
    This content will consist of one activity in your courses in one resource your
    courses access to the resources to based on the grade for the activity. As a teacher
    you use your courses to create your content. For the assignment, you will reflect
    on your use of your courses and create an empathy map for that experience Lastly,
    you will consider any issues you encountered while creating your content and your
    courses and describe any opportunities through design. So the idea is to focus
    on identifying problems and not presenting solutions. I hope that's consistent
    with what I said yesterday, and what i've been saying. Previously, as well. So
    yesterday was announced. I think it was yesterday it was announced that there's
    going to be a qr code available through. releases catch one who vaccination. So
    I collected a few things here. This was done before that was more recent announcement,
    I did this last week I got the screenshot last week, so this is the process to
    create a stream scattering.ca account. Then validate my identity. And validate
    your pin. So. And there's a news item will further down here. sketch and residents,
    no longer need pin sign up for email. So I was thinking. So has anyone done this
    as well, we went through and signed up for Neil director. Here in my my SAS health
    record, I should say.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I did before coven.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: that's a long time ago.
  persid: S03
- desc: Was there a requirement for a pen Do you remember.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, they had the mail. That out Okay, I was a annoying because it took a
    whole week.
  persid: S03
- desc: You know. and So I thought it was valuable. When I did it last week. I gave
    a callback number, and I will probably an hour an hour and a half to get the call
    back.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The content I do is updated now and it says that is no requirement for pain
    from Sep tember 20.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah that's right, so I have the link to that story as well down here. At
    the bottom. But I my experience with having the panelists. Though it's frustrating
    in some sense because. I have. I need to have a copy of my ID to validate my identity.
    So. Falling or. Not the pin isn't an issue, but the calling in and speaking to
    somebody that was that it became a big bottleneck. But I found once I got the
    call back with it was not unhelpful because. That, then, the person directed me
    to the last stages of looking through and making sure that I. was able to activate
    my account. And there were some things that maybe. They explained that weren't.
    identified. In the interface beforehand.
  persid: DHH
- desc: or.
  persid: ???
- desc: So so easily expressed. On the website. So it was helpful, not for the pin
    but for. Your support for clicking through the last few strings iPhone. So I have
    some links here, so instead curtis's gotcha and that's the account. So you click
    on that. So this is the government saskatchewan website. So. Nicole good. friend
    front page. So if I search for approval vaccination. So that brings up this website.
    it's quite a long. So now. It says the code vaccination record available qr code.
    So if it's. My it's my SAS health record. And then I get the email. that's yay.
    login button is this link the beginning here, instead of. Okay there's also login
    here that's further down the page. Tell us health space. age and then I get the
    services scattering.ca. So now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: well.
  persid: ???
- desc: account, and I can. I can get a vaccines vaccination certificate. So it's
    a smart health cards qr code. And the fact that it's in both official languages.
    seems to me that it's. there's. It hasn't been developed on in saskatchewan. But
    now I can view that certificate, I can do a PDF. Or, I can download file to upload
    the applications. And I don't know any applications that will accept that phone.
    So I think, maybe a PDF better choice. This is. Now, if I go home so it's a warning
    to help protect your information, please be sure to press the sign up button at
    the end of every session and close your browser receive an error message upon
    logout please ensure all browser sessions and flows. So. So we can think about
    doing an empathy map for. This process. and You can do that as an example. So
    how are you feeling do you feel. empowered by that message that warning to make
    sure that you're keeping your helping to protect your own information. Or is it
    an abdication of responsibility of the website. For them to terminate your session
    after. A period of inactivity. Is it is it. You feel good about having that responsibility
    to put on yourself or. Do you feel like it's should be the website developer provider.
    who's securing your information. make sense that choice.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think. yeah I think it's good to give a warning message, because this information
    is confidential for each individual, and anyone can get that information. So that's
    nice good to it's our developers duty to warn. To get that particular individual
    sign out from his website when he is closing it. Thanks.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah so it's a good thing. it's a good reminder that should make sure to log
    out of the application so that your information isn't available for the next person.
    Especially if you're on a. Shared computer.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think it's fine to have a question here, like the users have to sign out,
    but if someone mistakenly doesn't notice it then. Though if state should actually
    be responsible for saving the data. It should not be always. I mean they use our
    SWAT as possible.
  persid: S06
- desc: Oh. So, can you see that on my shared screen. yeah your session will expire
    within a few minutes look here this thing saying again. So i'm not sure that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: let's let it expire let's see what happens.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah like I said i'm gonna stay signed them. yeah so it's a bit confusing
    why the warning that's michaels con. and So the other thing about the warning
    message if you receive an error message upon logout please ensure all browser
    sessions are closed. Let me sign out and see whether I can. Get that again. So
    that's not now, you can see that some good this json that status code 400 message
    session not phone. yeah so. What I was going to try and do here is this use the
    back button and see what happens. Okay, so that's good. press the back button
    again. And I get a blank screen. we're still working. So, in the last five minutes
    here. Stop sharing the screen. Well, you see this generic citizen more.
  persid: DHH
- desc: snitch.
  persid: ???
- desc: we're going to say that you will see this whiteboard okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: perfect.
  persid: S06
- desc: On.
  persid: ???
- desc: I met some put upon that I have to log out according to the warning.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So I might think.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm thinking, why not have certificate and formats that mobile devices use.
    So if I have an iPhone and there's. A wallet. It things can go into. And so that
    it's available. For easier access. So I can get. I can get my tim's card put in
    there, my air miles card. My vaccine you think my vaccine certificate. would be
    a good candidate to put there. and What else also the boarding passes when I used
    to take. My different places. So I realized that this is a work in progress. So
    anyone else, want to contribute to assessor dense as we end of our time today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And maybe you say is that is confusing that whether we should log out or not.
  persid: S06
- desc: yeah so earlier or last week, when I did this, I realized that I was still
    logged into my E health record. After. 24 hours so. Last week, the. session ids
    were not. invalidated like they appear to be now. So the other thing I notice.
    So when I was trying to find a way to log back into my account, I remembered that
    I created a sketch from.ca account. If you go to the website and try and login
    there. You get to. An account. It doesn't have a way to get to the my SAS health
    record. So the idea of putting you in a map here like. These four quadrants it's.
    Trying to capture information about the interaction that we're having with the
    system. So. It may not be.
  persid: DHH
- desc: important distinction between thanks and field so.
  persid: ???
- desc: Some items might go and more could go and. Then a variety of different quadrants.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But entering them in this map format.
  persid: ???
- desc: And I think of. This being well suited to having a whiteboard or like this.
    And then people putting sticky notes on the board in the different quadrants.
    And then coming back and summarizing that information. So it's I think it's useful
    to have this. spatial overview of now. we're not trying to force things into being
    a sequential. Work so some other ways some otherwise way ordered. So provides
    a different. appearance provides important. Important benefits for the analysis,
    I think. And my goodness now it's 25 after I apologize for keeping you. A bit
    longer. than usual. Even though you can't see my head on. least that's what i'm
    i'm not seeing my anyway. I digress so thank you very much for today, if you have
    questions. we'll. take them up on Friday. And I have an office hour between two
    and three. and Well, have a good day and we'll see you on Friday take care. Okay
    we'll see you Friday, or maybe it in. Half an hour, if you want to come to see
    me during office hours.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: ???
- desc: problem submitting my assignments, can I talk to you now.
  persid: S09
- desc: yeah you can.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You have been given permission as a teacher, to me, so I can do anything.
  persid: S09
- desc: Oh. Oh, so you don't have an account on your courses. experiment website.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe he didn't turn on eating.
  persid: S06
- desc: Let me, let me see. So I don't see your name listed. Amongst the. teacher,
    so I mean to school. So maybe I have people on here who aren't supposed to still
    be here. that's why. i'll have to. Is your email.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, sir.
  persid: S09
- desc: Now here refresh you our courses, you should see. That you have an option
    for experiment with your courses.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hi yes that's great Thank you very much for that.
  persid: S09
- desc: So you're very welcome. I didn't catch that before, oh no that's fine that's
    fine.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thanks, thank you, where it was.
  persid: S09
- desc: So then, just remember the turn the edit turn editing on button.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh yes, yeah sure. Okay Thank you everyone have a good one.
  persid: S09
- desc: thanks you too, take care.
  persid: DHH
- desc: bye bye Thank you Professor for a good discussion today.
  persid: S06

  persid: S15
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: sorry
  persid: S16
- desc: anyone?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Does the question make sense?
  persid: DHH
- desc: Not uncommon , issue to me is lack of following the empathy principle i.e.
    likely not a user centered design approach was used
  persid: S05
- desc: No its common,When the designer does not create an empathy map properly then
    it create the gulf of execution large .
  persid: S06
- desc: Adding to what's been said already. Its likely that they have not received
    a lot of feedback on the site as its rarely used. So the creator/owner of the
    site is under the impression that it is working and fulfilling its purpose.
  persid: S17
- desc: a few years ago
  persid: S14
- desc: yes, there was a pin requirement
  persid: S11
- desc: or a call in option to get PIN
  persid: S10
- desc: now, it is possible to call for the pin
  persid: S11
- desc: I never sign out of websites. My login credentials are saved anyways
  persid: S18
- desc: Does that choice make sense?
  persid: DHH
- desc: so that's a bit confusing in light of the warning note
  persid: S14
- desc: the warning should also informyou of behavior
  persid: S14
- desc: I use this website and they already implement the feature of auto logout after
    period of inactivity
  persid: S05
- desc: The message is more of just a reminder in case you leave your PC
  persid: S05
