- desc: Somebody. says that. That you. Okay, no worries so everyone have a good long
    weekend. So not so good if you're went to the movie if you went to the football
    game on Sunday. The writers last badly. But then Calgary also lost so what's good
    news. First game well that's great. I I have season tickets, but I didn't go to
    the game on Sunday, because writers haven't put a vaccine mandate in place, whether
    they promised to do it forward by the 17th so. just trying to do my part. yeah
    so the next game they're going to be they say they're going to be checking for
    vaccines. So any interfaces of note. Do you have any good or bad experiences with
    interfaces that you. thought were more. Over interfaces become more. present in
    your thinking than they used to be. Since our discussion discussions have started
    last week. That makes sense. So there's one. quotation on. My webpage that I like.
    A commencement speech. And I have. I have it on my. webpage but i'll just. Tell
    tell you the the bed now. Now i'll add the link. So these two couple young fishes
    are swimming along and. talking to one another and they all the fish. comes by
    and says hey boys how's the water. And the two young fish kind of look at each
    other, we kind of shrug and then. After he's got after the old efficient gone
    by the state, the hell is water. So. So the idea is that they're always. assumptions.
    We don't. distinguish. or things that we. We take for granted, or we don't see
    as being. Part of the Environment we're in. So the way we're. Taking that view
    of interfaces so. When we have. we're clicking on lakes or. Some other swiping
    left or right, I guess, or. You can use different actions we don't even think
    about them. necessarily as. we're interacting with technology. But. There are
    lots of issues at play there. We can consider. That make that make some sense.
    Oh, speaking of the soccer game, so I noticed Canada tied us on the weekend so
    maybe there's a chance chance that candidate will be in the World Cup was coming.
    In 2022 we had our. So, so is to go but. So we have 46 people today well that's
    i'm impressed. And let's see how many of us have video on. By doing me. So. Safe
    space to turn your camera on lunch to do that. Okay, so. I want to show you a
    couple things i've done on the web page. When you are courses. Okay. You can see
    my browser window now. So with meetings so there's the zoom link zoom meeting
    link that's been there before and i've added another page another link. Well,
    to a page in your courses that contains. The links to the all of our meetings.
    So let me just go into that. So this is copied from my webpage, but I just made
    the links. On absolute. So that they work in your courses as well, so in August
    we had one meeting, and then they asked us for a summary. Ours for responses.
    And then we had second our second meeting. On Wednesday last week. And in summary
    of responses. And then Fridays meeting summary and responses. And so, here we
    are, on Wednesday. The eighth or fourth meeting. So. This will give you a space
    to our page place to go to any particular meeting and then for the ones in the
    future. don't have married. haven't I haven't occurred yet is just Report No semyon
    or responses. I don't know about having see Ha ha Ha ha. About preceding the remarkable
    a candidate needing to. Have a ways to go to qualify for the World Cup. And I
    say that wouldn't send some human. Okay, so i've done. That so that's sort of.
    A page that will get you through the different meetings. So that's more of a direct
    link to what's going on in my webpage. Well, everybody should. is currently in
    the class should be. In a group, and they should be listed here. I tried to keep
    these up to date. So, once we have our. there's been a bit of activity, some drops
    and add so. We have. In class 49 students at the moment. So we have. One group
    of five people and two groups of eight, so I propose that. Now, after Monday will
    rebalance the groups that's all. or not. And we can see. Okay, and. attendance
    at meetings so. let's do. The password for today. Now I hope this is. So I wanted
    to get a report about what's been going on with attendance. So i've tried this
    and I hope it's getting the same error that did before, so this is the students
    so i'm not going to. So i'm going to take all I want all participants. Not specific
    users. So i'm just using the default here. Okay, so i'm going to download an excel.
    Okay. So, it gives me this air so MOD attendance attendance plugin slash students
    not found. More information about this error. This page is not exist yet you can
    search for this page and other pages. So, as I said, said before. Please. try
    and avoid sending me direct messages. In class and the other thing i've said before,
    is that attendance on one day is. Not a missing attendance on one day it's not
    a problem. I don't want to say. That anyway. it's just a way to indicate. Your.
    sister another sign another piece of evidence for participation, I guess. So.
    Now I know that things are recorded because. I. get an air I get a message saying.
    Let me see what I can. let's go back. To the attendance. let's see. settings.
    Okay, so if I look at activity completion. So this. So this is one thing that
    I noticed was. Because i've said for activity completion. Students monsters you
    receive a grade to complete this activity so i'm I wanted to do. grading of your.
    Attendance information so that I could so. You could see that you've completed
    an activity. But if I. So notice. The message here is this activity is already
    been marked as completed for 53 participants. Changing completion options will
    erase their completion state and they cause confusion that's the options have
    been locked and should not be unlocked unless absolutely necessary. So earlier
    to 62 so I know that. One person has. completed it since. Checking earlier. Let
    me see if I can refresh it and see. Numbers different again.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: ???
- desc: So are there problems. In recording attendance. Are you having problems recording
    your attendance.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think everyone did it.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm going to keep working on this, so this is. So it's a. it's it's. A little
    troubling I guess that's the word I want to say us. there's probably something
    going on, that I have. And I don't. Know i'm not noticing This being said, incorrectly.
    anyway. So, going back to the error message I would like to be able to contribute
    to the page. For the air describing the error message, but. that's just enough
    another layer of complexity that. One read I jumped into just yet. Okay. let's
    see all right. And here's the. Oh, I didn't make it available yet. So, can you
    see this with everyone's smiling face or icon. Here, so we are all teachers of
    this course. So let's make it available to. students. Okay, so this is just. The.
    This is the bare bones course that you. That. Information Services will provide
    for a new course. In your courses, so we have announcements, they do the course
    email. john. has in mind, but. Anyway, so we have these two things so announcements
    and courses now, then we have a list of features that goes a long. way. So we
    have 49. plus one for me teachers in this class and no participants. Most students.
    So that. So this is a way for you to explore. issues with you our courses. If
    you're interested in doing. Taking on some aspect of your courses. The project.
    is to give you a way to explore things from a teacher's perspective. Then also.
    mentioned that assignment. we're going to do some activities and reflect on. Sorry,
    I didn't hear. Your comment. was speaking there. might just hearing things. Maybe.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So we talked about heuristic evaluation last day, so I wanted to. Think about.
    Applying some heuristics. or thinking about heuristic evaluation, a bit more detail.
    So. Jacob Nielsen in 1994 put together a list of 10 principles for interface design.
    hey there you're mystics which means there are some rules of thumb or general
    principles that often are applicable or work but don't necessarily. always work,
    so there might be some trade offs involved. So and they're not so not specific
    rules to follow. So this is a bit more detailed, so we can say visibility system
    status is one thing. And attacks to talk about discover ability and. feedback.
    Right, so the idea is that between the user and the computer. You get. The user
    here. and discover what it's available on the computer running a particular piece
    of software. That that software and a computer can provide. And then. The computer.
    gives some longer feedback to the user. So that he or she can. decide what to
    do next, so there is a cycle that goes between the user and the computer or the
    device. So when the interfaces designed, well, we can talk about. You know it's
    just it's just things are just very clear. Things are sad it satisfying experience.
    it's very effective. All these superlatives. When things aren't. So well designed
    so well considered. Then it may not be so easy to discover what's going on. what
    was going on what's available with software or how to access that functionality,
    so we understand that you could. form a certain function using this laser piece
    of software. But it's not clear. it's not clear where to find. That piece of functionality
    within the interface. And it's not there, how to operate the interface once you
    find it. And the similarly feedback. You might get feedback if things are designed
    well we'll get feedback that's. How this jacket, what we need to know. to advance
    our. Words our goal of completing the task. But if it's not designed well feedback
    might be ambiguous. and many other issues. So we can talk about. When things are
    designed poorly. The boss of execute they've been golf services, the conceptual
    distance. Between user and the computer. So we'd like to minimize them. or a good
    design will minimize these calls. and designing well. Very large results. and
    sexual distance. And I don't know you just. Hand waving all make a diagram.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I do have one ready with me.
  persid: S02
- desc: Do you. Well, oh one online too.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I have like some notes from previous classes and it has some of the usability
    thing, so the Gulf of execution and evolution diagram is with me in a DVD format.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. Good well. So I was kind of playing because I have a whiteboard in my
    office here. Maybe do some drawing. Maybe maybe I will I. will say that for Friday.
    Okay, anyway, so these heuristics of visibility asst status design should always
    keep us informed what's going on here appropriate feedback than reasonable amount
    of time. So I was. At a home improvement store on the weekend and wanting to get
    somebody to help and it's that. there's a button that says press here for help
    and I press and nothing happened. The CREST again nothing happened I press the
    button down for a while. and still nothing happened, so I decided that it was
    broken. So I went to look for somebody. So that's things in example system status.
    so that we know what's going on. I press them for helping you get light comes
    on. If the light bulbs not. so on. So another heuristic is match between the system
    and the real world design should speak to use language. Is words phrases and concepts
    related to user rather than internal jargon. So the only way that the user has.
    Access to the interface or to understand. The system is through the interface.
    And they do that in an ad hoc way. As opposed to the system designer or the people
    who are writing the code, they have a more complete and I hopefully an elegant.
    conceptual model of how things are put together. With the users don't have that
    need to build a model. Either interactions and so. Language is important. User
    control and freedoms number three users, often perform actions by mistake it clearly
    marked emergency exit three in one of the action without having to go through
    an extended process. So undo and redo our. Video he provide that. Consistency
    in stallions number four and users should not have to wonder whether different
    words situations of actions in the same thing well platform and industry conventions.
    error prevention. So good error messages, important that the best designs carefully
    prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Right, so we can we can think
    of errors in terms of slips and mistakes. slips are unconscious errors caused
    by an attention mistakes are conscious errors, based on a mismatch between the
    mental model and the design. So, based on my interaction with the piece of software,
    with my history with your courses or moodle. I have a certain model of how things
    are working. So. And I use my mall to predict. actions. predict what to do in
    situations i'm unfamiliar with. So when I. was in that process when I click on
    something and it gives me an error. I mean that that's a mistake. And it's. can
    be addressed by reconsidering the design of that interface park. So using recognition,
    rather than recall. So, instead of having an obscure word command to delete files
    that say. expunge. it's your source out and find some obscure words to describe
    delete. And anyway, he picked. Before. You pick a command name. But then when
    you force people to recall that command need they're going to do less well with
    it, then. If you allow them to. recognize it so if we say type in expunge. nevermind
    have spell. But if you have a button that says expunge. Then, then people. Say
    Okay, I know, expand the math for deleting fine. flexibility and efficiency of
    these. So shortcuts may be hidden from novice users may speed up the interaction
    with expert user. So that. There are a couple. shortcuts and menu commands. are
    available for the experienced users and the novice users so. You can make a choice
    and. So. Looking visible. aesthetic and minimalist design their faces should not
    contain information which is irrelevant or leave it if we extra unit information
    in the interface could be relevant units of information and diminishes the relative
    visible. So he give options for everything. And it's not clear what. Which of
    the options are most important for. What you want to do at the moment. Now for
    users recognize diagnosis recover from there. There should be expressed in plain
    language, no error codes precisely indicate the problem with constructively suggested
    solution. So how about that attendance module air that I got. That help. me diagnose
    and recover from the air. YouTube. I would say not. Often documentation it's best
    that the system doesn't need any additional explanation, whoever it may be necessary
    to buy documentation to help users understand how it could be their tenants. So
    if you need documentation. If you need an extra support and it's there. If. If
    there's a. way to do the search. And it's focused on the tasks that people want
    to complete. So I had. Experience with support documentation weekend, so I made
    this lamp I was trying to install. And this instructions were not clear. So I
    had to ask, I called the store and asked for some clarification because well first
    I call the one 800 number that said. call this number first. So I call them and
    they said Oh, we don't really help with that. So without. Without any further
    discussion they transferred me to. A different phone voicemail true. And then,
    they said choose from the following list of options. So I didn't know which option
    to pick wasn't clear. Which option to pick their so I hung up. And they called
    the store.
  persid: DHH
- desc: unintentional unmute.
  persid: S02
- desc: This these instructions, because there are a lot of. We want to provide the
    same part for lots of different outlets so. They said things in a way that we're
    not. there. that's that's very Jim. i'll show you a picture of the instructions.
    Well, post one next. picture online those instructions see him. So yes, I do have.
    We didn't talk about assignment when we talked about projects. and individual
    assignments little bit, so the experiment with your courses course that year now,
    teachers and. we're going to use that for the first assignment. So. Now i'll have.
    The description of the assignment out today. Sorry. Still, a few hiccups getting
    things out of that site. So the first assignment gonna ask you to. create a section
    for yourself. report that I had my second screen working today. And it turns out
    that I just needed to wait wait out the blinking. Black screen and then blinking.
    So I just put the video trying experimenting with putting the video window. on
    to my second screen now selected gallery. The gallery on had six people. What
    works. it's good. Now. Okay, anyway, so the idea is. me get this. So here we can
    edit the course settings so i'm not gonna ask you. To do to. be very careful that
    edit changing the course settings. Here is course format. of exploring that. So
    there are different ways to do this let's say topics. So the one i'm using in
    classes clubs topics. well. It should work as well let's do that will save a bit
    of screen space. Watch topics. number of sections. let's see if. I can prove myself.
    yeah how about we use that convention that same Convention have.
  persid: DHH
- desc: zoom.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. You can claim, one of the sections. And then. we'll talk about. Because
    of what within the sections. On Friday okay. So i'm a boy. He wrote a time again,
    I apologize for not keeping a better eye on the clock. So i've got a video that
    I want to share with you for you to watch. So i'm going to put that into the.
    summary. it's David kelly's how to build your creative confidence. And I put a
    link to the Norman doors video in side the audio transcript from last meeting.
    at all. So it's there if you look this audio transcript also make it a little
    prettier as well. anyway. Okay, thanks again for today. And we'll see you on Friday,
    have a good rest of your week. And will also set office hours by me. Only on Friday
    so think about when you'd like me to schedule some availability for office hours.
    All right, thanks again take care. Stay safe.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Not crap man.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't think we are able to claim a section, as of now, we don't have the
    permission or something like that doesn't give us the edit option.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay, so. experiment experiment plan and these can you see my.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S02
- desc: You can see it so turn editing on make sure turn editing on their food.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, I got it. Thank you.
  persid: S02
- desc: you're welcome. So I noticed that the border around my browser window is back
    now that I need some of the zoom stuff onto the second display. Go figure. feature.
    So i'll stick around for a minute, if there are questions. So now, I have video.
    Video window over here on my second display. So I find it hard. Of the corner
    of my eye see my picture. So when i'm looking at the camera on my laptop. I got
    not paying attention to this. figure, on the other end slate But then when they
    look at the picture than. giving you my profile.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh, so what we're going to do in this section.
  persid: S03
- desc: i'm going to ask you to create a couple things. Your section, so the idea
    is to. Create your. create a section. And then I want you to then that section
    do some activities. You know. it's been posted. So that we can you have a chance
    to look at them before the Friday meeting, we can discuss them in.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Some detail okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So it's a it will be marked as our assignment right.
  persid: S03
- desc: That won't be the first assignment yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: and Do we do we have any tier four discussed Professor. here.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. Can we ask for help to him or her, maybe to the cheer if we need any help
    our should we come to your office hours.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well, you can talk to me for help. Okay i'm and approachable. I like it so
    anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, no problem, thank you.
  persid: S03
- desc: Look approachable maybe not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: sure if.
  persid: ???
- desc: you're if you're very much.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah but. Maybe sometime you can be busy there so.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah well, I hope to get that sorted out by Friday as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay. and Professor like for the exam for the meat chairman, the final. uh
    I mean. What should we expect the topics from the book directly or. I mean, how
    should we prepare for the exams in future.
  persid: S03
- desc: So we're not gonna have a midterm exam.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay final.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah so it'll be a final so. I am. i'm interested in engaging you your. help
    in designing the final exam so that the questions. They ask or. A fairly evaluation.
    Here our progress this semester.
  persid: DHH
- desc: here. So.
  persid: S03
- desc: The details of what's on the exam will will. do that and. Encourage that done
    collaborative. And I. Think about. there being a few. theoretic theory related
    questions and then another question will be a. promise. deal with. Applying what
    we've done the Semester.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We have 25% for the exam so it may be the final exam right.
  persid: S03
- desc: 20% and final. papers is Tony stilling need to pass it. i'm not saying it's
    gonna be. difficult to pass that won't be difficult to pass if you've been engaged
    and semester. excellence.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: And also, Professor like this is an online Semester and that's why I was worried
    about the project because project is a group project, so we should communicate
    with the TEAM members and do a group work. For the project so i'm like worried
    about how we're gonna manage to cooperate. As it is online.
  persid: S03
- desc: lots of good tools that are available. Well, yes, good tools. Maybe they're
    not all great and they're not all good at the same things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: If you grew.
  persid: ???
- desc: up are we allowed to group make our own group.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: Maximum for person right.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well we'll shoot for four. or people in a group. With a professor will work
    out exactly. 49 does not it's not the physical form.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah there's true.
  persid: S03
- desc: So we'll. we'll figure it out. See. Then.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So professor, are you busy i'm taking your time more.
  persid: S03
- desc: No i'm. i'm happy to talk. Thank you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor when.
  persid: S03
- desc: It was him and Iraq, and I should. I should nation Ivy have things to contribute
    as well, you can put them in the chat or.
  persid: DHH
- desc: For the purpose of. And when should we expect to a start or project in the
    Semester, I mean, in which time of this semester.
  persid: S03
- desc: well. So. I have, I have the idea. Maybe first you get together, so what kinds
    of groups. kind. kind of arrangement for groups are going to have. Then. start
    thinking about ideas of all. kinds of. website source applications as a group
    you're interested in exploring so maybe it's something which you're familiar with
    you use from time to time. But isn't. There some things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That are.
  persid: ???
- desc: difficult to user confusing. So here here's an example of. Something that
    was confusing for me today they started out. Saying do this by hand, I have to
    add everybody is teachers.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh, so there was no tool to automatically add all of them.
  persid: S03
- desc: No, I couldn't. there's nothing to upload a spreadsheet.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So this is a, this is a I mean not user friendly. process right.
  persid: S03
- desc: it's not too bad, so I had the live class list. of our 420 8% 24 courses on
    my second display. And then so copy the user ID from. Like before the Ad sign.ca
    a copy that and I dragged on my laptop, and so this is the interface. whoa.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, this is Daniel yeah. yeah so you have to add all of them one by one.
  persid: S03
- desc: So yeah I said don't smoke everybody teacher and then. This is a little troubling
    at first. I didn't see that he get input focus on this box. So as i'm typing.
    well. There are two more things that I. hear, then I realized. yeah anyway. If
    I come up maybe I don't come up because. yeah because I. did notice. That so.
    It wasn't clear that I could do input there, so I would do a search. To new users
    to show. This lesson that comes up with us. by cutting and pasting. john's writings
    I could find them. see this one, so I can make the once once you're gonna make
    less. And then they added them all together.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: One day one.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So that was like. I mean. i'm kind of. What should I say it was kind of. boring
    like that, because you have to find everyone It cannot just put all of them at
    a time.
  persid: S03
- desc: It. says. Here are some cases, you are courses. Where it seems to. be available
    to do the things that I want. Like in forming groups. It says upload a spreadsheet
    of one. Anyway, so here, let me show you how to. Go back to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh, what does the sections mean in the experiment Professor like is it a different
    section for every topic, or like is it for I mean, is it like the section 1234
    like we have a section one for a C section two for htc like that.
  persid: S03
- desc: So in the experiment in that class it's called experiment with your courses.
    I just want you to clean section to the topic.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I have already claimed one section.
  persid: S03
