- desc: Good afternoon, Professor.
  persid: S00
- desc: doing well it's Friday so that's a good sign right. log into my bank. Banking
    APP. every Friday, it says happy Friday and it just. doesn't say that for the
    other days just. Friday should be especially happy for some reason. I tend to
    agree, I guess. So I thought I would do my second screen and we'll twice as long
    as it usually does. He needs me to sit in front of it and. Since like need to
    hit the occasion return he in the process of negotiating. share my screen with
    you. i'm just gonna mute everyone. You can unmute yourself to. This to catch any
    microphones that are empty.
  persid: DHH
- desc: or.
  persid: ???
- desc: are open or Nice. Okay, so you can see the web page here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: So do attendance. We have. response to meeting and then individually assignment
    one is do today that one minute to midnight. alright. I know that some people
    have been submitting on me questions or. Concerns about sign one. raise your hand
    if you're having. You have a question about it. What highlight on that webpage
    is changing i'm trying to grab the gallery and pull it out, so I can see more
    names. don't think you can see the gallery just just. Wait I think you can now
    because i'm showing the desktop. yeah okay. Alright, so let's go back to. Okay,
    so first let's do it. Okay, so that's that up. So how is. You. were doing an empathy
    map for the vaccines vaccination certificate process yesterday. we're getting
    on to you my son getting on to one's my SAS health record. So we can. Look at
    the same here in terms of. us look at the. instructors interface you're using
    it then. You cannot see what i'm seeing with my interface but. yeah. Do with a
    student one as well. So one thing I noticed, especially when the system is. slow.
    That. clicking and the shift. and moving between. screens is. slows down the pace
    of interaction. So is there, another way, we might do that. Could. This be an
    issue.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I guess.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm not sure. We got to password windows up. anyway. So if we're looking at
    this screen. With the interface, should we try and do an empathy map for that.
    Maybe what i'll do is i'll keep the screen up. On the board right away. I won't
    put the camera on. As i'm sketching. So I have a picture of the last the last
    days map, we did in class. Well, make sure that all get posted. I didn't hit the
    publish button with the push button. which will lead. To a laptop right now but.
    Okay. So let's uh first thing. let's let something you notice about this interface.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: S00
- desc: let's see if I can get a password. someone's gonna comment. Maggie. See. The
    border border of your rectangles lit up.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You have something to say.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so i'm able to click on. The icon for monday's session. Does that do
    us any good. On. I can thank. might feel pressured because I could save there's
    lots of flipping. Anything else come to mind. Then there's the fact that I like
    click I open the separate window I don't have a choice to get. You can just copy
    the pastor to my clipboard. which might be a helpful thing you're. losing track
    of. It is. The point too much. Yes, got it gotten the past password taken care
    of and I made it I started an empathy map I filled in an empathy map to this,
    as I was writing on the board, while you were. So on the agreeing with me. Okay.
    Wait so. I mentioned about project groups and i've seen some. discussion in the.
    Project assignments forum so that's good now i've seen one email sent to me about
    project groups. So this link. should open an email in your in your favorite email
    client. With the subject. Then opens one. In the different screen, of course.
    it's going to send me an email that's why address here. The same subject for 28
    and 828 project group members. You can send send it to you as. You as zoom meetings
    so you can have the name you like, to be called. And then your. Your giant.ca
    email ID for your group members so just. One email per group is fine. So I am
    i'm on this discussion list, it seems to be putting my email. With messages. So
    I. feel like i've been missing some emails. So I. go through with a fine tooth
    comb over the weekend, make sure i've got everything. But if you send me an email.
    We. do it in a way that has worked for me and or a. subject. Like. I have that
    link on my you our courses page. So this is working, the eight plus 818 email
    contact. or. So I just made the link here with it, so it makes it easier to create
    a. subject that i'll recognize. If you put for 28 and we're 828 in the subject
    and should be able to find it, as was strangled search for. Messages like that
    today. tonight. So I apologize if. If you send me an email and I haven't replied.
    And if it's something urgent, please send it to me again. Okay. and probably will
    will discuss on Monday we'll do some project. Time on Monday and we'll discuss
    timing for the rest of the project as well. Okay. So what. does seem all right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay, so i've gotten two yeses one and chatting one. Over the lights so that's
    good. And a thumbs up. thumbs up in oh geez okay. well. So. Now Abbas. student.
    In it, for me, for me, ago. Steady they're doing so this isn't research credit.
    If you're doing studies, with your studies in the future we'd like participants.
    You should Hello Lisa export farm. In the case you. can use the computer science
    purpose football. So they're using a different approval method. And last, we want
    to mention something here. And if you want to send me an email.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And can I explain my study, right now, or students.
  persid: S04
- desc: Take a couple minutes to explain it and then since then send me. The details
    and i'll. Post a few announcements. as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah for sure.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay, so just take a couple minutes gado gado.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Russia.
  persid: ???
- desc: Whenever you're ready.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Let me. Thank Thank you so much. About for allowing me to type two o'clock
    class about. My situation in my research project Hello everyone, my name is that
    was that list you know, working on the supervision of like there, however. We
    are conducting a study to evaluate the Academy digital library, while conducting
    exploratory browsing activities and seeking participants among undergraduate students
    in CS department to participate. You must have completed at least once a year,
    computer science course. and have a reliable. Internet connection on practicing
    camera on your computer. If you if it was up there, instead, he will be conducted.
    remotely via zoom you will be given for search. scenarios each of. them has an
    element that makes the search that complex, you will be guided, through the steps
    of performing exploratory browsing using a specific search interface, we will
    also ask you. To complete pretty steady question yeah and the pre and post test
    questionnaire for each of. course our stats. So you may participate in our study
    in any location, that you feel comfortable working at your computer for for one
    hour, we suggest quite location, so that you. can focus your attention on search
    that and the interesting part is that you might end up this is study you will
    receive that $30 gift card. as compensation for participation in our study, so
    I will put my email address in to the class chat if you are willing to participate
    into my study, please just send me an email, I will schedule time with you and
    we like. Set the meeting for this study it won't take more than one hour. Thank
    you so much.
  persid: S04
- desc: Okay, thanks to boss.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you so much for giving this opportunity.
  persid: S04
- desc: you're welcome.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I just put my email address out.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah okay. So if you're interested in that the snake, none of the email address,
    and you have questions you can send an email to a boss, and he will answer your
    questions. Okay, so last day. My SAS health record of that. And from there, I
    suggested. Looking at mental model. there's a link and then. Looking at chapters
    five through seven. So I want to talk about mental models, a little bit today.
    it's work yesterday. Access the link and have proper get a performance check that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah same same goes for me.
  persid: S00
- desc: Yes, Professor also had the same problem, although able to fetch for the link,
    since I got another link to the same documents.
  persid: S05
- desc: Go, this is the one that I had.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This counseling Professor I can share.
  persid: S00
- desc: i'm sharing my screen and I still. This is another picture of our. This is
    my sketch last day. Make sure that we looked at it first. Yes. copy from lengthen
    not the right information. Well, maybe I. didn't get the whole. beginning. So
    sometimes. website would be. Pending on what kind of servers running would. change
    at the lowercase so. You don't. have to watch the caps lock you. In type in a
    URL. That that didn't happen here so make sure that we have war case s at the
    end when we find the article. So we think of. Think of the picture, with the two
    bolts of. execution and evaluations and systems. One side and users, on the other
    side. The way the user can. understand. Why the application works is by. getting
    information about the current state of the system so that's. One part. And then.
    deciding which commands to execute that's the execution part. and If somebody
    is coming. coming on to our new piece of software isn't familiar. So they don't
    have experience with the interface. But they may have experienced other pieces
    of software which is likely likely people are. Not. have experienced with. The
    software interfaces that are. Not well your website or not, the website we're
    dealing with here. So we have some expectations about. what's going to happen.
    And so the inner through the process of. Looking at the system state and trying
    commands to. run honors and what commands need to execute to. me tranquil. That
    interaction that process of. vibration and execution. Of back and forth. Do that
    right understand the develop. A model of how the interface works. So we can allow
    the user to have a certain level of benefits. We can encourage it. And when we.
    do things like the empathy map and see where. Frustration arises. When we can
    see where. Where the model. Users developing may have. made me feel that with
    the system model. So this is really. You think of the user having a model system
    based on which is. ad hoc and develop new little interaction with the interface.
    And then the designers can have a model. That system where where they see all
    the pieces fit together. Look, the designers have the knowledge that model when
    things are. Or how the system provides services to the users. So, then, I suppose,
    we also have. The third model. The way the things are really in the system. So
    it might be that. The designers model isn't quite. Quite a natural consistent
    so that then they get plans for errors as well. The mental model for the user.
    Is. Like. User experience, so we can encourage. users to have a model and system.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That.
  persid: ???
- desc: We. put together we. As designers together. Then we use that provide the consistency
    in the interface. So we'd like to encourage users to adopt that model. We can't
    you can't force it. Like we can't force them to have positive experience. With
    your face. That makes sense. Okay. So. They haven't heard of the fallacy of misplaced
    completeness. To that that's a logical fallacy what happens when. We take long.
    We. We are thing. So when the user has a mental model. We make some incorrect.
    decision because, why do we have this within. The system. So. we're saying that
    there is a capsule times that we fall into. computer scientists talk about. We
    forget that model that we have. Another system like the one. Is. The system itself.
    So we need. We think that. We take model to be the system we. Forget to distinguish
    between them. so that I can be that simple simple problems. That makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Could you repeat the last sentence sorry it's it's a microphone issue. wow.
  persid: S03
- desc: whack wrong mice my mom was needed. well. So we can get in trouble, and we.
    We forget that model that we have all system listen. Is. it's different from the
    system that. We represent so models representation of the system. So. So the model
    that we. develop your interactions. may not match up. The wrong in all situations,
    so might leave out some important details. So we'd like to encourage. users to
    develop. And then to model, the system. That. uses the chances. reduces the risk
    of these mismatches. I will go through and Edit my comments on the transcript
    so. Sooner couple. Mental model mismatch. So we can make the system to conform
    to the user's mental model. model to reflect your system. So these are. All the
    ways that. You see, the interaction between the system and the user. I see i'm.
    Over time now. So. To speak more loudly. You can give you some feedback on. Why
    the Guardian that can lead to fire away from my. my microphone now. Anyway, regardless
    of that. Have a good weekend and. The Lincoln. Video free to watch. it's about.
    happiness happiness and design. And paraphrasing anyway take care. See you on
    Monday.
