- desc: Good afternoon.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor.
  persid: S01
- desc: Professor.
  persid: ???
- desc: weekend.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: S01
- desc: it's good.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so let's. start by me sharing my screen. Okay. So we get right into
    our administration so welcome back from a long weekend and did anyone see northern
    lights this weekend.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I saw it was great. yeah it was I saw it first time.
  persid: S01
- desc: my daughter, and I went out a bit later in the evening on Sunday. or Monday,
    I guess, yes, was Monday night everyone out. And I think it had. Calm down a bit
    by then. So it didn't see some of the spectacular things that. People were posting
    online. In. From further up even from saskatoon there's lots of. exciting things.
    I guess there's still some chances that. there'll be. Some more activity. So what
    I noticed. They have a lot of. Their different Apps and things to. To give information
    about when you might see the. aurora borealis and. It seems like that those things
    aren't. easily digestible who come through sample do you. The APP sorry and the
    APP that I saw was using utc instead of local time. So it's. A bit of a challenge
    to figure out what. figure out where to go and when to go to look for them.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But.
  persid: ???
- desc: Some very, very nice pictures i've seen with them. Certainly okay anyway.
    attendance. is going to remember to do.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It.
  persid: ???
- desc: there's a password for attendance. Look at the status of my question. about
    the URL parameters. So no replies for me. More or see my post about. The group
    assignment submissions. On Friday. Gemini problems with. With your group assignment
    submission. So this is what I wrote. describe it so. It turns out, so I said I
    said it to be. group assignment. let's duplicate this. ahead. login as a student,
    then we can look at the assignment. So I didn't include myself in the group, so
    I got this message, no one should have gotten this message. Before. Let me. Give
    myself a group. Okay Now let me so there, I have my group dh ah. So i'm going
    to add. myself to that. get into the right grouping as well. Yes, I did attendance.
    Okay, so now i've added myself to a group. With. It that's in the proper grouping,
    so let me switch back to. student. Okay, so this is the. comments I get. The interface
    so have a group. And the scooby attempt number one. That has been submitted, yet.
    Okay, so now i've found a PDF file. To. attached to my submission, so now it says
    draft submission draft not submitted. My graded. So, then, I can edit the submission
    remove my submission or submit assignment. Once this assignment is to maybe not
    be to make any more changes. So is that messaging clear. So I had some discussion
    during my office hours about. The expert. there being an expectation that until
    the due date. and time is reached multiple submissions could be made. that's not
    the case. And I see also there's no. question marks. For to access help such as
    is. So it doesn't the screen doesn't tell you. That you need to hit the submit
    button. So in my set settings for the assignment I said. That you students need
    to hit the submit button. But it's it's not conveyed completely clearly in this
    way is it. Is my microphone on.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S03
- desc: I.
  persid: ???
- desc: thought it was. So let me see what happens when I click submit. Okay, so I
    know after click that. Then continue. Okay, so i'm going to ignore the turn it
    in message there because I just submitted the picture is a PDF. So what I notice
    here is that it's not. I can make comments about the submission. Afterwards, but
    I can also delete them. So does anyone have. Any observations about that process.
    Were there any problems when you submitted your group assignment. Is the. Are
    the prompts sufficient to let you know that you need to press submit, and that
    when you submit. It won't be you won't have access to. Your. submission for editing
    anymore. Now many people. know that you could I can revert your submission to
    draft if you need to. make changes again. let's move go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh, so I knew it after you mailed us about the. information that you can revert
    it after we stopped it I didn't know. before that.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah and I don't think it's provided here either, is it. My submission statuses
    here. It says its attempt number one doesn't say how I can make attempt number
    two. And I think the attempt number is confusing because. If I don't require you
    to soon as I hit submit. and acknowledge that this is your own work, except for.
    or other work of others, you cited. I don't go down that path, and you can have
    as many accounts as you want. So I think the messages aren't quite clear. And
    also, here it doesn't say. you've successfully submitted for you. you've now submitted
    for your group and no nobody else in your group can submit or. anything like that.
    It doesn't the status doesn't reflect or the interface doesn't reflect the information
    that I put into it. In terms of. Who is going to do. Whether one person in the
    group submits for the whole group. and so on. guess, this is Wednesday after the
    long weekend. Okay, so i'm not gonna. go further with that. Okay, so I thought
    we'd have a breakout discussion about. Improving the. Either the assignments specification,
    which you can access on the experiment you, with your courses page. Yes, so I
    just have to talk to marker about. Some things about the first assignment. Then
    should get the MAC marks back soon. Anyway, okay so. Based on our discussion last
    day, so now we have 36 participants. So if I make. Make five groups. So then.
    From our discussion last day group six would go with group one. into breakout
    Room one and group seven would go into breakout room to. That makes sense. So
    I have a list of. The breakout rooms here. me share that on the screen as well.
    Okay, so the question is. Okay, so i'm going to create the rooms. Open them all
    up. So that's what we discussed the other day. On Friday last week. So if you
    if you can't see your name on the list of breakout groups. You can go into your
    courses and click on that link. The list of breakout groups. wow going to 11 people
    in the room, on. Okay, Martin. Any thoughts about. Anything anything interesting
    company or group discussions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We had a good discussion and we found three. Three points that we know down.
    Man foster foster was like there was too many options at the submission portal
    that confuses us. Secondly, there should not be any Item number after submission
    because we, we are allowed to submit only one time.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And the third there should should be some notes to clarify that we cannot
    revert to submission by yourself, or we cannot submit it again.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: there's their soul and there was another thing like we didn't get any notification
    after we submitted, I mean we sometimes most of the time we get a pop up message
    that your assignment is submitted, but when we submitted this project we didn't
    get one.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay, we look at the settings.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Actually we get a male we get a male then our assignment is submitted.
  persid: S01
- desc: He did get one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: This particular assignment I didn't stop me if I didn't get an email when
    my other TEAM members submitted for me.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah I got an email for the for the post that group rate rate your group one,
    but I don't believe It all went to the actual assignment.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay. So Lakshmi you got an email. Did you did you also submit the assignment.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Was purpose I got in.
  persid: S06
- desc: Nobody really the one who submitted your groups assignment.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh yes.
  persid: S06
- desc: yep.
  persid: ???
- desc: So did I remembers David lakshmi's group get emails or other notification.
  persid: DHH
- desc: know the other users.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just the person will send. But I would say they have to provide an option
    to include another Members this like this. features missing from your goals in
    general.
  persid: S07
- desc: Now.
  persid: ???
- desc: Was the three assignments as individuals assignments, and they are missing
    a huge part.
  persid: S07
- desc: With.
  persid: ???
- desc: Groups assignment or. Even assignments.
  persid: S07
- desc: Okay, let me look. Let me redo the settings based on that feedback. i'm still
    a student here. tonight. So i'm well i'm still a student, let me see i'll go notification
    menu. No notifications.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK.
  persid: ???
- desc: OK. see what settings there are here. saleability availability. submission
    types. A back types. submission settings require students to click on submit button.
    Okay. So students will have to click a submit button to declare the submissions
    final that messages and communicated on this submission screen isn't. To me it
    doesn't seem like it's there. Okay. So, this one is. A little bit ambiguous. it's
    not terrible okay. Maximum attempts and limited. group submission settings okay
    students to it in group yes acquire group to make submission yes. No notifications
    and see. Okay, so I didn't have the activity, the notification for students set
    the yes. So i've changed that now. It shouldn't make a difference for this one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: was sold, I think that is for after grading system might wind up SMS I created
    then we'll get a reputation.
  persid: S03
- desc: That might be it's not clear.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because I used to it sometimes.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so we're out of time today and I want to leave you with a couple things
    to think about. So you talked about metaphors for Twitter and. Oh, I. got my.
    Self into some trouble because I. The metaphor, or the mental model that I had
    for using Twitter was not correct. And identified me as somebody who's misusing
    the system. So i'm wondering about. What metaphors are helpful to bring in new
    users to say Facebook or snapchat or. instagram or what are some other platforms
    that are. are used by you, I guess. Oh it's the Facebook messaging thing. what's
    that yeah that's it. So, think about these questions, what metaphors you have
    to bring new years into into some unfamiliar platforms. know how to know if we
    have succeeded, then think about the metaphors i'm using for organizing meetings
    here. And this goes to. To the meetings page for this offering anyway so i'm out
    of time, thanks for your engagement today. Have a good Wednesday so i've got an
    office are starting at two to three. And we'll see you on Friday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S03
- desc: Thank you bye bye.
  persid: S04
- desc: Thanks good day. Oh, and there's a video here to watch to. That that's interesting.
    Anyway, thanks again take care, see you Friday. bye. Have a good day.
