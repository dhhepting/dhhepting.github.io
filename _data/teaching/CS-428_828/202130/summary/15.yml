Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon, everyone. nice day today seems. Start so cool that gets warmer.
    it's a nice way to start October. So what kind of issues. well. interesting. So
    my son who's in Europe. likes to use whatsapp to communicate. And I have an iPhone
    eight presently although i'm. going to upgrade to a newer version too. But I.
    I have trouble. Getting the notifications to work, so I don't. I don't see when
    i've gotten a message from him, even though I go through. and turn on every possible
    notification. The only thing that seemed to help was when I upgrade to ios 15.
    Then, then I started to get notifications more regularly it's still a little bit
    hit and miss. Any one of those kinds of issues with whatsapp and. The social media
    platforms.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think various for every other devices and every other version of, though,
    is. Like forever seven and shall we didn't have any problem, the notification
    and stuff but sometime the Facebook and the oculus it does give some of the problem.
    And also because of the new current ios and its privacy prediction things it is
    like somewhat contradicting maybe that also has to do a little bit of that things,
    maybe I don't know I don't use iPhone seven.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah well. It makes me feel good in some ways to say prefer to not. Allow
    the APP to track that's one of the. And i'm not sure. How much money, therefore,
    there we're going by creating such a feature but. Good PR anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah it's a long list of debate that's been going on for the past one or two
    year Facebook and apples.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, so. we're going to talk, so I think i'm sharing my screen now. Right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: But a little bottle that is like cut out from the screen from the left side
    haggis.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Oh Nice.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay. So when I have all the windows up like video gallery or whatever participants
    list. And the chat window I can't put my shared screen over top of those so that's
    why I had to do a little bit of moving around and get the right size to coexist
    with the. The list of participants. So I made a list of things to look at. The
    question about some suggestions and. websites to look out for the project and
    I didn't include zoom certainly zoom will be in. Another one to look at think.
    I don't have particular things in mind, but. Okay, so anyway. I haven't published
    this to my website yet. I was fiddling with a little bit. So. i'm gonna send out
    shortly to the website. So here's my so let's look at attendance first. So I put
    in a password and the direct link to the password. You can let me know. If you're
    able to click on that as well. Once I get it onto the website here let's get that
    started. Like send you the correct password for today's attendance. The benefit
    of doing this is, I don't have to. click through to another window. But the nice
    thing about this could be one less attendance link. Instead of it just goes to
    the right week. it'd be better if it just gave me the right day. It gives me the
    right week and it gives you something to click on as well. So just. just want
    you to keep that interface. issue in mind certainly there are things in your courses
    like like this feature showing attendance password to you. and they're doing the
    group assignments that interface Those are some ones that come to mind. So. Leave
    those two questions you have any well. So I put again the list of link to the
    list of project groups, so the project groups coming together Okay, are you coordinating.
    So the first issues are you communicating with your group members okay. and would
    like to give me a thumbs up or. thumbs up. For for at one point. You may have
    more like okay so here's another issue. Let me do a screen grab of this. Our.
    Okay, Sarah go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I have a quick question regarding the project so we're working on that
    yesterday and we had a question regarding the section that says that he have to
    describe the user. And we're not sure what it meant exactly so like because there
    are like four of us in the project and we're doing like same thing, but like different
    activity on the same webpage that we choose and. There is a section that says
    that describe the user right So are we describing each of us, or are we describing
    what the intention of the user is just a little bit unclear, for me, if you could
    clarify that thing.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So the idea is.
  persid: ???
- desc: To describe the characteristics of you as a user of that interface of that
    piece of software So what are the, what are the important. characteristics. You
    have as a user. That that will. be important to understand. So, so that. You can
    do what you. You get some satisfaction of using the interface so it's not a. You
    can have a more positive experience. So that we understand who the users are.
    What their needs particular needs are. So, for that was looking at your courses.
    It might be an important distinction to say. undergraduate or graduate student.
    Whether or not you've had. Experienced using the interfaces marker. Or, as they
    call it in your courses one editing teacher. was a good. and worthy of different
    whether you're going to use it as a student or they had some experiences of marker
    or live instructor. And, and whether or not. You have experience with other learning
    management systems, maybe that's important. To think about the things. Come. That
    affect how your. describe the position from the. position from what you're approaching
    the interface. That makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah it does, and it also raises another question let's see like we choose
    a topic on Amazon the E commerce website and all of us, like all the four Members
    are like a. participating in terms of a buyer or like a potential user right,
    so we will all four of us will have, then the same description right the user
    description that we're only on the buyer side, and we have the same characteristics.
  persid: S01
- desc: So I don't want you to coordinate too much begin with one that you can eat
    write your own description of. and So what i've said before it's too. To do some
    things on your own to serve maybe decide. Which kinds of activities you're wanting
    to take on for each of you, using the interface. But then. You do that. Each group
    Member does that on their own. And the description of themselves as a user. What
    are the important characteristics. They see. determines their. Each person's usage
    of the system, and then, once you have those things, and you get together and
    do the empathy maps for each of the. everyone's task. and get that data, then
    you can together. It may end up you end up with one description one sort of profile,
    but of the user who encompasses or that encompasses the for the three or four
    of you. In your experience or maybe there might be. Two different kinds of users,
    there might be. In your courses let's say a student user and a. Student marker
    user maybe there's enough difference between. Those two different. categories
    of people that. You have a description of. You. Know you'd like backtrack from
    considering them separately. keeping them separate.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, now, it makes sense perfect.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S01
- desc: walk.
  persid: ???
- desc: So any any thoughts about how the projects going so I know there's. There
    are a couple issues. or questions about picking a website or a piece of software
    and interface. So maybe i'll just go through these, and then we can talk about
    them. smarter further questions. So how can we find it interesting target. know
    and missed an article there find an interesting target in the Internet about our
    team project that perfectly cover all related redesigned suggestions. So I don't
    I don't think we need to. see ourselves as perfect. So it's a process of discovery
    so. And we can refine things as we go along. But I would say. Find semblance of
    interest so. by looking by thinking about which kinds of the kinds of applications,
    you use on the Internet. So maybe it's a streaming application like netflix or
    prime video. or there's some other ones apple. apple TV. we're Disney plus or
    fx or. i'm sure the list goes on quite a bit longer than like go. Think about
    the things that. That. The things we. Were you spend your time. In your experience
    with those interfaces. So think critically about. know whether you're. Whether
    you say you have a good experience with the interface, because your standards
    or. has been lowered by years of computer interface use. So talk amongst yourselves
    and your group and discuss the applications and interfaces and your experiences
    with them. So. To talk about Amazon. And prime video so that connection prime
    video. But to me. The Amazon website and. Then and prime video. has a certain
    feel to. feel to them that. may appeal to some people, but I find it less appealing.
    Things like this the way they say their customers have you. So the way they're.
    talking to me. Is not. it's not the most welcoming to me I find. So. So that that
    can be an issue for. Well, an opportunity for redesign I guess. So other specific
    example, so I mentioned, you are courses and and zoom. So if you have a SAS tell.
    account. invite you look at science count, so I had. explained my recent. run
    in the SAS tilt so. I have an account for my mom. because she in her new residence
    she has she doesn't know. She can't get access communication she has to sounds
    tell. So that's a whole new box and a whole new. remote control for her to. Look
    at. So I have a. tried to do some manage features online so. When I look at her
    account it says that she has. The standard package. Instead of the basic. So I
    wanted her to have a standard package because it came out a few few weeks after
    she started with the basic package. So I did a chat with SAS tell online. and
    I asked them to. You know I said, the situation that you know clearly on the online
    system, it says that she has the standard package. And the person, the technical
    support person said well no it's not showing up here. So you have to call the
    billing department and find out why it's what the problem is. So. first thing
    I thought is why aren't why isn't SAS tell. finding out what the problem is instead
    of. offloading it on to me. But then it came up with this feature. They have a
    currently they have a callback system. So it says, if you want to call back from.
    from them from the support. group, then you just click a button and enter your
    phone number, so I I was impressed with that that that was quite a nice feature.
    Then it didn't work. and I did not get it to work till three different times.
    And then, trying to find my way around the website is. The challenge, I find.
    It may be the different signal. That i'm not the kind of user they're targeting.
    But on the other hand. This should be a little more. I guess i'm curious if other
    people have the same kinds of issues there. Anyway, that says tell, and I think
    my SAS health record is also a. possibility for examination. There might be some
    opportunities. Does that. give you some more food for thought in terms of. Where
    to look and how to look at with. Think critically about the software that you're
    familiar with already. Anyone like to give me a thumbs up. Again, now i'm. one.
    Okay, thanks. So now I realize. For the reactions, I have to scroll through. The
    list of participants to see who's reacting. So in zoom I don't know why putting
    your hand up is a. higher priority response. Then. Give me a thumbs up. And again,
    the reactions will be. useful than going to the front and going to the top of
    the list. So okay. Good Center for that. So I have a column some pictures of interfaces
    here. I thought, maybe we just do a breakout activity we haven't done that, for
    a little bit. To discuss these a bit further, but. This is a foster that I encounter.
    I think it was but somewhere in Toronto. So instead of them. enough to turn. The
    joystick to the water. So, which direction if you want to. All lots of hot water,
    would you. How would you manipulate. The joystick. They wouldn't like you. The
    answer in the chat. yeah Okay, so that towards the mirror away from you is the
    pressure. I think, so if we start out a zero pressure than pushing it. Back it's
    going to give high pressure. But then I think it if you want to hot water, you
    have, I would say, go to the left and cold water you go the right and for. tepid
    water you just go straight back. it's not clear. Whereas, if you have. A lot to
    turn. The idea of having a simple controls is convenient. Instead of having two
    knobs here individually control the hot and the cold water. So here you have one
    control that mixes them. But then the knob. It gives you otter quote by turning
    left or right. And then. Lifting up. Lifting up and back is controls the pressure
    one of what are you getting. I think that's. Maybe better constrained. So it doesn't
    let you do things that are possible, but less meaningful. Whereas I think with
    the joystick you could get into some combinations. That are ambiguous. anyway.
    I have another view that. will show you. So this is where this I think it's still
    there, but we haven't had access to the love CAFE coffee stick station, for a
    long time so. here's a nostalgic photo. that's no good. sort of fixing that right
    now just get you. will share my screen of a window preview. here. Does anyone
    remember this. feature of the coffee station. Okay, so. We have no no volunteers
    to admitting having coffee in the live calf.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I used this. an airport I think in Toronto. that's my only memory of using
    one of these.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So.
  persid: S03
- desc: On the one, so it says step one add sugar step to add creamer milk and step
    three or enjoy so step three is done off to the left somewhere. So we're dealing
    with steps one and two, this interface in these two interfaces. So, on the one
    hand. So, depending on the size of Cup, you have. So the implication is, you can
    have a small, medium large extra large Cup. And then you can decide to put in
    one sugar. Or if you hit So if you hit the button once and get one sugar. And
    if you did twice, then you can get. Two sugars put their relative to the size
    of cup so. If you. And I don't know the relationship between small and extra large
    with the other small cup and you hit. Extra large toys, you get more than a double.
    You get a very sweet small cup of coffee. So does that seem like a reasonable
    way to dispense sugar. Okay um. No, I don't want to make your answer right now,
    we will talk about will break out and talk about this. And then step two cream
    and milk, so if you want to make a double double for. A large cup of coffee. Then
    we can. So in the panel, in the middle sisters loved ones select cup size. Extra
    small. Small Medium large and extra large. So I noticed right away there's not
    an extra small coffee on the. On the sugar dispenser. And then select the amount
    of you dispense single double or triple. And then select cream and milk. And then
    press dispenser Council to start. or spread press cancel to start over again.
    So the spence button is worn out from use the text is gone, I can see is that
    late underneath of it. So. So we have a different process of going through. So
    our consistency isn't great between step one and step two. But i'm interested
    to know what you think about the inner how we could improve it, what possible
    problems could arise from this setup. Okay, so i'm going to do our seven breakout
    groups. That makes sense as a question.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Repeated.
  persid: S03
- desc: i'm going to say. What. Whether how could this interface be improved. If your
    goal is to make a double double. what's a potential pitfall from this design.
    Or are there any potential pitfalls from this design. Okay. OK, so the breakout
    rooms are open. One person's join the breakout room.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Here we go. So, should I put a link to the breakout groups in future so that
    you know that is a reference. To the people who are still there in the main room.
    Okay, so how does that go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: pretty well.
  persid: S04
- desc: Good.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I didn't I said, make a double double that so do do do double double with
    cream or milk.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Usually.
  persid: ???
- desc: Work to do one of each, I guess, if you want to. Richard and not. immediately.
    So what are the what's a pitfall from this interface, especially with this step
    two. So I, I see this, I even did it once. But some people tell me on. i'm just
    over analyzing things. Does anyone see any issue.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I personally think. that there should be a different. Different settings for
    the o'neill can cream. super senior citizen.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah so. So that that's that's possible I mean, and it could be more consistent
    with the sugar.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like What I mean is for double double double cream and sugar so cream and
    milk is optional, like, if you want to put cream or, if you want to put milk.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's it's not confusing like if somebody saying double double. So. Some men
    in the kitchen can predict it like double cream and double sugar that's an audible
    milk or troubleshoot it like he will ask you like you want to put milk or you're
    going to put cream in it.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah, so this is, this is a self serve, so this you have access to this in
    the lab cafeteria. When it when it's open again you'll be able to do this yourself.
    So there's not not an option for double sugar yeah so you have to understand that
    you need to press the button twice. for sugar, but then you don't there's a different
    set of options for dispensing cream. So why is, why is it different to dispense
    cream or milk than sugar. So maybe there's some important reason why that's not
    being communicated. it's different. And so, like the sugar, where the spence dispensing
    buttons are. Right above the. Sugar so your attention is where. The sugar is coming
    out. Here the suspense button you're selecting cream and milk and then to dispense
    button. So. The issue that i've had and i'm not going to. leave this as a parting
    thought for you. So sometimes you might have the cup under milk and you press
    cream, or you press now can you put the cup under cream. And you get. The tray
    full of of milk or cream. Does anyone ever had that happen. Anyway, we're out
    of time for today, thank you very much for today and. So keep our discussion,
    you have questions post them to you our courses. and we'll we'll pick up our discussion
    on Wednesday take care, have a good rest of your Monday and Tuesday and we'll
    talk about cool town and. Knowledge navigator a bit on Wednesday as well alright
