Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: first day of December today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, yes. Great. know every subject like. practicing physicians and having
    studying every subject so. so deeply so that we can pass and we can get good marks
    in. waiting for the final exam.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah this exam is late.
  persid: DHH
- desc: know which one SEC is on it.
  persid: S01
- desc: 21st 20 seconds.
  persid: DHH
- desc: 20 seconds.
  persid: S01
- desc: So that's quite late.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and on 23rd I think like university is getting closed for making. Christmas
    we. Like Christmas holidays, I think, in the last. Well, usually it's Christmas
    Eve.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah 24. Maybe call it. I wanted to say, at noon, but that's not necessarily
    the case it's. A bit early but not not quite at new and I think.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S01
- desc: And then it's closed. during the week between Christmas and New year's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: So so hoping that the snow is going to stick around or.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Dirty.
  persid: ???
- desc: or not stick around but. i'm not a fan of the freezing rain. that's we had
    yesterday morning. And I was walking down my driveway and sliding all the way.
    that's not fun.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You don't like winter.
  persid: S01
- desc: I like winter I don't know the winter this that. That involves rain. And freezes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S01
- desc: I would much rather have snow. used to be that it would snow and. sometime
    in November, and it would stick around until March. And then it would be spring
    and we get rain and spring. But anyway. The reality of the climate is. Changing.
    and So I saw story on news yesterday. there's a survey in Canada and two thirds
    of. respondents their. survey of 2000 or so people. and two thirds leave. or accepted.
    Climate change or thought there was strong it evidence for it. And I wonder, my
    friend mark. Maybe 100% of people in BC. except the climate change is real now
    after the. list of the third atmosphere rigor and. Just a few weeks. anyway. So.
    I think we have to. Stay positive and do what we can and not despair. Especially
    as we're getting into December. Okay. how's everyone doing today. Very good. I
    like the thumbs up the mochi. what's your screen. Okay, so we're meeting 3638.
    Today, so. The end is coaching. So let's. Get administration of the way so. I
    said this happy Wednesday, some people and happy December. it's, not to say it's
    not so slippery today yesterday. Yesterday morning, especially, it was very slippery.
    And I was. sliding down my driveway. So hopefully it stays. Not slippery not icy
    anyway let's go on to attendance. So I just want to check have asked last day
    their questions about project. So that's due on the third, which is Friday. At
    one minute to midnight. Is there any. Is that a good so good day due date to have
    or would you like to move it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If we could delay it to one day, at least, I would be nice, I have a few assignments
    due on the same day.
  persid: S03
- desc: So when if I. If I move it to Monday so. When we. project is do the same days,
    the second individual Simon. This is that a help or hindrance. I guess, we could
    move.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No.
  persid: ???
- desc: I don't know about moving all individual Simon you dig. Because, then you
    don't want to move too much anyway so. Maybe extend it one day for the individual
    assignments. Well, some people have exams. During the class period. Okay. So let
    me make that change now. So if if you'd like to submit them sooner than that's
    fine as well. settings.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: Roger. Okay, that looks right. i'll fix up the other due dates. related due
    dates all this afternoon. Okay, so that's done. So last day we had a discussion
    about empathy maps and whether that can be part of an analytical evaluation. Like
    a walkthrough. So I didn't. come across any. Direct. directly related articles.
    about that, but. In general, I would say that. I think it does get the kind of
    walk through approach. in the sense that. well. Given that we don't have actual
    us with the same. Night be. Reasonable reasonable way to get. assumptions. or.
    understanding of news that the experts or will be people. are using. lock. So
    that that might help to highlight. points were issues or flag lock you want. peers.
    big problems when we're using the website. That make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah. Okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: So, then, a couple of responses from the meeting. phrases. So how to combine
    quantitative and qualitative data for analysis. So it might not be possible to
    make a direct. Well let's see if we can do something. You can use her cross tabs
    I think is the word for it. So if you have people who have all. Your experience
    the interface, maybe. You can look. At the time, at the. So people who report.
    Qualitatively a good experience. They collect quietly for them. may show fewer
    errors, they may show. Faster speed it's another. With a positive rating smart
    positive ratings for the interface. And the people who have. A qualitative report
    experience, then they might. Show. wires slower completion before ratings. The
    interface. So. there's a lot of details in terms of Is this the colossus or. If
    you're looking to get some significant results. You say that with. me. So we have
    95% confidence. In. The numbers, we have. that's beyond the scope of what we're
    doing here. let's say that you can do. Maybe a loser some trunks or something
    like that. The phenomena data o'clock the. night. be able to look at some groups
    and see whether there's some trends, or some. possible connections for future.
    exploration in terms of. The group so you might identify the qualitative data.
    and The quantitative requirements. some extent. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: On the chat response it's a yes. So. Anyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So the other question was Why is necessary to create a high fidelity prototype.
    So I. Think. High fidelity prototypes the ones that look more like software will
    be running on your computer. is productive in general, because. There might be.
    More issues. Or, more ideas. That the the actual users of the software all have.
    been proven things once they see it. In the more finished version. So what i'm
    asking you to do for the project was to create an illustration of the tasks that.
    you've been working on working with your interface. So. it's it's not meant to
    be. For. Men, to have a lot of bread. that's demonstrating a lot of functions.
    We just want you to focus on. The task. That you've been focusing on throughout
    your project so illustrate how that could be completed. redesigned interface.
    Okay. So I was looking at this website you're looking at the other day Monday.
    Then they notice. So this video. In shock for me, the first time I looked at the
    website, then I realized it's. Only saw this part of the website. They when we
    come home. that's when I first saw. And cpus running at 90% error. And kind of
    distracting for me, anyway, no, you can hear that on my computer from my computer.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You.
  persid: ???
- desc: So Another thing I noticed the first time I opened the website was this many
    didn't display properly, but I haven't been able to recreate that sense. So we
    talked last day about. The. inconsistent displays example that we look for. We
    want to look for men's clothing.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you have to click men's clothing, rather than clothing.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: We just noticing that. Is this shop clothing men's clothing is the breadcrumbs
    so I can go back and check on what click on clothing here. So still no products
    from. So the upcoming events. That doesn't look so good. it's like a syntax error
    and on the website. And then we're social Facebook Facebook. which looks like.
    Like possibly a mistake here, though. they're not identified as. Regina and Prince
    Albert links. No, I think that the two Facebook links are. One is. The first one
    is. For sure experience PA the other one is a share experience vagina. So, in
    terms of consistency that they have the first, then the vagina one. was a match
    through China than the Prince Albert. Presentation information there. Then I know
    search for for sure experience there's one in Ottawa that comes up. So how do
    we know from landing on. into the page with it's better that we, but the one we're
    thinking of it's energizing. Arkansas but I guess we'll talk about scheduling
    location. it's gonna be. one. Well that's not working, one let's see mission.
    looks. about the same. yeah okay i'll put a couple of screenshots up against that.
    So what are some so we said, find a Christmas last yesterday we're thinking about
    finding a Christmas gift. So clothing. If you're not. say when you decide to go
    to the store. Can you find out how to get there. Let me get to the star physical
    store.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If the social media for the store. Maybe features more information. Or is
    more updated than the website itself, in some cases.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: let's see what the Facebook pixel. Yes, there's no more. Information here,
    so we spend. We spend more time with the. social media pages. Or the Facebook
    page now. On it says they're very responsive messages. yeah. well. The website.
    we're just making a little bit more, we are going to enable them to.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think a website is good for branding like it is. Like a social media presence
    more legitimate he may be, or more confidence to the consumer that this place
    exists.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah. So I noticed here they have all these. Electric bikes. But I thought
    likes your own in da. anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Any more thoughts. So another question another. idea to explore is. on my
    website. Here it is. The homepage now how do we get to today's meeting. So that's
    three clicks to get. The page for today's meeting. Is that. Too much was there.
    Does that become a bit of an issue for you how many people. are using that those
    three clicks to get to the page for the day. Or do you. have this bookmark. And
    then you can just go to the one today. This URL. Like. You can click on today.
    get to this. Great okay well. you're doing seminars next semester, then. When
    we can do that as well for the whole semester. Are there other other ideas about.
    Well, what to do. To improve. navigation. So my question was. want. To get today's
    meeting pages, we and other and other issues. Are there other issues. We can.
    like to raise. The alternative approaches or you'd like me to do the today. idea
    and see how that works. Your final thoughts we've been scribble on the right whiteboard.
    anyway. Okay, anyway, yes and. Okay, so that's some good ideas anyway we're at
    a time for today. So. we'll see you on Friday. Take care can't run stay stay stay
    well. now gone sour two to three. today. Thanks everyone have a good day bye.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have a good day.
