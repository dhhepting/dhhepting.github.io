- desc: Happy Monday.
  persid: ???
- desc: Hello good afternoon.
  persid: S01
- desc: hi. Good weekend everyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: At least.
  persid: S03
- desc: that's good to know Peter.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I was just doing the assignments so many insights.
  persid: S01
- desc: I did some yard work. yeah laughing and a few other things. But I watched
    my wife and I watch squid game. This weekend.
  persid: DHH
- desc: same as I.
  persid: S04
- desc: So i'm not sure what's. points I thought I. understood what. The message it
    had another points it wasn't quite so sure, so I guess that's why they. Have the
    season two coming up. anyway. So let me. share my screen and then we can. Going
    here. Well, Nice. So I noticed that the first comment here was. Most important
    thing I learned is how bad Dr happens website is. i'm paraphrasing there but.
    i'm not. i'm not hurt by that but. I think i'm just thinking that there might
    be a few good things about it too. But anyway, do you need more characters to
    respond to, so you can give a more nuanced reply. Sorry, I kind of took a detour
    they're. Picking us up looking like sense of humor on you, without warning. Anyway,
    so. handsome responses from the meeting last day. That our meeting today it's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The 20.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well, the things that. I see that didn't get started on regenerating the page
    and. later. They didn't hit save. The guests. Okay, so let me give you the attendance
    password. going directly from your courses. Okay, so let's resume our conversation
    from yesterday about. And then it flows, so not all of them are great. On on my
    website. We could be more clear. Will it give us more consistently so one thing
    I notice is. My go back. we'll start from here, I say today is Monday October
    18 2021. And then next class meeting is today, then I have a 20. So just so happens
    that. well. The section of meetings looks like a calendar, this could be the 18th
    19th 20th 21st one second. well. Then you start to wonder why I have meetings
    on the weekends. They would have. It would be. Better to indicate that this was
    a meeting number. Would you agree. Next class meeting is number 20 on Monday October
    18 2021. Anyone like to make a comment about that. So here's what I show my age
    and let's say things like to remind you that, seen a movie Ferris bueller's day
    off anyone. Anyone. They will never heard of Ferris bueller's day off. Okay, so
    the question from nonsmoker what why the next meeting is on the same date. So
    i'm not testing the time. during the day, so this is when. This integration is,
    and always up to date, because. it's one when the site gets published. So I could
    I could do a better. more responsive thing to do would be to have a javascript
    routine. To read the to find out what the current time is. And then, if it's after
    the meeting time. then go to the next meeting time without. Having that work independently
    of one. The. The site's been published. So the message as it is on the page works
    if you're coming to this page before class on the day of class leading. Or maybe.
    it's like that I could say it's today next class meeting is today. So just repeating
    the same date string. Anyone feel like. gauging me in this discussion. In chat
    or an audio. My answer makes sense as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah Professor that makes sense.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So are we discussing metaphors here in the. context of meeting.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah, so I think there's an opportunity to continue our discussion a little
    bit.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh. So. yeah go ahead.
  persid: S05
- desc: You. Please, the control that i'm using here to provide the numbers. And so,
    and the next. Week, this is just go back one yeah. Well there's a that's an issue.
    jump it shouldn't have jumped the different page. would have been nice to stay
    on the same page, as we had before. But this control is. Based on a thing it's
    called the pagination. My computer's not happy with me today. I haven't. I haven't
    spent enough quality time with it. it's acting up. So this is the kind of market
    that I have so. controller So here we see there's a previous page link. And 123.
    So these are all page links in the next. Page like suddenly. classes page item.
    lincoln's page link. And then we.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have.
  persid: S06
- desc: An ordered list is a class pagination. And then inside outside of that is
    the now. We have an area label. This is to do with accessible. Accessible rich
    Internet applications. and always referred to it as. Mario anyway. and use it
    was an accessibility portion. anyway. So here are the meetings. As pages so each
    number number of meeting has its own page on link here. So what can we, how can
    we make this more clear. Is this idea of meetings. With each meeting having its
    own page. Is that sufficient clear. With this part. Of you see there's an issue
    with meeting number not being associated with the meeting date. So that I shouldn't,
    but I should maybe indicate. Next class meeting is number 20 on Monday October
    eighth 2021. For example. Go ahead and that's more.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So yeah at first glance, it seems like this is kind of a calendar, because
    there is 16 1718 1920, but when I mean we dig deep into it, then we can start
    that this is the plus number, so there is a bit. Confusion I feel from my side.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay. So Peter asks can simply use the days, instead of numbers. Well, we
    could use the dates in this. As as the page like here, we could say. Maybe not
    make them too long. This part it's an issue of screen real estate here. So I said
    I could say 18 October. The meeting 20. So the meeting numbers useful. For you,
    or just. The way to keep tracking things. We prefer to just stick with the dates.
    So. But I understand your comment, we have the month somewhere on top, so we just.
    We know the numbers for October. So we'd have to start. back with. See how. Many
    I can get on the screen. I think I changed it so that. This is as many as I can
    get. So. If i'm. Just bringing the month that month there the month here, the
    first meeting was an August, so this would be a 30. Then, to become one. And then
    three would be. three. Or would be six eight. So 30 138. That. That be clear.
    I think if you're looking at the whole collection of meetings with you some of
    the some of the month, and so September 2 OG an Arc and love and deck. Okay, any
    any. further thoughts about that Peter. No okay. So the other thing. of our discussion
    last day was. He had suggested getting the meeting themes. Along with the. On
    the index page, so that we could. get a sense of what things were what things
    are being discussed. In an overview. While the meetings. So that can be a useful
    thing but. How does it fit together with. What metaphor, are we basing that on.
    Only enhancing metaphor, the interaction by putting. The missing meeting theme
    for each meeting on meetings page. So we can be more clear about. Providing a.
    Consistent metaphor for Internet interacting with them. meetings. Okay. What do
    you think about that one. Does anyone heard it fits love before. Okay, so it was.
    discovered in the 50s I believe. My son named fits. And in terms of our. Our interest
    here, it says. gives us an empirical basis or. relationship between. Or the distance
    from. Where we have the mouse down where where we want to point. And the size
    of the target. So. And it gives us the basis this. allows us to say that. The
    speed with which we can click on a target is based on the distance. And the size
    of the target. So. If the target is further away. it's. well. So targets that
    are large and close by or easiest day that. And targets that are. far away and.
    Smaller are harder to hit take longer time to hit. So here's an example of 20
    trials. You can try this for yourself as well, so click on the rectangle and then
    move to the click on the green one move to the red one so that was quite large
    so. So the idea is that, in general, there's a. going along the diagonal. So it's
    not. precisely that. My case. So that's one aspect of how we can. Understand what's
    going to be. losers performance, with an interface. So if we have. screen that's.
    We need to click on targets that are far apart and. rather small that's going
    to be a challenge for users. To think about designing things so that. You don't
    have to go so far. And the target we needed hip is relatively larger. I know there's
    a version of Microsoft windows for the MAC where it had. A long screen manipulation
    from margin sizes. It seemed to be only one pixel by one pixel those controls
    are very small and so it's very difficult to pick the right one. And so. If if
    you're familiar with the menu structure. might be quicker and more accurate to
    find them on the menu. The menu structure and then engine. New values on the farm.
    That the advantage of having them on the screen to. be directly manipulated it's.
    We can see. see where things are on the screen and. We can know what bodies there
    are to be manipulated. And in that version of word those they had a. bar for the
    similar to a typewriter. So that's something like to understand. That then. Well,
    I thought in terms of a typewriter. And maybe some of you have never really worked
    with a typewriter. So that's an issue of. Finding the right metaphor for. users
    who are going to be using the system. Anyway, so it fits law. Is an understanding
    of. grouping controls close together, making them. Reasonable size that can be.
    we're not going to make errors by. going over to one control and accidentally
    hitting another. So this might happen. On. touch screens, for example. What one
    phones where the controls are too close together and people have. You, not to
    say fat fingers but large fingers. And it's difficult to see where the. Where
    the point of contact is, and so it might be difficult to activate the control.
    So that's another dimension of. dimension, but another way to think about the
    necessity. For planning in terms of these the size of targets. Depending on the
    interface. So it makes sense. So another. Another predictive. goals operators
    methods and selection he stood keystroke level model. Because it's an idea about.
    The time it takes to. execute a sequence of commands. Of keystrokes and. In a.
    New windows. graphical user interface, where we have text boxes and buttons. So
    we might switch between the keyboard and mouse. to execute commands. here. So
    this doesn't give a lot of context, but I put this link up here because. It talks
    about. The relative timings. So we have somebody who's a very good typist they
    might have. lower. time for keystrokes. And then pressing a button is point one.
    missing a button on the most part one. writing the mouse is 1.1 seconds. And switching
    between the keyboard and the mouse is point four seconds. The time to think. What
    you're trying to do is want like two seconds. So this action is so you think about
    any point in press the button press the mouse button twice go back to the keyboard
    you think about. Which keys need to press, and then you have five key presses
    so that sequence to take 5.5 seconds. So that gives us. An idea of. How long.
    how long it takes to execute an. input a sequence of commands and in an interface.
    So what can we notice. What, what are the big items in this example of 5.5 seconds.
    So there's 1.1 seconds for the pointing. that's thinking about using. same ideas
    we talked about with its long. going from one point to another. And then switching
    from the mouse to. The keyboard will point four seconds so that's 1.5 seconds.
    5.5 so we cut it down to four seconds. If we could eliminate that. So that's,
    not to say that. We should do that but. It gives us an idea about where the. Where
    time is being spent in the interface. So for comparing two interfaces you might
    say, well, one. This interface a takes 5.5 seconds and the other one takes. say
    we could we designed differently so. You have 3.5 seconds so. There might be some
    reasons. Think about. Maybe some reason to. Think about being quicker but. What
    are some potential pitfalls if. If you're doing things at so quickly and why it
    might be more prone to errors. Whereas the first interface is not. so on. Any
    thoughts about that. So we can use the Kalam the gums Callum approach to. Can
    you do an analytical evaluation of an interface, we can. We can do this calculation
    without having. Somebody. interacting. With the interface and. So we don't need.
    A user. To do this kind of evaluation or comparison between the interfaces. So
    we have a model that we can apply. So it's. If we do need to have users, what
    kind of evaluation. Oh, and how could we describe the evaluation, where we have
    users, like in that rocket surgery it's simple video, but the zipcar website.
    Okay we'll pick it up there it's 20 after time to call it quits for today thanks,
    very much for your. presence here today. So I encourage everyone to. comment as
    as you see fit. Anyway, have a good day see you on Wednesday take care.
