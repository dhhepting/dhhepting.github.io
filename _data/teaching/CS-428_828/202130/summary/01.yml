Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Hello. Good afternoon, yes it's no longer morning. So big change for me i'm
    zooming from my office at the university. Instead of from my kids spare kids bedroom
    at home. So this this this. first meeting of the first class of the Semester,
    or you already had some today.
  persid: DHH
- desc: First, yes.
  persid: S01
- desc: it's the first one.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah I suppose it's either one or two. wouldn't be. it's not that late in
    the day that you'd have. Many more than that. Anyway, it's nice to. Be with everybody
    here. So I had a. I thought about. Updating the names, so I know that. You can
    rename yourselves. let's see. Let me share the screen on the chat let's see what
    the chat okay that's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Good afternoon, Professor.
  persid: S04
- desc: Good afternoon. So I encourage people to put the video on if you if you're
    comfortable with that. feel a little more interactive. I can. Do a gallery view
    than we can. Okay, so we're couple of minutes in and have 3234. So we have 52
    enrolled as far as I know. So how how successful was I in getting an email message
    to you earlier today. And did some of you get more than one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: leave a great.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah so the interface has changed, and I, I thought that I had restricted
    them to the different groups. But then I saw that they were being sent to all
    groups all participants and I thought. There I was looking in one place. Where
    I where I thought I should look and it looked like it was sending to a particular
    group and then later on, at the end of the message block it said. It had another
    drop down that said all participants are different groups. So. I apologize for
    that little bit of confusion, maybe we can look at that in a minute with. Your
    courses. So let's see. What if I share my screen. And then, would you be able
    to see it well. I don't know. I don't know if I get the zoom windows in or not,
    so let me just explain what i'm going to do. So from the list of participants.
    I can choose myself, and then it says rename. So i'm going to say. i'm going to
    rename it, so this is the name i'd like to be called. So you can call me Darrell
    or Dr happening. Try and stick with those two. No bad words. So now i'd like to
    be called and then in parentheses my email address without my you Regina email
    address without the. Whole part just the. Just my ID user ID. Okay, so i'm gonna
    i'm going to suggest that, as a way so that. I understand how to how you'd like
    to be called and then. And then I can associate it back to the class list. If
    you put your user ID on your you rejoin the user ID. So that makes sense. So can
    everyone take a minute to do that, please. So, and maybe maybe not just. Okay.
    So enter eat. I see you put your student number I don't want to know your I don't
    want you to share your student number with everybody. So just. Just the part that
    identifies your email address, so you don't have to put at your vagina.ca but
    just. Does that make sense the the username for your email address. and i'd also
    welcome you to. be less formal if you mean you don't include your family name
    as well just the first name or the name you'd like to be called. So if we can
    do that as a practice. Then i'll be able to keep track of everyone's. So when
    you post in the chat and so on. Now okay. So the idea is. Oh, I can rename people
    to I didn't realize that. Okay. I don't think you have the ability to rename anybody,
    other than yourself that would be. strange if you did. to report that is a bug
    or a feature, perhaps not sure which. i'm. Sorry, my phone is ringing. didn't
    show. Alright, so. Where are you. So i'm going to ask you to not send me direct
    messages in zoom. So that I don't it doesn't when you send me a direct message,
    then. It wants me to reply to a direct message and that. And I have to reset it
    to go to everyone. So that makes sense, so. Please, please just send me. Messages
    send message to everyone chats to everyone. Okay, so the idea is. When you get
    beside your name in the participants window if you click more then there's an
    option to rename. So that's where i'm asking you to rename. yourself. Okay. So
    Can somebody who's. The let me ask path, if you can write something in the chat
    i'm just curious to see whether. You appear in the chat Okay, thank you. So that's.
    If you do that. For every meeting, then I can keep track of you, and so, when
    I put the chat transcripts. Oh anonymize them so you're not getting. You won't
    be identified to display identified as. We have done it as S, and then a number.
    So you'll you'll be identified that way, but then I can keep track of of your
    participation. So it makes sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: i'm just gonna grab a screen here. grab the window and.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So there's that Now let me go to New our courses. So editing is on. So let
    me so i'm going to ask you to report your attendance. And meetings. So that there's
    a link here attempt no they haven't shared my screen sorry. I think i'm going
    to try and use my second screen here that I have in my office. or figure that
    out for next time so i'm not juggling so many windows. i'm okay i'm live. Okay,
    can you see my Google chrome window.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: S05
- desc: I notice it's not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: highlighted.
  persid: ???
- desc: I updated to the latest version I don't see the highlight. Other versions
    had the. window. That was being shared. I lighted so. Anyway, so at tenants at
    meetings. Okay, so I posted. password for the attendance. So i'll do that at the
    beginning of every meeting. And just use that to record your attendance.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: sessions here set up and there's 38 meetings, including today's. So we have
    3903 you might have 39 ideally but. 38 is pretty close. Okay, so let me go into
    the student view. and show you what's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: here.
  persid: ???
- desc: So these links won't go to the best place right now, because. it's an August.
    Tomorrow, the debt it'll be better. I realized, because I have. My scripts set
    up to divide things in terms of winter is January to April. Then spring summer
    is may to August and fall is September to December. But today is today's an outlier
    so I have to. fiddle with that so on Wednesday we'll. we'll have better content
    available at some of these links. And i'm just finishing editing the syllabus
    as well, so we'll talk about that on Wednesday. So these links would go to. Things
    on my website which aren't don't include the current one. And I haven't published
    an update to my website for a while, so. I have a running on my laptop. But it
    doesn't. It hasn't made it to the CS website yet. So that's another one that's
    the link that's not quite updated yet. So I spent the better part of last week,
    it seemed all 40 hours of. trying to get my printer my computer to printer the
    printer across the hall for me. So I. So, on the one hand, that you know the paper
    cuts system. And if it's so. Managing print resources on campus to reduce waste
    so it's it's good and it's generally interoperable. But. So I just updated to
    the latest operating system on the MAC. And I probably tried to do a few things
    that I shouldn't have tried to do said well i'll just reinstall this myself and
    then cause problems but anyway so Finally I was able to print again so. Now, on
    to the other important things that need to be done so. So this zoom this zoom
    link here. Is a real link foot so that's my office hours. So if you have some
    suggestions for when I should. be available for office hours, let me know you
    can send me an email. I don't. send me an email with the subject of CS work 28
    plus 828. So that helps you pick out things that you're sending to me. Okay, so
    that's the first part of that, and if their announcements i'll send them here.
    So I sent. I use the breakout groups list so that I could let you know which group
    you're in. So we'll talk about that now, so the zoom meeting link is the one we're
    using right now so that's going to be used for all the meetings. When I first
    started doing this. Several years ago good I only seems like several years ago.
    16 months ago I would create a new link for every meeting. And that became a little
    bit too much. But so here's the zoom link to get to the meeting and here's the
    attendance and things we've talked about. And then i've used breakout groups to.
    to inform you about the links. and which group you're in so if if you're not yet
    registered. or you're kind of sitting in today that's fine. we'll figure it out.
    This coming in, by the end of the week i'm sure we'll have it figured out. Okay.
    So I created a page. So if you got more than one message for me. So we have 52
    students registered. So I made groups of the seven groups, some of them are eight
    and some are seven. So not too big not too small. But if you're not sure which.
    Which group you're in you can refer to this page this link, on the one page for
    the course in your courses. That makes sense. Then here is the discussion forum.
    So the student I haven't included myself. So, if anyone has this message. If you
    clicked on that. Well you're not registered yet in the class so. we'll take care
    of that this week, like I mentioned. anyway. So you as a student you could click
    on this and you would be able to post your group. So i'm just that message from
    Korea. Korea Shah. So thanks. But please don't send me direct messages. So I can.
    not get stuck in sending messages to individual people. Anyway, Okay, so it makes
    sense, so we're going to try a breakout room in a second here. On a little bit
    more than a second.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: Far I think. OK. So the breakout groups are going to use throughout the Semester
    so we're going to try and keep them the same and what i'm going to do differently
    with my treatment of breakout groups is. Let you to let you to assign yourself
    to a group. So i'm going to create seven breakout rooms, based on their current
    configuration and then you can put yourselves into the breakout room so that matches
    your group number. Okay, so, then you have some continuity. you're not getting
    together with a bunch of new people so. Maybe the breakout groups will help you.
    The continuity, will help you. Just be more connected to the class. You can let
    me know how it goes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Are the breakout rooms also going to be recorded.
  persid: S05
- desc: I do not think that I can do that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So. If you have a really good. chat going on. So i'm not sure whether you
    can say just the chat from the breakout room. or not, I think it's what happens
    in the breakout room stays in the breakout rooms. And I could be wrong. I am occasionally.
    Or maybe as my wife and daughter tell me. Frequently. wrong about things. anyway.
    So it's something to. experiment with it so. If you do it. Like if you do a chat
    or take some notes. So I just encourage you to keep those keep a record of those
    discussions. In the in this forum. So it says separated by group so you're not
    going to be stuck. sharing with everybody in the class it's just through the years
    with your seven or eight. Group members. And then, at the end of the Semester.
    See the night. The Nice feature about the disorganization is that it shows due
    dates. and It only shows up when you do collapse topics. So it's kind of a secret
    hidden. Easter egg, as they say. If you use this layout. So you have these arrows
    here that you can. You can hide them. You can clap similar. So we'll talk about
    grading groups. and realize that. Well, I can generalize. mushroom that's. Something
    is ringing not sure what it is. i've turned my phone off now. Okay, so that anyway.
    So that here's. The section about meetings. And then. We have responses to meetings
    so if any of you were in know some of you were in 280 or two or five in winter
    I. started doing this. And it took me a little while to get. get going in a reasonable
    way. And I think now is even more reasonable. You can let me know if you think
    it's all if you also think it's reasonable or not. So the changes i've made so
    i'm using a feedback instrument in your courses. So it doesn't do words, it does
    character so i've set it to be not. You can write up to 512 characters which is.
    will say it's about 100 words. And i'd like you to pick one of these three things
    most important thing you learned in the meeting most difficult thing for you to
    understand in the meeting that just passed. And the thing you would like to know
    you most like to know more about. I wrote a better the thing about which you would
    like to know more. So. You can submit these up until midnight so after the class
    is finished in 17 minutes from now. you'll be able to write something. it's not
    open yet, but so you get it. there's two questions, one is to pick one of these
    three things one is a description. And then you get 512 characters to write something
    about that. And so last semester, I did winter, I did it as. You have been a the
    day before the next class. Now wasn't really enough time for me to. make good
    use of them, so and giving until midnight today. And so there are 38 meetings,
    including today. So. give you a you don't have to submit all them to get 10% the
    10% of the marks. Whether a good portion of them anyway so. And I don't want to
    be too. too hard too hard and fast about that. try and do it every day. So you
    can see that there are responses for every meeting. And I think that i've done
    this correctly, I know there's 38 meetings and I ended up with 38. And I think
    i've. gotten the the days we're not meeting correct. So, for example, Monday next
    week we're not meeting that's Labor day. So jumps from. September 3 to September
    eight. And then you know thanksgiving on Monday, the 11th so there's that goes
    from October 8 the 13th. And then we have our fall break. Whereas it's here, so
    we go from the fifth to the. So you're not moving in that week. And remember it
    stays in that week as well. So I I added this today. Because I wanted. To give
    you an opportunity to write more if you're interested. So i've created a collaborative
    wiki so you can. elaborate on your responses. So you can have more than 500 characters.
    In the wiki and then we can look at organizing it and. Keeping it as a record
    of our discussions are learning from the Semester. So maybe things if you think
    there's a resource that. would help to. be good to include in that discussion
    so you're talking about. Human centered design generally. And you find that there's
    a link that. or discussion or some somebody's blog post or whatever. That would
    be a good addition or maybe a video or anyway. Those are also things you could
    put into this wiki. Okay. So let me close this. So then there'll be individual
    assignments with 20% of your final mark, so we started with 10% here, plus 20%.
    Is 30. And then we'll be a project. will be done in groups. And lots we divided
    into different assignments. And all together they'll be 40% of the final mark,
    so now we're up to 70%. know and there will be an exam. I said exams but i'm not
    going to do a midterm exam. So we will finance our 20%. And you'd have to pass
    the final to pass close. But it's. Just as a sign that you've been doing the work
    and not relying on your group members or other people in class. So it makes sense.
    And then there's another 10% allocate for participation. So part of that is attendance.
    Your contribution to discussions and plots. and Other opportunities that come
    up to. Speak well. If you put things into the wiki that's. And suggested suggest
    exam questions you can. Find issues with my website. or with my website or your
    courses. So different things like that now how about I just didn't have a chance
    to clean up everything. Once we end today i'm going to do that. So we'll have
    much more information before Wednesday. And then there's also research credit.
    You can get one or 2% bonus marks for participating and research. it's done in
    the department. hasn't there there's not always a project but i'm the principal
    coordinator, so if there is a project you'll know about it. And so. We might ask
    you to try some software do do something. it's basically you're volunteering time.
    Maybe a half an hour or an hour. Monitoring time to contribute to some research.
    And as a way to say thank you give people give participants but credit for the
    class. wellness marker too, so you can. participate in tune studies and get two
    bonus marks. So that's, not to say thank you it's not enough to. make you feel
    like you have to do it, even though you really don't want to. me if I said i'll
    give you an 80% bonus, if you do to study for me. So you might be inclined to
    do it, even if you don't want to do it. So. i'm. I would be 80% of view but of
    course course of word. So don't do that we want to have free and informed consent.
    When we. get people to offer their opinions, because then the data that we get
    from those studies is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It.
  persid: ???
- desc: Is a higher quality it's not so biased. And then we're also being ethical
    we're not twisting people's arms being them to do things they don't want to do.
    They will talk about more that will talk more about that later as well. So does
    that make sense, how we've got things set up. Okay, so let's try breakout room.
    And if you're in if you're just waiting to get into class. You can pick a breakout
    room for yourselves. Who didn't get an email with the breakout group number so
    i'm going to put this up. again. So if you don't have a group number a group breakout
    group breakout room. Choose 456 or seven because they have only seven members
    so. Keep it spread out and then, if you if you do end up on in the class, then
    you can just keep you in that group, you can let me know which group that is and
    i'll add you to the group and. we'll take it from there. Okay. So it didn't talk
    to mature yet about. What we're going to do this class so. So the idea of designing
    interfaces for people doesn't just have to be software, but. that's The thing
    that we're focusing on here. So how do we engage. Humans so that we make the interface.
    With the people at the Center of the interface, instead of just as an afterthought.
    Instead of thinking Oh, what would be easy to code. And then, all. The people
    who are going to use it, they can just figure it out. So maybe you've seen soft
    seen interfaces like that. Where people haven't really the designer the programmers
    haven't really thought about people using the thing. we'll do is we'll talk about
    the theory. goes into interaction design and we'll go through the process of identifying.
    opportunity problems. unmet needs and then. How we can address those. Those needs.
    go from. requirements and through design and implementation so we're not going
    to implement. we're not going to change. The actual code of any software programs,
    but will do prototypes high fidelity prototypes and we can. make it look like
    we're interacting with the software fine. So we'll do. Low fidelity prototypes
    which are grown and paper with on paper with pencil. And the high fidelity prototype
    which is using some software. And we'll try we'll do a bit of evaluation along
    the way. So let me have. Bigger here. I think this should just you should be able
    to see that. Can you see that because I just switched the tab in the same browser
    so. So there's understanding the issues and exploring opportunities and then materializing.
    And it's this isn't just a. single iterate is doesn't just go smoothly, from start
    to finish. There are opportunities to go. And revisit steps along the way. This
    is, these are the eight. This is the kind of the process that we're going to look
    at so that makes sense. Okay, so. Oh boy sorry. i've talked too long sorry. let's
    go into breakout rooms and you can say hi to one. Okay, so we have 39 participants
    38 excluding me. And you should be able to assign yourself to a breakout room.
    So the other thing I wanted to mention before we wrap up today it's. Well it's
    my experience with. An undergraduate class I took looking at wallpaper patterns.
    It was a geometry class, but the idea was we're studying the 17 different ways
    to create plane filling patterns or wallpaper patterns. And some. What what I
    did that semester was. analyze every piece of. wallpaper I could find. So I want
    you to think about this semester is an opportunity to think carefully about. And
    more deeply about interfaces you encounter. Whereas, you might. not notice, something
    is. Very good, or very bad. You just accept it for what it is, but maybe there's
    an opportunity to. understand and reflect. On what's. What are some of the potential
    issues for people. That makes sense, I hope it does a little bit. So we got all
    the. got five people in Room one. 300 to five and four 305 506 and 307 so. If
    we're giving out prizes be room six. and three. But we're not. Maybe that's something
    you should consider if your future meaning so. that's a little joke. So this finally.
    I got a direct message from sahil so are you ready just. See. What he said there's
    no options to get in. Anyone. Well we'll talk about it, I guess we're 22 minutes
    or two minutes late here. So we'll address that are you are you in the class officially
    in the class. So you worry. Okay we'll figure it out for Wednesday okay Anyway,
    thank you very much for your time today, thank you. you're very welcome. So. we'll
    hit the ground running so So if you had a chance to look at Chapter one in the
    textbook. do that but we'll. Sorry for keeping you late first day take care stay
    well see you Wednesday. bye.
  persid: DHH
- desc: bye.
  persid: ???
- desc: bye.
  persid: S06
- desc: bye.
  persid: ???
- desc: Have a good Monday. thanks again. So see you on Wednesday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor me I.
  persid: S07
- desc: Yes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, I have a ton of questions I screwed up a little bit in the beginning,
    I clicked on the wrong link because there was too many link in the. website so
    I was like maybe was some office, our leaders and let them, so I joined like 15
    minutes late to this. session so I missed the first part and just right now, like
    asking questions regarding that like what a mess so i'm just wanted an overview
    of this whole subject so. The subject is basically like I already saw the old
    arm resources that were provided that it's going to be assignment project there'll
    be no made them that you mentioned and final exams right.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so for the final exam would be the proper exam or Do I need to install
    that or is and it'll be a zoom lecture like an open book closed book something
    like that.
  persid: S07
- desc: you've done in your course before. So I think that works OK.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK, so to be you.
  persid: S07
- desc: don't have to use proper track.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay perfect and. Regarding the course and how it is implemented i'm just
    having some questions regarding that so like the courses, like every single day,
    that would be attending the lecture afterwards, before I didn't even better, we
    have to mark attendance in the course like in the URL seltzer.
  persid: S07
- desc: Not before this so during during the meeting I will send that password soon
    the password it's a child.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S07
- desc: So it will say student password and then i'll be like a little short string
    characters.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S07
- desc: Take that and. use that to record your attendance at the meeting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, and and every single day, we are you will be like teaching us some content
    and something like that, and we have to discuss it in the breakout room, or is
    it just the have to give us like every single day like. What are we are, we are
    like what our plans for the Semester like in for every single actress.
  persid: S07
- desc: So I. i'm a little resistant to be saying to committing to a plan for every
    single lecture but, overall. like this. Many people are. Still with us anyway,
    a few other people, besides you. chicken. So this picture you can can you still
    see the picture here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The certificate.
  persid: ???
- desc: So we're going to. Talk about and kind of follow this. in general. go from
    understanding to exploring and materializing. Or the Semester and that's what
    the project will focus on. So along the way we're going to touch on different
    pieces of theory. That are explained in the textbook and and and and other resources.
    So every day. I have a little outline. This is kind of how the Semester is going
    to be organized that we're going to follow this. circle.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, like we will be taking one topic. From the book and it will be like discussing
    two hours this guideline and the assignments and stuff it will be based on the
    books, a content and of what we do in the lecture style.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: But. Again I don't i'm not comfortable in saying that this is over. we're
    going to you know cover page 500 to six 500 to 520 on in meeting 13. So it's.
    i'm. prepared to have the. default discussions, where they go.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So the idea of having the breakout groups. And the rooms is so. That we have
    a structure so. we're not getting together with a bunch of new people every time
    we do breakout rooms. And connection with the forum and your courses there's a
    way that we can have more. continuity.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah okay that helps.
  persid: S07
- desc: So. I would say don't worry. about things before. They come to pass. So i'm.
    Sorry, but since the last time I did the class i've updated. The marketing scheme,
    a bit.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I actually have checked all of that. yeah I did get an overview of what
    we are doing and I just like. Like a little bit I was little bit confused about
    the content, like what we are going to do for the assignment and the lectures
    and stuff so that's why I was asking you, the questions and stuff.
  persid: S07
- desc: well. So for Wednesday i'll have. To website cleaned up my website. Anyway,
    I just have some more things and. So what I want to say, I guess, this. So the
    responses to the meeting, so you can write a response to today's meeting you can
    say. here's what I didn't understand or here's what I. like to know more about
    or here's, the most important thing we talked about. So I know.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: Professor one more thing regarding that feedback every single day that after
    the lecture we are right at 100 words things like that I checked. And he said,
    the deadline is like every day after the meeting hours, so you after the lecture
    I was 12 in the night so because, like i'm having some classes, following this
    class so. Can we maybe modify that like maybe extend for four or five hours or
    something like that, because the classes goes on, after this for like because
    I have taken another class that starts from like. 237 and I have also taken a
    graduate seminar that goes on like five or 530 so kind of like it's like it's
    difficult for me to like write the review, right after our class. So that's how
    they can we just extend that like maybe the next day 12 or something like that
    in the morning to Wilson.
  persid: S07
- desc: Like, no, no, I don't think so I don't want you to overthink it. it's it's
    like. issue is going to take more than five minutes. Your your. It should I don't
    expect it take more than five minutes so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, so it's not going to be a like big thing it's going to be like small
    thing and it's not.
  persid: S07
- desc: 100 words.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I can get the word limit, but the thing is like i'm not able to get the
    like content like what kind of things that we have to provide like is it gonna
    be like a complete you know review of the things like proper.
  persid: S07
- desc: You know, research.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And stuff or something like that.
  persid: S07
- desc: So. Page here. Oh, so now. Now it's open I can show it to you. So I want you
    to. on any day to pick one of three things. Most important thing that you learned.
    In our discussion most difficult thing for you to understand from our discussion.
    The thing about which you most like to know more. So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So. Every day feedback.
  persid: S07
- desc: So. So here's what it looks like when you do respond to meeting one. Then
    there's it gives you that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh.
  persid: ???
- desc: So let's say the thing i'm most like to. know more about thing about which
    I most like to learn more. No more. So i'm going to say that's what i'm writing
    that's how to classify it. You can write up to 100 words and, and this is an example
    here okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay yeah oh.
  persid: S07
- desc: yeah. That took me less than five minutes.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay Okay, or if that's just like a general question type of stuff okay let's
    open that we have.
  persid: S07
- desc: right to see like I want to get your input. Yes, some days, maybe you have
    a question some days, maybe. You don't have a question but. This particular thing
    was. Important I found this really important. or i'd like to know more about this
    or. i'm trying to give you a few things some I don't want you to describe what
    we talked about in class.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I don't need.
  persid: S07
- desc: you to read you know regurgitate. A summary like that. But. So I want you
    to pick one of those three descriptions of what you're writing and then right
    up to 100 words. See you know in Chapter one of the. So there's an interesting
    answering machine designs talked about in Chapter one I think it's Chapter one.
    Anyway, so I might be. Something that comes up will come up and discussion.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you, Professor That is my all doubt it's really helpful.
  persid: S07
- desc: Anyway, what i'm going to do is. Because these are going to be do by midnight,
    then tomorrow i'll look through them and organize them and then we'll spend some
    time talking about them. Next class. Okay.
