- desc: Good afternoon.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good afternoon, Professor. Your office today.
  persid: S01
- desc: Did you get my email recently. Where you just noticed by the background that
    i'm not that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I noticed by the backdrop of so.
  persid: S01
- desc: So I I tried to. I was a bit late doing this i'm stuck at home today because
    of. Its kind of look at our roof. Getting some water in around the chimney. And
    then, it just wasn't worthwhile to go into the. anyway. So I thought this might
    also be a good day to. spend some time in in group project groups. either for
    today's assignment or for planning for the next bit. That was the purpose of my
    note, but by the time that. I got it sent it was probably not too much at a time
    when you were coming. Already. Or you shouldn't. Anyway, not. That I was trying
    to discourage you from coming to class today, but I just wanted to give a heads
    up about what I thought I always thought how I thought we might use today's time.
    Anyone go trick or treating last night. did anyone have kids come to their house.
    or dwelling apartment. So my wife said she expected no kids and I said I expected
    one family, so we exceeded both our expectations we had one family and two kids
    came on their own. So we had three people and I tried to load them up as much
    as possible with candy. But we still have a lot left so. See, this is the. This
    is the real tragedy of not having face to face meeting because I could bring.
    leftover goodies to class today and share them with you. So i'll i'll take them
    to the computer science office. So. How many of you are getting on campus these
    days from time to time. Okay, so. tomorrow. will supplement the. The supply of
    candy in the office. So if you if you're going to stop by there. Might he might
    have. Some extra goodies there to be found. So the other feature of being at home
    is my puppy is that my feet trying to get my attention. Here, maybe i'll give
    you a chance to see him. camera shy. There we go his name is l gar. he's just
    over a year he was turned one years old. could go, we go Friday. anyway. is generally
    pretty nice he's a little bit. he's still a little bit full of energy. Like a
    puppy so he didn't go away when he had his birthday. Okay, so. You would really
    enjoy coming again a topic of. If he could come to class meetings and. Come by
    and greet everybody every one of you. Looking your face or. jumping out anyway,
    trying to get him to be a little more calm. Anyway, I digress. So let me share
    my screen. So here's my I didn't say that in class but happy Monday. First of
    November today. it's good to do the attendance. Okay, so you got that out of the
    way. Anyone. think that the renaming of Facebook as Meta. is going to mean a big
    change. or. Perhaps even an improvement. So. Do you think Facebook hasn't Facebook
    hasn't already jumped the shark. And for. So I noticed that they're not rebranding
    the Facebook APP itself it's just. The parent company is being called Meta. So,
    Michael mentioned jumping the shark. Do you or anyone else know what the references
    or. Where that phrase jumping the shark comes from. Yes, so there is. An episode
    of happy days which this film TV show in the late 70s early 80s, I think. came
    out of. the heels of. American cushy movie I think there was a connection there.
    The main character Arthur funds rally. Was water skiing and. In his leather jacket,
    as I recall. And there was a shark in the water, and he jumped over the shark.
    So, to have him water skiing. And jumping over a shark was seen as a desperate
    ratings ploy. So this is. That phrase it comes into. Our modern lexicon. Okay,
    so. I suggest will go into. will make breakout groups make 13 of them, so you
    can get together with your project group. And i'll enable screen sharing. That
    will be here in case you want to ask them questions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Could you go over the next group assignment that what is the general expectation
    of the next group is just that we have an idea.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay sure. So, now that. With the due date for the project this last part
    of the project. Or, part two of the project do today. Then i'll create testing
    groups so. You doing. These children on a chair. it's a little too much enthusiasm
    from the puppy. He. is also this chosen to chew on baseboards. around the House
    so that's. it's not a welcome behavior. But. he's generally adorable. anyway.
    So let me go to what I have written here for the project for this next assignment.
    So the idea is that each project group has two interfaces let's call them A and
    B. You have low fidelity versions of the of your interface. So the different interfaces
    because they have. Their based on different metaphors. But they allow the user
    to complete the same task. Right, so you have these two interfaces. And so what
    this is going to do is. allow you to engage. Other class members. In evaluating
    your low fidelity prototypes so. So, most of these testing groups will be three
    people. So I made an example here. With Bob fanboy on Prem la. So those three
    three people are in the group so there's probably going to be one group of four
    people in it. So that doesn't mean you have to make extra appointments it's just.
    it's just a way to structure things so that you're not testing with your own group
    members and you're not. So you're not testing your own group members and the people
    you're testing with their from different groups as well. So that gives those other
    project groups, maybe more experience. collective experience with the different
    interfaces. Around in in. Amongst the projects. Is that if that makes sense. So,
    in trying to. engage. As much diversity of. opinion as possible, without making
    this. too onerous. So three people in the group ID. But there may be four. So
    Bob fan one pamela that's what i'm showing on screen here. So when you have a
    greeting. So there's. In a group of three there's three pairs. So each pair you
    can arrange to have a zoom meeting. And then. You present one interface one of
    your interfaces to the other person and then. So you then you're running the evaluation.
    And then. And then, once that's done the other. person in the pair. is going to.
    run the evaluation of his or her interface with you as a participant. So the idea
    is you're going to have one so each person is going to. Do one test. Other it
    a interface of the group's a interface and one test of their groups be interface.
    So that's. that's the idea. I hate this feature. Where if I inadvertently have.
    two fingers on that touchpad, then I can. jump back to. Previous screens I. lose.
    Potentially lose work that way more than once. Okay, so that's the idea of running
    the tests. So before you individually do do the test A and B tests tests of your
    amb interfaces as a group, then you create the script and the. The questions and
    the instruments you're going to. use to collect the data during your your meeting.
    Okay, so. So you're not each do it all your group members aren't doing their own
    thing in terms of collecting data but you've got a script. That you agreed on
    within your project group. That you're going to present. To the people in your
    testing group so when you do the interface, and the the interface you're going
    to have the same script for those two tests. And everyone in your project group
    is going to have the same. script as well, so all all. All three or four of your.
    And B tests are going to have the same script so you're going to collect the same
    kinds of data. Each time as well. Now, I think I have. I. think this link is,
    let me just check this link to documents related to the. Video. Okay, so their.
    documents. To that test. So I think we. Okay i'm not sure. If anywhere I posted
    the link for the video but. Like i'll post to the chat. Here today just to make
    sure that it's covered. it's a good illustration of how to conduct a test. Their
    testing a. An active website that same idea could go for. Your low fidelity prototype.
    Just instead of sharing your screen you're sharing. pictures that you drawn. Of
    the different. elements of the interfaces you. anticipate them. Okay. So. You
    go back to them. So you should submit all of your raw data and submit a summary
    of all is collected by whom, from whom when and where it should be group rose
    will collect one test of interface a one test of your face be. All tests, we,
    the same script and other materials. So you shouldn't sin submit your. I can clarify
    that should submit the script in the. Data Collection instruments as well. So
    revise that. description. So provide analysis of your data, the data that you
    collected from participants reveal any agreement or disagreement about your interface
    designs were there any results that were surprising in any way. And then, finally,
    based on your experience with your project in your testing of your low fidelity
    prototypes. create a single interface design that combines the best ideas. and
    new to low fidelity prototypes in any other sources.
  persid: DHH
- desc: i'm a little confused here. Could you clarify. This this particular assignment,
    we have a testing group and we have a project group so. from at least my reading
    of this assignment description. you're suggesting that the testing group is making.
    A single interface design that combines the to. know all the prototypes or is
    that the group project.
  persid: S03
- desc: Is the project group.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK so.
  persid: S03
- desc: The testing group is. is a way to manage the people, so you don't have to.
    Take on survey asking different people. To test your interface so i'll make groups
    based on. The project. i'll mix up. The project groups into. Groups of three or
    four, so the each of those. So the testing groups will have people from. All different
    project groups. Not all different, but they won't be there won't be the same project
    group represented more than once in a testing group. So the idea with the testing
    groups is say. If you and I, and so, here we are in the testing group and we're
    all in different project groups. Then I would arrange to meet with you Jeffrey.
    And then I would show you my interface a. And do the test run the test of that
    using the script. And then you would. run your test of your interface a. Using
    your script and then so that way we each get. One test and way in working after
    are.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, I think I understand, so people that are in the same testing group they
    don't need to interact at all with each other. Correct.
  persid: S03
- desc: Not not to produce anything for the assignment.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah. But, but the project group still has to collect data from them and everything.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah So the idea would be. whoever's in your testing group so if there's three
    people in your testing group. The other two people in your testing group. Will
    you will interact with them to run a test of your interface. One one person you'll
    test your interface a the other person with with. With the other person you'll
    test your interface be.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay yeah okay so you're testing each other's. prototypes.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah that's right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and I guess. That will be all I guess. It seems sounds consistent Okay, thank
    you for clarifying.
  persid: S03
- desc: you're welcome. thanks for the question. Any other questions. So I need to
    update the testing group members link. With the. submitted by Wednesday i'll have
    the testing groups made up. No link will be updated.
  persid: DHH
- desc: One of the question.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The last sentence or says, based on your experience blah blah blah and then
    create a single interface design is this what you're referring to in materialized
    part two, as the high fidelity prototype. Last the last step of the project.
  persid: S04
- desc: Right.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The high fidelity photo.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah so. i'm. i'm trying, a new fourth part of the project. So the idea is
    that you should say that maybe you can. outline it. So I had some better language
    at the end of this assignment. So you can sketch sketch of what changes, you would
    make. To universe after your testing. And then. In the last part. Of the project
    to create. A video that. shows a demonstration of the. Of the single interface
    design. And then you're presenting in the last. part for the project you're presenting.
    The final interfaces nine you have. In in some kind of simulation of interaction.
    And you're also sort of presenting the background. Of the steps that led you to
    that point. Does that make sense. So i'm.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A little unclear about when we submit the high fidelity prototype as part
    of the last stage or as part of the third stage.
  persid: S04
- desc: No inspiring the last stage okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So the Korean single interface design the you mentioned and the next submission
    is actually going to be essentially another iteration of the low fidelity prototype
    we've been working with. You know reading everything. yeah okay. So it's going
    to be just a pretty a wireframe drawing or something to that effect.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah so it can be a sketch, just like the other your interface A and B.
  persid: DHH
- desc: perfect.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, thanks for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: If you.
  persid: S04
- desc: A question. Okay, so i'll create these groups breakout rooms, the 13 for the
    project to correspond to the project groups. So you know which group your number
    you're in. Or you can. well. Surprise yourself. meet some new people today anyway.
    So i'm going to create those and then i'll turn on the sharing screen and i'll
    be around here. And if you have questions, let me know. I can come and join your
    breakout room, if you have a question. Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Hello. meeting you. And all those. breakout rooms mahaney. Meeting. breakout
    room meeting with. Seven number join. me the new man today.
