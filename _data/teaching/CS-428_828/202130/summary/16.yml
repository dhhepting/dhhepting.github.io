Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: afternoon.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Professor.
  persid: S01
- desc: it's a little cooler today, I heard on the radio that it's going to be snow
    before too long. Right. Maybe some rain and then maybe some snow. Soon afterwards.
    getting us to this nice fall weather. Okay, so after. Our meeting. The other day.
    When we share my screen. Had a bit of technical difficulties here. So the website
    is an updated i've gotta figure out a couple things. So again, have been travis
    documentation isn't always the most clear. So. I struggled my way through that
    and we'll get this content up on the website soon. So I was going to say is that
    I did. Do. Some research into. We looked at all the show attendance to to you
    and to me. So I have a new. URL variable to put on the end. This. Page. You can
    see it's view equals one. And then that. corresponds to selecting days. i'm curious
    whether it's going to skip the next session day or. click on this hero. yeah.
    So this fit about how to display the current leading is not walking and. So I
    that's investigation and I made a forum post on moodle. let's see if I can find
    it. see if I got any responses to my. question. And I haven't yet. So i'm trying
    here to add another tab to. window that i'm sharing. here's a question that I
    asked what when I. was a situation extract and asked the question. So I discovered
    that I could do a current date. and give it the current dates. This is a timestamp
    unix timestamp. As anyone ever run into those. So that's the. Number of seconds
    since January first. 1978. So not only not very well documented and then looking
    at this. I can guess it's a timestamp. But it's not it's not very clear. What.
    You do with what like what date it specified. and similarly. Vehicles one. seems
    to do the track that was extended my investigation with the other day. But vehicles
    one seems to be. doing the right thing for us. But again there's no documentation
    about. about it and. there's no. Vehicles one is not. No. Self explanatory. So
    it doesn't. disagree with it sticks. anyway. So here's our attendance. So that's
    a little better display that it gives us only one meeting so we're not. One the
    wrong one. So we had the idea of going to a different screen to to get there.
    Alright, so last day we talked about. TIM hortons. pain and sugar dispensers cream,
    sugar and milk dispensers. So how many people, the show of hands or some kind
    of reaction. Many people could see. trying to get cream and. Being an under dispensing
    milk or vice versa, to. Have a. dispense dairy product. miss the Cup. How many
    people can can see that as an issue potential issue that interface. Okay, a couple
    people. So what kind of metaphors are at work in those two separate interfaces.
    let's go back to the picture. which I should I should have corrected. Levi correct
    attracted. Okay, so. We could do a high tech. solution to say that there's a cup
    that's the right size under the. Under the proper. Milk or dairy milk or cream.
    spoke. let's suppose you could do the same with sugar, although it's. It seems
    a dispensing the sugar. The Cup, there is much less likely to happen. So if you're
    having a sensor under the under the milk and the cream this spouts. That. fixing
    the issue, the potential for the air or is it just. going to put a bandaid on
    that design. So we're going to protect the user from. Making that mistake was
    you have a comment.
  persid: DHH
- desc: or not I just had my heart for your inquiry.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. Thanks.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I have a way. Like what kind of metaphor you're talking about.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well, so how do we put sugar and milk or cream into.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: Why is the coffee, by the way.
  persid: S04
- desc: Sorry go ahead.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I see sugar, I see milk ice ice cream, but I don't see the coffee, the main.
    thing is missing actually.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah so the coffee is off to the loft there were. I think. Your pod for the
    cow. well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Actually. The metaphor, which I think is like it's very common like when we
    see. medium devil devil it's understood the head it's a medium curve and devil
    agreement devil's river.
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: there's a normal and.
  persid: S03
- desc: I think those settings should be separated for milk and cream, because they
    are, I mean the setting is put in the same place, so it may confuse the user,
    which one i'm sitting here i'm in selecting selecting the meal or am I selecting
    the cream. Maybe they can be consistent, like the sugar.
  persid: S04
- desc: You know, so what i'm. Getting at tues. And so the concept of a double double
    is isn't necessarily hard to promise. So we might be familiar with that, but then
    it's a question of executing it. So if we have a medium Cup. When you take the
    shoot, what are the sugar Spencer first and step one. So. What has to happen to
    get a double. What do you do in step one to make a medium double double. What
    do you do on the interface.
  persid: DHH
- desc: jambi first select a medium from step one to step three. And then.
  persid: S03
- desc: Step one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: poses the medium and step one.
  persid: S04
- desc: We just best medium instead of one that said.
  persid: S03
- desc: Why do you press it once or depressive twice or three times.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Have you press it once already.
  persid: S03
- desc: You know, getting a double double.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah, this is the thing.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah. It actually refers to the size of the top.
  persid: S04
- desc: So.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So I would say, like one of the negative sides of this design is, they are
    not assigning a certain amount, or like the quantity of the certain item so you're
    just clicking medium. And just they are measuring medium we don't know what's
    what's the quantity we don't know it's double double maybe triple triple some
    people they like, maybe triple triple others they want just single others, maybe
    they want sweetener they don't want to drink sugar.
  persid: S05
- desc: So it's.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just like limit limited options.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah so. If they have a preference for other sweeteners, I think there are
    pockets of sweeteners. On somewhere along the way there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah but it's still like the process is not domain it.
  persid: S05
- desc: No. So you, it requires some focus, so the first time, so I would say, adding
    sugar, you might say. You might think about it in terms of spoonfuls of sugar
    if you're at. The full of sugar with.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe five grams when it's book.
  persid: S05
- desc: yeah but then the question is. The amounts being dispensing press Small Medium
    large extra large are different. Right and it's not clear. So it'd be nice maybe
    if they said. If they had the idea of spoonful and you could say one spoonful
    for small to medium three for larger for for extra large. With something like
    that. Because I think.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I think the interactions that reference is not clear yeah the reference
    of home how much sugar we've already know it's not clear like putting Small Medium
    large extra night is not enough instead fun.
  persid: S03
- desc: Well it's it's enough. If you wanted to do a medium double double. If you
    stick with the medium double double.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah there in that case only. If someone wants paper, then it will have to
    think or.
  persid: S03
- desc: Even for. Even for a double. yeah the person has to realize that you need
    to press the button the medium button. Three two times, or three times to get
    a triple. Two times to get a double and three times to get a triple.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, that makes sense.
  persid: S04
- desc: So. What kind of metaphor is this so it's. it's it's not like putting spoonfuls
    of sugar and. it's. it's not transparent, so we don't know how much sugar we're
    getting.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So can we get a fair does limited functionality.
  persid: S05
- desc: Can you tell me more about that.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Like their function is not hundred percent clear.
  persid: S05
- desc: Right. So. there's a. golf of. execution and their goals are not as small
    as it could be. there's a conceptual distance between. The user and the sugar
    dispenser. Yes, we have to understand. What. You have to press the button multiple
    times to get no sugar, so if you're. If you really wanted something sweet, you
    might press when I started the median cup of them press the extra large button.
    So it's. So without any other information, we could make some inferences about.
    So we could do it as we develop a mental model say. If I have a medium cup and
    I press extra the extra large button. Maybe i'd like to do that because. I just
    want to press the button once. And I want to get as sweet as sweet a cup of coffee
    as possible. it's so I don't know how many how many grams of sugar i'm getting
    from that. And that would be in a nice bit of information that. i'm thinking about
    whether we need to have that extra bit of sugar it to. Get the required energy
    for a cup of coffee. So it's to me it's like it's like adding spoonfuls of sugar,
    but. We don't know how big the spoons in. And they're all different. There are
    four sizes of spoons are doing a hobbit they're. Small Medium large and extra
    large. Anything else any other comment about step one. Okay. So then, what was.
    So just ask the question why is the sugar machine, depending on the cup size is
    in the double double standard of two packets of sugar. So this. So that highlights
    an issue so, whereas we think. We understand double double in a way that. your
    respective of upsize. Then. practically speaking if we have a smoke, if we want
    to have the same. flavor in a small cup as an extra large cup then wall. proportions,
    have to be different. Is if we put the same amount in this between the small and
    the extra large cups. Smart same amount of sugar in each of those. Then the extra
    large Cup is going to test taste sweet, because the sugars more diluted. Well
    it's not clear there. Okay let's move on to step two. And cream or milk. So you
    can select the cup size and right away, you notice there's a difference here because
    there's an extra small Cup. i'm not sure if there's an extra small. cup of coffee
    or whether they just have. A. cup size of extra small for.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Because it ties.
  persid: S03
- desc: it's a which. translates oh. well. Then we get to the question why are we
    feeding kids coffee. I suppose it because they wouldn't add milk too hot chocolate.
    But anyway.
  persid: DHH
- desc: where's the sugar for extra small come.
  persid: S04
- desc: by me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Why is the sugar for the extra small, there is no standard for extent some
    small in the sugar, I mean step step one.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah so I just looking at this, I realize. There is a button to the left of
    S. And i'm not sure what it does. When the lab calf opens again i'll have to test
    that button. So actually there are five. Because I was focused on the number of
    labels there.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And that might be for access mode.
  persid: S03
- desc: So May. or might be matching the extra extra small size. So, then, the amount
    of you dispense need to say single double or triple. And then we choose cream
    or milk. And then dispense. So here we're deciding. What we'd like to put in.
    How much we'd like to put in before and. So we're selecting single double or triple.
    And then dispensing. The by pressing this button. So, because our attention is
    up here. may not be focused on. So we selected Caribbean milk instead and is the
    third step on the checklist here. Then cream and milk is. Our attention is on
    the dispense button and less so, on the creamer the milk spouts. So that's where.
    The milk or cream get spill. So when I was thinking of this earlier. I thought
    about. The sugar packets being available might. ask for two or three sugar packets
    with your coffee you getting it in the different from a different dispenser or.
    cafeteria. You might have a collection of sugar pockets and cream. Small creamers.
    So we still don't know the size, the amount of milk or cream we're going to get
    spence. And i'm not sure that we don't. We can't do. A double triple we're request
    dispensed whites. And I wonder, this is maybe more. an audit the stories information
    about. The contents are dispensed or not sure like it's technically better to
    have this setup. that the road buttons like this, like on the sugar to sponsor
    the five buttons. Across the top of the milk and cream. So we have the five buttons
    across milk or cream. No Entry so we have two sets of five buttons. Without the.
    More approachable.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I think that the COP says is not necessary here the amount, I want to take
    the milk or cream, that is, the necessary thing the COP sizes. Just evil in here.
  persid: S04
- desc: well. Yes, and no, I think, I think that if if you wanted to say. Like double
    doubles whatever size, it is then going to get. Then I should know that i'm going
    to press. i'm making a large double double or medium double double or small double
    double. So i'm going to press account size and i'm going to say double and that
    you want to choices. Left is whether it's cream or no. So is this a good interface
    if you're doing double doubles. or double cream or. The double milk or triple
    milk or. If you have the idea of ordering coffee like we do at TIM hortons say.
    Please double double and so forth. So do you think. to sponsor. When problem would
    be better if you only had one place to put the Cup. With that help things.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah maybe that will be also a tool, because we are all already selecting
    which order you want to take so if there is one place to actually put up that
    would make less collocation. Otherwise, someone can see like cream and take them
    in.
  persid: S04
- desc: yeah. So. There might be a. constraint of how. The milk and cream are made
    available X I think they're just in giant. will not.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe.
  persid: S04
- desc: you're in big plastic bags. In the. The dispenser that comes out the bottom
    of the boat that comes up the bottom this baby part of the bag just gets. With
    into the. machine that way. So it might be difficult to. make something that's
    easy to clean and to keep sanitary. would have just one spot for the dairy to
    come up. With conceptually. So I think it's. For me it's a question of attention.
    That the spence button, we were doing the dispense activity your attention isn't
    where the cup is placed. So much as you're focused on getting the amount. For
    to cream let's say for a large cup of coffee. And you might put a couple hundred
    milk. or vice versa. So does anyone have. Whether the comments of. The interfaces
    from your personal experience or otherwise.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: So I wanted to revisit the videos I. shared with you, the other day about
    the knowledge navigator from apple and cool town from HP. So, can you could you
    identify with. The metaphors being used in those videos. Did you enjoy the videos.
    Look at the videos.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, Professor I did, and I enjoyed the videos because, if I look at the HP
    cool Tyson that was done in 2000 and asked about when I just started walking.
  persid: S01
- desc: So.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah it brings back for memory, but what I find interesting is for the hitch
    be cool town, some of the devices, there are currently use like the fall detection,
    for example. I believe that X is correctly.
  persid: S01
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: And then they could. You go to a. specified location to read her data and
    get her medical mystery. yeah so it's like having a. URL on the semantic Web.
    Well, so it's reminiscent of Internet of Things kinds of technology that we're
    we're. Becoming immersed in now. So cool town, the one that I thought was least
    cool is the heads up display in the car. I mean the fact that they could. Help
    him. navigate. To the gas station and get this problem resolved it's good but.
    So, having having it, but having a heads up display for mail messages and. All
    these other things, that the dragon is doing. seems to be a good recipe for distracted
    driving. Of course. I mean, now that hasn't stopped people because. I heard about
    last year there's. A new luxury car that has. The whole dashboard being. display
    screen and not sure which model Carla was. But there's certainly making the dash.
    The dash display screens bigger and. Putting more activities there so. You seem
    to be not so concerned about distracted driving. I would say. We thought about
    that. Okay, so that's the Mercedes eq is the one that's got the giant. dash sighs
    display screen I guess okay. So, if we so the other nice thing about those videos
    they. Help us. they're telling us stories. What how technology, like the US so
    it's not. it's not so much about. the specifics of the interactions but the general.
    On services that are provided by the technology. So it can get. Information and
    we can. Imagine how a vigil or virtual assistant could involve us schedule activities
    and. do some asks for us. So we're thinking or. Our first idea is evolved. What
    the technology will do. necessarily how it will do it. So I think if we get the
    what. We get a vision of. What we'd like the interface to do. What the capabilities
    are that that's a good first step, and then we can work on. Why do you design
    the information display. And the commands to make that happen. So we do the integration
    design and interaction design. From the perspective of. What things would like
    to be able to do. The interface. And then, how do we. How do we make them consistent,
    I guess, are all the aspects of the interface consistent, so I designed the sugar
    and the milk and cream dispensers. They have the interfaces and consistent but.
    seems like it could be. That could be helpful to reduce. Problems or spills of
    milk and or cream. It so that's why we can think of a metaphor is being. A good
    way to unify things in the interface that are features so. Like if we think about
    online shopping. it's like grabbing a cart. Filling it up with the things you
    want to buy. And then going to check out and paying for it. So that that's a helpful
    metaphor that. Trains the activities that are available, but it's not too specific.
    That we were lost without a car to push around. Or to general that we don't. We
    don't get enough information to. To apply with to the specific interface for encounter.
    So metaphors of. ideas to help the user understand where the wall of the mental
    model of the interface. We can design. You can't force users to particular mental
    model. We can encourage it by having metaphors that are. Appropriate. at the right
    level of detail. So make sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes. Okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: So see right of time. So I was going to. I think I suggested it in in the
    next assignment. If you want, if you're looking for something next look at next
    is probably chapter 12. Will text to be a. good thing to look at. Anyway, so that
    brings us to the end of today. i've got an office or two. i'm going to have to.
    Do a small office or tomorrow, because I have an appointment of campus and then,
    I have a department me. So maybe we'll do it. In the morning tomorrow, like a
    loving. Or you could do it on Friday. And maybe i'll. send a note, but if you
    have the preferences for tomorrow or Friday, let me know okay. So, thank you very
    much for today. Take care.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S01
- desc: enjoy the Nice weather, while us and we'll see you on Friday. Welcome thanks.
    thanks you too.
