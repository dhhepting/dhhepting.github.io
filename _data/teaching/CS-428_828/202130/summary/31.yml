Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: afternoon. how's everyone doing today. Happy Friday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you i'm doing.
  persid: S01
- desc: Good. So I was had my office hour from home yesterday. I decided to come back
    on campus today just. Usually, make the point of. saying how and in Regina saskatchewan
    we're not put off by the snow. just go by their regular business. So. Here I am
    in my office on third floor of college West. Okay, so let's go to. today's meeting
    page. let's do attendance, first of all. OK, so now the password in the chat.
    Alright, so before we get any further. Everyone get my email. On Wednesday, about
    the testing. being done. Today, by 5pm and. and making sure that appointments
    were arranged before class today. So let me do a poll.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yes, I got them email.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. So at least Jeffrey did.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I also got to me.
  persid: S03
- desc: I was kidding when I said it was just Jeff for you got it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry bye.
  persid: S03
- desc: So if you can see my screen now. Maybe i'll do is i'll take a snapshot and
    i'll post it. Good again an idea why don't like. To set up these polls, especially
    on the fly. Okay, so I don't want to get hung up on that. Well, you can't see
    it anyway, especially. Okay, so I just want to get a sense of. So there's three
    choices either you have two appointments scheduled or done by 5pm. One appointment
    scheduled are done by 5pm and zero appointment scheduled they're done by 5pm okay
    that makes sense. Launching the ball now. So looking for five more people to participate.
    One more. So on the top line it says. 29 to 31 participants participated and then
    on the question line it says 2929 100% answered. So I don't know why those two
    are numbers are different.
  persid: DHH
- desc: It says 32 participants are here.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah but that includes. 32 participants includes me. But I can't answer the
    poll. So that's why it. Okay, now it says 30 out of 30 participants. And then
    the question that's been answered by everybody okay so i'm going to end the call
    now. So i'm encouraged that 80%. said they got things organized. Well okay so
    i'm encouraged that 100% send have you answered the question. But there's still
    a 19 people in the class who didn't. Who aren't here who i'm not sure about so
    anyway, for our sample today of 30. Of you 80% so 24 to 30 said they've got everything
    booked. For 13% for the 30 said one appointment scheduled are done. By the end
    of the day today. And then to have 30 said they don't have any appointments scheduled
    are done by 5pm. So those last two groups I just. I don't want to put people on
    the spot in front of everybody, but. So we had any communication with the testing
    groups. You can answer in chat or you can send me a direct message, if you like.
  persid: DHH
- desc: hey.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so one correction. Okay, so. One person who entered you said zero appointments
    scheduled. understood to mean 0.0 appointments needed to be scheduled. So the
    other person who answered zero appointments. Can you send me a direct message.
    about your situation. What if we. start doing that let's try the. i'll do the
    sharing my whiteboard and you can annotate on it. i'm trying to get rid of this.
    And just so happened that. The control bar was over top of the buttons to distress
    the ball. Okay, so that's done now. Oh OK. So the two people answered zero. Let
    me just redo them. We do that pole in a minute. I names validators. Okay, so if
    you want to do some. Okay, so. Believe. We should be able to post things onto
    the screen or draw on the screen or. Okay, the people who have one so that from
    I understand there are no groups. know people who have zero payments arranged
    so that's good some most of two appointments done or scheduled to be done by 5pm
    today and. So that's still remain still these a few people with one appointment
    scheduled are done by 5pm so for the people who are. You can draw on the screen
    or type on the screen. Okay i'm. not sure what the comment in the chat for Martin.
  persid: DHH
- desc: amen. We cannot draw on the screen. Like for my team, we are already done,
    we don't have any issues.
  persid: S05
- desc: Okay what's good. yeah Oh, if you.
  persid: DHH
- desc: click on, there is no option.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah we.
  persid: S05
- desc: Are you on an iPhone or what kind of platform, are you on.
  persid: DHH
- desc: A laptop.
  persid: S05
- desc: i'm on windows your windows laptop.
  persid: S03
- desc: Let me join from my iPhone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: you're muted.
  persid: S02
- desc: So when I logged in on my phone I kicked. Myself out of my desktop. or my
    laptop so just a minute here like it back. To that, with the shared screen and
    everything. Recording.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Now.
  persid: S06
- desc: Okay, so i'm back unmuted now. Such a joy to use this platform. Some days.
    Okay. So, I guess, my concern is, if you only have one test arranged or completed
    and you don't have the second test of your other end. So you don't have a test
    of both of your interfaces range just have one test. So, based on notes that i've
    gotten that people are. there's there's nobody here, who has zero. Testing appointments
    arranged so that's good. So i'm just wondering if there. Let me just go back and
    do the poll again maybe that's easiest. We done okay that's good. Okay. Let me
    do the poll. i'm just gonna relaunch the poll that we just did earlier. So if
    you can answer again. I would appreciate it. Okay, still have a couple of people
    who haven't replied. So there, so there are still people couple people. Who said
    they haven't got both their appointments scheduled or done. So. possible solution.
    In that case, is to go back. To the person us. We can we've done a test and test
    your other interface with them. see if you can arrange that that would be maybe
    the simplest solution. Okay. i'm going to end the poll now. So i'm posting the
    link to the. image I shared of me editing the pole what my screen looks like them.
    And i'll share my screen. So anyway to pull that I was trying to edit this back
    here the untitled one. blocked by. A few windows here. Well, one anyway. Okay,
    so I wanted to do a breakout the other day, but we've been that time, so let me
    start that today. So the question I want to think about either think about in
    breakout and based on the things that I posted yesterday and our experience so
    far with the annotations and so on. question I want you to consider is how to
    use zoom to make the most out of great group discussions. And I will. Let. You
    share your screen in the breakout groups. So I think we'll try. and try for breakout
    rooms. While lets you. choose. Choose your room a try and stick to vote eight.
    People so if there's more than eight. eight or nine. Look, for somewhere else
    okay. Okay there's still quite a lot of people not going into a breakout room.
    is still six people left. That a breakout room so i'm getting. Okay, any. thoughts
    about. How to use zoom to make most of the breakout room discussions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: We had a discussion about data and. We thought that it would be great if the.
    Members are more engaging I mean if they. If they are engaged in the discussions
    and it will be. helpful to actually. make it more useful discussion forum discussion
    and also if the topic is like directed and specific to. I mean, understandable
    and interest to all the Members, then it will also. It will also get them to talk
    and communicate with each other and also sometimes we need to actually. give all
    the Members, some opportunity to talk and we should listen to them, so it will
    be helpful for other Members to communicate.
  persid: S08
- desc: Okay, so that sounds like some good ground rules for. participating in breakout
    rooms. Any thoughts about. The capabilities that zoom provides. And ways ways
    to use zoom to help people be more engaged in discussions.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Ashley gave us a good point here in our breakout room. She mentioned that.
    While users don't seem to have the feature to create polls have their own. For
    their peers so like if we're in a breakout room we can't generate our own polls.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. For discussion mm hmm.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: Another thing that could maybe increase our. Dialogue, or whatever would be
    image sharing on the chat but we could definitely see where that could go wrong,
    but. We can already do screen sharing so. that's. They could go either way on
    that.
  persid: S02
- desc: So when you in breakout rooms, when you can do the screen sharing, can you
    do a whiteboard as well.
  persid: DHH
- desc: I never tried that before. Let me.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ???
- desc: yeah so. The zoom interface is not so consistent, I would say, and it would
    help from some more consistency. and to be able to do polls more easily would
    be a certainly a big. help. To get them. To get people more engaged. Okay outlined
    my my idea my thought when we realized, we could do this anonymous annotation,
    even if we could do a stamp and with the checkmark for yes, and the next Renault.
    But there's no stamp on the iPhone interface for annotation so. it's certainly
    a problem, I would say. Any other comments about. Making breakout rooms more productive.
    More engaging. Seven feel like they're encouraged to participate. In my discouraging
    anybody from participating. Okay well. If that if I am. Let me know. anonymously,
    if you like. Anyway, it's 22 after so you done for time today. and we'll pick
    up. So we didn't talk about today on Monday, have a great weekend take care of
    everybody. And we'll see you on Monday. Stay safe and warm. I didn't know what
    the temperatures are protected. Through the weekend.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S01
- desc: Thanks sushi.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Take care have a good weekend.
  persid: S08
- desc: Thanks YouTube. Nice.
