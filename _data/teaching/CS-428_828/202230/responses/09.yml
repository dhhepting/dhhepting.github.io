difficult:
- desc: The most difficult thing in today&#039;s meeting for me is the empathize with
    teachers
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand is the concept of user friendly.
    We need to consider carefully to design the UI to be as friendly as possible for
    user.
- desc: gulf of execution was a bit tough to understand for me
important:
- desc: The user interface Design is the most effecful for any person who is designing
    the websites or the Interfaces what is for the people understanding and it is
    the effectful tool for the person who is working on it. If the websites interfaces
    is very intutive then everything is very clear but the think which is not visible
    then it is very complex. So my understanding is to deploy such type of UI that
    will be easy for the understaning but remaining the user privacy policy.
- desc: The most important thing I learned in this meeting was the 10 Usability Heuristics
    for User Interface Design. These rules will be very useful when we create or built
    a good and successful product to get the best customer satisfaction, such as the
    system being error free or giving the user the freedom &amp;amp; control such
    as if they placed an order by mistake, they should be able to modify or cancel
    it before it&#039;s shipped. This access will give the user sense of security
    and make them feel like they&#039;re in control
- desc: I have learned about the concept of creating intuitive design today. It gives
    the chance to think about user centric design by maintaining some standards. I
    have also gone through some heuristics for interface designing. We can always
    give the user some control over the interface so that we can get some feedback
    for improving. But the system should be error preventive and maintain some consistency.
- desc: Today in class we learned about the important concepts of intuition and heuristics
    for interfaces. I thought the concept of inution was especially interesting as
    sometimes designs can be confusing for users such as Norman Doors.
- desc: The different heuristics for designing a good interface.
- desc: "Today our teacher took about Empathize in UI UX  as well user friendly and\
    \ Intuitive (intuition) and we understand How to do we develop intuition in ui\
    \ ux :  out come of good design if its consistent with standards other example\
    \ and \u2026"
- desc: Today we discussed about assignment 1, what is intuitive design and 10 heuristic
    design principles
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture was on the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface
    Design wherein, I&#039;d understood the following concepts in the designing of
    a system&#039;s interface, namely, Visibility of system status, Match between
    system &amp;amp; the real world, User control and freedom, Consistency and standards,
    Error prevention, Recognition rather than recall, Flexibility &amp;amp; efficiency
    of use, Aesthetic and minimalist design, Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover
    from errors &amp;amp; Help &amp;amp; documentation.
- desc: We learned about the important concepts of intuition and heuristics of interfaces.
    Also learned about gulf of execution and evaluation.
- desc: "A website can and should be made intuitive for easy navigation for the users.\
    \ This can be achieved when one sympathizes with the user and the developer thinks\
    \ McDonald\u2019s the user\u2019s point of view and sticks to the norm. New features\
    \ can still be adde for innovation and creativity if the new functionality can\
    \ make the process easier and better."
- desc: "In Today\u2019s lecture we spoke about Assignment 1 (Empathize with Teachers).\
    \ Also we focused mainly intuition and some examples. Then we wen on to Talk about\
    \ the 10 Usability Heuristics of an Interface. Also the Two UX Gulfs, Evaluation\
    \ and Execution."
- desc: The balance of the Two UX Gulfs. Today&#039;s class examined the challenges
    people go through in order to interact with different technology environments
    with their user interfaces. Through an article, two gulfs were brought out of
    the Gulf of Evaluation and Gulf of Execution. These work in tandem with each other
    as the system state takes evaluation for the world(system) to connect to the state
    and evection works in taking a person&#039;s actions and connecting to the system.  They
    work together to create a loop.
- desc: The most important and new thing I learned today is the gulf of execution
    and evaluation. The gulf of execution is what the user thinks they can do with
    the system versus what the system actually does for them. The gulf of evaluation
    is figuring out how well the system can support the user through the given information
    of the system state.
- desc: The most important thing about today was intuitive and interactive websites
- desc: 'The process in which we develop intuition: if it is considered standard or
    something we are used to then its considered intuitive design. If we see a software
    that has a function which is not doing what is suppose to do on other software
    then it creates a usability issue for users. There will be an agreement over time
    but until then it is going to create confusion.'
- desc: Norman door and intuition was very informative. Had a new concept.
- desc: "In the 9th Mtg Dr. Hepting talked about \u201CEmpathize with Teacher\u201D\
    \ and he asked whether this is user friendly or not? This can be too broad for\
    \ thinking of specific  case and people. Also he mentioned some features of intuitive\
    \ design like invisible empathy. At the last part the way to develop intuition\
    \ like: out come of the good design, consistent with standards, and agreement\
    \ overtime."
- desc: 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design is very important. Designs
    should keep users informed about what is going on. Designs should be clear enough
    to users about what they want easily and also be standard. In a good design it
    is so important to prevent errors. All the information in a good design are relevant.
    It is so perfect to give the users help and documentations. In this way, they
    can find everything fast. Intuitive can help the design well. Norman Doors are
    not intuitive!
- desc: I learned how the design of interface cam effect personal emotions like intuition
    and empathy. I would also like to learn more that how can an interface attract
    users.
- desc: "In today\u2019s class we discussed about how can user be empowered to stop\
    \ misinformation and after that had more details about our first individual assignment\
    \ which is empathize with teachers. Should it be user friendly or intuitive?.\
    \ For it to be user friendly we should think about specific cases and people.\
    \ The Norman doors are not intuitive. The doors should be invisible means we don\u2019\
    t get distracted by it and get through it easily."
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we have learned some points about the empathy map
    which is our first assignment and then we seen the 10 usability heuristics after
    that we seen some points on evaluation and execution that we will discuss in detail
    in our next class.
- desc: Making Empathy Map
- desc: Heuristic design principles and what is intuitive design.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt was about intution and how we can develop
    it. I learnt different ways it can be possible.  Just to add on that also saw
    an example for invention of mouse
- desc: Today we learned about the intuitive user interface and how can one create
    intuitive user interface.
- desc: I learnt about empathy and sympathy in the previous lesson, and today I learned
    how to execute execution and evaluation, which are both crucial in any ux design.
    The class began with &amp;quot;happy Wednesday&amp;quot; and discussed heuristics
    and their usefulness.  and I want to learn more about how to perform out and evaluate
    tasks more quickly.  and smarter
- desc: Hello Prof. Hepting. Today you talked about the user friendliness of interface
    design and said that it is too general. Then, you introduced the usability heuristics
    and specially you discussed about user control and freedom. Finally, you talked
    about the two UX gulfs which are evaluation and execution. Thanks
- desc: "Today I learnt how to develop intuition among users while designing the interfaces.\
    \ Better the self explained and intuitive the design, the user doesn\u2019t have\
    \ to care about the execution of interface, they can know just by looking at it.\
    \ Also got to know about important heuristics for user interfaces."
- desc: 'Today we checked attendance and then learned about 10 Usability Heuristics
    for User Interface Design and The Two UX Gulfs: Evaluation and Execution'
- desc: 'We discussed a few points about Empathising with teachers which included:'
- desc: today some discussions regarding discovery of mouse, intudition and the first
    assignment was done. in the beginning, prof.abbas came shared his new program
    for third and fourth year computer science students
- desc: The ten heuristic usability and how it is useful but goes unnoticed in everyday
    designs and several interfaces. Besides that, I also came to know the gulf of
    execution and evaluation. Moreover, I want to know more about development of intuitive
    designs.
- desc: In this lesson, we mainly discuss The 10 Usability Heuristics and The Two
    UX Gulfs -- Evaluation and Execution, as well as The directions of The assignment.
- desc: The most important heuristic in my opinion is the error prevention one. I
    usually don&#039;t even read the buttons on the &#039;confirm&#039; alert that
    comes up when I delete something, I just automatically assume that it is going
    to be in the same location every time. So, the alert boxes should not switch the
    position of the &#039;confirm&#039; button each time just in case I accidentally
    click the wrong one.
know-more:
- desc: Today Professor discuss about empathy map, and I would like to discuss more
    about that.
- desc: "So in today\u2019s meeting we discussed about the user-friendly interface\
    \ which are easy to use because of the design being so simple. The UI is so interactive\
    \ and friendly that a user can figure out the functions just by going through\
    \ it. We also discussed about how to develop intuition, also I would like to know\
    \ more about how to build an intuitive interface and how to make it more effective.."
- desc: "I would like to learn about the concept of User control and freedom. I thought\
    \ it was very interesting as it referred to the \u201Cemergency exit.\u201D As\
    \ Dr. Hepting mentioned, even though we might only use these exits 1% of the time,\
    \ they are incredibly essential in these situations. I remember a time when I\
    \ accidentally unenrolled myself from a course on UR-self service. I wished there\
    \ was a confirmation prompt so that I would have gone through the hassle of enrolling\
    \ again (the class had a big waiting list)."
- desc: I would like to more about the intuitiveness of the computer interface design
    as it turns out be really interesting after todays session. In simple words an
    intuitive design is the one that is easy to use and the user knows what to do
    right after they start using the product itself. So basically an intuitiveness
    geneally refers to the unser friendliness design patterns that we are comfortable
    in navigating stuff through the browsers and able to access the information without
    any kind or hinderances.
- desc: I&#039;d ilke to know more about the answers to the question of how to empower
    users to stop viral misinformation. More education is one way of preventing misinformation.
    Censorship on social media like Twitter and Facebook was effective in stopping
    the spread of viral misinformation. We also discussed about developing intuition.
    I agree that documenting user experience over time is the best method of developing
    intuition.
- desc: I am curious about knowing the 2 UX gulfs evaluation and execution as it was
    end of lecture meeting.
- desc: Today, we had a discussion about how some interfaces are user-friendly and
    easy to use because the design is very intuitive. By just looking at the interface,
    the user can intutively figure out what and where they need to click and/or look.
    I would like to know more about what the UI/UX design phase looks like in order
    to build such an intuitive interface. What priorities/goals do the designers have
    when they are designing an interface that has to be accessible and intuitive at
    the same time?
- desc: About empathy mapping.
- desc: Execution and Evaluation are both very important. I feel like in the practical
    world, compared to the physical responses, people would prefer more visual ones.
    I would like to know more about the basic theorem related to user experience like
    these 2 gulfs.
- desc: the thing about which I would most like to know more is 10 Usability Heuristics
    for User Interface Design and how each usability can benefit us and benefit out
    interface for the better. Also, I would like to know more about the empathy map
    and how could we feel, say, think and understand the role of teacher and introduce
    a better delivery for the users without letting them suffer while using our interface.
