difficult:
- desc: "Today, for the whole class time, it was difficult for me to understand. First,\
    \ I did not understand the teaching role of the students. For discussion related\
    \ to chapter 1, Durrell Bishop\u2019s Answering Machine video has been played.\
    \ I know the concept behind the machine, but it seemed confusing to me how many\
    \ marbles could be used to cover the whole day and is there any significance for\
    \ the color of the marbles or not."
important:
- desc: Marble answering machine is introduced by Durrell Bishop in 1992, when he
    was a student at the Royal College of Art and he came up with an original answering
    machine design that is considered as one of the first tangible user interfaces
    (TUIs). This machine spits out a marble each time an incoming voice message is
    recorded. But But many claim the answering machine was invented by William Muller
    in 1935, but it may already have been created in 1931 by William Schergens whose
    device used phonographic cylinder
- desc: Today we watched a video about Durrell Bishop&#039;s Marble Answering Machine
    which was an old phone that recorded the voicemail and output a marble in the
    order a voicemail was received. After researching a little about it, I figured
    that he had designed this in 1992 and it&#039;s really amazing how you could separate
    the marble if the vm was for someone else and you could auto dial using the receptor.
    I wish they had developed on this idea a little more and can&#039;t imagine what
    it looked like today.
- desc: Durrell bishops marble answering machine
- desc: The professor successfully executed my dev tools lesson and used it to change
    the password on the QR code page to make it float right and bigger which made
    me proud. We discussed assignments, assignment groups and midterm dates which
    made me realize I should figure out when my other midterms are.
- desc: I thought the marble telephone answering machine in the video shown in class
    today was really interesting. It allows the user to sort their voicemail by relevance
    and allows reminders for any voice message they need to follow up on. The major
    downside I see in this system is that since it is using physical marbles, there
    is a chance some of the marbles could get lost.
- desc: We saw the video of the Marble Answering Machine by Durrell Bishop. This answering
    Machine is designed with some marbles. It is so simple! The number of marbles
    that have moved into the pinball-like chute indicates the number of messages.
    Placing one of these marbles into a dent on the machine causes the recorded message
    to play. Dropping the same marble into a different dent on the phone dials the
    caller who left the message.
- desc: Today we learned about durrel bishop answer machine
- desc: The concept of Durrell Bishop&#039;s answering machine was one of the most
    important thing I encountered today as it dealt with the problem of having to
    listen and read the instructions on the traditional answering machines. Moreover,
    the concept was demonstrated by means odm
- desc: I was impressed to see a marble answering machine and the most important thing
    is that it helps user to to keep the voicemail for a future use and sort them
    as needed depending on the call.
- desc: "I learned about a very important concept, that we are surrounded by many\
    \ instances of bad user interface. We examined the UofR academic schedule, a document\
    \ I used many times over the years. However, many of the choices of the design\
    \ did not take the user\u2019s experience in mind. For example, the Fall and Winter\
    \ semesters (the most used parts of the documents) are squished into the edge\
    \ of the document, making the users\u2019 experience more difficult. Simple fixes\
    \ can be implemented to produce a better experience."
- desc: The Marble Answering Machine is the most important thing I saw today. The
    video showcases a great and simple design for an answering machine. The machine
    puts the marbles in a queue then the user can take a marble and play its message.
    The user can discard the marble afterward, or they can save the marble&#039;s
    message for later. The machine is overall very usable and friendly.
- desc: course syllabus and possible midterm date
- desc: The most important thing that I encountered today is about the syllabus, it
    let me have a better understanding of this course content.
- desc: I encountered the first individual assignment and I feel it will give me more
    insights on UI designs
- desc: Thank you for fixing the syllabus link. It was really helpful since I am still
    not able to attend class.
- desc: Dr. Hepting discussed teaching each In-class group&#039;s part in this session.
    Additionally, four days were proposed for the midterm exam, which will be voted
    on in the UR Course. A discussion followed about the syllabus, assignments, and
    course events with Dr. Hepting. To help better understand user interface design
    heuristics, Dr. Hepting showed a video clip at the end of the presentation.
- desc: I think the most important thing is interaction design. A good or bad design
    can be influence in the usability of things. The design always should inform users
    interactively. Also the design of things should not be complicated to be frustrated
    users of finding goals.
- desc: I got to learn about the mark distribution today and about the marble answering
    machine.
- desc: Today I learned about the syllabus of this course. And also the first individual
    assignment was discussed today in which we have to make a empathy map and activity,
    resources which we have to add as teachers in an experimental course.
- desc: Today we saw video of durell bishop marble answering machine. It was the first
    tangible user interface. The machine spits out a marble each time an incoming
    voice message is recorded. The issue that I saw is that machine does not differentaite
    message for different persons. Thus security could be a prime issue with this
    machine as another person could easily listen to our messages.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss about the dates of midterm exam and watch
    a YouTube video of marbles answering the call. We have seen the video of university
    also and discuss some stuff.
- desc: today is my fourth class, and the professor discussed about the midterm exam
    (provided us different choice of dates for the exam), and the course plan,course
    schedule. I can see how the marks are distributed from this, and I learned how
    the project will involve creating an interface and running tests , and also how
    the mark distribution will take place within groups. The Marble Answering Machine
    by Durrell Bishop, which was projected, was a video explaining the design of the
    machine. Messages can be heard
- desc: Today we discussed about the academic schedule and took a look at the course
    outline and hiding student Id numbers. A brief idea about assignments and projects
    was also given. At last we also saw a video on which a small ball erupts out of
    the telephone with every missed call and it saves the audio message for the person
    after he comes home. After listening he bifurcates the balls according to his
    requirements.
- desc: Today&#039;s lesson is mainly about the choices of time for the mid-term exam,
    as well as class information and assignments
know-more:
- desc: I noticed that the marble phone has several potential design problems.  What
    if a person has r/g colourblindness, and can&#039;t tell two colours of marble
    apart?  What if they have physical conditions that make picking up and placing
    the marbles difficult?  Would there need to be a reminder system if marbles are
    missing for people who can&#039;t remember if they have one on hold?  Would the
    machine have a very small capacity for messages based on the track for the marbles?
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss about the syllabus structure. Professor
    Hepting open the syllabus and Explain about office location and  exams percentage.
    Midterm is of 8% and final exam is of 20%. He will pull an opinion poll of midterm
    dates. Next we watch a youtube video of marble durrell bishop and I would like
    discuss more about this video.
- desc: Converting a PDF graph list to a HTML page possibly with PHP and SQL
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting first we discussed the weightage distribution of\
    \ the course and then we discussed what can be done by the students if the access\
    \ similar to professor is given of the UR-Course. Also few dates were given by\
    \ Dr. Hepting for the midterms and at the last we saw a video called Marble Answering\
    \ Machine, in which it was shown how marbles stored the voice message and how\
    \ it was processed. I would like to know more about how it works."
- desc: We saw a video about the marble answering machine today. I think that machine
    is a good design because it uses everyday objects to convey a message. The user
    can tell how many messages were left, what kind of messages were they and much
    more. Therefore I would like to know about the marble answering machine which
    was discovered by Durrell Bishop.
- desc: Today we started discussing the assignments for the course. I plan to read
    more about them later and am excited to see what is involved.
- desc: To what extent should the visual appeal of an interface be the focus of user
    interaction? Today&#039;s video with the marble answering machine had it using
    a series of marbles to order to regulate the messages on the answering machine.
    Such marbles even though they had a visual appeal presented certain design flaws
    in comparison to a regular button interface like lack of permission and the marbles
    are able to be lost.  When should visuality be more important than functionality?
- desc: I would like to learn more about the Durrell Bishop Answering Machine. We
    watched a video on it but did not have time to discuss
- desc: Today&#039;s class was just about the discussion in regarding the coarse material
    and stuff. Dr.Hepting discussed the mark distribution about the assignments, the
    midterm percentage, and also created a poll for the students to answer on what
    date we would like the midterm to be conducted.  Besides all these in the last
    5 minutes the professor showed the video about the Marble Answering Machines.  Marble
    answering machine  is a prototype telephone answering machine, which shows message
    in the form of marbles.
- desc: Improvements were made to the QR code attendance by increasing the font of
    the password. We watched a short video about the Durrell Bishop marble answering
    machine. It was a demonstration of how a user interacts with the machine. I&#039;d
    like to learn more about how the answering machine exactly works.
- desc: I would like to know more about the midterm contents and mark distribution
    of the exam. The video at the end of the class was difficult for me to understand.
    Would like an explanation for that as well.
- desc: In lecture video about Durrell Bishops answer machine was vague. So, I want
    to know more about it, like why it was developed and how it was developed.
- desc: Marble Answering Machine looks interesting, I would like to know more about
    Marble Answg Machine.
- desc: In todays lecture we discussed about class syllabus, academic schedule and
    Midterm possible days.But where my eyes stuck was on marble answering machine
    by Durrell Bishop how each marbles gets out when calls where received also we
    can listen again with same marble also time notification.I would like too know
    more about that.
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today you showed a video called &amp;quot;Marble Answering
    Machine,&amp;quot; and I am curious to see more of these types of novelties. It
    was an interesting design for a phone. Thanks
- desc: The marble answering machine is something that I never knew. However, I would
    like to learn more about the context of that with design. If I have assumed correctly,
    then it is designed in a self-explanatory way, also with the help of everyday
    objects.
- desc: The most interesting thing I got to know about in todays class is the &#039;Durrell
    Bishop Marble Answer Machine&#039;. I am looking forward to know more about similar
    concepts and how these concepts can affect the way users interact with machines.
- desc: the video that we watched in the class.
- desc: the thing about which I would most like to know more is to learn more about
    the original answering machine design that Bishop made up and how it is considered
    as one of the first tangible user interfaces (TUIs). Also, I would like to know
    more how can Bishop develop the interface of his design. Also, I like to know
    more how the machine spits out a random marble each time an incoming voice message
    and how it is beingis recorded.
- desc: Regarding Durrell Bishop&#039;s Marble Answering Machine, I&#039;m interested
    in knowing what the benefits of this design are over having a regular answering
    machine. I can already tell that it is more costly and less secure than the digital
    type, so there should be some incentive to switch over to his design.
