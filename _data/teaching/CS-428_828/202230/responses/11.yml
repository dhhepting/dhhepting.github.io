difficult:
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand today is the interaction execution
    between user and the object.
- desc: Confused what should we do with the group project still.
- desc: "I would still like to know more about gulfs I\u2019m not able to understand\
    \ clearly also need to know about assignment project."
- desc: Hello Prof. Hepting. First of all, I appreciate your time because, at the
    end of the meeting, my friend and I came to you and shared our idea about having
    an automatic mechanism for attendance, and you kindly shared your thoughts with
    us. In today&#039;s meeting, you talked about the two gulfs of UX design which
    are execution and evaluation, and you explained it with a diagram. Thanks
important:
- desc: The gulf is related to the execution and evaluation of the design. The execution
    is like interaction and the evaluation is like the information. Every design should
    have the value to its user that would be very essential feature. But the design
    should be optimum as per the user requirements that would be very useful for the
    the user to evaluate the product quality. The design should be informative as
    for the all types of the people thus the relative things for the comparatively
    easier to understand.
- desc: We continued discussion about the Norman door and used the Education door
    that Dr. Hepting showed in previous meeting. We discussed the ways to improve
    the door and prevent these issues from happening in the first place. The solutions
    were that we can visualize users using the door and doing test simulations, providing
    clear information and lastly have real users test the door before it is introduced
    to the public.  Then analyse all of these information to decide if it&#039;s a
    good product for the public use.
- desc: To maintain or create a good interface design, we need to ensure that the
    gulf of execution and evaluation should be minimal. The gulf can be minimized
    if we provide less confusing and limited options to the user. We can provide clear
    and concise information to the user and create a testing facility for the beta
    user so that the most accessible options are generated, which was not possible
    earlier. Moreover, analyzing and contextualizing information from the user perspective
    helps maintaining small gulf.
- desc: About the gulf of execution and evaluation, hands on experience as a class
    formulating on those gulfs helped understand how to make use of the premise
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss about the gulfs. How we can decrease
    or minimize gulf. Gulfs have limited option to the user, provide clear and concise
    information, we need to test with real user.
- desc: "Today we explored the concepts of gulfs of a person\u2019s interaction with\
    \ an interface. The two gulfs are evaluation and execution. We also learned how\
    \ if an interface is too specific or too general could impact the gulf of it.\
    \ I thought it was quite interesting as it\u2019s a concept I never thought of\
    \ much when interacting with user interfaces prior to taking this course."
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we discussed about the gulf of evaluation and execution\
    \ and also all the aspects on how we can minimize these gulfs. Concerned was raised\
    \ among the students about how limiting the choice available to user will make\
    \ the UI to understand as well as easy to evaluate. It is important to test and\
    \ analyze the interface when designing the interface."
- desc: "Today we are discussing about How can we decisase or minimize these gulfs?\
    \ limit the options presented to user \uFEFF\uFEFFpronde cleur + concise intormation\
    \ test (with nad user, y \uFEFF\uFEFFanalye intonation \uFEFF\uFEFFcontestinie\

- desc: Today we discussed about minimizing the gulfs
- desc: "The most significant thing I learned today was to minimize the gap between\
    \ the gulf of evacuation and execution in order to enhance the usability of the\
    \ interface by limiting options to the user, providing clear &amp;amp; concise\
    \ info, analyzing and contextializing the info, having visual indicators, following\
    \ industry standards and sticking to what people know. Also, interface metaphors\
    \ could be used to connect users\u2019 prior experience with the concepts in the\
    \ new interface."
- desc: Is how to minimize the gulf and how ED door will not work for everyone.
- desc: 'The most important thing I learned today is how to bridge the gulfs of execution
    and evaluation. There are a few concepts such as: limiting the options presented
    to the user, providing clear and concise information, testing, analyzing information,
    following industry standards, and sticking to what people know to make the experience
    more familiar.'
- desc: "In today\u2019s class we discussed how can we minimize the gulfs of execution\
    \ and evaluation. One of the ways to do that is to follow the industry norms \u2013\
    \ meaning stick to what people already know. People already have a lot of worry\
    \ about in their daily lives so using a website should not add to that. It is\
    \ easy stress-free where even a first-time user can swiftly use the website. The\
    \ design interface should resemble the outside world.Meaning a shopping cart icon\
    \ on Amazon.ca is good design interface feature."
- desc: "After doing some further research, I discovered that in Canada, power door\
    \ operator buttons must be \u201Clocated clear of the door swing, but within 1500\
    \ mm (5 feet) of the door swing\u2019."
- desc: We Spoke more about the Norman doors and a couple of students created a video
    which we saw in class today. We wondered if the door was automatic? We again spoke
    about the gulfs of execution and evaluation, and how these gulfs can be minimized.
    limit options, provie concise info, test real users, analyze infor contextualize
    info and look for visual indicators.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is that in order to understand what
    the users view as common knowledge, it&#039;s a good idea to perform tests with
    real users.
- desc: The most important that I learned today is mental models
- desc: The concept I learned today about evaluation and execution was something I
    never thought about. I wanted to add a point to making an efficient design is
    &amp;quot;Keep user in mind&amp;quot;. I think that is one of the most important
    things to build a better design. I would like to get more information on the midterm
    syllabus
- desc: In the diagram drawn in class today with a user and a computer, there is an
    interaction/execution from user to the computer, and from computer to user, there
    is an evaluation/information. In between the user and computer device, there is
    gulf which afftects the interaction between the two.
- desc: In order to minimize the interaction and evaluation gulfs, we must limit the
    options provided to the user, analyze information, provide clear and concise information,
    test with real users, and contextualize information.
- desc: Actually, monitor rotating was for watching the paper size document at once
    without scrolling!!
- desc: I agree that the monitor partially blocks the ports for the connections but
    they are located at the back so that the wires do not interfere with the user
    and for appearance as well. For the ED door, I agree that the automatic sign is
    confusing. I think it is referring to the handicap button function but it should
    be more clear. I think providing clear and concise instructions is the most effective
    way to minimize the gulf between user and computer interfaces.
- desc: I learned some of the concepts of making the gulf of execution and evaluation
    closer to each other.
- desc: In the 11th session, Dr. Hepting talked about the importance of industry standards
    and that a designer should stick to people&#039;s knowledge. After that, we discussed
    how we could decrease or minimize the Gulfs like limit the options presented to
    a user, providing clear info, testing, etc. In the end, I asked a question about
    what is the best way to skip the QR/Code for attendance in each class at University.
    Dr. Hepting raised some issues that can be concerning to solve this problem.
- desc: Today in the class I learned about the ways we could bring the gulfs between
    user and computer closer. It can be done by limiting thr options presented to
    the user, provide clear and consice information, analyse information and by following
    industry standards.
- desc: "Two of the many challenges people must overcome to successfully interact\
    \ with design are Evaluation and Execution. The first one is understanding the\
    \ state of the system and the second one is taking action to accomplish a specific\
    \ goal. These challenges are the \u201Cgulf of evaluation\u201D and the \u201C\
    gulf of execution\u201D. It is so important how we can decrease these gulfs. limiting\
    \ the options, prividing clear information, testing with real users and also analyzing\
    \ information are the parameters which are so important."
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture we learned a lot about the Gulf of Execution and Gulf
    of Evaluation. The thing that stood out to me was about referring to &#039;push
    button&#039; doors as automatic because when we talk about automatic doors, I
    straight up think about not having to do anything to enter through the doors.
- desc: Today we learnt how can we minimize gulfs. We learnt how limited options and
    providing correct information helps. I would also want to learn more how user
    friendliness can be achieved .
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we discuss about the gulf points how to minimize it
    with  proper explanation and important things.
- desc: The most important thing I learned in today lecture is how can we decrease
    gulfs? I learned this goal can be achievable if we are successful in providing
    clear and concise information with analyzing information before been presented
    and the presented information should contain just limited options which we provide
    to user to avoid confusion. Following this steps can help to minimize gulfs.
- desc: "In today\u2019s class I learned about the different metaphors which we can\
    \ do for attendance such as signing in, participation awards, fingerprint sensor.\
    \ And also learned about the size of the doors."
- desc: started by wishing us all a happy Monday, connected a loose cable to the classroom
    monitor, where the port is actually partially blocked by the monitor stand, discussed
    norman doors, addressed how important it is to form groups and how sharing ideas
    within those groups is important, and asked how we can we minimize the gulf.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is various ways of minimizing
    the gulf between execution and evaluation. The most significant point I could
    realize that if the user is being displayed minimum options, then they will have
    not much options but the correct one. Hence, the gulf can be decreased. Also,
    there are other ways to minimize the gulf which were discussed in the class.
- desc: Today we checked attendance and then discussed how we could reduce or minimize
    guls?Limit the comments submitted to users, provide clear + unambiguous information,
    and test with real users.
- desc: Today we went ahead with the theory part and had fruitfull discussions with
    the professor and each other .
- desc: Today, we talked about the gulf of evaluation and execution and what we can
    do to minimize/decrease these gulfs. There was consensus among the students that
    limiting the options presented would make the interface easy to learn and evaluate.
    If the user is presented with various options without clear or concise information
    about each, it will be difficult to understand the major purpose of this interface.
    When designing any interface, always test them with primary end-users and analyze
    the information.
- desc: The factors to keep in mind while designing the interface especially the ones
    for specially challenged people, as today in class it was discussed that the time
    it may take an automated door to be kept open for a person in a wheel-chair. I
    had never thought in this way, so it was really good aspect of designing that
    I came to know today. so, the standard measures can be a guideline to keep little
    details in mind.
- desc: How to minimize the gulfs.
- desc: Tricky doors would be a disaster for users, especially for the people in priority
    needs. Good design of the input icon for monitors would be some corresponding
    color and recognizable shapes. Good designs would be straight-forward to the users
    and no confusion in any cases.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is about the gulfs and how we can
    analyse and test the information being provided to minimize the gulfs and also
    that we can do so by limit the options presented to the user. Also, we learned
    about the usefulness of the educations building door and how is it not really
    efficient for the people who use wheelchairs.
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we mainly discussed related contents of group and Mental
    Models.
- desc: The most important thing brought to mind today is to keep in mind that not
    everyone has the same experiences as me when designing an interface. Even if I
    fixed all of the issues with the ED door that bothered me, it still wouldn&#039;t
    be a good design because people who use wheelchairs would still have trouble with
    the door.
know-more:
- desc: Gulfs of execution and evaluation - How are we getting that information?
- desc: How does one consider the balance between a reliable interface in a practical
    interface? Todays discussion was still on the Gulf of execution and evaluation
    and i&#039;d like to know more about the design process of keeping them balanced.
    Also what is the consqieunce of removing features to minimize gulf? If the goal
    is not to emphasize details why not remove the barriers/features enitrely instead
    of just the options where they are not needed (i.e certain interior doors not
    having much use in the first place)?
- desc: I would like to know more about decreasing and minimizing gulfs
- desc: The discussion about the execution and evaluation of how the communication
    takes place among the humans and the machines via the gulf which is also called
    the distance between the computer screen and the humans was a good one. There
    is tons of information that needs to be explored and would like to dig more into
    the depth of how this works for the user and computer interactions so that it
    would be really helpful in the research for this course project. It can really
    enhance the interactive thinking ability.
- desc: We discussed about the ways to minimize the confusion which user faces and
    the possible ways to provide better solution.
- desc: Additional way, other than discussed in class that can be used to decrease
    the  Gulf.
