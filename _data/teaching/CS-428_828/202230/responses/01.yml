difficult:
- desc: I missed the meeting today because of COVID-19 but I can make the next class
    on wednesday
- desc: I learned about planning, course evaluation, and break rooms in the first
    lecture. Overall, the lecture is interesting, and I&#039;m looking forward to
    the upcoming ones.
important:
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand was what was happening on the
    projector.  I could not see what was being done to navigate between pages or where
    information was coming from.  Hopefully in the future, the page can be full screen,
    and the password for attendance can be written with a larger font.  Hopefully
    the microphone will also work in future meetings, as I could barely hear parts
    of the explanations .
- desc: Actually I came to classroom, You introduced yourself to us, we understand
    that this course is between undergraduate and graduate students. After introducing
    with professor and his course, we understand after this class we have time before
    11:59 P.M to do assignment and submit it to urcource university of regina, Most
    important and interesting that is this course is about UI UX design and I love
    that. I understand we have midterm and Project that we do as a team work.
- desc: Today we discussed course outlines, midterm, final exam and also discussed
    about marking criteria and etc.
- desc: "The most important thing I\u2019d learnt today, was to be observant about\
    \ various interfaces in my surroundings and to be aware about the same. Furthermore,\
    \ I\u2019d learnt that I\u2019ve to think critically and improvise on the interfaces\
    \ as well; and most importantly, to not work on the basis of assumptions. These\
    \ learnings were supplemented with an illustration of fish in the water, learning\
    \ about their surroundings and understanding about the same. Besides this, there\
    \ was a SKYNET reference, with regards to the advanc"
- desc: A good start in making a user interface is to look at how people interact
    with your software and what you can do to make that interaction better. Depending
    on your environment, you should observe if making something better means adaptability
    to screen sizes, less user input from point A to b, or a more minimalist design.
    A good user interface helps the customers complete their goals efficiently for
    said environment.
- desc: The outline and class topic
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in today&#039;s class is the Syllabus,
    let me understand the class content.
- desc: Today was the first of class. There were not much dept in the discussion other
    than going over the syllabus of the class, professor&#039;s website and some introductory
    topics about human computer communication. We have been given some ideas as to
    what human computer communication is about.
- desc: "I would like to know more about group projects and assignments. Also, I am\
    \ confused about what \u201CClass Wiki\u201D section will be used for."
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today was the course syllabus. I learned
    what the course is about and the grading scheme. I was glad to learn that there
    is a project in this class with a midterm.
- desc: I was unable to attend class because my flight was canceled due to the COVID-19
    infection in my family.
- desc: The most important thing i learned today was how to use the UR Courses homepage
    for this class. The other important things I learned was how to use the attendance
    system so that I can get my attendance marks. The other important thing I learned
    was how to respond to the meeting questions. This has allowed me to write these
    messages.
- desc: "* Introduction to course CS 828+428 and Syllabus\_     * Dr. Hepting talked\
    \ about the importance of midterm and why it would be better to have midterm alongside\
    \ the final rather than only the final exam.     * Intro to the Dr. Hepting website\_\
    \     * Talking about the groups for assignments and class discussions     * Position\
    \ of HCC in the road map of learning Human-Computer Interaction"
- desc: In the first session of the class, I learnt that this class would be about
    interaction design. It is the way to satisfy people to use program and how to
    make them better. It was explained about J.C.R. Licklider who worked in how human
    mind and computer work together and make the decision making better. Also, some
    pages in the UR courses were explained. Furthermore, it is introduced Dr. Hepting&#039;s
    email and website. Midterm, class content, doing groups and final exam were explained.
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture was super fun. We got introduction of the course and
    what to expect from his course. Dr. Hepting got us familiar with his website/URCourses
    and things we need to pay attention to. I really enjoyed it. The thing that I
    liked most is the way Dr. Hepting makes meetings fun and enjoyable.
- desc: Today was just the introduction of the course. We went through the syllabus
    and some inspirational quotes. Also at the end of the class we had a discussion
    about Midterms. So I think it will be a good class to attend. Looking forward
    to it.
- desc: Today in class I learned about the syllabus. We learned some stuff also and
    we heard a joke of fish that was funny. The behaviour of our professor is also
    very funny and I find it cute also. I feel like learning with Dr heating will
    be fun!
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today&#039;s class was the first one, and you generally
    introduced us to the course. The important thing I noticed was having just a midterm
    exam instead of a final one, which is good. I am looking forward to participating
    in this class. Thanks
- desc: What stood out today was how much human communication can resemble TCP vs
    UDP. At the beginning of class you began writing (ie. &amp;quot;sending&amp;quot;)
    vital information regarding the next 14 weeks - your name, the number/section
    of the class, the attendance password. Before long it crossed your mind that simply
    writing these things down on the board was essentially UDP protocol for humans
    - and you switched to TCP by asking everyone if they had received your package
    (to which you got a sluggish but affirmative response
- desc: I have learned information in the syllabus today, and I have got some basic
    ideas about this class and some knowledge about human-computer communication,
    hope we will have a good semester.
- desc: "Today was the first day of class so it was mostly just an introduction to\
    \ the layout of the course. We mainly discussed Dr. Hepting\u2019s website and\
    \ how to get in touch if we need, as well as a little bit of a URCourses tour."
know-more:
- desc: "I have learned about course outlines and exams today. This subject will be\
    \ fascinating, and I hope to acquire the best possible knowledge about how to\
    \ interact with different systems through the user interface. While going through\
    \ today\u2019s lecture, I learned about different ways the course can be more\
    \ exciting and interactive, but I think this is also a way of knowing how we can\
    \ cope with computer technology."
- desc: Sorry Professor, I couldn&#039;t attend today&#039;s lecture but I would like
    to know about what was discussed.
- desc: "As today was the very first class, there was not much to discuss about the\
    \ class topic itself. However, based on the class description, I am most excited\
    \ to learn about user interface design. As the \u201Cmiddle man\u201D between\
    \ a user and the computer, a good user interface is a very important aspect of\
    \ technology. As such, I would very much like to learn more about this aspect\
    \ of computer science especially since I feel like I have not learned a lot about\
    \ this topic yet in my studies."
- desc: I would like to know more about the assignments and projects. I would like
    to know how many of them we will have, the grade weight of each, and a rough deadline
    for each. I like to plan for assessments early and complete them early as well.
    I would also like to know more about the research credit, as I am interested in
    research. I would also like to know what the requirements for this research credit
    is. Lastly, I would like to know about the midterm and its weight, which I believe
    will be discussed later.
- desc: "After today\u2019s class, I would love to know more about what kind of assignments\
    \ will we have and also what kinds of topics will we learn during this course."
- desc: What is the project worth 40% about? Based on looking at other items on URCourses
    it will be a group project based on the bit in participation on &amp;quot;rating
    group members&amp;quot; and the 20% above it being &amp;quot;Individual Assignments&amp;quot;.
    It wasn&#039;t discussed today so I&#039;d like to know more about the structure
    of it as&amp;quot;Project as Assignments&amp;quot; indicates its layered.
- desc: As talked in the class about wallpaper group, it intrigued me a lot to know
    and learn more about the concept. I would love to take that class and learn about
    the structure and formations within the seventeen wallpaper groups and their similarities
    and differences. Concepts like this excite me and learning about their compositions
    and structure is very satisfying.
- desc: Today&#039;s class was just about the course objectives and the introduction.
    The professor introduced himself, although I already took a class with before
    with Dr. Hepting and indeed I must admit that he is an amazing professor. I would
    like to know a lot about the human computer communication and how humans and machines
    interact with each other. What are the different technologies that are responsible
    in creating these bonds and the consequences of these interactions. Whether it
    is a boon or a bane?
- desc: I would really like to know more about the format of the upcoming assignments/projects
    and the things we are going to learn over the period of next months. Topics we
    are going to cover every week until the end of semester. This would better help
    me understand and plan ahead of what will I be doing. So, I can manage my time
    efficiently.
- desc: I would like to know more about the assignments and what will they be based
    on. Plus the introduction was informative looking forward to this semester.
- desc: The topics that will be covered in this class (regarding user interface design)
    seem interesting and I would like to learn and know more about them.
- desc: Since it was the first class, I am looking forward to know what this course
    has to offer.
- desc: Glide reflections and other interaction designs that are being used.
- desc: Today was the first day of classes and we went over the class martials and
    how the class will be formed and what will learn in this class. I would like to
    know more about the class syllabus and the midterm and the assignments.
