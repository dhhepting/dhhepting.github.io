difficult:
- desc: While I understand wanting feedback, providing a written evaluation form alongside
    our written midterm is a major ethics problem.  There is a reason course evaluations
    are done at the end of term, on an anonymous website, and not made available to
    an instructor until grades are in.  To use a metaphor, writing an evaluation alongside
    your midterm is like being forced to say things you don&#039;t believe while someone
    threatens to break something important to you.
important:
- desc: This is our midterm exam date. Question was good and I have tried to all the
    answer of each questions.
- desc: Today we had our midterm so we learned nothing new but we were evaluated on
    things that we had learned so far. The midterm was not hard but with a tricky
    question regarding what is one exam question that needs recall rather than recognize.
- desc: I have learned today, how the ten heuristics for user centric interface design
    can be related to reduce the gulf of execution and evaluation.
- desc: No class. Midterm.
- desc: Questions can be made from any topic that is discussed and there is no specific
    template for questions
- desc: We had our midterm today and submitted a feedback as well.
- desc: Today was the midterm. I feel like it went well.
- desc: The most important thing for me to understand on the midterm was the last
    question; the question made you choose two heuristics for each gulf; so two heuristics
    for the gulf of execution and two heuristics for the gulf of evaluation.
- desc: Midterm exam
- desc: I took the midterm
- desc: We had our midterm exam today. It went pretty well.
- desc: There was nothing that has been discussed in today&#039;s class because we
    had a midterm.
- desc: A metaphor does not use the word &amp;quot;like&amp;quot; in the statement.
    Example a is b.

- desc: Today we mainly have the midterm exam
know-more:
- desc: Midterm day!!!
- desc: I would like to know more the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design,
    and how each fall under a gulf of execution and evaluation. Do all of the 10 Usability
    Heuristics for User Interface Design fall under a specific gulf, or can it overlap?
- desc: Now that I have given the midterm, I would like to know how did I do on it.
    When will we be
- desc: What makes a good testing interface? Writing today&#039;s in-person midterm
    had me reflecting on educational software. Softwares like proctortrack provide
    security as a trade-off for user experience. Gulf of evaluation is also important
    as you have to account for the many devices and environments one takes the exam
    in. Can an interface of testing software be created to allow large exams to be
    done online or has the pandemic proved interfaces with e-exams do not support
    learning well enough to use?
- desc: Today was the midterm exam but the thing I would like to know more is what
    we are learning next chapter.
- desc: Why we are always trying to distinguish usability and UX.
- desc: I would love to know how I did on the midterm. I feel pretty good about it
    though.
