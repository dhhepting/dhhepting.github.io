difficult:
- desc: While the marble answering machine displays a nice idea of familiarity and
    potential ease of use, I&#039;m not sure why it is offered as an example of &amp;quot;good
    design&amp;quot; in a modern sense.  While it might have been relevant 20 years
    ago, nowadays the very idea of it is inferior to any current technology we have.  When
    I see this design, it just reminds me of the spectacular failure of Microsoft
    Bob.
- desc: The number of people in my group that didn&#039;t know what an answering machine
    is or its purpose
- desc: Todays Class was just about the discussion from the previous sessions in which
    the professor had shown the video about the marble answering machine where the
    marbles were being used to transfer the messages and today we actually had a discussion
    about it in the groups in class. It was a good discussion. We were being asked
    to discuss about &amp;quot;what is good about the design and the value of the
    design and can we apply those concepts in the modern world etc.&amp;quot; I want
    to know more about it.
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand was the fact that this is somehow
    more efficient than a normal answering machine or even a web interface. Mostly
    since I was born during the internet age and I don&#039;t know of a time when
    the internet didn&#039;t exist.
- desc: The way marble answering machine works. I think the only good thing about
    the machine is we can choose which message we want to hear and skip.Unlike the
    ones on these days where we have to hear every message as there is no way to skip.
- desc: For todays lecture most difficult thing I encountered was a question related
    to Durrell Answer machine. The question was &amp;quot;what is the value of this
    design ?&amp;quot;.  I was not able to understand the meaning of question.
important:
- desc: Marble answering machine has the modern implementation of the voice main answering
    service in the mobile phone. It is asynchronous communication for the medium of
    exchange. So it is very important for the people who we are trying to find for
    a certain period of the time but we can not find that person as our expected time.
    We can also see the email commutation which has the written but the voice communication
    has the audio. So it is also important for the people whom are blind and can not
    read or write.
- desc: 'We continued our discussion regarding Marble Answering Machine by Durrell
    Bishop and discussed how good of a design it was for its time. Easy and simple
    to use being one of it&#039;s best future as new phones these days too complex
    for elderly and people with disabilities (eg. Blind people). However the downside
    of the phone being is: lack of security causes less privacy as anyone who has
    access to the marbles can access your voicemails which sometimes can contain private
    and personal information. easy to lose a'
- desc: Today in class, we expanded on the marble voicemail video we watched on Friday.
    By getting together in groups, I was able to see some other flaws or benefits
    of the marble voicemail system that members of my group pointed out that I was
    not able to notice on my own.
- desc: I understood the value of implementing knowledge of regular physical activities
    into the design process, bearing the user in mind, thus enhancing the UX and the
    usability of the product. The proposed user&#039;s location of use, identity and
    age group are also crucial to the design process. Lastly, the product must be
    simple, elegant and enjoyable to use, while ensuring the privacy of the users
    interacting with it.
- desc: The important thing I encountered today was the useful concepts of the marble
    machine. Even though the machine has many limits (such as the number of marbles,
    and the likelihood of losing marbles), the machine does give the idea of using
    an array for choosing voicemails, instead of the queue which we see in many voicemail
    systems these days. An array approach would very useful for some users, especially
    offices and big organizations who will receive many voicemails.
- desc: 'Today my group members and I discussed the positives about the marble answering
    machine: it has tactile design, there is a visual indication of the number of
    voice mails, it is intuitive, physically strong structure, different colors of
    marbles for different voice messages. One feature that could be implemented in
    today&#039;s voice mailing system is labelling and organization of voice messages.'
- desc: The most important thing I encountered today was in our group discussions.
    The Marble Answering Machine has some good features; you can play your messages
    in any order. You can place the marbles on your phone to call back instantly.
    The machine is overall simple and easy to understand. However, it would be very
    ineffective in practice since the marbles can easily get lost, and the amount
    of physical storage for your saved voicemails can build up.
- desc: watched video and group discuss
- desc: The most important thing that I encountered today is the group discuss
- desc: During group discussions, some useful features of the marble answering machine
    were identified such as ease of use and interactive design. Potential problems
    were identified as well such as loss of information from losing the marbles and
    privacy issues. I don&#039;t use the voice mail system much but labelling the
    message for intended receiver on a shared voice mail system would be useful if
    this feature does not exist already.
- desc: It gave me an opportunity to think about the pros and cons of voice messages.
    It doesn&#039;t send voice mail well. I prefer text messages. This is because,
    while voice allows for more subtle emotional transfer, noise can make it difficult
    to understand exactly what is being said, which is imprecise. It should be converted
    directly to text through speech recognition so that the sender can confirm and
    send it. This will bring the benefits of both voice and text messaging.
- desc: "In this session, the first individual assignment was postponed. Once again\
    \ Dr. Hepting played the Marble answering machine video. After that, he asked\
    \ us to discuss 3 questions in class groups. What\u2019s good about the &amp;quot;Marble\
    \ Answering Machine Design&amp;quot; and what is the value? The last question\
    \ was about the tangible user interface and integration to current voice mail\
    \ systems that had been discussed in our group."
- desc: The new thing for me was to know if a possible marble machine existed and
    there could be a lot of advantages like easy to use, interactive, tangible and
    buttonless. This type of machine could be really helpful for elderly people or
    people with disabilities
- desc: "This answering Machine uses some simple objects that indicate simply how\
    \ many messages have been left. It is not complicated and it has just one step\
    \ to perform task. It is simple so that it is perfect for all people with any\
    \ ability (Good design and value). RFID tags can help this answering machine to\
    \ be modern. Also, privacy should be considered in this design so that everybody\
    \ cannot listen to the other\u2019s messages."
- desc: The most interesting thing I encountered in todays meeting was that the messages
    left on the marble answering machine can be in any order. The messages are not
    heard in order. It allows efficiency.
- desc: What good about the design? The marbles come out in order. And requires one
    step action to perform steps.   What is the value of the design? It uses physical
    objects which and we can see the number of voicemails we have.   Concepts from
    the video in modern voice mail system? We can listen to the voicemails multiple
    times.
- desc: Working of marble answering machine.
- desc: "started with happy monday and discussed about the first individual assignment\
    \ and\_group project, asked for requests to be sent this week, added a new feature\
    \ called in-class group discussion chat to urcourses, and with this option one\

- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today we had our group discussion and discussed how we
    could use marble answering machine concepts in new voicemail systems. We thought
    we could use the air tag idea to implement the concept of the marble machine.
    Thanks
- desc: 'By scrutinizing the three questions, I was able to encounter one of the most
    important things: We can implement one of the fucntionalities of marble answering
    machine in current voicemail system. We can have an option of listening to the
    voicemail received in a particular timeframe.'
- desc: Today we checked to see if anyone was absent, then watched the video and had
    a group discussion about how the design was, whether it had any use, and what
    we could use it for
- desc: discussions were held about the first indivisual assignment and also a group
    discussion about the video that we saw.
- desc: The functions of marble answering machine and how we can use this basic idea
    in voice mail. Like auto dial facility can be used from that old idea into new
    voice mail systems.
- desc: Disscussed about an updated design for voice mail application.
- desc: the most important thing that I encountered that the marbles answering machines
    that can be tangible which mean it could provides the value of the physical interaction
    and performance can actually interact with marbles physically. Also, buttonless
    could encapsulates the intuitive aspect of the device as there are no buttons
    or displays.
know-more:
- desc: "I most important thing I want to know more from today\u2019s class that how\
    \ an old concept can be applied to fill up the loopholes for now a days service.\
    \ Some devices from earlier days can be outdated today, but in terms of logic\
    \ and effectiveness they can perform best if they can be updated. Today I have\
    \ gone through how the concepts of marble answering machine can be applied into\
    \ our today\u2019s voice mail system. In the similar way we can think of some\
    \ other technologies too."
- desc: In today&#039;s class professor played a video on marble answering machine.
    It can be used in voicemail mailing systems. I would like to know more about this.
- desc: During group discussion we only focused on positive aspects of the marble
    answering machine from the textbook however I really wanted to trash talk it and
    bring up negatives
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss about machine working flow. The good
    things about machine learning is that it is interactive and easy to use. It help
    the blind people to identify physical things.  In this process no manual is need.
    I would like to learn more about this topic.
- desc: In todays lecture we did a group activity where we discussed about the video
    we watched previous class which was about &amp;quot;Marvel Answering Machine&amp;quot;.
    The most important features that I noticed which are kind of useful are the user
    friendly and easy to learn. And the thing that I want to see in the new answering
    machines is that it would be great if it is possible to share that marble so that
    it is easy to share, also it would be great if it had password so that no stranger
    can access the information.
- desc: I would like to know the design concepts of the marbel answering machine which
    we looked over today in the class
- desc: Should interfaces have an acceptible level of difficulty? With the ball voicemail
    system it provided ease of use in order to receive and look at your messages.
    With such a system however one might argue for how it might hinder the use of
    the system. Voicemails can contain vital information so casualizing the interaction
    might make the response to the information less important to the user. However
    by being easy it might help notify users quicker to specific vital information.
    What is the correct balance?
- desc: I would like to know more about the design concepts about the answering machine
    viewed in the class.
- desc: The idea of the marble answering machine and how it had some important features
    such as being user firendly and easy to learn. There are some other features that
    I would like to see in modern answering machines, such as segregation of the voice
    notes based on a tag, portability in the sense that I can send/give the voice
    note to anyone for listening, etc. I will read more into this and if I find some
    good content, I&#039;ll also update the Class Wiki.
