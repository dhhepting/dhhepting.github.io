difficult:
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we saw the confusion between push and pull for doors
    and what&#039;s more confusing than understanding is using it. I personally have
    pushed the door when it said pull and vise versa but the one thing that these
    doors can be neatral and open both ways which is what we don&#039;t see anywhere.
    All doors are either push or pull otherwise if a door works both ways it wouldn&#039;t
    create so much confusion for people.
- desc: What makes &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; user interfaces a thing? When considering
    the bad doors video, there are a lot of doors that are confusing to use called
    Norman doors and points out their commodity. When considering it in relation to
    interfaces, both have similarities in the production phase. Both a door and an
    interface would have to have had an approval process but why doesn&#039;t that
    process &amp;quot;sniff&amp;quot; out obvious design flaws that would prevent
    you from using the product correctly? How do companies generally test interfaces?
- desc: It&#039;s about to fly now. I can join the class soon. BTW, I cannot access
    to the syllabus link. Am I the only one having that kind of problem?
- desc: It was kind of hard to hear from the back. Also It is kind of hard for me
    to understand the class orientation and what the things we need to submit/learn?
important:
- desc: The most important lesson for me today was that when we design something we
    have to be mindful of our design. Like the example from the video in the class
    our design should make sense and people should be able to use it easily without
    any issue and need of written instruction; for example if a door needs to be pushed
    we should not install a handle as it will have the opposite response from the
    end user as they will think it needs to be pulled.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today about the ease of usability of a
    design. The design can be well equipped, but if it does not comfort the user,
    it will be a bad design. There was a difficulty in understanding the QR code for
    attendees, which was resolved. Then I learned about Norman&#039;s door. The video
    about it reflects how bad design can be. Make user puzzled is not the goal of
    user-centric design.
- desc: Staring at a QR code for thirty minutes made me reflect on how a feature that
    should have a positive change on user experience, such as easier attendance, can
    be anchored into a negative experience when it is overshadowed by other significant
    negative experiences, such as no syllabus or assignment information being posted.
- desc: I taught the professor about dev tools in web browsers to modify the layout
    of the QR code page for attendance
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss about the group formation. In which group
    what people are involve. We also discuss about the QR scan for attendance, it
    could be better.
- desc: "I was really interested in learning about Norman Doors. It is interesting\
    \ how something that seems rather insignificant such as the design of a door handle\
    \ can have an impact on a person\u2019s experience using that device/object. These\
    \ are important things that a designer can easily misunderstand."
- desc: Some classes insist on placing students into teams
- desc: The most important concept learned today is the Norman door concept. Many
    items that we use everyday are not designed with a human centered design (user
    experience in mind). Therefore, we run into many inconveniences which can be easily
    avoided (such as push/pull doors). An ideal design is one where the user is immersed
    and is not reminded that he is using an interphase. For example, if there is a
    door that is easily operated from both sides, we will not be reminded that we
    are using a door because our shor
- desc: "In class today we saw Don Norman\u2019s video on bad doors. This video cleared\
    \ up the definition of good design when he said that when a person going through\
    \ a door should not feel like a task but an involuntary activity. So a good design\
    \ at the least should be intuitive."
- desc: In Today&#039;s meeting we encountered a video about the Human Centered Design,
    and the example we used was that of a Door, A bad door is that which has a handle
    (used to pull), that requires us to push the door. Using a handle to push the
    door is just uncanny. Don Norman was the speaker who says that its not us, its
    the door. A door that does not need a sign is an ideal door. Example, push a door
    without it saying &#039;Push&#039;.
- desc: The most important thing I encountered today is the idea of obvious design.
    The Norman door video showed that if you make a door with a pull handle, the door
    should open through pulling. If the handle is just a flat surface, the door should
    open through a push. In a user-interface setting, obvious design features increase
    usability and help people instantly understand what the functions do.
- desc: The way that today&#039;s attendence password changed has let me have a better
    understanding of how design pattens can improve user experiences.
- desc: Made a tentcard, the design issue about the attendance page
- desc: Today I learned about how a human-centered interface helps people to enjoy
    the use of an object better. In class we had the example of doorknobs. Had they
    applied a human centered design to the doorknobs, it would have been easier to
    use. I also learned about what aspects of human centered design are the most important.
- desc: "Happy Wednesday too. In this session you talked about the re grouping and\
    \ asked us to write our name on the paper desk name. The next concept you Talked\
    \ about was Norman Door that accompany with a great video clip. A Norman door\
    \ is a poorly designed door that confuses or fails to give you an idea whether\
    \ to push or pull. It was named after\_Don Norman, the author of\_The Design of\
    \ Everyday Things\_which explored the phenomenon."
- desc: I thought the explanation I encountered today in terms of design of doors
    was certainly very interesting to know. How Don Norman changed how everyone thinks
    about design. It was an interesting thing to learn about today.
- desc: We submitted our attendance by scanning QR code in UR course and then we wrote
    our names on the special papers which were put on the table. The short video about
    designing was shown. It was named &amp;quot;Norman Door&amp;quot;. Don Norman
    was a professor and he started complaining about doors. He believed that Doors
    shouldn&#039;t need instructions. The shape of them can guide you through just
    fine. Why do doors need instruction? Don Norman thought about, and wrote the book
    and he changed the world.
- desc: The video we watched today regarding doors was very relatable. The most important
    thing I encountered was the logic behind opening doors. I guess I never thought
    about it but it makes sense for the push door to have flat handles and pull door
    to have handles because in the end its all about convinience.
- desc: "Today I learned about the interface . The first example was of the Attendance\
    \ password which has a very small area for letters and the qr code was good enough\
    \ to scan. The second thing which I learned today was about the bad doors. I learned\
    \ that the doors doesn\u2019t have to be complex and you should not think about\
    \ push and pull and just go through the door. I saw a video about the bad doors."
- desc: By visiting Norman&#039;s Door idea I understood that it is very important
    to design anything keeping Psychology of human in mind.
- desc: Today is the third meeting of our class where we discuss about the groups
    and attendance code and then we watch a YouTube video related to doors and I think
    we will discuss something related to this in our next class.
- desc: In todays class Dr Hepting headed up with new way to remember Names of the
    students by giving each of them with papers and fold it as if he can see the name
    you want to call by on our tables.We also discuss about the new style for meeting
    passwords with QR code that would directly fill up the code and redirect on URcourses
    adding up to that we have checked names of our class groups and verified.
- desc: It&#039;s not you Bad doors are every where. ), a clip about the confusing
    doors, was projected by the professor during the class. Pushing or pulling to
    open the door often causes confusion among people. I learned about good and bad
    design through this, such as how locking doors can cause confusion while trying
    to lock various types of doors.In upcoming lectures, I want to learn more about
    good and bad designs.
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today you showed us the video of Norman doors which was
    related to the design of doors, and It was an excellent example for me to understand
    how much the design of an interface is essential for the users with this example.
    Also, we talked about the design of the QR code page of URcourses, which was good
    practice for understanding a good design for me. Thanks
- desc: Today saw a good example of one of the important designing problem in daily
    life but getting overlooked. The pull or push option on doors are
- desc: Today we wrote our business cards, then we divided into groups, then we learned
    about QR codes, how to quickly submit our attdence, then we watched the norman
    door video, and learned about norman door news and insights.
- desc: today was my first day in class as i had registered late for  the subject.
    we scanned the qr code for attendence and professor hepting explained why recording
    attendence with qr code was more reliable than manually typing the password. we
    also saw a video of human centric designs on the basis of the principles of discoverability
    and feedback like the doors should have flat plates instead of handles so there
    is no confusion about pushing and pullling
- desc: 'How bad and good designs that we come across in day-to-day life are being
    ignored or goes unnoticed, until brought to note like the Norman doors! I also
    have faced trouble with the doors in malls and kept waiting because it said &amp;quot;Automatic:
    caution&amp;quot; but didn&#039;t open on its own.  This subject will teach more
    observation skills.'
- desc: I totally agree with the concept of Norman doors being a fault of the design
    and not of the human using the doors. It&#039;s important that the products we
    design make people&#039;s lives easier, and not become a source of frustration
    (as seen with the office door shown in the video).
know-more:
- desc: Today we discussed about bad doors also called as Norman doors. And a question
    arises that human centered design is important or people centered design is important?
- desc: So in today meeting first we were provided a piece of paper to write our names
    so that Dr. Hepting can know us all by names and then we watched the video of
    Norman Doors. Basically, Norman doors are the doors which are confusing to use
    for example while using doors in any entrance it is of a commonsense that the
    doors will be generally opening by pushing them but instead we have to pull them
    which creates the chaos.
- desc: Today we watch video from YouTube that about design and the guy was Desiger
    in England and apple he talked about design he loves design and before that we
    watch this video we write out name on the paper and And we put it in front of
    the table.
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more about the real world applications of interaction
    design principles. My curiosity in this aspect sparked from the Norman Doorman
    video.
- desc: I would like to see the concept of norman door in design principles related
    to software and computer applications and also how to resolve the issues.
- desc: Today lecture was an interesting one as we saw a video about the Norman door.
    The Norman Door is the one where the design tells you to do the opposite. It talks
    about the principle of Discoverability. It talks about the ability of how simple
    things work and we our incapable if discovering it. The video was literally amazing
    as it talks about how simple things can even get overcomplicated for the users
    to use. So I would like to know more about the principles and application of how
    I can utilize them.
- desc: "We discussed about interface involving the QR code for attendance. Some of\
    \ the findings were that it does not work well for students sitting near the back\
    \ of the class. Some potential improvements were displaying instruction on the\
    \ screen and bigger QR code. It was also beneficial to receive feedback from the\
    \ students. I\u2019d like to learn more about interface testing."
- desc: I have learnt today about the norman doors through a video which discusses
    how important it is to consider user experience in designing products. I would
    like to learn more about the design methodologies
- desc: The Norman&#039;s Door concept was very intriguing. So, I really want to know
    more about the Psychology behind the designing concepts and therefor I am searching
    for the book by Norman to understand more about this.
- desc: Discussed about UR Course class information and Breakroom Groups.
- desc: the thing about which I would most like to know more is why the designers
    do not really satisfy what users need. In other words why do users need to struggle
    to perform simple tasks. For example, the video we watched today in the class,
    illustrated that simple design such as doors make it too difficult and confusing
    to the users to use. Which needs clear instructions o make it easy.
