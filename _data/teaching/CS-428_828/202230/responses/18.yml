difficult:
- desc: It is really hard to get the direction for how to study.
- desc: The hardest thing to wrap my head around is the metaphor for the midterm exam,
    so I&#039;ll probably have to practice that at home
important:
- desc: The most important thing that the midterm exam and the topics of the midterm
    exam has been discussed today. The reference book chapter 1 to chapter 4 and the
    class discussion topics like Norman door, Marvell ball answering, gulf execution
    and evaluation and so on. So the preparation for the midterm exam is important.
- desc: Today we learned that the interface could be a metaphor for a bridge which
    is used so a user can accomplish a task. Dr. Hepting also provided info about
    midterm and what to expect. It will be from chapter 1 - 4 and we have a time limit
    of 50 min.
- desc: The most important thing I have gone through today is about midterm exam,
    the question pattern and about the syllabus.
- desc: Today, I learned the terms formative and summative evaluation.  Apparently,
    this had been talked about on the first day, but I do not recall discussing these
    terms, although it could have been because the microphone hadn&#039;t been working
    so I just didn&#039;t hear anything.  In terms of agile programming, formative
    evaluation seems much more important.
- desc: To read chapters 1-4 for the midterm
- desc: In today&#039;s Lecture we discuss about Why interface is joke. Professors
    ask us to give metaphor for an interface. The midterm is on 21 October. Duration
    is 50min and we discuss that what are the topic are coming in exam.
- desc: "Today we discussed more details about the midterm. We also looked at metaphors\
    \ for user interfaces. I liked the metaphor of an interface is like a joke, if\
    \ you have to explain it, it isn\u2019t good. Like a joke, an interface should\
    \ be easy to understand without having it explained to you."
- desc: Not all students are good at writing or creating exam questions. Also, there
    are some that have no desire to.
- desc: Discussed about mid-terms and other things.
- desc: Today i understood that an interface could be a metaphor of a bridge, wherein
    the bridge serves as means to accomplish the tasks that the user wants to do.
    The river under the bridge and the distance between the 2 ends of the brudge could
    be seen as the gulf of evaluation and execution. The bridge could be either sturdy/
    weak/ built completely or partially, indicative of the way in which a typical
    interface would function.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we talked about the midterm and what we are going to
    cover for it. We also talked about the project due date and what&#039;s needed
    to be handed in tonight. Dr. Hepting told us about the topics and material which
    will be needed for our midterm exam on Friday.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was the metaphors we discussed in
    preparation for the midterm. It is not quite easy to find metaphors, especially
    since imperfect metaphors can drive the user away from the intended purpose, rather
    than bringing him closer. For example, if designing for an OS, files and folders
    look similar, and hold different purposes.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we learned how a bridge can be considered as a metaphor
    for an interface. An interface can be thought as a bridge between human and machines.
    If the bridge is short and sturdy, it means the interface is fairly easy to use.
    If the bridge is long, rickety and has a few missing planks, the  same analogy
    can be taken for an interface that is hard to navigate around and lacks user-friendliness.
- desc: "Today we discussed the midterm that will be on Friday. I am hoping some of\
    \ the multiple choice are some of Dr. Hepting\u2019s amazing jokes!"
- desc: The construction of the midterm. Part of today&#039;s discussion dealt with
    discussing the midterm for Friday&#039;s class. Even though it&#039;s obvious
    anything could be tested up to the midterm day it&#039;s nice to have some mental
    confirmation about the topics present and what the format for the exam looks like.
    Previous midterms were able to be run for 75 minutes while the class runs for
    50 minutes so I&#039;m curious as to how that affects the exam as with a more
    constrained timeframe, the scope of questions has limitations.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is the topics for the midterm; topics
    such as Norman Doors, Empathy Maps, Marble Answering Machine, Metaphors, Usability,
    and more.
- desc: Midterm information and review.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is about what we should do in
    midterm.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in today&#039;s meeting is about the
    midterm such as the format of the exam and types of questions or topics it will
    ask because preparation is most important for the exam. Similarly to when you
    are building an interface design, you have to prepare, and evaluate what you want
    to have in the interface.
- desc: I learned about the gulfs of execution and evaluation.
- desc: Since the Midterm is approaching, so the most important thing for me is to
    get the required information about all the topics that has been covered so far
    in order to be able to attempt the questions in the midterm properly.  It would
    be better to do a little bit of research by going through those topics and plan
    accordingly.
- desc: A good interface like Google does not require explanation on how to use it.
    The search engine is in the middle with popular features like Gmail and Image
    search options at the top right corner. As explained in class, a good metaphor
    for interface is a bridge that connects the user to the computer. The metaphorical
    bridge would be shorter and better built depending on the quality of the interface.
- desc: What was on the midterm on Friday
- desc: midterm
- desc: In the 18th meeting, Daryl talked about the similarity between an interface
    and a joke :) If you have to explain it, it is not good. Then Dr. Hepting asked
    us to give metaphors for an interface. An interface is like a bridge between a
    person and a computer. An interface can be seen as the link connecting the worlds
    of execution and assessment. The bridge&#039;s quality can be viewed as the interface&#039;s
    quality. The interface is fairly simple to use if the bridge is compact and reliable.
- desc: Today we discussed about a point made in our previous sessions that why is
    an interface like a joke? if there is a need to explain it then its not good.
    Furthermore, Dr Hepting asked us to give metaphors for an interface. We also went
    over the types of questions that could be asked in the exam.
- desc: We mainly discuss about Mid-term exam. The bridge example for the gulfs between
    execution and evaluation is easy to understand. The shorter the bridge, the less
    gulfs between a user and a computer.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we discussed the topics of the midterms. The midterm
    is going to be 50 minutes and consists of everything discussed in the class.
- desc: Today we discussed about the project submission and midterm topics. We also
    learned about the midterm topics. Moreover, we discussed about interfaces and
    what they are like.
- desc: Today in class we learned about the syllabus which will be covered in midterm
    exam.
- desc: Interface is like joke, if you have to explain it then it is no good.
- desc: I lerned today related to midterm quetions also we had what interface is like.Discussion
    forms are included with quetions and answers suggestion for midterms.
- desc: Today we discussed about what type of questions will be asked in midterm like
    short answers,multiple choice,etc and what topics will be covered
- desc: Today we learned about midterm. We discussed about the type of questions and
    topics that will be asked for midterm.
- desc: Overview of topics covered till now and discussed few topics regarding saskpower
    presentation.
- desc: "started with &amp;quot;happy Monday,&amp;quot; discussed about the midterm\_\
    questions and what type of questions\_might be expected in midterm tests, then\
    \ asked us to give examples of\_\_metaphors for an interface."
- desc: 'Dear Prof. Hepting. Today first, you started by considering interfaces as
    a bridge and explained why it is like that. Then you discussed the midterm exam:
    The date, type of exam, and probable topics. Thanks'
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture was mostly focused on topics which will be included in
    midterm. It was nice to have idea of all the potential topics that can be asked
    in midterm. By this, a good summary could be formulated about what we have learnt
    so far.
- desc: We discussed midterms today, and then we checked attendance
- desc: today we discussed about the projects and the midterm. We also talked about
    the gulf concept and theory.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we discussed about the midterm and all the topics
    that would be covered in the midterm. We also discussed about the group project
    and the requirements for this project.
- desc: Finding a similarity between the interface designs what things it can be compared
    to.. like as discussed in class &amp;quot;interface is like a joke -- if it has
    to be explained, it&#039;s not good&amp;quot;. This is kind of brain-storming
    activity where I can relate interfae and designs to so many other things that
    are around me.
- desc: Listed and discovered already studied topics and discussed about rate my group.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is about the midterm topics and also
    the metaphor for the attendance. Based on example in class, We can consider an
    interface as a bridge between human and machine.  It can also be thought of as
    the bridge over gulfs of execution and evaluation. We can think about the quality
    of the bridge as the quality of the interface. If the bridge is small and sturdy,
    the interface is fairly easy to use. If the bridge is long and rickety with missing
    planks, this means that the
- desc: The main task was to discuss the last questions of project 1 with the group
    and finish it
know-more:
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we discussed about the interface, gulf curves, also\
    \ discussed about the midterm questions."
- desc: I would like to get more information about the trade offs topic and mental
    models.
- desc: If previous midterms were 75 minutes long, and our midterm is only 50 minutes;
    how will we complete about 10 questions in this time since even for 75 minutes
    exam there were approx. 10 questions.
