difficult:
- desc: Why is apathy a negative thing?  Today&#039;s discussion looked at the different
    pathy&#039;s in empathy apathy and sympathy and empathy was the one given the
    checkmark of the three. Discussion about apathy was centered around it &amp;quot;builds
    character&amp;quot; which I&#039;m somewhat mixed with the concept. All programs
    have a specific audience in mind and a certain level of capability to complete
    tasks.  Why is building character a bad thing when a program is built for an audience?
    An interface shouldn&#039;t need to appeal to everyone.
- desc: It&#039;s been a while since I&#039;ve heard of &#039;empathy&#039;. In counseling,
    empathy is the stage of going beyond understanding and entering into the person&#039;s
    feelings and circumstances. Isn&#039;t it a bit excessive to require that much
    for UI/UX?
important:
- desc: Today we had a student who was representative from RPIRG, and we learned about
    RPIRG, it&#039;s action and research education. In this class we learned about
    the three PATHY; empath when we take on someone else&#039;s perspective, apathy
    when we don&#039;t care about others perspective and sympathy when we pity for
    others perspective and how we can make a better design/product to give our user
    a good experience by understanding and implement these.
- desc: "I have learned about empathy mapping today. It includes what user says, thinks,\
    \ does, and feels about a design. If we think of the user\u2019s perspective when\
    \ we create a design for an interface, then it will make our work useful and beneficial\
    \ to the user."
- desc: 'In today&#039;s class we discussed about marble answering machine practical
    issues, usability issues and user experience. Later we discussed about empathy,
    apathy, sympathy. Empathy map consists of 4 parts: feels, says, thinks, does.'
- desc: Today in class we discussed the three concepts of empathy, apathy, and sympathy.
    All three of which are very important to understand when designing user interfaces.
    I was always confused between empathy and sympathy but today I finally understand
    the difference. Both are similar but empathy is generally more active while sympathy
    is more passive.
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we discussed that why users are not ready to use\
    \ the marble answering machine, few of the reasons are that it has issues with\
    \ practicality and security and also some users might find it as a repetitive\
    \ task and get bored with it and might miss something important, we also discussed,\
    \ usability, user experience, empathy map, Apathy, sympathy of the same."
- desc: 'Today we realized several important issues about  Empathy, apathy, sympathy
    in UI/UX. We learn and understand Empathy, apathy, sympathy is very important
    to ui ux that build. Empathy Map in ui ux design It consists of four elements
    : fells, says, thinks, dose.'
- desc: Today we discussed about empathy, sympathy and apathy while designing interface
- desc: Today&#039;s class helped me understand the benefits &amp;amp; disadvantages
    of owning a marble answering machine. I learnt that although it provides a good
    user experience, it has practical issues. Also, a certain experience in the form
    of a design can&#039;t be enforced, rather it must be designed with empathy, wherein
    the designers take on the user&#039;s perspective. Thus, designing with apathy
    (ignoring user&#039;s perspective) and sympathy (merely showing pity for the user&#039;s
    perspective) is NOT to be done in the design process
- desc: Important thing I learned was empathy, sympathy and apathy. Empathy is something
    that you need to experience a user&#039;s perspective even if we don&#039;t share
    experience with them that way we know what a user&#039;s perspective is and how
    it can be made better.
- desc: "The most important thing I learned today was the difference between Empathy,\
    \ Sympathy, and Apathy in relation to Userinterphase. We should always use Empathy\
    \ (putting oneself in someone else\u2019s shoes). This could be, in some cases,\
    \ very difficult. Therefore, testing is an important part of designing the interphase\
    \ to make sure it suits the users\u2019 needs."
- desc: The Microsoft helicopter joke was amazing and I hope to share it with others
    in the future.
- desc: We spoke about the user interfaces as well as user experiences, also what
    RPIRG is after 3 years at the University. Most importantly what empathy, apathy
    and sympathy are. Also what is an empathy map.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is the importance of empathy in design.
    Even if you do not share any experience with the user, it is important to view
    the experience from their perspective; that way, you have a better idea of how
    they will react to your design choices.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is design with enpathy.
- desc: I learned the difference in empathy, apathy, and sympathy in reference to
    interface designs and user interactions.
- desc: Today we learnt more about Marble Answering Machine. It has usability issues
    as the marbles need to be sorted and organized. User experience is also important
    as it might be a fun experience for many but not practical or it could end up
    being a frustrating experience for some. We need to design using empathy in mind.
- desc: The most crucial thing that I learned about is how beneficial is the concept
    of Empthy, Apthy and Sympathy for the an user interface desing is. All these components
    are quite essential in creating an interface that is very effective in presenting
    the application friendly to user. Empathy is a deep connection and understanding
    of the target user, their needs and their problems, with the aim of provding a
    tailor-made solution. Also the presentation about RPIRG was really helpful and
    want to explore more.
- desc: I would not like a marble answering machine because of security reasons and
    the risk of losing information. Fun is not important to me when choosing an answering
    machine. I agree that empathy is important in interface design because testing
    the interface as a user is an important part of testing. In some cases, I think
    apathy is important as well because caring too much about user experience can
    become problematic.
- desc: The assignment
- desc: "UX teams can achieve a deeper understanding of users&#039; attitudes and\
    \ behaviors by visualizing them in an empathy map, according to Dr. Hepting today.\
    \ The mapping process also reveals any holes in existing user data. It has 4 sections,\
    \ which are Feels, Says, Thoughts, and Does. Also, he talked about the exact meaning\
    \ of empathy, apathy, and sympathy, which clarifies the whole idea.  Empathy:\
    \ taking on someone else\u2019s perspective  Apathy: don\u2019t care about others&#039;\
    \ perspectives  Sympathy: pity for others&#039; perspec"
- desc: We discussed various &#039;PATHY&#039;  Empathy is the ability to see things
    from another person&#039;s point of view. Apathy is to disregard for the opinions
    of others Sympathy which means that feeling sorry for others
- desc: "It was talked about empathy, Apathy and Sympathy. The first one is taking\
    \ on someone else\u2019s perspective . The second one is don\u2019t care about\
    \ others perspective and the last one is pity for others perspective. For example\
    \ if there is a \u2018?\u2019 Mark on a site such as UrCourses or somewhere else,\
    \ it can be Sympathy.Empathy Map has 4 sections which are Feels, Says, Thinks\
    \ and Does."
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was the differences between Apathy
    and Empathy.  Empathy is taking in someone else&#039;s perspective whereas Apathy
    is when you don&#039;t care about others&#039; perspective. Looking forward to
    building the empathy maps!
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting an RPIRG representative came and talk about their\
    \ union and they do research and also fund students. And also talk about different\
    \ pathy such as empathy apathy and sympathy. And also compared them with few examples.\
    \ The last thing I learned was empathy map l."
- desc: one should be empathetical towards user while designing the interface.
- desc: Git to know about various options available in ur courses with teacher access.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting one of our classmate explained us about some program
    in which she is a member of then professor discuss  with us about the empathy
    map what we have to do in it.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting I learnt about difference between empathy,apathy and
    sympathy. I was fascinated by the fine line of understanding which separates them.
    I would to know more about it and I feel this is most important thing I have learnt
    I felt and also would like to know a bit more about user experience.
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Before designing the user experience, we should understand
    the users. Today you talked about empathy map. A visualization tool that we can
    use to understand the end user. Thanks
- desc: Today I learnt how empathy designing is a way for UX designing. Also got to
    know why apathy and sympathy designing are not apt for UX designing.
- desc: Today, we discussed about how, even after having a lot of features that we
    would want in a modern answering machine, the marble answering machine is something
    very few people would want to use. This is because of issues with the practicality
    and the usability of such a machine. If the user ends up feeling frustrated while
    doing a menial task of listening to voicemails, they would rather miss an important
    call than go through the process of the marble.
- desc: In this tutorial, we will focus on the specific application of Assignment1
    and the use of MAP
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is the difference between empathy,
    sympathy, and apathy. Apathy is not good for design because it means you don&#039;t
    care about the user, and sympathy is not good either because you pity the user.
    Empathy is the best because you take on the user&#039;s perspective when designing.
know-more:
- desc: I wish the marble answering machine was more flushed out and we got more information
    about the specifics of its workings given how much we talk about it in class.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss about Marbel answering machine. We also
    discuss about Empathy that is taking about other perspective. Apathy that means
    who don&#039;t care about other people thoughts and Sympathy means pity for other
    perspective. I would like to discuss more about this Definitions.
- desc: I would like to discuss more about why people supported apathy in UI and stated
    that the user is always wrong. I strongly disagree with it because one of the
    primary qualities a website should have is user friendliness and accessibility.
    If Uber decides to build the character of the user, it is pushing away old people
    and several other users who use the app for its user friendliness and convenience
    .
- desc: The concept today about empathy, sympathy and apathy about the website designing
    was very interesting. But I think instead of using just one to be the core of
    the design, it should be the combination of all 3. I would like to get more information
    on this. Also, I would like to know the syllabus of the mid-term to start preparing
    for it. I would like to get information about the topics that were taught before
    Sept 14 because I joined class after Sept 14
- desc: We only briefly touched on doing empathy maps and I wish we had learned a
    little bit more about it.
- desc: Today I learned about design principles based on one example of EMPATHY, APATHY
    AND SYMPATHY
- desc: i would love to know about norman door concept more and also do praticals
    which include interacting with computers
- desc: Designing with empathy and about empathy map.
- desc: Learned about empathy, sympathy and apathy.
- desc: the thing about which I would most like to know more is about empathy and
    how we can understand the user make our interfaces less  apathy and easy to use
    for the user so the user does not have to suffer using the interface being implemented.
    Also, I would like to know more about how apathy can relate to sympathy and empathy
    when is related to user interface.
