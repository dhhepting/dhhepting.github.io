difficult:
- desc: When anything is not answered by the directly then it is treated the most
    difficulties to me. In the marble answering machine if we think like a GUI for
    the users that would be very realistic and the modern technological solution for
    it.  Or is the UI just for the keypad when accessing the voicemail that will work,
    but it&#039;s not labeled and the options have to be repeated a couple times when
    it is missed.
- desc: I didn&#039;t really understand the explanation of the group project, specifically
    the discussion part.  Is each group going around and talking to each other in
    cycles, are they just supposed to meet one other group, and how exactly does this
    work when there are potentially different amounts of people in each group, such
    as solo graduates?
- desc: The group project and what should be done exactly. Need lengthier information
    about the project.
- desc: the most difficult thing for me to understand the midterm date seems to be
    not fair as many students have exams on 21st. Also, we talked about the project
    today in class and its component.
important:
- desc: In this class today we discussed about how the project will be marked and
    how to test the interface of out project. We also figured out that the Experiment
    with UR Courses site had an issue/bug that allowed the students to change their
    role from beta teacher to a non-editing teacher which give them access to view
    student&#039;s ID numbers. Dr. Hepting will consult with IT Office and will have
    it resolved by the next class.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discussed about experimental course. We also discussed
    about 4 parts of the project and what should be done in each of this phase.
- desc: 'In todays meeting we discussed about the Experimental course, basically how
    some private things get leaked due to the same (e.g. SID). Also discussed how
    redesigning worked. Also each person in the class will test their A, B interfaces
    with other 2 people and act as a participant for other groups interface. [Design
    A: B, Test A: B (Reflect + Present)]'
- desc: "we are talking about midterm date again, the Survey about is done today and\
    \ The final decision will be made today with survey or coin and we have to email\
    \ to Dr. Hepting to choose a Project: It\u2019s about UI UX Design Test A-B"
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture enabled me to understand the manner in which the group
    project was to be executed in. I understood the way in which I would have to work
    with my project team on understanding the opportunities for redesigning an existing
    website, then coming up with a design, testing it and then, finally reflecting
    on it by means of a presentation.
- desc: I was able to go into editing mode in the fake class for the assignment and
    I am excited to look into the assignment more.
- desc: In Today&#039;s Lecture we discussed the Experimental course and how it might
    reveal private information about students.  We also talked about the project,
    which has 4 parts.
- desc: More depth was given to handling group project assignments. I particular was
    fond of the 1st activity in breaking apart and understanding an interface. It&#039;s
    logically placed at the first as in order to construct an interface one must first
    understand the logistics behind what makes interfaces work. The process seemed
    straightforward in dividing into groups though there may be some unbalance with
    the management of simple to complex features. I understand the objectives and
    how they apply to the assignments.
- desc: The most important thing for today&#039;s meeting is the group project things
    and its four part.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is that I understand the mark
    distribution of our group project, also the mark distribution gives me a guide
    of what is important in interface design and interface development.
- desc: The most important thing that I have learned from today&#039;s lecture is
    that it very important to understand the people around you and the because interacting
    with people makes you aware of what is exactly going around the world, it helps
    to understand of opportunities are available to you if we try to intertact with
    our classmates as every individaul I talked to so far in the class has something
    incredible in them. And I would like to keep learning the human computer as well
    as the human human interaction .
- desc: The individual project is almost ready for us to do.
- desc: 'In meeting 7, we discussed the Experimental course and how it had a way of
    revealing some private information about students (STID). We also discussed the
    project, which consists of four components. 1- Recognize design and redesign possibilities
    2- Create systems A and B. 3- Test AB: Each person will test their group&#039;s
    A and B interfaces with two different people and act as a participant for other
    group interfaces. The teams will be divided into three (each from a different
    project group) and each will'
- desc: In today&#039;s class, we talked about a 4 part assignment. Designs A and
    B (make an alternative User Interface). Here each participant will test the two
    interface A and B of their group with two different people and participate in
    the testing of other group interfaces. These are new groups of three people (each
    from a different project group), in which each person will present and test the
    interface, and so on. Reflection from past design and enhance/improve future design
- desc: In the meeting, we talked about the Experimental course, and how it may reveal
    the information of students. We talked about the project (4 pieces of 10 marks
    each). Understand opportunities for (re)design + Design A, B and test A,B. reflect
    and present. Dr. Hepting&#039;s website has more information.
- desc: We talked about the project requirements and contributions required. It would
    be helpful if a project outline is provided.
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting I learned about the important things which will be\
    \ in our group assignments such as presenting our interfaces and be a participant\
    \ when other present their interface. And group assignments are divided into four\
    \ parts in which we will be working over this semester."
- desc: There was nothing important today in lecture other than discussion about projects.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting professor explain us about our projects assignment
    and we have done some experiments with the roles of everyone in our participant
    section, we done some discussion about the attendance code also.
- desc: The assignments, the group project, the discussion over whether attendance
    should be in PDF, and the concept of testing designs with other team members were
    the most crucial things I learnt. Through these interactions, we may learn about
    other participants designs and also develop more complicated designs.
- desc: Hello Prof. Hepting. Today you talked about our project. You mentioned that
    we should do it with our group members and start with low-fidelity prototypes,
    which are sketches. Thanks
- desc: started with a happy friday and talked about the regina public interest research
    group, its values, acknowledgement, operations, projects and many more. it was
    a great class today
- desc: Today, there was discussion about the group project and how the marks will
    be distributed between the project requirments.
- desc: In this lesson we discussed the problem of grouping, the progress of the personal
    work, and the rules of the check-in
know-more:
- desc: We didn&#039;t do much today except continue to deal with the emphasize we
    with teachers assignment. I took the time to put a silly picture as the class
    photo of a cute lil guy waving hello. Other than that I coded a particle system
    for another class as hepting was busy with other things with the class.
- desc: Today, Professor explain about the Project that will divided in 4 Parts. He
    also discusses about the activity of designing A and b that is alternative UI.
- desc: I am interested I  learning more about the class group project and the individual
    assignments. I would like to know more details on those.
- desc: What is required for the first individual assignment and what is required
    for the first part of the group assignment
- desc: Today we discussed about projects and everything
- desc: We discussed about the midterm and group and the individual assignment which
    I would like to know more abou the group project.
- desc: I would like to learn more about the tools and techniques we will be using
    to assess interphases. For example, are there preferred distances (in pixels)
    between different components? Or, are such matters stylistic in nature and should
    be left to the discretion of the designer.
- desc: I would like to know more about the individual assignments and their deadlines.
    I would like to know how can we approach the assignment and go about doing it.
- desc: The thing that I would like to know more about is what exactly we&#039;re
    supposed to do on our first assignment. I know it&#039;s supposed to help us emphasize
    with teachers, but what will we do with our new temporary roles? and how will
    we show our work?
- desc: I would like to know more about the group project and the empathize with teachers
    project.
- desc: I would like to know more about the Group project that we discussed today.
    We saw the 4 required steps in class but I am confused how the testing with take
    place. If we have group of 4 members, does each member need to test two other
    group&#039;s work?
- desc: I&#039;d like to know more about the details and expectation of the project.
    I understand the first part of the project to critique the design of an interface
    and suggest improvement. When discussing interfaces between groups, I&#039;m not
    sure if we are expected to create an improved interface on a website or a software.
- desc: Today we discussed about individual assignment and group project. I would
    like to learn more about the approach towards group project and what do we need
    to focus on?
- desc: Nice to know about creative way to do project collaborating not only within
    team but also among teams.
- desc: I would like to know more about new Experiment course which is going to be
    our individual assignment by some technical cases we were not able to discuss
    today but probably in next lecture.
- desc: Today was just deciding upon assignment 1 and elaboration on project. For
    assignment 1, the solution for roles issue is yet to be found and we had a high
    level idea of the project we will be doing.
- desc: Today&#039;s meeting was based on the discussion about the group project or
    the group assignment that we have to work on with 4 group members and we also
    discussed that there are 4 main topics for the assignment.
- desc: Nothing important just discussed about the project and groups.
- desc: Today we learned about the difficulties in creating a teacher type role that
    does not have access to sensitive information, so I&#039;m interested in seeing
    how IT support will resolve that.
