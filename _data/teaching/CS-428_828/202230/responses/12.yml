difficult:
- desc: I don&#039;t understand how taking attendance for grades hasn&#039;t been
    banned post pandemic.  It does nothing to reflect the skill or commitment of a
    student to a subject.  All it does is pressure students to go to class, regardless
    of whether they are sick or weather conditions are dangerous and they would be
    safer staying home.
- desc: Translating my ideas into metaphors was much more difficult than I anticipated
- desc: Today we discussed about the way of taking attendance
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand is the metaphors discussed in
    class. Not quite clear on the topic. I think it would be great to clarify some
    things out regarding metaphors and perhaps use a different example.
- desc: I just want to stay in the old way of doing things that we&#039;ve been doing
    without too much difficulty. e.g) attendance.
- desc: The metaphors didn&#039;t match with the topic.
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today you introduced the word metaphor to us. In the beginning,
    it was hard for me to understand what it meant, but you explained it more briefly
    and now I know what it is. Thanks
- desc: Today we checked attendence, and then we had a group discussion that Metaphors
    -&amp;gt; Goal is to provide context to new activity by relating it to past experience?
    NFC Reader in each class. So you have to tap in or scan when you come in the class.
- desc: It was a little hard for me to come up with metaphors for design when starting
    out, because I was mainly thinking of abstract ideas instead of real-life examples.
    It was easier to come up with ideas once we had some examples to take a look at.
important:
- desc: The metaphor for the class attendance is very from user to user. But which
    method will be the best for the recording system it depends on the system requirements
    and the facility of the system. In the traditional process the system is not friendly
    as for the teacher and student. In the other hand the building entrance rules
    and regulation depends on the requirements of the people demands. Every metaphor
    is connected to the use of the system reliability.
- desc: In this class we had discussion about how to record our attendance and what
    are some other best alternatives. We also had a group discussion about the metaphor
    for recording our attendance such signing in, clocking in for work, getting an
    award, letting people know that you showed up, getting a celeb. signature and
    etc. In the group discussion we also talked about what might be a better metaphor
    for our attendance and our group thought it&#039;s like voting in an election
    or updating our status on social media
- desc: Today in the lecture I learnt about thinking something outside the box for
    a situation. Like in todays lecture we could think of different ways for marking
    attendance which should be in a proper way and also what alternative ways we can
    come across.
- desc: Today we explored the concepts of gulfs in an interface and related it with
    the attendance. After getting into our discussion groups, we discussed what metaphors
    we could use in relation to the attendance. Our group came up with casting votes.
    I found some of the ideas the other groups thought up quite interesting and unique
    such as clocking in at work, participation award, paying for parking or caveman
    putting in handprint.
- desc: "today we are going to talk about what might be better metaphor some examples\
    \ discussed in the class : signing in clock in for a shift at the work participation\
    \ award leaving graffiti in public washroom letting people know I showed up getting\
    \ fingerprinted by police registering your DNA at GED match caveman putting handprint\
    \ on cave wall collecting autographs of Disneyland character taking a picture\
    \ paying for parking\LBeReal app"
- desc: Attendance is a important key thing to be succesful in class. Best way to
    learn is by going to the class and watching examples and learning new things and
    that can only be done by attending the lecture.
- desc: "The most important thing I learned today was how important metaphors are\
    \ to improving the user interface, and relating to users\u2019 past experiences.\
    \ Metaphors make it more obvious to the user what the components of the interfaced\
    \ are, and how they operate. For example, windows make folders look like physical\
    \ folders, and one could drag and drop files into them like one would do so with\
    \ physical folders and files."
- desc: "Today\u2019s discussion of metaphors for the marking of attendance was very\
    \ fun. Attendance is like a caveman putting their hand print on a wall."
- desc: Today we spoke about metaphors where the goal is to rpovide context to a new
    activity. NFC Reader in each class should be introduced so students can scan or
    tap their Uregina Ids for the use of attendance.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is the discussion of metaphor
- desc: The most important thing that I learned is the different ways we maybe use
    later for attendances
- desc: "Gulf of execution is the gap between the user\u2019s goal for action and\
    \ their means to execute it. Metaphorically recording attendance is like signing\
    \ in, clocking in for a shift, participation award, letting people know you showed\
    \ up, etc."
- desc: Attendence was the topic that has been discussed in today&#039;s class. Although
    we are all well aware of the fact that attendance in a class is a very important
    aspect of an individual&#039;s presence and a mark of participation of in-class
    activities that are being conducted in the class. So showing up in class on a
    regular basis is a must to get yourself updated of what is going on in the class
    rather than getting marked absent and losing the grace marks that carries a lot
    of importance for calculating the total.
- desc: That I can relate the analysis of interfaces to any problem
- desc: "Today\u2019s class was about how to describe a problem as a metaphor and\
    \ what is the best way to improve it. At first, Daryl described the normal ways\
    \ of attendance recording like Calling out the names, Writing down the names,\
    \ and Signing in the class sheet. As a group discussion, students named some metaphors\
    \ like getting fingerprinted by police, clocking for work, and registering your\
    \ DNA @ GED Match, \u2026. There are many ways that can be employed instead of\
    \ the traditional attendance registration for example log"
- desc: Today in class we learned about metaphors on attendance. Different metaphors
    for attendance were clocking in for work, signing in, letting people know I showed
    up, getting fingerprint by police, or bereal app.
- desc: What might be better metaphor  &amp;quot;Recording attendance is like ...&amp;quot;
    ? We have discussed some examples. Signing in clock in for a shift at the work,
    participation award, leaving graffiti in public washroom, letting people know
    I showed up, getting fingerprinted, registering your DNA at GED match, taking
    a picture, paying for parking. Also we can use an application to scan barcode
    on student id to record attendance.
- desc: Today in class we brainstormed different ideas for taking attendance. The
    idea about scanning our ID cards seems pretty cool and hassle free compared to
    putting in the attendance code. It&#039;s interesting to look at common activities
    such as clocking in to work as a metaphor.
- desc: Today we learnt about the metaphors and what alternatives are poss For taking
    our attendance. But all of the methods had flaws and were not feasible. I would
    like to explore more and find a more feasible and efficient option
- desc: "In today\u2019s class I learned about the different metaphors which we can\
    \ do for attendance such as signing in, participation awards, fingerprint sensor.\
    \ And also learned about the size of the doors."
- desc: Different options for recording the attendance. I still don&#039;t know why
    we need it but good to know what options we have.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we discuss about recording attendance topic in a group
    and with class also. we discuss what we can do to make it better for the one who
    attend the class and the one who don&#039;t.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was different possible ways to record
    attendance and if there can be issues which we should take into consideration
    and if so can it be resolved by different metaphor
- desc: I learned today how attendance is required and different ways what attendance
    is like..as we know its important to note we attend lecture and prof can look
    on it anytime for grades.But i would still like to know about metaphors.
- desc: "started with &amp;quot;happy wednesday,&amp;quot; the most important thing\
    \ I learned today was about the alternative techniques of taking attendance. Normally,\
    \ we have traditional methods like writing names down or calling them out, and\_\
    talked about some alternative methods like using a face scan or inserting a card\
    \ etc,"
- desc: Today I was able to scrutinize the attendance issue in terms of metaphores.
    For recording attendance, several metaphores were discussed in the class. From
    all of those, I could feel the most important one was to enable the location of
    student and then record the attendance. This way, the attendance issue can be
    solved.
- desc: Discussions on theory topics, videos and debates with each other on the same
- desc: There was a group discussion about the different metaphors we can think of
    for attendance and maybe find a better alternative metaphor for attendance. Our
    group came up with the metaphor of casting a vote. The attendance system that
    we currently use has options to mark yourself present, absent, excused, etc. This
    is similar to a parliamentary vote where you either vote for, against or abstain
    from voting. This can be implemented in class if everyone writes their name on
    a piece of paper for attendance.
- desc: Finding metaphors for the physical system that would be relatable and  easily
    understood by the user while using the digital systems.
- desc: How to take attendance.
- desc: 'For the question mentioned in class: which kind of way to record attendance?
    I would prefer taking attendance automatically in meeting times. In this case,
    the system would be a fair tool for recording all users&#039; login and logout
    time, so that the attendance would be more reliable and trust-worthy.'
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is that how we can think of metaphor
    in regard od the recoding the attendance. We learned and viewed lots of examples
    that illustrated our knowledge in recording the attendance.  Also, Alternatives
    and corresponding problem that can arise Above approach can be adopted using RFID
    tags rather than barcode scanning.
know-more:
- desc: We have worked on the attendance system today. We discussed some metaphors
    by which we can make our class system more effective. But the main problem is
    that without involving the biometric, we cannot remove the misuse of it. I would
    like to know more about whether it is possible involving any biometric involvement
    in URCourses, so that it can detect the exact person who is giving the attendance.
    For example, it can be a device that will be pressed, capture the fingerprint,match
    and update URCourses.
- desc: In today&#039;s lecture we discuss about the metaphor of recording lecture.
    Some of the points came out in class is signing in, taking pictures or by app.
    I would like to discuss more about this topic.
- desc: Different ways to handle attendance, the good and the bad of each
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we did a group discussion where we have to think\
    \ and come up with different metaphors for attendance and come up with alternative\
    \ metaphor for it. So the attendance system that we are currently using for CS\
    \ 428 has options to mark ourselves as present, absent, late etc. So this can\
    \ be also implemented by just writing down the names and signing it so that there\
    \ is no redundancy."
- desc: I would like to know more about the metaphors that could be utilized for recording
    attendance in a typical classroom setting .
- desc: "Today in class we discussed metaphors related to attendance. It is something\
    \ that is a reward for students attending the class but a small penalty for those\
    \ who don\u2019t attend. So I think the professor should give an individual password\
    \ to every student attending the class. This password would be random, one time\
    \ use and only one per student. This can be done quickly so lecture time won\u2019\
    t take much time. However this would require a bit of behind the scenes preparation\
    \ but it\u2019s worth a try."
- desc: How does one judge consent when it comes to interface design? The majority
    of the articles related to privacy in the discussion of attendance were related
    to forms of privacy. clocking in, fingerprint is taken, BeReal are all different
    degrees of privacy being taken. Attendance taking is a personable action but its
    severity is regulated more to accountability than consentful data points. Should
    consent always be asked or is there some aspects of privacy that are not needed
    for interface actions to discuss?
- desc: I thing that I would like to know more about is what are the improvements
    for recording attendance?
- desc: I would like to learn more about metaphors and its applications to many daily
    activities.
- desc: The best way to record attendance is to have the professor scan the barcode
    of the student ID as students enter the classroom, similar to when entering the
    gym at the university. This would be the most time efficient method and it would
    prevent dishonest students from taking advantage of the password available online.
    One of the metaphors for taking attendance is getting your ID checked.
- desc: Discussed many other ways in which attendance can be taken. I would like to
    know more about ways to take accurate attendance. In every possible way there
    is either privacy issue or task becomes too tedious just to take attendance.
