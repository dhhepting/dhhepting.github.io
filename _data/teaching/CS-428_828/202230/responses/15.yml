difficult:
- desc: I&#039;m not too sure why the binary guessing game was necessary to talk about
    encoding, especially when it was explained in that level of detail.  It is a fairly
    trivial concept that is taught in CS100 and CS110, and probably didn&#039;t need
    a 20 minute explanation in a fourth year course, especially when it is not really
    related to interface design at all.
- desc: "Since today was a student\u2019s birthday, the professor did an interesting\
    \ activity where he had her guess a number between 1 and 15 and using various\
    \ cards with numbers on them, guess the number. We also explored the bits on ASCH\
    \ code as well. Although it was an uninteresting discussion, I don\u2019t understand\
    \ exactly how it relates to user interfaces."
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand in today&#039;s meeting is what
    keeps the computer system limited to 128 characters.
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand today is the ASCII, the encode
    things are really hard to understand
- desc: For me, it was difficult to understand UTF and ASCII.
important:
- desc: The number guessing game is the representation of the binary number bits and
    if anyone can know the tricks of it. Then it is very easy to solve the number.
    But at the beginning it seems very complex when you do not know what is the binary
    bits. So that the 4 cards can guess the number 0 to 15 if the card number would
    be more then it would be increase the range. The ASCII and the unicode also the
    represents of the value of the computer by using the binary bits.
- desc: "Today Dr. Hepting did a fun activity where he held four cards and asked a\
    \ student to guess a number then using a series of yes and no he guessed the correct\
    \ number. Then he explained how binary numbers works and then we discussed how\
    \ many bits would we need to fit no English characters in government documents/ID.\
    \ Dr. Hepting brought up a woman\u2019s story where she had a hard time correcting\
    \ her name on her government ID because of one invalid character in her name."
- desc: "Today I have learned and recalled some of my previous knowledge of ASCII\
    \ and Unicode. Using ASCII, representation of all the character is not possible.\
    \ That\u2019s why we cannot make our scope open for creating the visual representation\
    \ for all the characters we need."
- desc: "In today\u2019s lecture we discussed about ASCII and it\u2019s complexity\
    \ limited to the programming boundaries. It was fun and interactive."
- desc: How binary code can be used to impress those that do not understand binary
- desc: Today professor talked about ASCII code and Unicode, I understood that is
    method of Encoding text.
- desc: We learned about the UTF and UTF-8 which is an encoding and decoding unicode.
    UTF-8 is mostly used because it is easier as we don&#039;t have to store all the
    values.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was how we might consider the future,
    when designing for the present with limited boundaries. This is a very important
    question, since we do not know what we might change in the future, and so we are
    just designing with a complexity that we might not need. However, if we ever need
    to make changes, our hands will be tied with the boundaries for the previous design.
- desc: "Happy Birthday Laura!! The binary card guessing game is a great thing to\
    \ show off to my family this weekend. Can\u2019t wait to confuse them"
- desc: Applicability of bits. I understood bits through previous CS courses, but
    today&#039;s card example exposed me to the practical side of connecting bits
    with design. Especially with the discussion of adding necessary characters to
    support non-English writing to government documents It made me reflect on how
    technology and interface are intermingled as when technology develops, the possibilities
    for interface and human interaction with technology develop(e.g.  accessibility
    options on websites)
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is about UTF. UTF is an encoding
    system that decodes and encodes Unicode. Most programmers use UTF-8 than UTF-32
    because they usually do not need to store all possible Unicode values.
- desc: Prof taught us a card guessing
- desc: "Daryl in this meeting played card games to guess a number! At first, he talked\
    \ about the card game and how the answers to the questions translate into binary\
    \ numbers, which we can translate into a binary number and find the answer. So\
    \ it\u2019s important to know how many bits we need to encode characters and what\
    \ kind of that. In the next 15 minutes he talked about, ASCII 7 bits, and Unicode\
    \ 32 bits charsets and talked about each shortcoming."
- desc: Today I learned about encoding the characters with ASCII, Unicode, UTF 16
    and UTF8.
- desc: We had an interesting game in the class. gussing answer and how the answers
    translated to the binary numbers. We can translate it into a binary number and
    in this way we can find the answer. Also, we talked about the different ways to
    encode and to represent unicode.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we discuss about the binary, Ascii numbers we play
    a card game also.
- desc: The most important thing I learnt was encoding character and what is the difficulty
    level to add bits to store more diverse options. I would still love to learn a
    bit more about it because I found it as avery interesting topic
- desc: "started with &amp;quot;happy friday,&amp;quot; the most important thing\_\
    I learned was about the card game&#039;s logic. The professor bought 4 cards and\
    \ asked random\_students to come up with a number in their heads. He then asked\
    \ them to start at 0, show the cards in order, and ask participants if the number\
    \ is in each card. If the answer is &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; he added the cards&#039;\
    \ place values to guess. Participants also discussed how many bits are required\
    \ to encode characters with 4 bits"
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today you brought some cards and asked some of the students
    to consider a number in their mind. Then, you told the number by asking yes/no
    questions. The reason for bringing this game was teaching how encoding works.
    Thanks
- desc: Today I got to know the logic behind the card trick professor showed,
- desc: today we did play the number game and then learnt the binary code mechansim
    from it. we also discussed adding and storing of bits.
- desc: UTF-8 are mostly used in storing the multilingual character and usually the
    most popular encoding method in World Wide Web.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is about the card game and how the
    answers to the questions translate into binary numbers, which we can translate
    into a binary number and find the answer
- desc: In this lesson, we focus on the permutation of the truth table for various
    possibilities. The analysis considers how many different combinations there are
    of the whole card.
know-more:
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss about the card game and how that answer converted
    into binary answer. I would like to know about this games.
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we saw that DR Helpting modified the QR code for\
    \ the attendance and then afterwards we discussed about the ASCII code and how\
    \ that works in binary guessing game. I would like to know more about how that\
    \ works in detail."
- desc: "Today I\u2019d learnt through the card game, the problem faced by today\u2019\
    s computers of being limited in terms of the input options and I\u2019d like to\
    \ know and explore more ways in which this barrier could be overcome."
- desc: UTF 8 and UTF 16 is something important I learned. The binary game is amaz
- desc: I would like to know more about the binary game concept as it seems pretty
    interesting and also there it is available in a variety of ranges. It can either
    be played solo or in group and either with number or with alphabets. But as the
    name itself depicts that usually revolved around numbers and  we either have to
    change the binary digits by clicking on them to make the total for that row or
    type in the total for the binary digits given. But overall I really  enjoyed today&#039;s
    class.
- desc: Our computer system is limited to ASCII because it is commonly used to give
    our computers the same language which allows sharing of files. ASCII is large
    enough for US English but not for universal use. A quick Google search shows that
    extended ASCII is available but I&#039;m not sure if it is widely used to support
    non-English writing in government documents as discussed in class. I&#039;d like
    to learn more about how government plans to deal with this issue.
- desc: I would like to know more about how I can represent characters from different
    languages so that it is more inclusive
- desc: Today we discussed a problem about encoding characters.
- desc: I would like to know more about how digital data is important also about UTF
- desc: udt8 time zone and how it works
- desc: Today, we discussed the binary guessing game and it was kind of difficult
    for me to understand how it worked. I would want to learn more about this game.
- desc: The way how other characters apart from English alphabets can be stored and
    used in the system and how bits are used to store this value. It&#039;s interesting
    to study and understand that part of computing and designing.
- desc: I am interested in learning how computers are able to display different alphabets
    using the same bits, and whether it is labour intensive to switch between these
    alphabets.
