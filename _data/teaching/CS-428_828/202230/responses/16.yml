difficult:
- desc: Attendance feels like a weird example to hang on to and it seems strange it
    will be in the midterm
- desc: The most important thing for me to understand at this point is the upcoming  midterm
    and the group assignment. I would need to pay a lot of heed to both them as both
    are approaching nearly together. I would really interesting to get a good experience
    by working under pressure, and I would be happy deal with. But overall this importance
    and the interface of attendance in today&#039;s class discussion was really good.
- desc: "I noticed today there\u2019s no longer QR code or password for attendance\
    \ I don\u2019t know why because now anyone can fill present in attendance by staying\
    \ home it\u2019s demotivating to attend class in morning specially in winter anyways\
    \ currently focusing on midterms to have good grades."
important:
- desc: This is very important that the empathy map is the Empathy is the initial
    stage in creative thinking, as it is a skill that enables us to comprehend and
    share the same emotions as others. Our ability to empathize with others allows
    us to understand their problems, circumstances, and situations from their point
    of view.
- desc: In this class Dr. Hepting informed us that the Midterm will on Oct. 21 as
    scheduled and part one of project is due next Monday, Oct. 17. We also discussed
    the importance of consistence and tried to change the attendance time limit so
    student can only mark themselves present for the first 20 min of the class however
    the setting and instruction were so clear about how to implement that in UofR
    Course. We also discussed the importance of knowing what settings we chose and
    the impact it will have on the enduse
- desc: I have learned about consistency and why it is so important in system designing.
    To make a system consistent we need to make sure that they will look and perform
    in a same way. Maintaining consistency is one of the key indicators for user centric
    design. For today, professor tested the attendance system for its different options,
    and found that it is not that much consistent, so it needs to be modified a bit.
- desc: "In today\u2019s class, we discussed about the importance of consistency in\
    \ system designing. We considered attendance as an example and came out with an\
    \ idea on how to make it consistent. One example is \u2018Time of Submission\u2019\
    . If attendance is marked within 25 min after the class started then considering\
    \ it as present else late. We also discussed about visibility settings."
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss that in empathy map at least one entry should
    be there per quadrant. Group assignment is due on 17 and midterm is on 21. consistency
    is very important when we are performing any tasks.
- desc: today we are talking about Empathy Map, how many entire per quadrant for each
    part And after that we are talking about ability of attendees. Finally we discussed
    about midterm questions.
- desc: The important things I&#039;d learnt today was about deciding the number of
    entries that would be reasonable to fill up an empathy map quadrant, wherein the
    minimum was set to 1,
- desc: The most important thing I learned was that the due date for project assignment
    was extended and someone from saskpower will be coming on Friday.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was how important consistency is
    to an interface, and how lack of consistency in an interface can be very confusing
    for a user. Today we examined the UR courses&#039; attendance feature. It had
    many inconsistencies, like how the eye icon and the 0 value in the attendance
    time appear to have the same meaning, which is very confusing to a user.
- desc: Today we spoke more about the project and the Empathy Map. Midterm will cover
    chapter 1 to 4. How important is (lack of) consistency? Consistency is important
    in every task we do. For example we talked about attendance and how can we make
    it consistent. How do we know the impact of the setting we choose?
- desc: One of the important things we discussed today is, &amp;quot;how important
    is (lack of) consistency?&amp;quot; I would say that consistency is very important
    because it keeps the user familiar with the controls. They will be less likely
    to feel confused or overwhelmed with various options.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is the midterm date and project
    part 1 due time.
- desc: The attendance resource on Urcourses lacks consistency.  When we set a time
    range of first 25 mins of the class as &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; and want to
    set &amp;quot;absent&amp;quot; to the rest of the class time. It is very complex
    and does not give preview option to test or see how the changes would look like.
- desc: As demonstrated by the professor today, the UR Courses webite could be made
    more user-friendly for the instructor. Consistency between modules is important
    to improve user experience and to make the interface easier to learn and use.
    Preview of the changes to settings would be very helpful for the instructor as
    well.
- desc: How attendance system works in UR courses and how we can change it
- desc: Daryl started this meeting by listing the number of quadrants that should
    have at least one entry. Three entries per quadrant, we believe, is a reasonable
    number. Then he emphasized the importance of (lack of) consistency. He stated
    that consistency is critical in all of our endeavours. We talked about how we
    can improve attendance. One suggestion was to limit present to 25-30 minutes and
    then only have other options available. Also, He discussed the significance of
    the setting that someone chooses.
- desc: How important is (lack of) consistency? And what about error prevention? In
    the meeting, we learn that consistency is so important in activities. The attendance
    was explained in details that how it could be consistent. We set time on present
    on 25min and we saw the result. We should consider preview of setting or some
    instructions for users.
- desc: "Today in class I learned Consistency is important in every task we do. For\
    \ example we talked about attendance and how can we make it consistent. One idea\
    \ was to set the time limit on \u2018present\u2019 for maybe 25 or 30 minutes\
    \ then just have other options available."
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we discuss about the midterm question related to attendance
    and also some guest is coming on Friday from sasktel we need to do a group discussion
    about it. So for the midterm question ** suggest some ideas that will help students
    to record their attendance who attend the lecture only?**
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we continued discussion in attendance topic and tried
    to dig out answers to questions like what is the meaning of interface control
    and some information on error presentation
- desc: There is a way to add events based on time. Today we discussed to add time
    based attendance system where student will not get option to mark present if he/sher
    opens it after 25 mins. There will be only option to mark absent.
- desc: Nothing note worthy but excited about next lectures visit from saskpower.
- desc: "began by wishing everyone a happy Wednesday and bringing up that there will\
    \ be a few guests from the Saskatchewan Power Digital Design Lab this Friday.\
    \ I learned that the midterm syllabus is from chapters 1-4, and that for empathy\
    \ maps for each group in the project, evey entry per quadrant can be greater than\
    \ or equal to 1 and\_also talked about the midterm exam and were asked to post\
    \ any thoughts on the question types."
- desc: Hello Prof. Hepting. Today you talked a little bit about the project part
    1 that how we have to complete it as well as the midterm exam. Also, You discussed
    some features of the URcourses related to the attendance part form the perspective
    of UX design. Thanks
- desc: Today while setting up the attendance module in ur courses, got a chance to
    scrutinize the consistency within UR Courses. It was a nice example of visibility
    settings of UR courses modules being different per module. I.e. In some it has
    an eyeball and in some need to type manually to have it visible/invisible to students.
- desc: Today we checked attendance, then discussed how homework should be written,
    and then talked about the midterm
- desc: The processes and techniques of how to make attendance more efficient
- desc: The most important thing that was done today was the project 1 submission
    due date was extended to October 17.
- desc: Today we had a group discussion with our project groups and decided on what
    we need to do for the project for this course.
- desc: How important is consistency within the modules of a website and what impacts
    it makes when we decide to put any settings or particular designs. It is after
    all the user who suffers when the designs are not properly selected and it can
    create great confusion for the individual while using our application.
- desc: "the most important thing that I learned is that Consistency is important\
    \ in every task we do. For example we talked about attendance and how can we make\
    \ it consistent. One idea was to set the time limit on \u2018present\u2019 for\
    \ maybe 25 or 30 minutes then just have other options available."
- desc: In this lesson, we mainly discussed some previous content and confirmed that
    the assignment will be postponed to 17th
- desc: I learned that URCourses has surprisingly a lot of options and customizations
    for attendance, it&#039;s just hard to find all of them.
know-more:
- desc: I&#039;m most interested in the guest presentations happening soon.  We are
    on week three of &amp;quot;discussing&amp;quot; attendance, and I have nothing
    left to say about it.  It will be nice to have something else to think about and
    react to, and perhaps we might learn something.  Attendance has been completely
    overdone, and I hope we can finally move on after this week.
- desc: Today we discussed more about the class attendance. An idea was that we could
    implement a timing mechanism where the user will be marked as present if they
    submit attendance within the first 25 minutes of class, otherwise they will be
    marked as late if they submit within the second half of class. We also discussed
    the types of questions for the midterm. I am very interested to see what types
    of questions the other students come up with.
- desc: How can we modify the attendance module for the different desired settings?
    Is it best to set the default settings, or should these settings be required in
    setup?
- desc: So today we did the project group discussion and also learned about what should
    we provide for the assignment.
- desc: I have a suggestion for a midterm question. The professor should give us two
    or three essay topics before hand and then the students are supposed to write
    an essay of probably 200-250 Words based on an essay topic selected by Dr. Hepting.
    This way the students will have to learn about the two or three or four important
    topics discussed in the class uptil now.
- desc: What makes good consistency in interface design? In today&#039;s class there
    was discussion about conistency particular in regards to how attendence shows
    options that aren&#039;t useful (i.e marking yourself absent). Consistency can
    create uniformity in following through with logic of the design but it could also
    be considered a weakness like needing to draw attention on the layout of a page.
    How does one find proper balance with consistency such that function remains intact?
- desc: I heard that we&#039;ll meet someone from Saskpower on Friday, which I&#039;m
    so excited and looking forward to the meeting on Friday. I would like to know
    more about what we have learned can be used in really life work, so the meeting
    on Friday will be a good opportunity for me to get familiar to the experts.
- desc: The think abouto which I would most like to know more is about the midterm
    questions and also other functions in UR Courses like the attendance we did in
    class
- desc: How important consistency is throughout an interface.
- desc: Today we got to know about midterm and details of our project.
