difficult:
- desc: The divide between people who thought the second try would also be push after
    pushing failed the first time
- desc: The most difficult thing for me to understand today is the analysis of ED
    door, I didn&#039;t understand the conversation of the interact between door and
    user at first.
important:
- desc: The UX design should be as simple to the user for the understanding that would
    be intuitive for the people and it should have the clear user notification. The
    Norman door is one of them that the most of the time user has confused how to
    use this door properly. The execution and evaluation has been described in this
    perspective.
- desc: I know about the gulf between execution and evaluation today. The gulf of
    execution is the user&#039;s goal and how they can achieve the goal. And the gulf
    of evaluation is the understanding with which a user can determine whether the
    action of achieving the goal will be successful or not. In terms of Norman&#039;s
    door, the user knows the goal that they want to open the door. But whether it
    will be push or pull, that can be confusing. The lower the gulf is, the better
    and known as user friendly design.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss about Normal door in Education building.
    The push is clear but pushing doesn&#039;t work. handle is ambiguous. Professor
    also updated the 3rd oct of first individual assignment.
- desc: "Today in class we looked at an actual example of a Norman Door at the University\
    \ of Regina\u2019s Education Building. In this particular door, only one of it\
    \ worked and it indicated the user needs to push but there was also a handle and\
    \ an automatic door sign. As a result, it can be confusing for a person to know\
    \ whether they should, push, pull, or will it open automatically."
- desc: Norman doors, trusting what signs says and what the door actually does in
    response
- desc: "Today we analysis ED door and Normam Door. Push is clear but pushing doesn\u2019\
    t work ( door fight back ) And handle is ambiguous, helped by \u201Cpush\u201D\
    \ ( one the handle is turned ). And the other hand we draw a issue on the table\
    \ and We explained"
- desc: Discussed about doors
- desc: Today, I understood the importance of designing the simplest of everyday objects,
    like a door in a manner that would enhance its usability. I derived this understanding
    from an illustration demonstrated in class, of a Norman door (Push to open door
    at the university). Here, the door handle is ambiguous as, the pushing alone is
    not enough to unlock the door, requiring the user to turn the handle as well.
    This ambiguity in the system design widens the conceptual gulf of evaluation &amp;amp;
    execution distance.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was how a Norman door (such as the
    on in ED) was made with bad design. Not only is the door difficult to use, but
    the fact that the accessibility button is very far from the door made me think
    that there is no button at all. This feature is not useful, but also forces the
    user to go to the door, realize there is no button, and then go back, press the
    button, and return quickly to the door. This is extremely counterproductive for
    the user.
- desc: Today I learned that I have trust issues with doors.
- desc: "In Today\u2019s lecture we spoke about Assignment and that UR Course has\
    \ been updated. Then we Analyzed the ED door at U of R and whether it is an example\
    \ of a Norman Door. We discuss further about Execution and Evaluation when an\
    \ individual is approaching the door."
- desc: Group partner members. Today at the end of class their was a brief moment
    where we were paired off into project groups to discuss plans for it. I didn&#039;t
    have anyone in particular to be grouped up with so I didn&#039;t know who I was
    going to be paired off with. Still a bit confusing over how the project will be
    divided as some activities like the empathy maps are more dependent ant with the
    activity requiring more or less time but i&#039;m sure that will be figured out
    over time.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is that people will often perceive
    some things first. For example, in the picture of the norman door shown today,
    most users would think to push first since it&#039;s labeled right in the top
    middle. After failing to push, the user will realize that there is another label
    telling them to use the handle, which may make things more confusing. It is important
    to clarify the purposes of the door at the begining.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is analysis of ED door and the
    due date of assigment 1.
- desc: "Analysis on Norman Door example: our ED building door. The handle\u2019s\
    \ role is ambiguous since it usually signifies pull but the plate of the door\
    \ said \u201Cpush\u201D which is contrary of what it should normally be like.\
    \ There is definitely trust issue when it comes to following door instructions."
- desc: We discussed more about the Norman door using a door in the Education building
    as an example. It is confusing that there is a push panel with a handle that locks.
    I think the simple solution is to remove the push panel and just have the word
    push on the door with the handle. Alternatively, the handle and the lock could
    be removed on the push side.
- desc: "Dr.Hepting discussed a problem with the door of the education building as\
    \ an example of Norman&#039;s door. That door had an ambiguous handle, like a\
    \ push plate plus push written on it, and it wouldn&#039;t open when pushed. As\
    \ a second action debate after initial push failure, he discussed door signs (automatic,\
    \ indicates pull, etc.). \u201CGulf of Execution &amp;amp; Gulf of Evaluation\u201D\
    \ was the final topic taught using an example in which the smaller distance was\
    \ the target and the wider distance may make us give up."
- desc: In the meeting 10, we analyzed the door which has ambiguous handle. On the
    top of the part of aluminum was written &amp;quot;Push&amp;quot;. But when you
    was trying to open the door by pushing the door, it didn&#039;t work! (The door
    fights back!)  May be once the handle is turned the door could open! The goal
    of this is opening the door. And when we see the door some thinks comes to our
    mind. 1-I should open the door by pushing? 2- Maybe turning the handle opens the
    door? we could evaluate this design.
- desc: We got to learn more about the Norman doors today and I realized that there
    are lots of norman doors even in our campus. We also got to understand that Norman
    doors is based on perspective. I would like to learn more about the concept of
    user friendly designing.
- desc: Analysis of Education Building door. It is Norman Door.
- desc: Norma
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting I have learned about the evaluation and execution
    in a norman door topic. it is very interesting and fun topic to learn. i like
    it and looking forward to learn and discuss this topic in next meeting. professor
    has made the groups for group project also.
- desc: Today in the class wee learned about 10 neuristics. After that I learned about
    two UX Gulfs which is Evolution and Execution.
- desc: Today we discusses about the design of ED door. I learned that clarity of
    programmer is must for designing good user interface.
- desc: Professor today figure out the door of Education building which was aware
    by all but none noticed it as door says toh PUSH but only opens when handle is
    unlocked.This is the new thing I learned today as we can also turn handle and
    PULL in most of cases.
- desc: "The most critical thing I learned was how execution and evaluation works.\
    \ discussed\_about group projects, explored norman doors, and presented  A video\
    \ of a door with a push sign was also shown.  analysis of door, even a significant\
    \ push is obvious, yet in this instance, it fails,  The handle is clearly handled\
    \ by &amp;quot;push,&amp;quot; and I learnt how assessment works.  the implementation\
    \ is effective, and if we have any questions, it is also effective.  evaluation\
    \ would be slow as well."
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today you talked about the design of a norman door that
    you saw in the university. So, the problem was that the door was automatic, but
    the battery died so that you couldn&#039;t open it, and that was a bad design
    because there was a handle that gave you the feeling that you had to pull the
    door, but they wrote the word &amp;quot;push,&amp;quot; and you had to push it.
    Thanks
- desc: From the example of Education building door, I learnt the important thing
    that the gulf size in using that door is big. I.e. We need to execute multiple
    times and try to evaluate the interface multiple times before having successful
    operation of that particular user interface. Hence, for a good user interface,
    the gap between two gulfs- execution and evaluation should be small.
- desc: Today the teacher said personal homework, and then watched the video of ED
    DOOR and NORMAN DOOR. pushing is clear but pushing doesn&#039;t workhandle is
    ambiguow,helped by push.
- desc: continued our discussions on evaluation and execution, the two gulfs of UX
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is about the Norman door example taken
    by the Professor inside the education building and I actually went with my other
    class mate and we investigated the usefulness of this door and it appeared is
    makes it really confusing t open the door and also so hard to open he door automatically
    for the people with special needs since the button is way far away and is not
    close to the door.
- desc: Today, I will mainly talk about the deadline of Assignment 1 and ED Door&#039;s
    related problems and thoughts
- desc: The gulf of interaction is an important concept that I learned today, regarding
    the Norman door on the first floor. What makes this door so confusing is that
    you have to turn the handle and push, but the push bar implies that you don&#039;t
    have to turn the handle. I&#039;m also curious as to whether the automatic opening
    button works without having to twist the handle.
know-more:
- desc: I would like to know more about design and user experiences other than just
    doors and the marble answering machine.  I feel it is hard to get a grasp on the
    bigger picture if we keep resorting to the same set of examples every week.
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we discussed about the Norman doors, we saw some\
    \ videos about the same. He also showed some of the Norman doors on the campus\
    \ of University Of Regina. The topic of Norman door is debatable because some\
    \ people like push while some like to pull the door on the same place. I would\
    \ like to know more about the Norman doors and its concepts and also how it creates\
    \ problems for some people while not for some others."
- desc: I would like to know the benefits of empathy in a design.
- desc: I would like to know more about how evaluation and execution can be used for
    user interface implementation.
- desc: The Gulf of execution and the Gulf of evaluation are literally new topics
    for me that I would like to dig a bit more deeper. The Gulf of execution and the
    gulf of evaluation are the concepts that are essential to understanding the interaction
    between humans and computers. I would really like to explore more about how it
    helps humans in interacting with the machines and vice versa and in it might turn
    out to be a good topic in the class discussion. But overall it&#039;s a great
    topic to do some research.
- desc: I wish we had covered a little bit more on the gulf of evaluation and execution
- desc: We learned and analysed door for university of regina. We discussed about
    what factors contribute or through which we can determine if a door is norman
    door or not and basically if we see a door  and if we are able to open it without
    knowning about it or knowning the activity which is performed in opening door
    is considered as good example for it. I would like to know more about it as subject
    can be argumentative when it comes to choice as some may think to push while other
    may think to pull
- desc: A door, so common yet many of us fails to use it properly. This was an interesting
    topic to discuss about in today&#039;s class as it brings forth the understanding
    of human psychology.
- desc: Today we discussed Norman Doors and Dr. Hepting had some examples of norman
    doors on campus. I am intriguied about whether a norman door would still be considered
    a norman door if people in a certain environment had developed an intuition to
    always pull a door first, and for them what we consider norman doors, would be
    the perfect design. I belive that the concept of norman doors is a bit subjective
    based on who is using it. I would like to look more into the invention of Norman
    Doors.
- desc: I wanted more information about the assignment- Empathize with teacher; the
    Empathy map- whether the user will be the teacher or the student.
