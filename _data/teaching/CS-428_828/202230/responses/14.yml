difficult:
- desc: If we want to cheat on attendance, we can do anyhow. I like classic way calling
    everyone&#039;s name, so instructor can remember students&#039; names ang faces.
- desc: The thing I found difficult to understand was about the tradeoffs. I could
    not really understand what are tradeoffs and how it works in terms of attendance
    when you discussed in class.
important:
- desc: Similar to writing, metaphors are employed in web design to link real-world
    concepts and objects to the website&#039;s pixels. Time is of the essence when
    exploring a website because web readers have a shorter attention span than print
    readers. It may appear extremely little and something that can be neglected. A
    straightforward metaphor just has one connection between the subject and the metaphorical
    object. As a result, the subject receives a single meaning from the vehicle.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discussed the usefulness of password for attendance
    and Dr. Hepting suggested to remove the password altogether so students can submit
    their attendance without a password like clocking in for work which does not requires
    a password from their boss. One of the students also suggested to restrict the
    attendance so only people with IP address from UofR can submit it and we continued
    the discussion with the tradeoffs. He also discussed more about project and extended
    the Due date to Oct. 17f
- desc: "Today\u2019s discussion was quite interesting as we had to discuss about\
    \ the pros and cons of having a password and not having a password for online\
    \ attendance marking. Also we had few discussions about pros and cons of professors\
    \ website. Overall enjoyed the class."
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss about the Project part I, its due date is
    extended to October 17. He tries to explain with the example of website and discuss
    its flaws.
- desc: I thought the discussion of having a password was interesting as an agency
    vs security issue. Although I feel like the password is unnecessary as students
    who are not here can easily get the password through their friends.
- desc: 'With interfaces, it is better to lay out what your end result should be (e.g.,
    attendance: restrict who? What are we trying to capture) prior to developing the
    interface.'
- desc: The most important thing I&#039;d learnt today was about the concept of tradeoffs.
    Tradeoffs are basically the limitations or the compromises that a developer would
    be faced with, in exchange for offering/ modifying/ deleting a feature from a
    product. I&#039;d learnt this through the illustration of the attendance system,
    where the dilemma between an agency vs security style of attendance marking was
    discussed. The metaphors for the agency &amp;amp; security are &amp;quot;too general&amp;quot;
    &amp;amp; &amp;quot;too specific&amp;quot; respectively.
- desc: Personally the attendance system works fine as it should they only thing is
    that honesty is the best policy so keep it open for the first 15 minutes of the
    class and the students can do the attendance without needing to tell them but
    with a password so that student who are absent cannot which in some cases they
    still can get the password or the alternative way would be to write the students
    name down in class but that is time consuming during the lecture time.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is assessing the necessity of each
    part of our functions. I had not considered the real necessity of having a password
    for the attendance activity. The password takes a considerable amount of time
    to be posted on the website and shown in class. However, it does not serve much
    protection, since it can easily be shared between students. Therefore, it might
    be more beneficial to have no password at all.
- desc: "In todays class, we discussed about the project assignment that\u2019s due\
    \ next week. We need to select a website and draw empathy maps for different roles."
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is the trade-offs of having to use
    a password for attendance. No password means it will be easier and more convenient
    for people to log in to their attendance, but having no password also means that
    there is less security for blocking those who are not in class.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned was that Attendance is a great cause
    of concern for students as counts towards your class participation. And there
    are different ways the attendance can be recorded both manually and online, but
    some students take an advantage of it by marking their attendance from outside
    the class while skipping the lectures which is not acceptable at any learning
    institution. Students must be asked to provide evidence whether they have attended
    the lecture or not.
- desc: The attendance system works fine as it is set up now. I don&#039;t think much
    improvement can be made to it unless the professor decides to check everyone&#039;s
    student ID to confirm it. The professor&#039;s website is useful. I can find all
    of the course information on there easily. Some students made find some information
    on there to be redundant because they are available on UR Courses as well.
- desc: How to improve tge attendance system in UR courses.
- desc: In the 14th session, Dr. Hepting more talked about attendance and group project.
    The first thing he suggested was a new date for part 1. A few minutes later, he
    explained how students keep attendance records. He then suggested showing the
    attendance password/QR code directly to students. He challenged this issue with
    this question. Again using a few metaphors he tried to overcome the problem. In
    the end, he wrapped up the session with headlines.
- desc: We resumed our discussion of UR Course attendance, particularly the use of
    passwords, in this class. He proposed attendance without a password, while other
    students preferred limited participation by IP address. We also spoke about how
    an attendance without a password is less safe.
- desc: In the meeting, the importance of password to attendance was discussed. is
    it necessary or not. Privacy for password is important too.
- desc: Today we discussed how to improve UR Courses website attendance metaphors.
    We also discussed how to make DR heptings website more user friendly.
- desc: The most important thing which I learned today was Design thinking, trade
    off and about the attendance
- desc: Today we discussed about metaphors of attendence and how can we make the webpage
    better and more accurate. We also discussed about group project and briefly about
    empathy maps.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we discuss about group projects.
- desc: "started with &amp;quot;happy wednesday,&amp;quot; talked about the group\
    \ project and extended it to October 17, and I learned that we had to create interfaces\
    \ and select, and we had to compare our website using html or Powerpoint.proffesor\_\
    also talked about some ideas related to the attendance, and the steps were for\
    \ students to click on an attendance, be asked for a password, and why not display\
    \ the qr code/passcode for the students."
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today you talked a little about the course project and
    the process of doing it. Afterward, you discussed how the attendance system of
    the URcourses works and what we can consider to make a better experience for the
    users. Thanks
- desc: 'Today, we could dive more deep into the attendance issue and the most important
    thing I learnt from it was the scrutiny of the issue itself. After exploring different
    solutions, there were two trade offs that could be identified: Security and Metaphor
    being too specific/to general.'
- desc: Today we discussed the timing of midterms and then discussed the details of
    the next group project.
- desc: Today, we discussed more about the metaphors for attendance and whether passwords
    are useful. The metaphors have some tradeoffs, they can never be too general or
    too specific and need to be balanced. We also discussed about the projects and
    Dr. Hepting mentioned that we can use his website for the project.
- desc: How to improve the attendance and disccussed about the project.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned Is how we should the form the project
    and the UR Course attendance and especially the usefulness of password. He suggested
    attendance without a password while some students were more in-favor of restricting
    the attendance with IP address. We also discussed the trade of such as an attendance
    without a password is less secure.
- desc: Today&#039;s discussion continues based on a group project and the role of
    metaphor. After that, we exchanged different views in the group and determined
    some ideas and directions for implementation
know-more:
- desc: The thing about which I would most like to know more is actual design philosophy.  Having
    to ride a bus to university to get an attendance mark just to spend the whole
    class debating on how that attendance should be taken is getting very exhausting.
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we continued our discussion on the metaphors for\
    \ attendance and also added if the password is useful or not. We also discussed\
    \ about the Project and also DR. Hepting gave us permission to use his website\
    \ for the project."
- desc: I learned different ways to make website more interactive today
- desc: The thing about which I would most like to know more is another example besides
    Attendance that we can explore more. Also what is agency vs security in trade
    offs that we talked about in class.
- desc: "I don\u2019t understand why do we need \u201CToday\u201D section anyway?,\
    \ When we have a daily meeting section already.  I would like to know how we could\
    \ make it more useful?"
- desc: I would like to know more about how to analyze an interface.
- desc: "I want to know more about project section how it\u2019s going to be also\
    \ discussion on attendance is going on while Professor website is good as we can\
    \ get details from there."
- desc: Somebody mentioned that there should be a restriction regarding IP addresses
    for the attendance code. I&#039;m interested in learning if that is possible and
    if it would help with our problem of balancing participation marks and difficulty.
