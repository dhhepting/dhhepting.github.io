difficult:
- desc: The response of design to its environment. Today&#039;s discussion was focused
    on the switching of bluetooth on a computer and reflecting it on the evaluation
    and execution gulfs. An idea presented in the article was that those gulfs transcend
    styles and devices which I slightly disagree. The way systems are understood is
    dependentant on the medium. You wouldn&#039;t use text to indicate traffic signals
    you&#039;d need lights to send a signal to cars. Systems get understood a certain
    way so why do gulfs transcend devices?
important:
- desc: Users must face the dual obstacles of comprehending the existing state of
    a system and figuring out how to change it with each encounter. By being aware
    of these gaps and bridging them with an open conceptual model, designers may help
    these groups.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discussed about various metaphor and interface issues.
    Example include light switch where a user will try atleast once to turn on the
    switch. Also, turning ON/OFF bluetooth on PC is tricky. Labelling both the sides
    of the button could be a possible solution inorder to avoid confusion.
- desc: I personally think the most misleading thing about bluetooth control is what
    you can actually accomplish with it.  I know many technically illiterate people
    who connect things via bluetooth expecting to do things like share wireless signals,
    screenshare, or other features that it does not do.  I&#039;m not sure there is
    anything you could do with the interface to fix that.
- desc: Midterm is on 21. In class student discuss about doors. Professor asked if
    we have any interface examples that are having problems. The next students discuss
    about Bluetooth features.
- desc: Today we looked at examples of the gulfs of execution and evaluation. We looked
    at a bluetooth example and I thought the metaphor with a switch as quite accurate
    as many switches label the on/off as I/O which can be confusing depending on how
    you interpret it.
- desc: 'We are talking about university doors and the problems and need to redesign
    also some interaction examples like  bluetooth and we explained some metaphors
    for that like switching buttons: Light switch  Control panel  Console Close/Open'
- desc: Discussed about midterm and university&#039;s doors
- desc: The most important thing I&#039;d learned today was the use of the metaphor
    of a toggling regular switch for understanding the bluetooth switch in the control
    panel in Windows. Here, the switch clearly showed that the underlying operations
    involved in the process need not be recalled, but simply recognising the switch
    and familiar labels were good enough to bridge the gap of execution and evaluation
    involved in manipulating the system&#039;s bluetooth function.
- desc: We talked about the interface for windows 10 and 11 where you switch bluethooth
    on and off.
- desc:  A switch is something we learn and has become part of natural actions.  If it
    doesnâ€™t work one way, we will automatically try the other. Online switches are the
    same thing; if one way, we will try the other
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is how powerful metaphors can be.
    Reinforcing the metaphor can often be the most powerful way of helping the user
    identify the functionality. Feedback is also beneficial for the user to be able
    to identify the current state and current progress.
- desc: In todays meeting we discussed a lot about metaphors and interface issues.
    One interface issue I can think of is the placement of light switches on a switch
    board. You also feel like you are solving a puzzle when you try to switch on a
    specific light, you can never do it one try.  Maybe this is something that needs
    to be worked on to make the interface universal and keep its design consistent
    throughout.
- desc: Bluetooth settings should be standardized between devices so that it is more
    easily understandable. Currently I think that Apple does a good job of making
    it simple with having Bluetooth and other devices split between multiple spots
    in settings.
- desc: Today we spoke more about the Midterm!
- desc: The most important thing  I learned today is the use of switches in a user
    interface. Having only one label on one side can be confusing if the switch is
    on or off, so it&#039;s better to have labels on both sides; or have the system
    show a message.
- desc: The possible ideas of midterm
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is when we talked about a different
    example of interface that is problematic. An example of this would be the Bluetooth
    function in Windows. Disabling the adding bluetooth when it is not on and the
    label of the bluetooth button can be confusing which can cause users who are not
    very technically some problems. Another example we talked about is the switch
    with a label of | and O. How they are read and what their meaning can be confusing.
- desc: Label both the sides of the on anf off switch for bluetooth settings on windows
- desc: 'The bluetooth feature on windows has issues with its design. The disable
    function needs to be labelled on both sides of the switch like on off on either
    side and have the button moves to the correct side. It should only display the
    name of devided its connected to when its actually connected to it. Some of the
    metaphors for this is: light switch, control panel, bathroom lock vacant/occupied.'
- desc: There are many examples of Norman doors in old buildings like our university
    because it is cheaper and more efficient to add and remove features to the door
    instead of redesigning and replacing the entire door. For a simple interface with
    insignificant effects like a light switch, feedback is unnecessary because the
    user can simply do and undo its functions with no consequence.
- desc: The format of the midterm.
- desc: Possible question on the midterm.
- desc: "Dr.Hepting then asked in Mtg 19 if there were any other doors that required\
    \ additional information in addition to those from AV services and elevators.\
    \  Daryl then inquired as to whether we had come across any examples of problematic\
    \ interfaces. Yes! A first-time laundry machine without instructions and user\_\
    \_must rely on the poster rather than the machine.  While discussing a Bluetooth\
    \ feature on a Windows 10 device, the user had been valiantly attempting to connect\
    \ BT. He eventually found a related page."
- desc: 'Brainstormed metaphors for bluetooth and switch from the two UX gulfs: evaluation
    and execution. Consistency is important in design thinking.'
- desc: In the meeting it is mentioned about doors in the university which needs to
    improve in design. Also some other interface example such as laundry machine which
    has some problems. bluetooth item was explained. We talked about some metaphors
    for that. Such as light switch, control panel or console, bathroom door lock and
    close/open. The importance of feedback was mentioned as well.
- desc: Today in class I learned about bluetooth example which was tales about in
    class and few ideas which can make that interface better. Such as label both the
    sides with on and off, disable adding bluetooth when it is not on. Also talked
    about the idea of 1 and 0 switch, LTR, RTL switches.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we have discussed the topic and questions for our
    midterm which is on Friday.
- desc: I learned today Bluetooth settings and similar metaphors to it
- desc: Type of questions that could be asked jn midterm.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we continued discussion what questions can be asked
    in midterm and we talked a bit more about different types of doors present itself
    in our university of Regina. Moreover we discussed on the ways to solve bluetooth&#039;s
    interface problem
- desc: started with &amp;quot;happy Wednesday&amp;quot; and discussed interfaces
    and metaphors, using examples such as &amp;quot;switch,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Bluetooth,&amp;quot;
    and &amp;quot;some unmet needs to interfaces,&amp;quot; and covered different
    interface designs that were observed that are problematic, one of which is the
    laundry machine.
- desc: Hello Prof. Hepting. Today you talked about the switch button which is using
    in mobile devices for turning on and off the Bluetooth. You used actual switches
    metaphor for turning a light on and off and compare these together to review the
    user experience. Thanks
- desc: Today got to know more about metaphors for different applications and some
    of the inconsistent meanings drerived from those. I.e. On the bathrooms&#039;
    doors, for some it is &#039;closed/open&#039; and for others it is &#039;vacant/occupied&#039;.
    This creates inconsistency and great confusion to users. Hence, this point I found
    the most important today.
- desc: We discussed more about the midterm and the possible questions on the midterm.
    Someone mentioned if we need to know about any other &amp;quot;Norman Doors&amp;quot;
    on campus which could come as an example in the midterm. Dr. Hepting also mentioned
    the Bluetooth example wherein sometimes it is difficult to add the bluetooth device
    on various machines. I related to this problem very much since I bought a bluetooth
    headset YESTERDAY! and had the same problem with and had to read the fine print
    instructions to figure it out.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned the interface that windows has for
    the Bluetooth is not really easy to use for some users. Also, the button or activate
    and deactivate Bluetooth is somehow a resemble for the control panel or a switch.
- desc: In this lesson, we mainly discuss some problems about the midterm exam and
    Bluetooth interface, analyze its advantages and disadvantages and discuss how
    to improve it.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is how the same design can be
    perceived differently by different people who have different experiences. The
    main idea is that we want our design to make the message as unambiguous as possible,
    which usually means following the industry standards.
know-more:
- desc: more guidance on what will be in the midterm from the textbook
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we discussed more about the Midterm Questions. Also\
    \ we discussed more about the other Norman doors on the campus, and relating to\
    \ that we also discussed the switches. Gulf of Execution was one of the topic\
    \ as well!. Further on Dr Hepting discussed about the confusing Bluetooth settings\
    \ on Windows 10 and how the GUI plays an role in that."
- desc: The metaphors for Bluetooth button was an interesting topic, I was thinking
    of maybe using Boolean/traffic light as a metaphor for that Bluetooth setting.
    However, the difficult part for me to understand was Norman door concept. If you
    can record your class, it would be great so that we can review it at our convenience.
- desc: "I would like to know the concept of metaphors that has bee discussed in today&#039;s\
    \ class. A metaphor is a figure of speech that describes an object or action in\
    \ a way that isn\u2019t literally true, but helps explain an idea or make a comparison.\
    \ It allows the user to get an insight of how the interface of the application\
    \ is going to look like. Best practice for it would be to initialize into your\
    \ day to day chores and understand the core concepts of it."
- desc: Various ways to design ON/OFF switch which makes more sense to user about
    functioning of it.
- desc: I would like to know more about the midterm as I get to know what to how much
    to prepare as I am confused about it.
- desc: How it relates Quick settings of MS for bluetooth and whether it is consistent.
    I could not relate to that part in today&#039;s class.
- desc: Discussed about door problem and another interface problematic examples.
