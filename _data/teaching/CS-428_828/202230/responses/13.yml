difficult:
- desc: Perhaps instead of trying to ascribe potential benefits to an interface or
    feature, it is best to consider what that interface actually provides in the first
    place.  Taking attendance is good for trying to indicate if someone was present,
    but nothing else.  It will not show if they paid attention, understood the content,
    ect.  Making up potential uses for something just to justify it is the opposite
    of good user design.
important:
- desc: An interface metaphor in user interface design is a collection of user interface
    images, actions, and procedures that take advantage of the specialized subject
    knowledge that users already possess. The interface metaphor&#039;s main goal
    is to instantly inform the user on how to interact with the user interface. It
    can be created in many ways. Like we have the different keywords for it and different
    user matrix for it.
- desc: Today we continued our discussion about improving the attendance in our class.
    In our group discussion, our group decided that taking a selfie and uploading
    it to the urcourse to prove that you attended the classs or a quick quiz after
    the class is a great way to make sure someone attended the class or not. A quick
    quiz will be most helpful as it will check if the student paid attention to the
    class or not. Having a time limit (like 5-15 min in the start of the class) to
    do the attendance was another great
- desc: I learned today what types of metaphor can be attached to the attendance system
    and how it can me implemented.
- desc: In Today&#039;s class we have discuss about the empathy map one more time.
    We also discuss metaphor about cave art and punching time. For example, faced
    ID, open window for specific time in which student have to entered attendance
    code.
- desc: Today we further discussed improvements and metaphors for UR Courses attendance.
    My group came up with the idea of students having to submit some sort of passcode
    to our class wiki as an attendance. We also looked at the option of not having
    any passcode but students would need to submit their attendance within the first
    10 or 15 minutes or so of class. It will be similar to punching in at work where
    if you do not punch in within a certain timeframe, you will be marked late or
    absent.
- desc: Empathy map and additional features that can be added to your courses were
    discussed.
- desc: "Today i\u2019d learnt more about the concept of empathy maps and their role\
    \ in UI/ UX design. The empathy map was described as a 4 quadrant map with the\
    \ labels, Says, Thinks, Does, Feels for each quadrant. Thinks and Says is almost\
    \ similar, with Thinks referring to asking yourself what you\u2019ve to do to\
    \ achievw something. Says technically means thinking aloud. Does refers to your\
    \ actions involved in your interaction with the software. Feels refers to your\
    \ emotional status, whild interacting with the software."
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was to be more realistic in offering
    alternatives and new features to a problem. This is specifically for my suggestion
    of using a selfie feature to record attendance, which is very similar to how proctor
    track worked. This is somewhat not realistic, considering the technical difficulties
    with it.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discussed about metaphors regarding attendance that
    have more features. I think giving small timed pop quizzes can be helpful in marking
    attendance as well as seeing if the students have been paying attention to the
    material taught in the class.
- desc: I really liked the idea of having a random code or statement used as the attendance
    password so that it is something specific that is said only in class. A response
    to a joke or something similar would be great
- desc: Again today we discussed more about the metaphors regarding class attendance
    and how we can change the possible ways of recording it. In our group we discussed
    how we could add a Quiz at the beginning, during the course of the lecture and
    at the end of the lecture to make sure that attendance has been recorded only
    for the students that are actually present in the class. Also spoke about the
    Empathy Map which we came across in the First Individual Assignment.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is to make a student want to show
    up more for class; the attendance for &amp;quot;present&amp;quot; should be unavailable
    after some time has passed. That way, they&#039;ll need to show up at starting
    time.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today is we discussed the new feature
    of UR course attendance.
- desc: I liked the discussion of different metaphors for attendance like using fingerprint
    scanner, unique password for each student, secure timecard, etc
- desc: In our discussion group, the metaphor for UR Courses that we came up with
    was apps that use GPS to track our location. It is a good metaphor because it
    can accurately track our location whenever the app is active. Turning the app
    on to confirm our location could be useful in taking attendance.
- desc: How to use metaphors to explain software
- desc: 'Daryl continues the metaphor topic. He clarified the order of difficulty
    for each of the four elements of this map. The elements of the empathy map are
    Does, Say, Feel, and Think (easiest to hardest). So, when dealing with others,
    we should always ask them to use a think-aloud protocol to reduce the difficulty.
    He also mentioned a couple of metaphors from the previous day. Daryl explained
    secure time cards like: fingerprint scanners, Face IDs, and retinal scans. Consider
    what URCourse at attendance might be'
- desc: We mainly talked about metaphors for UR courses attendance which could give
    new features. As a class we came up answers like restricting the time to mark
    attendance, pop quiz, tap feature in class, etc.
- desc: In the meeting we talked about metaphors from last day include cave art, punching
    time card, using finger print scanner to identify yourself or face ID and so on.
    In group discussion we conclude some results. Trade-offs, limiting ability to
    record attendance, encription, pop quiz an so on.
- desc: Today in class we continued the discussion regarding metaphors. We also had
    a brief review about the empathy maps which we are supposed to hand in with the
    assignment due today.
- desc: Today we discussed more about the metaphors of attendance and understood what
    other methods can be used as alternatives for attendance. We also had group discussion
    about it and get to know others point of view. As an example we thought that an
    interactive exercise on topics discussed on classes with small time frame would
    be a good alternative for both attendance and class interactions too.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting we asked question related to assignment 1 after that
    we have discussed the metaphors about recording attendance. in next meeting professor
    will talk about group projects.
- desc: The most importanat thing that I leraned today was about different metaphors
    about attendance and then we had a discussion about empathy map.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we did group discussion regarding options or what features
    we can add to ur courses for attendance. In group we discussed both traditional
    method and modern method to do it. Traditional method is the one when professor
    can make excel sheet and take attendance by taking names in class and other way
    to add authentication through which student are allowed to register only if they
    are logged in to university wifi
- desc: "started with happy Monday, the most important thing I learned was some depth\
    \ about empathy maps, as it is segmented as thinks, says easier, does easiest,\
    \ and what we feel, and discussed about metaphors\_and the examples of them are\
    \ purchasing a time card, cave art, and there is a group discussion about the\
    \ new techniques that can be implemented in your courses attendance, like using\
    \ a fingerprint scanner to identify yourself, face id and scan, and how can we\
    \ implement the metaphors to reveal these featu"
- desc: Hello Prof. Hepting. Today, you talked about the empathy map and guided us
    on how to write it for assignment 2. Then you gave us two questions about replacements
    for taking attendance in the URcourses to discuss. Thanks
- desc: 'Today in group discussion, I could think of the ways for attendance issue
    in terms of metaphors. We could think of a solution for attendance: as students
    we can take our selfie which will be uploaded with the timestamp. However, the
    professor needs to verify the pictures manually.'
- desc: today we group discussion about how can we describe the attendence QR_code
    and design a new way to find how it upgrade.
- desc: today we started with reminding of the assignment 1 being due today at 11:59,
    then we learned more about metaphor and then we had group discussions on what
    way attendance should be taken on urcources.
- desc: Today, we continued our discussion about the metaphors for attendance. We
    had to have a group discussion about the metaphors and come up with a better solution
    for attendance on UR Courses. A number of viable ideas were discussed and my group
    came up with the idea of having the attendance code discussed in class and then
    submitting it in the response to meeting. Only people in class would know the
    discussed code and it&#039;ll also engage the students with the course material
    every meeting.
- desc: New ways to integrate attendance into urcourses.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is the best metaphor for recording
    attendance could be made through doing a quiz with timed password so the people
    who do not attend cannot see the password since will be timed. Or we could use
    QR codes with encrypted codes so no one will be see it because we can time it
    as well.
- desc: Today&#039;s class mainly discusses the problem of Attendance on homework
    1, and discusses various forms of Attendance
know-more:
- desc: Different types of attendance formats (using a unique keyword that must be
    included in response, having the QR code automatically decide your type of attendance,
    or something of that sort)
- desc: "In today\u2019s meeting we discussed about the metaphors for the attendance.\
    \ We also performed the group discussion for the same and also came up with the\
    \ alternative for the attendance. Many viable ideas were discussed such as taking\
    \ a real time photo in the class and submitting it, proving answer to the question\
    \ at the very moment during the class etc. Also there was a discussion of the\
    \ empathy map for todays\u2019 individual assignment."
- desc: I would like to know more of how we can make the UR Courses attendance better
    without needing to login to UR Courses and a put a password in because it takes
    about 5-10 minutes during the class time for the attendance.
- desc: What extent is security an important factor in design? In today&#039;s discussion
    we were looking at different methods for attendance. A general consensus revolved
    around discussing the level of security of the attendance. The current system
    right now allows for students to count for attendence without attending the class.  Items
    like require photos and pop quizzes help eliminate that risk at the cost of being
    time consuming. Which interface interactions value security over convivence?
- desc: Discussion about the attendance metaphor was a kind of brainstorming topic.
    I am not sure if we can have &amp;quot;Roll numbers&amp;quot; as a metaphor. As
    in, each student can be assigned a roll number and teacher can just take attendance
    in the class. I would like to get reviews on that. Also, it was a bit hard for
    me to understand the empathy map quadrant - &amp;quot;Feel&amp;quot;.
- desc: The thing about which I would most like to know more is about Empathy Maps
    - how to build one using an example, what it means, and why do we have to do them.
    Another thing I would like to know more is the metaphors and what is the importance
    of it (why are we exactly learning about them because it is a bit hard to understand)
- desc: I would like to know more about metaphors in connection to taking everyday&#039;s
    class attendence
- desc: The most important thing that I would like to know about is that I have learned
    that an empathy map is indeed a very crucial componenet if we are planning any
    sort of activitied because I allows us to have a good understanding of how the
    things are going to work and what will be the views or the judgements of others
    towards your work and your agenda. As though this course entirely revolved around
    empathizing towards ones approached so a deeper knowledge would help in getting
    good results in the future.
- desc: What is the most complete and simple way to check attendance? It&#039;s best
    to have them monitor each other. Some sort of giving extra points for finding
    someone&#039;s absence.
- desc: Metaphors. I&#039;m not sure what&#039;s happening in here. Most of the metaphor
    doesn&#039;t even makes sense to me.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today was the Empathy Map which we
    have been discussing since last week. It was a nice group discussion to continue
    for the Attendance Metaphors with different perspectives. Discussing about metaphors
    is a good topic but I would like to focus more about the ideas and solutions for
    design layouts which will get more practical practice for real time projects.
- desc: we are on great discussion right now that how we can change the attendance
    portal with some new features as per my point of view we can go with small quiz
    in anytime on class so that prof can check the students participation and involvement
    with minimum time period so code sending to other team mates chances are decreased
    though I am looking out for more options how to improve system.
- desc: I would like know more about Empathy maps. where, when and how to use them
    as it is a part of assignment 1.
- desc: Various ways to take attendance and integrate it in urcourses.
- desc: Today we discussed about different metaphors for the attendence site. I would
    like to know more on how to identify or on basis we can use metaphors to make
    our design better and useable.
- desc: I learned on how there can be an metahpor to attendence on UR courses
- desc: About caveman and door as I missed the class
- desc: I&#039;m interested in learning more about how empathy maps are used by professionals
    as part of their design process.
