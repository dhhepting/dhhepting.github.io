difficult:
- desc: I am confused as to why so many people feel that the UR Self Service site
    is not a good interface.
- desc: It&#039;s frustrating that I still can&#039;t attend class because of the
    Covid-19. I&#039;m really curious what is going on in class.
important:
- desc: 'Today I learned that if a website is pretty or have a really good design
    it does not mean the interface is good. For a website to have a good interface
    it needs to meet all or most of the following: It needs to be Consistency (from
    one page to another), user friendly, reliable (does not output any errors), it
    has to be easy to use for the end user, responsive (no delays) and readable  (no
    fancy fonts or colour that would make it hard to read). Also everyone aggress
    that our Uni Website has a bad interface.'
- desc: We learned and discussed the user interface in terms of good or bad. Exemplary
    interfaces are user-friendly and functional, keeping the user satisfied and beneficial
    while using the system, such as interfaces are Gmail, Outlook, Google Maps, Slack,
    and Discord. A bad user interface confuses the user with a lack of information
    or unnecessary information, which misleads the user. Suppose the interface for
    real-time systems is challenging to understand or confuses the user.
- desc: There is nothing to respond to from this meeting.  We did not do anything
    meaningful.
- desc: "Today we understand that what make an interface  For example : interactive\
    \ , reliable , user friendly, accessible and \u2026 before we write the answer\
    \ to the above question we made group of 7 person and we have conversation together\
    \ and talk together about 15 min."
- desc: Learned about marking criteria for this course. Group discussion about good
    and bad interface and its examples.
- desc: Discussed about the characteristics of Good &amp;amp; Bad interfaces. Good
    interfaces are intuitive, user-friendly, easy to navigate, accessible, compatible,
    consistent and reliable. Bad interfaces, on the other hand are overly complicated,
    inconsistent and non compatible, containing unwanted elements, with a poor design
    overall, making them non user-friendly. On an illustrative note, Google maps have
    a good interface, while Apple maps on the other hand have a poorly structured
    interface.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting I learned that reliability, easy navigation, readability,
    security, and responsiveness are the main important keys for a good interface
    otherwise the interface would lack a good user experience. For example uregina.ca
    and transitelive websites are websites that are hard to navigate.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned today was the usefulness of the 5
    Es in assessing a good interphases. The 5 Es are Ease of use, Error Tolerance,  Efficiency,
    Ease of learning, and Engagement. It is also important to note how many other
    important factors (such as ease of navigation, self explanation, and consistency)
    all fall under the five Es. I also learned that the absence of some of the 5 Es
    is a sign of a bad interphase.
- desc: The most important thing we discussed in class today was about good and bad
    interfaces. The 5 E&#039;s (easy to learn, efficient, engaging, error tolerant,
    easy to navigate) and other factors such as accessibility, consistency, intuitiveness
    and comprehensibility. Google  maps, Instagram, Discord can be considered examples
    of good interfaces.
- desc: Apart from the Activity Weights that were discussed, we had an important discussion
    about a Good and a Bad Interface. What makes an interface likeable compared to
    the latter and a few examples of a Good/Bad Interface.
- desc: Today, the most important thing I learned from the discussions is that the
    best user interfaces for general audiences are user-friendly ones; friendly user
    interfaces are easy to navigate and read through. They&#039;re also usually clean
    and visually appealing to most people. General audiences care more about convenience
    and accessibility than the specifics.
- desc: Introduced the mark distribution.We discussed what make an interface good
    or bad and some example.The bad interface example is transitlive.
- desc: The most important thing that I learned in this class is that I get a basic
    understanding of what is a good or bad user interface, the group discussion help
    me a lot.
- desc: In today&#039;s meeting, we have discussed about what makes an interface good
    or bad and different types of examples to it. We learned that interfaces are good
    when it is designed as intuitive, accessible, reliable, has 5 E&#039;s, user friendly,
    consistent and comprehensible so that user who are or will be using the interface
    can have a good experience to it without any errors. An example of good interface
    would be Google because it is very easy to navigate and find what you are looking
    for.
- desc: There are so many websites and applications today that some of them have such
    a bad interface which often gets ignored. After our group discussion we could
    list a handful of applications that are used everyday regardless of the fact that
    it has a bad interface. Simply because there is no alternative for those specific
    applications.
- desc: In today&#039;s class we had a discussion in groups made in the class and
    indeed it was a great experience as getting to know each other and discussing
    the questions about what makes an interface good or bad and their related examples.
    I have learned that concept of cooperation and it was really fun discussing the
    concepts at the end of the lecture while responding to the professor. Other details
    of the course were also discussed such as the overall weightage of the course,
    the assignments, the research project.
- desc: Many factors have to be considered to determine if an interface is good or
    bad. Some of the examples from today&#039;s class was user friendliness, intuitiveness,
    and comprehensiveness. It was interesting to hear that many students found the
    University of Regina Self Service website to have bad interface. An example of
    a good interface was Google.
- desc: 'In this meeting, Dr. Hepting declared the grading and evaluation methods.
    There are two types of assignments, one of which will be the same for both groups,
    and one will be different. Additionally, the number of people needed to complete
    the project (40% in total) was discussed, which could be up to 4 undergraduates
    and graduates can do it alone. Lastly, two discussion questions were asked. What
    makes a good or bad interface? Intuitive, Accessible, Five E&#039;s, user-friendly.
    Good: Google Bad: Livetransit, URs'
- desc: A few things I learned about today were what makes a good UI and some examples
    include of good or bad interface. As we were discussing, all groups came up with
    answers that makes a good UI were 5E&#039;s, reliable, fast, etc and a few good
    examples were google, apple and bad examples are transitive and UR self service.
- desc: It has been explained about students assessments. Respond to Meeting, individual
    assignments, projects, exams, participation and research are so important. Dr.Hepting
    suggested group discussion. All of us joined in a group based on row table where
    we sat. We discussed about interface and example of good and bad interface. Some
    students said about accessible, reliable, user friendly and comprehensive. Ur
    service, google map, transit applications were introduced as examples of bad interface.
- desc: The most important thing which I learned today is to work in a group and get
    to know different people. We talk about what a good or a bad interface looks like
    and also discussed in group some example about the interface.
- desc: In today&#039;s class I learned and discussed about good and bad interfaces
    in groups. it&#039;s fun learning with each other because I have not done any
    group work before so it&#039;s my first time. So talking about good or bad interfaces,
    good interfaces are easy to use, navigate, secure. Examples are Google maps, Instagram,
    discord.  Bad interfaces are transit live, snapchat, webmail etc.
- desc: I learned today what makes an interface good or bad. It&#039;s the most important
    thing to make a user-friendly and reliable interface. Minimum information and
    then adding up things in the sub description.Some good example are quota, Instagram,
    goggle while on the other hand, bad ones are Facebook, Apple maps, transit live.
- desc: "Today is my second class,There is a\_discussion on mark distribution, grading\
    \ for participation in meetings, individual assignments, projects, tests, and\
    \ finally research credit. and asked us to divide into groups of our choice, We\
    \ have a great conversation about interfaces, good and bad apps .The most important\
    \ thing i have learned was about interfaces and grading\_criteria. difficulties\
    \ I had faced today were, the voice not being audible and the text not being visible\
    \ ."
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today me and my new group discussed designing good and
    bad interfaces. We noticed that good interfaces should be user friendly and has
    5 E&#039;s of usability and bad interfaces are ones that are hard to use for the
    users. Also, we chose google and twitter as good interfaces and uregina self service
    as bad one.
- desc: Today, I got a chance to discuss with fellow classmates regarding different
    aspects of user interface. We shared different point of views and got to learn
    from all of them. Also realized that as a user of any application, the interface
    of it is very important factor for many reasons.
- desc: The group discussion was really a good way to know about everyone&#039;s perception
    about what an interface is.
- desc: Today we talked about what makes an interface a good or bad.  The good part
    is basically, efficient, effective, easy to use error tolerant. And the bad part
    is inconsistent, unreliable and the opposite of the five E&#039;s. I learned also,
    the good and bad example for the interfaces.
- desc: I learned what made a good interface, and I got some examples of good or bad
    interfaces during class time.
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture was mainly about the course plan for the semester. Then
    mainly for the other can be discussed, that is, what kind of interface is a good
    interface, whether there is an example to prove the good and bad interface. Our
    group gave some examples and counterexamples through the discussion, and obtained
    some discussion results of other groups.
- desc: Today we discussed what makes a good interface as well as examples of good/bad
    interfaces. The most important thing that we discussed was what my fellow classmates
    think is important in determining whether an interface is good or bad.
know-more:
- desc: In today&#039;s class we have discuss about the syllabus distribution. In
    the group discussion we have discuss about what makes an interface good and bad.
    In class we discuss about good example like amazon and bad example like transit
    user interface. I would be interest to know more about this topics.
- desc: "Today in class we got to participate in a group activity where we came up\
    \ with examples of good or bad interfaces. Our group came up with Google, Youtube,\
    \ or Wikipedia as good websites from an interface perspective. Examples of bad\
    \ ones we came up with were Bing, CTV, CBC, and the U of R\u2019s website. I would\
    \ be really interested to learn more about what applications/websites other students\
    \ consider as examples of good or bad interfaces."
- desc: Today in the meting we discussed about two major questions Q1) What makes
    an Interface good or bad? and Q2) What are some some example of good and bad interface?
- desc: Can too much of one aspect in designing a good user interface be a negative
    thing? There are aspects of the interface that make it good like the ease of use
    and accessibility. Over-emphasis on one can change the practicality behind the
    interface. Take for example accessibility which even though it is important needs
    to consider design for a wider range of audiences which can complicate how/if
    a certain feature can be incorporated into the interface. What&#039;s the right
    balance between access and functionality?
- desc: Today we discussed what makes a good and bad interface. However, we didn&#039;t
    hear what truly made an interface good or bad from the textbook. This will require
    more time since the reason we had stopped was because we had run out of time.
    Also, we didn&#039;t discuss the different types of interfaces available in human-computer
    communication such as the voice or keyboard interfaces. All we talked about was
    website interfaces in which the mouse is used to point at whatever buttons were
    put in the website.
- desc: What makes an interface good or bad? There are several factors to it. But
    which is most and least important, that is what I want to know.
