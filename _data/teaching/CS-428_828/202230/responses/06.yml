difficult:
- desc: I struggled at first with the wiki history system but with a little help from
    the prof and my friends I figured it out. It was also hilarious how he showed
    the entire class a dude who randomly deleted everything off the wiki.
- desc: Marbel answering machine was a very interesting eachtime an incoming voice
    is recorded. topic I learned today. The most interesting thing I learned today
    is it&#039;s working pattern, it spits out marble. The aim was to create a phone
    answering but lack of privacy is biggest disadvantage here as anyone at home can
    listen to anybody&#039;s private message.
- desc: I&#039;m just starting to attend classes, and I&#039;m figuring out what to
    do and how to do it. I first heard of the marble answering machine, so I looked
    it up on the internet. I still do not understand the contents of the figure created
    by connecting the dots described last. I think Dr. Hepting explained something
    in the sense of breaking away from the existing stereotypes, but I still don&#039;t
    get it.
important:
- desc: I think marble answering machine is so important in the sense of blind people
    and the disable people who are not able to capture all the scenario in the real
    time. It is also good for the people whom are the memory loos patient and who
    have to do lot of tasks. But it is difficult for the people who are not comfortable
    with this scenario. Most of the modern voice messaging service has been built
    based on this marble answering machine. This is not the user friendly for all.
- desc: By the end of the class we had a discussion and learned the importance of
    thinking outside the box and not to limit our creativity. In this class Dr. Hepting
    also uploaded the QR code and passcode for the attendance to the website which
    will be very helpful and we also discussed the midterm date and will have an run
    off to finalize the result on Friday. .
- desc: The most important thing I learned today that the marble answering machine
    is tangible and we can see all the messages at once instead of listening to them
    sequentially. Sometimes it gives better feelings than any abstract service. Any
    value can be added to any services if we can thin out of the box.
- desc: From what I could gather today, it looks like the URCourses wikis are awful,
    and difficult to work with even when switching roles between teacher and student.  Given
    the nature of the posts the groups make, I wonder if forums would work better
    so that there can never be multiple students trying to edit at the same time.
- desc: "Today we did an interesting activity  where we had to connect a series of\
    \ 9 dots using only 4 lines and without lifting our pen. It was an interesting\
    \ experiment about thinking \u201Coutside the box\u201D."
- desc: 'today we talk about midterm again.and we want again choose a day between
    Oct 17 or Oct 21 after that we discuss about Marbel answering machine :  Good
    things :  -tangible  -can see all message at once  after that vale We solved a
    question by drawing!'
- desc: Today we discussed mid term exam dates, summary of meetings by group and also
    about out of the box puzzle.
- desc: Today&#039;s lecture enabled me to understand the value of having a marble
    voice mail system in terms of thinking outside the box. Although conventional
    systems possess a set of instructions to access the messages, they could pose
    as a challenge at times, in terms of ease of use, familiarity and general usability.
    However approaches like the RFID voice messaging technique as mentioned could
    solve this issue by offering a more user friendly and secure approach for the
    user to interact with the system.
- desc: The most important thing I learned today was thinking outside the box, and
    how this methodology allows one to formulate and create solutions which are both
    simple and effective. A good example is the new Attendance QR code distribution
    method. I only considered sending the link, but a file solution is both simpler
    and more effective. A link could have issues with confidentiality, but a pdf file
    is much safer. A file is also easier for students to access through any browser.
- desc: "When adding to class wiki, it is important to make sure you are not overwriting\
    \ other students work. Make sure to only add and not modify other additions so\
    \ everyone\u2019s work stays visible."
- desc: We spoke about the video we watched in the last meeting, the marble machine
    that is user friendly as well as efficient. The midterm date was also discussed.
    And the fact each group will now have to write down the classroom discussion in
    class wiki
- desc: The most important thing I learned today is what value something like the
    Marble Machine brings. Sure, the machine has a lot of flaws, but it has creative
    ideas that people can implement. Most answering machines output messages through
    a queue; the marble machine lets the user pick out the messages in any order.
    The value that it brings is out-of-box thinking.
- desc: discuss content
- desc: Thinking of out the box can sometimes help us get solutions to a tricky problem.
    Like the example of connecting 6 dots with 4 straight lines without lifting the
    pen. It was pretty intersting.
- desc: Today meeting was just about the discussion from the previous session about
    the Marble Answering Machine. Professor discussed the merits of using the Marble
    Answering Machine that is tangible and all the messages can be seen at once instead
    of listening them sequentially. Later, the professor has given a 3x3 puzzle. Our
    task was to join the dots with just 4 lines without lifting the pen. He asked
    us to think outside the box  in order to solve it. After all failed attempts,
    professor himself drew it.
- desc: I learned that some features of UR Courses website has poor user interface
    design. The professor and the students were struggling to figure out how the Wiki
    page works on UR Courses. It could not be viewed in consistent format and the
    table of contents could not be consistently displayed.
- desc: The date for the midterm was discussed in class today. It appears that either
    October 17 or October 21 are the final dates for our midterm. Due to an ongoing
    issue with showing our student ID, we were not able to discuss the first assignment,
    but we may have more information on Friday. We did an interesting activity at
    the end of class that challenged us to think &amp;quot;outside the box&amp;quot;
    by connecting all 9 dots using only 4 lines without lifting our pen.
- desc: Today we did an interesting &amp;quot;thinking outside the box&amp;quot; activity
    near the end of class where we had 9 dots in a 3x3 grid pattern and had to connect
    all of them without lifting our pen and using only 4 lines. This was a very interesting
    concept that I got to learn which made me think a closely about this question
    in an interesting way.
- desc: "Marble answering machine has good things. It is tangible and all the messages\
    \ are seen at once instead of listening to them sequentially. Also, We had the\
    \ interesting activity \u201COutside the box\u201D!"
- desc: We discussed about the marble answering machine and about the machine design,
    it&#039;s value and application. I would like to know more about the application
    of the machine in real life.
- desc: I have not attend the class due to some reasons so I don&#039;t know about
    today&#039;s meeting.
- desc: "In today\u2019s lecture I learned about the new place where I can find the\
    \ password for my attendance. Also few instructions about the First individual\
    \ assignment in which the student id will be hidden which is beneficial for all."
- desc: "The wiki and how it would benefit all the groups were the most important\
    \ thing I learnt, and it was also beneficial for students to express their views\
    \ on a weekly basis and\_assign each group the task of summarising the class.encouraged\
    \ to solve a puzzle outside of the box, and spoke about the marble answering machine.\
    \ attendance passcode using PDF helped the students seated on the back benches."
- desc: Today we checked attendance and then watched the class wiki to see what other
    groups thought about design. Then we discussed a lot of issues
- desc: Started with a happy Wednesday. Talked about the nature of the class. Also
    mentioned to talk about the individual assignments the next Friday. It was an
    interesting class as always. Thanks.
- desc: Today, the most important thing I learned while discussing the Marble Answering
    Machine was that it is important to think outside the box. The whole design of
    the machine is non-conventional and inspires us to think outside the box. The
    example of covering all the points of a 3*3 grid with 4 straight lines also shows
    how there are some elegant and innovative solutions if you can try and think outside
    the box.
- desc: About the good design in marble answering machine and even the new puzzle-thinking
    outside the box.
- desc: the most important thing that I learned is about think outside of the box
    and how we can think critically that will help us for this class.
know-more:
- desc: "In today\u2019s class we discussed about the possible mid term dates. Then\
    \ professor explained how to respond to the meetings to summarise the group discussions.\
    \ Then we studied the characteristics of good design for marble answering machine\
    \ and values."
- desc: In today&#039;s class we discuss about midterm date it can be conducted on17
    or 21 October. Next we do the out of the box activity, we need to used all the
    9 dots and without lifting our pen and only 4 lines are allowed to use. It will
    be fun to do this kind of activity more.
- desc: Learning to use UR Courses and all the different options available.
- desc: Good things about the marble machine are that it is Interactive, User friendly
    and Tangible. The value of the marble answering machine is that it help the people
    who are not tech savvy, the voice messages can be played back easily, it arranges
    the message in order it was received and also it determines who the message is
    for and can directly call back the person if needed.  Also narrowed down the Midterm
    dates October 17th or 21st.  did a puzzle in which we have to connect 9 dots using
    4 lines.
- desc: I would like to know more about implementing the marble answering machine
    in real world and we talked about midterm.
- desc: "At the end of today\u2019s class, Dr Hepting showed us how to connect a 3*3\
    \ square of dots using only 4 lines. This helped to think outside the box. I want\
    \ to know about how we can apply that kind of thinking when building designs for\
    \ our interfaces."
- desc: To what extent should ingenuity be a factor in user interfaces? Problem-solving
    and the way you complete tasks have creative action in thinking outside the box.
    With the marble machine, the tangibility can be considered ingenuity when considering
    voice mail interfaces and with the dot puzzle, you had to draw outside the box
    to connect the entire 3x3 grid.  Is there value in having some ingenuity in any
    design or are there instances that should only follow proper interface design
    patterns?
- desc: I would like to more about the implementation of the marble answering machine
    in the real world and with user interfaces.
- desc: I would like to know more about how to use the course wiki?
- desc: I would love to know more about the group project and assignment 1 so I can
    get a head start on it.
- desc: Today we discussed about midterm and then continued our discusison on Marble
    answering machine. I would like to learn more about the value of marble answering
    machine.
- desc: In todays meeting we discussed about midterm dates almost finalize from 2
    now also individual assignments and project will be discussed on Friday. I learned
    today something new connecting 3*3 dots with only 4 lines.I would like to know
    more about assignment and project in upcoming meeting.
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Actually I want to discuss different types of user interfaces
    and the users experience. I appreciate it if you consider it more in the class.
    Thanks
- desc: I would like to know more about the value added by marble answering machine.
    Since most of the values and importance were identified by the group discussion,
    I am curious to know more about this.
- desc: Today we mainly discussed the meeting wiki. I created a template that is formatted
    so the Table of Contents shows up properly. I am interested in knowing whether
    people are open to using the template and if it makes life easier for them or
    if I just wasted an hour :)
