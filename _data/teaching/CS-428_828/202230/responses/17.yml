important:
- desc: In this meeting we had two speakers from SaskPower who discussed about their
    interface design and how they use user-centered model to develop their design.
    It was interesting to know about their Digital Design Lab and also that they handle
    all of the production and distribution of electricity in Saskatchewan.
- desc: Today I have learned about saskpower &#039;s Digital testing lab and their
    testing techniques for different users and employees.  Users are able to take
    a survey and share experience, so that based on their data, the authority can
    take measures to improve the user interface of their website so that they can
    provide a useful and user friendly interface.
- desc: Todays lecture was interesting as we had a seminar from Saskpower people and
    also came to know how important a customer feedback is. Also came to know how
    the design of an application is important.
- desc: It was interesting to see that SaskPower used the same accessibility site
    and resources I did for the lab pages.  I did not know about Hemmingway, which
    is a shame since it seemed useful.  The most interesting thing I learned was the
    click test, and the format of the click tree.  I have never seen how this test
    was actually formatted before.
- desc: I thought the SaskPower presentation today was quite interesting. I thought
    it was especially interesting to see how important incorporating user feedback
    was to designing a good interface. As an interface will be used by many people,
    it should be easy to use for people of all education backgrounds.
- desc: SaskPower&#039;s structure is vastly different than the structure in the US.  It
    is interesting that SaskPower covers all parts of the power process from generation
    to delivery to the final consumer
- desc: "Today we have presentation from \u201CSaskPower\u201D that to guys talked\
    \ about it. They talked about how/what we test,open card sort,help us build better."
- desc: "Todays Class taught me to prioritize customer experience in terms of the\
    \ W3C criteria and general enhancements to edify the experience of the general\
    \ audience, by simplifying the displayed content as well. More importantly, feedback\
    \ from users is required in terms of minor fixes, additional features, etc. However,\
    \ certain downsides to acting on the basis of customer feedback also exist as\
    \ customers don\u2019t always know what they want and might have unrealistic expectations\
    \ that\u2019s managed by democratic decision"
- desc: Today we had gue
- desc: "The most important thing I learned today is that some of the customers\u2019\
    \ feedback might not be good for us, or at least should not be implemented. Firstly,\
    \ the customer does not always know what he wants. Secondly, the practicality\
    \ of a suggestion might not always work, and we must keep that in mind. Lastly,\
    \ user interface principles can sometimes produce an outcome that is more satisfactory\
    \ than what the customer originally asked for."
- desc: The people from SaskPower showed us how their Design digital lab is completely
    based on customer feedback. They showed us how they send our questions to the
    users and taken in their feedback in order to make important design choices for
    their website. This shows how much customer interaction and feedback is necessary
    for website design interface in the real world.
- desc: "The Digital Data Lab from sask power explained their user testing that they\
    \ do to improve usability and accessibility. I enjoyed that Casey uses colour\
    \ filters on her laptop to look through \u201Cdifferent eyes\u201D at their work."
- desc: Today we learnt about the Digital Design Lab, where two Representatives from
    SaskPower performed a presentation on why and how the Digital Design Lab has helped
    them Digitally to interact and understand their customer. From their needs to
    their preferences over the SaskPower website as well as different examples and
    prove that the DDL has been a success which they started back in 2019 during Covid-19.
- desc: The importance of unit testing. Today&#039;s class had a presentation from
    SaskPower with the digital design lab. One of the most intresting things I took
    from the presentation was learning new unit tests I wasn&#039;t familar with.  They
    touched on color-blind test, click test, and tree test. When doing tests i&#039;ve
    always concerned purely based on the what side of logic of &amp;quot;what am I
    trying to achieve&amp;quot; and not on the &amp;quot;who&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;why&amp;quot;
    one is trying to achieve something which the presentation opened my eyes too.
- desc: Today we had a guest presentation from Sask Power. The most interesting thing
    I learned is that instead of using the engineering/business model to develop their
    interface, they use a User-centered model instead. It was also interesting to
    note that Sask Power handles almost all of the production and distribution of
    electricity in Saskatchewan.
- desc: Lecture of Saskapower

- desc: Saskpower presenters explained us how digital labs works. They send emails
    to their subscribers to test their websites In terms of UI/UX and get their views
    on positives and negatives. Then based on the reviews, the right changes are made
    to the website to get the ultimate customer satisfaction.
- desc: It was interesting to see how materials learned in the classroom are applied
    in real life job settings such as usability and accessbility. It was interesting
    to learn about data protection as well like securing customer email list and contact
    information from ads and spam. Different tests such as tree test, closed card
    sort, and open card sort used in restructuring of the menu were helpful in demonstrating
    what kind of proceses are involved in redesign of interfaces.
- desc: Presentation about Sask power
- desc: Two Saskpower representatives were present at this meeting to explain the
    user interface design process and how it is carried out. They discussed how they
    work, how they test in user interface design and the importance of details during
    this meeting. They concluded the meeting by responding to the student&#039;s questions.
- desc: Today I learned usability, accessibilty, customer feedback and how saskpower
    digital lab takes into account for UX and its&#039; branding. It encourages me
    to dive into UXD and HCI in the future.
- desc: We learned about DDL (Disign Digital Lab). Chad and Casey talked about why
    feedback and testing is so important. It helps to improve customer satisfaction
    and also user&#039;s feedback helps to improve satisfaction as well. It is perfect
    to test with customers and improve after that more and more. Tree test and Click
    test that indicate how people to do things to be successful and they could find
    them easily. They categorized the information in their website to be more user
    friendly.

    \ from Sask Power present well all key points about it, including how power is\
    \ produced from various sources, how they\_design website\_for easier user communication,\
    \ how many people work there, and the number of ways there are to test it."
- desc: Dear Prof. Hepting. Today we had people from SaskTel and they talked about
    their interface design and the things they have done to improve their users experience.
- desc: Today it was a good session delivered by the guests from SaskPower. I got
    to understand how businesses have to focus on User interface (on their websites)
    and provide good user experience. Also, they are taking into account all the feedbacks
    from users so that they can improve their services towards them. I also liked
    their Digital Design Lab implementation and purpose behind it.

    data from user and their feedback is is being empowered in generating better website
    designs.
- desc: The SaskPower is a better company then expected.
- desc: The most important thing I learned about digital design lab today is when
    they do a survey the users who participate are anonymous and they consider their
    feedback if they are positive and also the once that are related to survey only.
    Doing this will enhance the experience of developers and knowing what they could
    do.
- desc: In this class, we continued to discuss relevant knowledge points and discussed
    the completion of homework in our group
know-more:
- desc: Today saskpower employees gives a brief explanation about their company. They

    Lab where they take valuable feedback from their customers and then implement
    the changes based on that. Some of the method that they discussed are Closed Card
    Shorts and Ipen Card Shorts, Tree tests, Click Tests and also shared some industrial
    information of using &amp;quot;Second proof&amp;quot; for viewing where they stand
    in comparison to other websites.
- desc: Today saskpower representative present slide shows about their organization.
- desc: I found interesting about how the team from Saskpower to evaluate their website,

    to make our website more diverse.
- desc: I would love to learn more in details about Saskpower&#039;s digital media
- desc: Today&#039;s class was about Digital Design Lab, and I must admit that it
    was really interesting, getting to know the insights of how it actually operates.
    The thing that interested me the most was how Saskpower is taking the concept
    of color blindness into consideration by paying attention towards to customer
    feedback and making the required amendments. I also like that way Chad at the
    end of the presentation asked us to apply for jobs in the near future as it as
    tons of opportunities and is a great place.
- desc: Saskpower careers for the future
