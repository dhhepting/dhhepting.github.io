- desc: I was here trick or treaters wasn't too bad probably well maybe 30 Kids altogether
    Guys so it says this session I got a message it's telling me when I came here
    from selling parking
  persid: ''
- desc: is it just because it's not an idea?
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not sure what's up with the agenda is when I scan the QR code I left my
    attendance as a question mark and said that I'm not available to sell market it
    so yeah, comes on at 930 Should be okay to give you
  persid: ''
- desc: one second it's not 930 30
  persid: ''
- desc: that's very likely
  persid: ''
- desc: yes, I remember when I did that
  persid: ''
- desc: I shared this coffee this morning takers for I'll ponder at the end because
    I'm not much of a candy enthusiast myself. More chocolate country was.
  persid: ''
- desc: up so I didn't find this out. I'll try for 20 minutes but I can't make any
  persid: ''
- desc: so happy Wednesday everybody suddenly November so any thoughts? About? The
    guests we had on Monday so we don't have a guest today but class member Devin.
    Tommy would have probably worked on for the last 100 collapse CS 100. So it might
    be interesting to hear about that. 20 minutes for that, and then we'll talk some
    more about making progress on the project so here's the markers.
  persid: ''
- desc: I've got my own say don't trust the one to too many type experiences in the
    lab. Hey, welcome back. So my name is Devin. I was a lead instructor here. I taught
    CMS 100 lead since 2017. So about five years I've actually spent more time teaching
    here than I have taken classes, which is a bit strange. But back in 2020 when
    I was considering what I wanted to do, I was looking at our lead pages. I was
    looking at the pandemic and I thought well maybe I could just stick around a little
    longer and fix our pages because you're all CS 100 Score 100 CS students here.
    You've probably encountered our lead pages, you probably have a lot of very bad
    things to say about them and so did I. So we want to grants for $18,000 to actually
    improve these lab pages and that's going to be the project I'm talking about here.
    So when we were considering this grant, when you have to put in your requirements
    of what you're going to do to get money, we divided it into a set of categories
    and the first category we talked about was usability. You can have the best pages
    in the world but if nobody can actually use them, the mice will not have any pages
    at all. So they're no good if they're not usable. Now, most of you probably haven't
    taken CS 100. It's not a requirement for CS. So there's no reason you really would
    have unless you messed up. But CS 100 If you're not aware of what it is, it's
    sort of an introduction to computers. It's for the non programming people. It's
    a required course for business it used to be required for nurses, they took that
    away. But what makes CS 100 a difficult test to plan for is that you get CS students
    who took the class by accident because they didn't realize they didn't need it.
    And you get students that are from areas that aren't so technological. That will
    tell you in the class they've never touched a personal computer before in their
    life. So how do you sort of find a balance between that right there is a very
    large range between your personas. So you got students working full time as well.
    You got students who just don't want to be there because they hate computers.
    What do these students actually want? Well, in general, most of these students
    are going to want lead pages that have easy examples to follow, easy to find information.
    And I guess for some reason they expect to actually wanting something. But the
    problem with just planning for students is that they're not going to be your only
    user in a project. Like this. In fact, on most web interfaces, you will have more
    than one user target. And the other user target we have here would be our instructors.
    So we have technically four full time instructors. Right now there's going to
    be one going on sabbatical every year for the next two years. We actually have
    three and we have I don't know how many labs, I have not really counted i Six,
    but they're responsible for teams monitoring 1000s of students within these labs
    as three people, the other instructors you're going to get our students they hired
    who probably have not taught before probably weren't trained to well, and in the
    case of 100 they don't always get CS students applying for that see sometimes
    get business students you don't even know how the program teaching the class.
    Now, these instructors are going to have a little bit of a different thing they
    want out of this. They don't want the lab to change because they've been doing
    it for so long. They want it to stay the same so they're not delaying anything,
    because they're already overburdened. Doesn't make them bad people they're just
    busy. Are people we hire might lack the background to effectively know how to
    change things as well. Or just lack experience in general on making decisions
    on what could make our life better. So I'm going to just show what we used to
    teach on in CS 100.
  persid: ''
- desc: Like this. So let's go through this pretty quick. And think about everything
    that's bad. So this is their homepage. We got some reminders here. This had to
    be manually updated. If you forgot it would show the wrong week. We've got a tab
    top navigation bar along here. The colors aren't so good in the first place, but
    many of these links have nothing to do with the lab. We've got webmail your courses
    the link to the University of Regina website itself, not very useful information
    and a lot of places they can click on. If you give your user a lot of places to
    click that go the wrong place. Chances are they're not going to end up where you
    want them to. Now to get to where we actually wanted them to go. They're supposed
    to click the lab schedule not entirely obvious. And then we got all of our dates
    lined up here. They're not up to date because we stopped using this we just show
    it so they can do demonstrations with it really. But other information about things
    like their assignment is hidden behind multiple levels of navigation. They had
    to go what to do. They have all these options. They go checkpoints, they go. We
    want the first one. And this would be their first assignment. But there are so
    many levels of navigation here most of which the instructors didn't even know
    existed, because we're not taught about them so we weren't even maintaining them.
    So there's like 10 year out of date information on some of these links. But one
    of the bigger problems was in each week of the labs themselves. So this is our
    navigation here. It's small, it's hard to click on. And we got links named the
    same thing. So I tell my students to click basic CSS, it's almost a 5050 If they
    click the right one and the order of those notes didn't actually follow the order
    we taught in the lab in the first place. In fact, usually skipped about half of
    that, because it wasn't even related to what it was teaching. So tremendous problems
    in 100. So eventually, I just got permission from the department head to just
    rip this apart and do whatever I wanted with it. But before I show that process
    is something important you need to consider in designing. Hopefully it's familiar
    to me. And that is cognitive bias and logical fallacies. a cognitive bias definition
    is a subconscious error that affects your rationality and logical fallacy is a
    false or false argument that can be proven wrong with reasoning. In short, we
    have monkey brains that don't do well. So some there are some important ones to
    consider when you're doing design like this. The most common one you might be
    familiar with is called something else. And that you might be familiar with. If
    you've ever played a mobile game, they have all these little tactics, keep investing
    and throwing money out there. And any $10 If you like you like the game, they'll
    throw $10 at it no problem. You need to get what you want in Israel number 10
    is to keep throwing money because you've already invested. That is actually quite
    a problem if we consider designing something cost is important one and why? Because
    if you're doing rapid prototypes and you put a lot of investment into your prototype,
    but it fundamentally stuffed then you're going to spend a lot of effort trying
    to make a prototype that would never work, actually do what you want it to do
    and function and you're going to waste a lot of time because you don't want to
    give up on it. Another one to consider is anchoring. This is more important for
    testing. But anchoring essentially means that a person will prefer the something
    they already like or the first thing they see. So when you're doing tests and
    you got to interface is like what you'd have in your assignment. What you do in
    real testing is that you split your groups and 5050 at some start one started
    the other. And you do that because by this logical fallacy, they will prefer the
    first one they see if they have an opinion. If they have an opinion, this doesn't
    really take into effect but if they don't care, they're just gonna say like the
    first one that they saw. And you got to get around that by dividing up and showing
    other ones survivorship. This one is quite important in terms of what I get here
    with teaching. Survivorship dictates that a lot of people tend to focus only on
    what succeeded without looking at what failed. Now if I looked at these labs,
    I had a lot of students I could get 100 I did have CS students after all, but
    also had some students that did not get 100 In fact, they would fill the course.
    And it would be very easy under survivorship for me to look at it and say well,
    these students got 100 These students just clearly weren't doing anything or trying
    hard enough. And I could just ignore that. Instead of looking into why they were
    failing. That's a pretty big problem.
  persid: ''
- desc: backfire effect another important one. This one is more important if you're
    working on students. What this one dictates is if you present a logical argument
    and it's completely sound and you think no one could possibly refute it, and then
    somebody does anyway, Backfire Effect basically means you're presented with information
    that contradicts what you feel that instead of acknowledging it and just double
    down and stick to what you think she's right. The last one for fun, I'm gonna
    write down the Dunning Kruger effect. That's a fun one. The Dunning Kruger effect
    basically dictates that people with a below average skill level will tend to overestimate
    their skill while people with a high level skill level will underestimate their
    skill. And you might see this in studies a lot. Basically, there's like they'll
    put out a study. Do you think you're above average intelligence? 70% of people
    will say yes, which is statistically impossible. So that's the Dunning Kruger
    effect. Those are some file fallacies and problems you need to be aware of when
    you're designing.
  persid: ''
- desc: Closing slideshow so to go through the rapid prototype process we went through
    with this lab. I started with MSPaint because in my opinion, if your prototype
    looks good, you're not doing it correctly. With sunken cost fallacy, you don't
    want to invest a lot of effort. This was my prototype for the lab page. You can
    see I wanted to have a light on what section I wanted it to be divided navigation
    on the side no top nav okay with a tall sample code book sample. And so I did
    it took me about five minutes. This was my first prototype for the lab page and
    this was my first prototype for the homepage we got our lead instructor information
    on the site other helpful links schedule. That's all it needs. In my opinion,
    if you spend more than 10 minutes on your first prototype, you're wasting your
    time it's not meant to look good. Now, we never had a actual focus group of students
    to tell me if this was good or not, but we do have a student society. So I sent
    these to the students society and they pointed out some useful things like why
    am I using right here? It makes absolutely no sense. That was a very good point.
    So I took that feedback and I week later made an HTML no JavaScript, just HTML.
    And I just copy and one of our web pages that exists to it, but it will go to
    all our navigation splits the notes, I took a look at what it looked like for
    that. On pages like this. And drought next year, I would send pictures like this
    to the students society that told me why it sucked and I tried to fix it to make
    yourself less. And that was sort of the design process we went through. The final
    result we get so this is the lead page we're using now. It's got our instructor
    information. It's got reminders to tell them where to go it's got a schedule down
    there, the streets pretty zoomed in. But it functions. We've got a room schedules,
    we got any additional resources they need to know. And the navigation is very
    simple. If we go into here and it lights up what page they're on so they can visually
    see what page I'm on. When I clicked on it and follow along a lot easier. It's
    got recordings. We did a lot to improve the usability. Now it's not a perfect
    prototype. There was still work that could have been done on it. I don't think
    it'll ever get done. And he just stuck with this but Anything's better than what
    we had earlier. So one thing that we were talking about in the last presentation
    was press personas and scenarios. So you can have a look at what a scenario of
    a student using this would be. Now I'm from a farming community. So I will just
    use that as an example. Let's see, we got Billy Bob Joe the farmer. He has worked
    farms his entire life. His parents hated computers. He never touched a computer
    because he was never allowed to. But he wants to come to the University and he
    wants to start up a business while CS 100 is a required course for business so
    he has to take this class no choice. Some point in August, which is in this school
    season, August September is hard to see. So you had to go back and focus at farming.
    They were overburdened and he missed two weeks elapsed and now he needs to catch
    up. So what would his scenario going through this page? Be? Let's say he missed
    week two. He's going to load into this website. He's going to have a look at our
    schedule. And if he's not impatient, he's going to go through the notes one by
    one. You'll be able to watch the video if he needs you'll be able to go through
    the notes we have example code at the very bottom about what we did in the lab,
    and we have what the solution would look like and you would go through those pages
    one at a time. He'd get to the end results. You do the assignment. That would
    be a general scenario for this. What Interaction Type would that be? Since that's
    what you're supposed to consider in your assignment? You can make an argument
    that that would be instructive. I don't think that's quite right. I think it's
    explorative because we have the information on the page. They need to explore
    it, they need to find it they need to record it. And they design metaphor I could
    use for this since it is a textbook I'll use a library example. When they load
    into the page, they're presented with a catalogue of information. You know how
    in the doctor Archer, we have all the fancy letters and maps. Well, these are
    the aisles of our library
  persid: ''
- desc: to figure out which one they need to go into. They go into that aisle. They
    open a page they open a book they see if the information they want is in the book.
    If it is they read it if it's not they close it they find another book. That would
    be the metaphor I would use for this particular design. Could we have used a different
    metaphor to open up more possibilities? Yes, we could. If instead of doing it
    this way, I just had a sitemap on the side with a bunch of drop down arrows which
    I did consider and the drop down arrows would let you access any page at any time.
    That'd be essentially letting your students walk through bookshelves, right? So
    that that wouldn't be the same metaphor anymore. You can maybe try called a filing
    cabinet. You open the cabinet you pick out the folder you want you pick up the
    file you want. Is that better? Maybe for experienced users, right because then
    they can take shortcuts, but in my opinion, it wasn't better for my type of users,
    because unless my students are failing, they should never actually become experienced
    users to know how to use that system. So those were sort of the metaphors we considered
    with this and why we made the decisions that led to this now the second category
    we looked at was accessibility. If you have an accessibility interface, you're
    actually automatically generally improving usability accessibility and usability
    are quite related a lot of the time. color themes for example, nobody usually
    likes the light color theme. We have a dark theme on this page. You can get it
    from me. Most people I know like dark theme more. We need a dark theme for people
    that couldn't read the light theme properly. And if it's both people, things like
    line spacing you have to double space your essays Why do we not double spaced
    things? On our website? It makes things more readable. Subtitles when video is
    not everybody likes to have to listen to me I don't blame them and says Howard
    fit their presentation they refer to W three school not schools but the consortium
    and the accessibility tools. They had with that. And this is Bart. I just want
    to talk a little bit about accessibility concerns from this page. Ever since things
    moved to online.
  persid: ''
- desc: Accessible accessibility lawsuits against universities for having terrible
    little web pages increased by 17 times. It's actually quite a miracle that we
    never got hit. And many of the things that they cite for these are lack of descriptive
    alt text when you put an image on a page, there's a thing in the tagging to put
    posts. What that would do is if the page doesn't load that image to it, put some
    text on the page instead to describe what it was. Screen readers rely on that
    to describe an image to somebody who can't see it properly. And if you don't have
    that it makes your page unaccessible we were relying on PDFs PDFs are difficult
    for a lot of screen readers. Redundant links and broken navigation, school colors
    working with the green and gold at the university. It was actually really hard
    because it's a terrible color combination for accessibility. So I got through
    articles like this and I went to the W three accessibility same thing SaskPower
    use, they have a lot of notes and guidelines on how to actually design an accessible
    interfaces as I said mindspace color themes, rules, context, anything like that
    they've got guides on that. They also had 167 free tools to help you automatically
    evaluate accessibility on your pages. And these are the tools that the SaskPower
    people were talking about. And the one I use and I can show is right here, an
    automatic color contrast test. All you have to do to use this is put in the name
    of your site
  persid: ''
- desc: it'll go through all your colors and tell you are they good enough for people
    who have color contrast problems? In this case we made sure they were almost none
    of the pages in our university actually meet these requirements.
  persid: ''
- desc: There was another test that they talked about that sort of gave evaluations
    I don't remember which one I used. I don't know if it's even still here or if
    it got bought out. But there are other things like that where you just put in
    the website and it'll give you a list of things you can improve for accessibility.
    And we use that that's where I got most of my ideas for how to do with accessible
    design. So that's about everything important to have to say that I can fit into
    the time here. So I guess that wraps it up is there a reason that it's separate
    from the back page? I don't think I can answer that. Yeah, it's because I'm not
    sure I did the other words.
  persid: ''
- desc: I noticed that the settings option on the last page was in the middle instead
    of the traditional
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I mentioned that many of my students don't really know computers,
    like interfaces and standards. Take that incorrectly. I can. There's a principle
    in computer science or in design called the locus of attention actually. And that
    is that when you create the option, the effect should appear somewhere really
    clicked. Now settings bars in the rights and on the side are pretty standard.
    That is true. But I was concerned that my students wouldn't see it unless it was
    from the center because they don't know where to look. So that's why there's a
    giant box here and that's why it appears right here
  persid: ''
- desc: is the website design? Or is this the class designed in a way where students
    can find everything about the MATLAB session on the website where
  persid: ''
- desc: my idea with this was to make it so students don't even have to attend? Because
    while that might seem counterintuitive, the less people that don't need to be
    in my lab that don't show up. The more time I have to spend on the people that
    do so if you could figure out everything I wrote the labs exactly how I teach
    them the videos match exactly how I teach them. You can figure everything out
    that we teach just from language.
  persid: ''
- desc: In your testing, did you find that clear instructions and instructions sort
    of substitute videos or
  persid: ''
- desc: not does depend on the person. Clear instructions certainly do help because
    some people aren't going to be in environments where they can watch the video
    maybe they don't have stable connection. Maybe they just don't like watching it
    and they just find reading the notes better but I do find that making sure that
    your notes and the video matchup and they are descriptive and describe everything
    did make user experience overall better.
  persid: ''
- desc: Just calibrated most people prefer adopting when it comes from survey
  persid: ''
- desc: when I said most people prefer I said most people I know prefer dark theme.
    I don't have any sort of statistic on whether that's actually true or not. I find
    that people I talked to like all of our instructors prefer light theme, which
    was getting a dark theme was actually quite difficult to convince them we needed
    it. But I personally can't read half of our pages because they have light blue
    writing on light backgrounds. So dark theme for me was quite important
  persid: ''
- desc: and impossible the way that I can change it to the dark
  persid: ''
- desc: No, because like for me like I don't like dark
  persid: ''
- desc: eyes when I see website.
  persid: ''
- desc: For those who are done like
  persid: ''
- desc: oh, well the students in the lab would have their own version of the page
    and they could bring up on their own computer so they will be able to read and
    follow along from there so they don't have to necessarily use my dark mode for
    my presentation. I would just be presenting in dark mode for myself. But if they
    wanted to read it on their own, they don't have to use the same mode. Good point
    though. Thanks for sharing
  persid: ''
- desc: your experience. Okay, so one take up a few ideas there. So I guess one question
    I didn't ask you is did you think about responsive design? Be sure that we did
    everything in percentages.
  persid: ''
- desc: And while we can definitely tell
  persid: ''
- desc: the page isn't correct, all while
  persid: ''
- desc: he says it just takes up the screen
  persid: ''
- desc: so talk about testing in more detail after our break, but I just want to mention
    a couple things. So I mentioned that I mentioned the anchor ship idea. That people
    are gonna like to see first
  persid: ''
- desc: so what are some ways? are getting the best data if we always show people,
    two interfaces, we show them interface a and then interface b a second.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that way we can remove so if we observe in effect well, we balanced the
    way people see the interfaces that's protect us from bias for the first one so
    what's another choice? What's another way we can we can get away from the preference
    of a shopping mall at the same time.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what if we don't show everyone both interfaces to show?
  persid: ''
- desc: So if we show them both alternatives that's within subjects design. And if
    we show them one or the other, then we're doing it between subjects design. So
    the advantages that we're so we're printing less. Instead of spending an hour
    on two interfaces, they can spend a half an hour in one interface. But the drawback
    is that we don't get the basis for comparison between two interfaces. I guess
    if the participants are similar
  persid: ''
- desc: then we can
  persid: ''
- desc: first things about pharmacy two interfaces but it's not as straightforward
    to compare simply showing both interfaces and make your own comparisons to hear
    the way you said between design mentioned. So I'm going to show one or the other
    that's between subjects.
  persid: ''
- desc: To show that both this case in subjects we'll talk about this more later but
    I just want to
  persid: ''
- desc: highlight some some of the ways you can deal with these issues testing issue.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we haven't done group discussion activity I thought we might take so we
    have 20 minutes 16 minutes
  persid: ''
- desc: On. Makes sense so I just need have some group discussion time to think about
    creating metaphors or thinking about metaphors in terms of interface design. So
    let me while you get yourselves organized. I'll put up the sample screen where
    we can. We're making groups up soon no one's moving to get into groups. Oh thank
  persid: ''
- desc: you Hey, what's going on organize our campaigns
  persid: ''
- desc: me Okay, so actually I was a little bit tentative because I wasn't sure it's
    going to hide student numbers but you can access this interface for yourself in
    the experiment. You our courses so we have a group as I can have maybe I want
    to give you something new says Excellent. Anyway, so I don't want to dampen the
    energy in here with the discussion. Zack clear enough. What I'm asking you to
    do
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: are we? done because students can change they can get together. So it's very
    it's actually maybe
  persid: ''
- desc: already like changing the nature of things. Central Yeah, actually.
  persid: ''
- desc: 27th Oh my gosh, I didn't even know what was going on. Or less supposed to
    get better? To see it. University Microsoft wake up. Tomorrow right serious I
    mean, it's up to you. I don't I think
  persid: ''
- desc: it's like immaturity. of the system going on holiday
  persid: ''
- desc: I forgot you weren't students anymore. You're not students in this set it
    to be students and that wasn't working and I realized it's teacher for learning
    beta beta for teacher learning.
  persid: ''
- desc: The good thing about making drugs is that you're not getting robbed, you know,
    you're making assignments and this way yeah, like he just went in this business
    writing together a prisoner to hear what others are saying morning emails are
    like university. Yom Kippur shave we how can we relate in Cape Town? You to stop
    working in office they're not exactly regarded as actually doing volunteer work
    with a federal offense. In the first album they actually contribute to a friend
    of mine Ross last couple of seasons for you actually the opposite where we teach
    you how to do a bit more like we kind of get like a double went really fast to
    be active seems to be able to do a really good service again actually Oh out at
    the movies Mr Rogan and because we're talking about TV One question I have always
