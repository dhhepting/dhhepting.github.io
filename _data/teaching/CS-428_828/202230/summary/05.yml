- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: How was your weekend? Anyone watched a football game? The riders I wouldn't
    say it was that bad but they didn't win.
  persid: ''
- desc: To score. Flattered two bombers. I think I'm waiting for my two factor authentication.
    Oh, that's right. I turned off I put put on airplane mode so now I'm not going
    to get
  persid: ''
- desc: notification I think they'd better not turn a better keep the phone on because
    it's going to not do the transcription properly.
  persid: ''
- desc: Try Do Not Disturb and see if that is sufficient okay
  persid: ''
- desc: let's do the attendance first. Let's see if this then I have to change the
    link here well it'd be nice if I could create have a link that just shows me the
    QR code or that shows you the QR code that you could even bring it up on your
    laptop and take a picture from there instead of straining to see the screen at
    the front of the class.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway now let me see if I can do the Know day Okay, so we're talking about
    knife the first assignment they gave you about empathizing with teachers.
  persid: ''
- desc: Realize I've done this before other years, but it didn't occur to me as an
    issue. And now I am in good conscience.
  persid: ''
- desc: We tend to sign an issue. So I hope to have it resolved this week. A person
    who's who's dealing with this is a way of the conference
  persid: ''
- desc: so make some other contacts. So the idea is with student numbers more that's
    the key to some more information about you with university.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you want to protect that and I think consent is also an issue as you could
    say, right brass in class who's okay with me sharing your student number with
    within the class
  persid: ''
- desc: and not everybody might see a big problem with that. And then doesn't mean
    there's not an issue. And then people may not also be comfortable in speaking
    about this in front of the whole group. So that's another another issue. And then,
    even if you say yes, I give my consent. In some ways it's a little bit like saying
    yes you can cut off my arm because you well, it's not quite that dramatic, but
    it is you can give free and informed consent for something so impactful. So I'm
    hoping to have some discussions today and I hope to have something sorted out
    by Wednesday, next week. Okay. That makes sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: So until that's sorted out, we don't have a first design.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so no, and once I get it sorted out the knowledge just the due dates.
    So you still have time to work. On
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. So I've received a few of these but if you'd like to send me your requests
    for groups. So who has tried out that class? We're crew member on your courses
    page. This one I'm not a member of any crew that seemed like an effective way
    to because to me this was a new feature a helpful way to discover your group numbers
    sometimes they do really good stuff. With Moodle. So
  persid: ''
- desc: I think for the sport, actually. Chat area will be more appreciated during
    message because we have logs and we can send everything to share with the others.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, here let me I was thinking about that. So let me just set up one set
    it up here so don't think I wonder what Chelsea would say. So we could do a chat
    I could set up a chat and I can also set up a forum
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's. Group mode separate groups I suppose this could be a solution for
    people who are I'm just thinking we could do the chat when we have a group discussion
    today
  persid: ''
- desc: but I don't want to discourage you from getting together and talking
  persid: ''
- desc: and they have masks here now forum Okay. So for me because I'm I'm a teacher
    I consent to everybody. Change to a student I'm going to go you won't be able
    to see anything I think so.
  persid: ''
- desc: From my screen okay, so then class group and members. Yes. Are we gonna be
    required
  persid: ''
- desc: to use this in class group chat in order to communicate to gauge our progress
    and participation or to have a chat through other means or other platforms? We
    have something set
  persid: ''
- desc: up. Yeah, if you want to use discord or something else, that's fine. And I'm
    really thinking about most of the discussions are gonna happen in class anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I would encourage you to talk to people but communicate however you'd like
    to do that. We can set up a group form for the project but you don't have to use
    that you can
  persid: ''
- desc: use discord or whatever you like best okay. I thought I put the link Oh, I
    guess I fixed it here
  persid: ''
- desc: so I would encourage you to have a peek at this video. This is on the last
    days page. David Kelly is one of the principals that IDEO which is an industrial
    design firm.
  persid: ''
- desc: And so it's an interesting discussion about building creative confidence and
    overcoming the fear of doing creative things so, the link for the because this
    is on Vimeo, the marble answering machine video. It was an unhappy face over the
    weekend. So
  persid: ''
- desc: because you cannot put iframe to push it into the page, right?
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, that might be the issue but I certainly gave it the wrong URL for that.
    So I just did the usual regular year off so here's a two minute video to refresh
    your memories. So what I'd like to do is spend some time in groups today to think
    about a few questions. And I'll write the questions down on the board. afterwards.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, that might be the issue but I certainly gave it the wrong URL for that.

  persid: ''
- desc: your flight be a 6213 at 1230 Monday 15 October drop number is 46 to one five
    including for Canada mentioned. At 5pm Simon is George, could you give us a ring
    my turn number is talk to you later. See you okay, don't want to. So
  persid: ''
- desc: various efforts to search the web. For more details of that. I think
  persid: ''
- desc: the marble answering machine only made it to that stage of concept video So
    three questions. So what's good about the marble answering machine design? What's
    the value of this design?
  persid: ''
- desc: What contribution does it make? The conversational design of answering machines
    for example, and then can you see ways to apply the concepts from the video in
    modern voices, modern voicemail systems so it makes sense. Okay, so now is our
    test of in class groups and discussions so
  persid: ''
- desc: see are all buzzing with excitement?
  persid: ''
- desc: Can you arrange yourselves into group discussions? Or take this opportunity
    to test the chat that we just set up?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so we'll take
  persid: ''
- desc: 10 or 15 minutes to think about these issues. Okay. You ever going on just
    joined the class today. Not in any? way what's up yo yo, yo, why YouTube? Yeah.
    Shut up evening to have you here the way that you're
  persid: ''
- desc: going to change your life between C and C does not see worse. So yeah, but
    this
  persid: ''
- desc: just goes here. This video

- desc: anyone else who was indoctrinated? Just, I just asked because I see somebody
    who shouldn't be in a different group. So yeah, sure. Free today and now you can
    watch the show all day much. What's up I cannot wait to walk all the way down

    once your values are so you can go on up can answer the question however you want.
  persid: ''

    this and say, well this is this was an issue for us. That makes sense. Right well
    design and labor are saying why and why lions Lions Gate know what's not mean
    that poor people at the US Embassy missions pays more than ever sex contributions
    especially if you have that desire to pass through now it
  persid: ''
- desc: was like six years the answer was we have to find a hybrid three are starting
    to run out everyone. Accent argument and they still didn't know what I was thinking
    the question so what I was thinking about how does it make sense to wait based
    on the voicemail service again when it rains rather than rather than what you're
    going to be speaking whether they get sent to Wi Fi or not a little touch on some
    data you're working on right now. You have to keep going Good afternoon some worship

- desc: Yeah, I remember saying something about each group is going to have to make
    some notes on every class or something. At least four meetings.
  persid: ''
- desc: Every discussion needs to because in the class we keep one of the group membership
    post. Like we had one more discussion previously and after the emphasis the second
    decision
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: I just want to ask related to the project like do I need to do private meeting
    with you for the group members and everything or for the topics? Like what kind
    of topics we are actually we need to because I'm unsure about that. And I don't
    know many members in the class. I have just one shrined in my discussion.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I can I can add
  persid: ''
- desc: people to your group.
  persid: ''
- desc: So 2428 or 828 28? And are you doing research Okay, so you can talk to people.
  persid: ''
- desc: And related to the topic, we are able to choose any topic we want.
  persid: ''
- desc: A topic. I'm asking you to find a website that you use amongst your group
    members you have some experience with and
  persid: ''
- desc: find a website with which you have some experience and then look at opportunities
    for through redesign, find some unmet needs, things that it doesn't do. Well.
    So the idea is you're going to go through a design cycle.
  persid: ''
- desc: website and just redesign and we just go through like what kind of things
    we want to redesign it or wanted to make it more efficient, or like quick for
    the customers for like us.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, there might be some bigger issues than making things more efficient
    can be one part of it.
  persid: ''
- desc: So maybe, Friday or Monday next week, we'll talk about the group stuff. The
    project.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you. Have a nice
  persid: ''
