- desc: Now does that sound? right word I was that see if I can figure out this magic
    sequence to get you to wake up.
  persid: ''
- desc: See whether I can get screened to stay down see if this works okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so this should work now so that's okay progress and I hope I can can win back
    your favor for my delay in getting the syllabus printed for you. So just to go
    over quickly, we're meeting here in education room 388. Monday, Wednesday, Friday
    930 to 1020. Our last day of meeting is December 5. So there's a few days we missed
    between August 31 and December 5, but not too many. Here's my email address here's
    my office location. So anyone clear Everyone clear but where I can be found on
    campus?
  persid: ''
- desc: I mean people have been up to the computer science department. It's see this
    month one person this month anyone else to Okay. Three. Wow. Okay. So this should
    it's got a blue. It's highlighted in blue. So it makes you think it's a link but
    I'm not sure whether it's gonna work
  persid: ''
- desc: I made a hyperlink. This is really a URL so I don't know why it's not
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll have to check but these are links. So this is the your courses page.
    And this is my personal page. We'll go through that. And so their final design
    Wednesday, December 14. Don't take my word for it. Especially about the location
  persid: ''
- desc: so in terms of promises so this is a this is the quote that I read in class
    the other day
  persid: ''
- desc: so the promises you will come to know they're doing the design is hard yet
    worthwhile. You need to start somewhere to jump in and get your hands dirty. To
    begin with a judgment and spiritual boundary reflection you have glimpse what
    is exciting empowering and important about interaction design. You'll gain sensitivity
    to the impact of interaction design on real people. You will see the necessity
    of a multidisciplinary perspective you will think critically creatively and computationally
    for designs and design problems using the foundational concepts of this discipline
  persid: ''
- desc: and a sound okay so the textbook This is a textbook and I'll show you how
    this is the fifth edition 2018 If you're how many people are looking at this one
    or an earlier edition Wow 001 Okay nobody else object.
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't know what version. Okay, well okay. Yeah. I think it's, it's a good
    book. It's got lots of stuff in there. But we'll also use things that are online
    so I've got a few links. And Nielsen Norman Group stuff is also very good online.
  persid: ''
- desc: But it's just a normal group down here so participating writing, designing
    so talked about formative and then some devaluation on the first day
  persid: ''
- desc: remember that okay. So the things you were doing during the semester, our
    formative evaluations and the final exam is a summative evaluation to see whether
    we've to assess your learning over the semester. So we must pass the final to
    pass the class. So this is the list of weights that are in your courses. So we
    so from the last offering, we we agreed to add a midterm exam. So midterm gets
    8% of Mark.
  persid: ''
- desc: Here's another blue line, which I made into a hyperlink in word and it doesn't
    seem to be working. But this is the academic schedule.
  persid: ''
- desc: Which is really not a usable document. In fact, let's go look at it right
    now. Acrobat? Think this video I think it's it's pretty cool as well, but I find
    it a little off putting the word speeds up when it's doing the flyover
  persid: ''
- desc: and all the people hiding in the bushes smoking on campus.
  persid: ''
- desc: There is no smoking on campus.
  persid: ''
- desc: The trees or the cigarette
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. Okay. Where's it coming up okay, here's a flyover. Yeah, just speed
    up to get to the sign. $1 million
  persid: ''
- desc: on this increase in tuition it gets half a second.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, it's not it's not just the sign. It's the whole corner and they rebuilt
    the sidewalk to go from the corner in towards the classroom to the college West.
    And it still fills up with water. They didn't address that. Issue
  persid: ''
- desc: anyway grass here Okay, so this is the right one, I believe 2223 Okay, so
    what are the important dates this semester? Do you need me to zoom in on that?
    Better now
  persid: ''
- desc: first of August 6
  persid: ''
- desc: exam here is ninth the 22nd of December and then there are dates for tuition
    and fee payment which are repeated and then the class add drop dates, tuition
    and fee refund dates
  persid: ''
- desc: and other important dates and deadlines. So the fact that 95% of this bottom
    part of the table is empty.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe indicates space could be better used. Any thoughts about that? Or so
    I know your name. So that's why I called it a go ahead.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe they should have a different file for summer, because you have like
    10 periods just for summer. And so it's hard to see fall and winter even though
    they might be more important. So if they just have two different files
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, that's a possibility to divide up so it's so it's not when you go to
    look at this
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm back in Acrobat. That's why the fact that they're in PDF instead of HTML.
    Also makes it a little more difficult. Anyway, perfectly knows what this is. This
    design doesn't quite fit on one page. So the PDF has a second separate line for
    Good Friday which
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe we can update the wiki for good and bad design.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, sure. You can do that certainly. If we recorded every incident, incidents
    of bad design, I think we'd have a very full wiki a never ending one okay. So
    I want to point out okay, so they're in the links. This is also a link to the
    PDF
  persid: ''
- desc: for the syllabus and their your courses page. And then the assignments here
    I have an extra column I guess because there's a space in the file that's why
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so there are some individual assignments so everyone will do this empathize
    with teachers. So I'm going to give you access to
  persid: ''
- desc: your courses teacher and ask you to do something and then think about reflect
    on your completion of the activity in your courses. So one thing that I realized
    just now since we've been talking about student numbers so I partway through the
    list of getting people enrolled, enrolled in that experiment with your courses
    class as instructors, so I'll have that
  persid: ''
- desc: finish after class Okay, not quite halfway through but I've got a few people
  persid: ''
- desc: and they're all listed as teachers. So the issue is that student numbers appear.
    here so I'm going to do a bit of investigating to see whether I can
  persid: ''
- desc: can hide them or not. So is that a concern for people? One nod and the other
    feelings about concern. Yes. Well, not Yeah. So not teaching the course it's it's
    teaching this experiment with your horses so
  persid: ''
- desc: on then it gives you some information about everyone's IP that's now I could
    make I could make the problem less serious. Eight times. Take the in class groups
    and give each in class group an essence of your courses that might be better to
  persid: ''
- desc: control our agent teacher versus the entire classroom teacher.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I could do that.
  persid: ''
- desc: We also haven't done it.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. Thanks so one one question can you reply to announcements, they will
    try to reply to announcements.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So I'll put that in I'll put something in the class discussion to get
    to solicit some more ideas. We'll try and
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll talk with your course. Support. today and see what options there are.
  persid: ''
- desc: I thought I thought you'd all enjoy that. Picture Okay, so I have media. I'm
    not sure why the outline didn't show up. I managed to convert the text into something
    a little more readable and you can use this information to add to the wiki and
    I'll try and go through it as well and add a few things.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's my plan so there's that and then responses so I think the transcript
    kind of cut out a little bit earlier seems a little short. But anyway. I'll post
    what I get from my app and have that further discussions. So the assignments are
    all here on the page for the semesters offering so let's go to the budget presentation
    or what kind of formal project
  persid: ''
- desc: so the idea with the project is to choose a website. So for
  persid: ''
- desc: a 28 students are doing research that could involve user interface component.
    You can talk to me about doing a project related to your research.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you're designing some software was an interface. You can take that as
    your project and go through steps with that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Otherwise, people who don't fall into that category will make groups and we'll
    look at last year to pick a website and see where there's some issues some unmet
    needs and then go through a process of designing and testing a couple alternative
    interfaces and then making a video to present to capture your results from the
    process. So testing will be paper and pencil test. We'll talk about this as it
    comes up you'll have a sketch of an interface and the different screens and you'll
    test it with other people in class so you'll get together so you can test so you
    have two interface designs. Created and then you'll test running. Each member
    of a group will run a test of each of both interfaces with somebody else in class
    and we'll get a structure to support that. Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: most of the assignments mentioned, but it seems like they were groups of four
    so they separate them the groups are formed on the first day of class.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. So if you have a group of four. Let's see. See how well we do with groups
    of four. If you have a group of four in mind, you can email me and I'll set that
    up for the project
  persid: ''
- desc: so the project group is distinct from the class discussion groups before
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. So the in class groups are just in class. So and if you don't have preferences
    for people with whom you'd like to work, then I'll take the information I do get,
    set those up. And then I'll fill in
  persid: ''
- desc: so if you give me three people you might get a fourth person in your group
    CME okay. I know I like I published this this morning, but it's not here. Okay.
    So let me go back one of the things I was going to mention was scheduling for
    the midterm.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have 36 meetings. So midway through the semester, would be this week
    approximately. So I'll make a choice activity on your courses and verb on it so
    for now, would you like me to add other choices
  persid: ''
- desc: can we add the 14
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, our team's gonna get zero maybe one vote. Vote the following week. 20
    for 24th. No one wants to really that's good to know. questions which we'll discuss
    and above which also solicit your input and design suggestions.
  persid: ''
- desc: Be an option like the 31st.
  persid: ''
- desc: That's too far. Yeah, it's a little less midterm ish. Okay, so I'll go with
    these four choices and I'll create it right after class. Okay. So attendance No,
    I didn't do that okay, now I will attempt to do that messes up the screen for
    you. Right Thank you so, is that large enough so, thanks for the for the tip I
    would still prefer it to be a little this is not a thing they want to do every
    day So, it'd be nice if Moodle or you our courses
  persid: ''
- desc: gave me some options right? Right off the bat. So anyway the QR code appears
    in the source I'll show you. Yeah, so here's the QR code What's up
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's base 64. encoded. So it's a binary file. encoded using printable characters
    ASCII or UTF eight. I suppose maybe I can replace some different styling with
    that class anyway. So in chapter one they talk about draw bishops marble answering
    machine. Anyone come across? Remember coming across that story
  persid: ''
- desc: give you the message when you put a marble in.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, no well. It will pop out a marble when it records a message and then
    you can put the marble into a player to hear the message.
  persid: ''
- desc: I found that the textbook didn't discuss underlying issues like the number
    of marbles. Marbles. Can you figure out heavier the Marvel Marvel stuff
  persid: ''
- desc: well, not only as a text isn't discussed it there's there's very little written
    about it. So this is a quick video and it's very hard to find the original source
    material for the textbook mentions anyway Simon in imagens house they are both
    out.
  persid: ''
- desc: What I thought was when when he got to come to the football fan and if you
    don't bring it up GPM Hello. Your flight is pH 6213 at 1230 Monday 15. Your job
    number is 46 215 and the pic of a trans employee for Canada mentioned custom mouth
    particularly 5pm Simon is George can you give us a ring? My tone number is talk
    to you later. See you Bye.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well it's 1020 was good timing Okay, so we'll we'll take some time to discuss
    things on on Monday and I just wanted to point out so as we talked about on Wednesday,
    in class your bay if you want to take care of the wiki anyway, thanks for today.
    Have a great weekend. See you Monday going on y'all this addition to traditional
