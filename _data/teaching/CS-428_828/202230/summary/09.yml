- desc: Now I want to distribute this papers between you. If you don't want to participate
    into a study or you are not a third year or fourth year undergraduate student,
    you can pass it to your next classmate.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, great. Yeah, sure, go ahead.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any questions? Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: If you have any question you can ask me right now. you Yeah. You. gains to
    use Good. Good evening the students please keep in mind if you want to participate
    into my study, my email you can find my email address at the end of this paper,
    so you can easily send an email to me. Just send me just tell me if you want participate
    into my study after that. Right cable wasn't there no that's. 17 was
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you so much, everybody. Thank you so much Hepting for giving me this
    opportunity to present my work into your class. Have a good day.
  persid: ''
- desc: 2014 Anyway so here's my public service announcement for today. Don't cook
    chicken and nightfall I was reading a bit more about that
  persid: ''
- desc: so my wife told me
  persid: ''
- desc: she heard about it again yesterday and I said I was speaking to the anchor
    on the news but apparently it's been around since 2007. Theory sports
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, the issue is cooking.
  persid: ''
- desc: Whether the chicken safe to eat and another question but cooking with NyQuil
    changes, vaporizing some ingredients which could be harmful for your lungs just
    a bad idea. So maybe a question is
  persid: ''
- desc: that's the best security. Don't believe
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe a question from a user interface. Perspective. Even computer based
    perspective is out. People respond this stuff be empowered to stop spraying
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: I want to talk a bit about so I've I've made visible the projects. I think
    I think things have the correct dates now but I'll double check that the Gradebook
    matches up with this so the Gradebook doesn't have strange entries in it. I believe
    so that's in case you can let me know about that. But so if you go to this page,
    this part of the page and look for project group and members and click there,
    you should be able to if you have a project group set up, you should be able to
    see a project group. If you don't see anything here send me a note. I got a note
    or two yesterday. Maybe I still have I still have to process.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you aren't in a group and let me know. And after today I'll fix up people
    who aren't in groups using my own superior skill of putting groups together randomly.
    I wouldn't say it's a superior skill but I know I can do that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so let me read that. So project groups, please check that you are in
    the group do spec. And you can do that by clicking on this link private group
    and members so if you don't see yourself in a group or the group isn't what you
    expect. So it's not what you expect. Let me know. I'll fix it. If you don't see
    a group, but you have an idea for a group let me know and I'll set that up. And
    by the end of today, I will have gone through all the requests and then I will
    make adjustments I will finish to fill up the groups so ever it'll be in a group
    aside from people in a 28 who are doing an individual project
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: if you're in a 28 and you have you'd like to work on your own research, let
    me know and I'll put you in a group with one. I know it sounds fine to be a group
    of one but groups is the way it's organized in your course itself. It can be one
    can be more than one person.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that seem okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So we do. So that's the link on the webpage so I want to talk about
    some ideas related to. Bigger Okay, so the first individual assignment I've asked
    you to take on the beta teacher for learning role in your courses, any questions
    and so I want to talk about some ideas related or how we can approach the idea
    of empathizing with somebody else how we can think about evaluating an interface
  persid: ''
- desc: so I wanted to thank first of all. So maybe user friendly is a bit too. too
    broad. Just description for the users and what are what are being friendly to
    all users or. And, and we can think of some more particular things about user
    what user friendly is as you get into a more specific case.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the other
  persid: ''
- desc: term that we had came up in our discussion the other day was intuition or
    whether an interface is intuitive and so what what does that mean in practical
    terms? Am I still speaking loud enough for the back? Yep. Back row. Can you hear
    me? Okay? Say How can you get the door we're not getting contradictory so Norman
    doors aren't intuitive because the Norman door is one that behave behaves in a
    way different from what's indicated.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, if we can
  persid: ''
- desc: operate the door without thinking about it, if we see a push a panel on a
    door that says push and push it, and we go through and we don't encounter a locked
    door, we don't cover it and kind of resistance and go bang our head against the
    door because expecting it to open properly that's intuitive. Maybe.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? So what are we doing dealing with computer software?
    How do we think about an interface being intuitive?
  persid: ''
- desc: Or do you have something you're laughing with? Me or or neither? Okay, thanks.
    That's allowed. Well, the others allowed to that anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe something like self explanatory. So, for example, it can go through
    designing website is one where you can maybe like just drag elements. So you can
    sign up
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah. So
  persid: ''
- desc: So we'll talk about that in a minute. So we might say computer interfaces
    with direct manipulation so as my writing should i What's what's the lowest point
    on the board? I should right? So so. live above Okay, I'll try and keep that in
    mind.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so computer faces allow us to directly manipulate things like drag icons around
    the screen or a touchscreen, you can move things around, so on. So that's a particular
    style of interaction that we can can use so the question is how do we develop
    intuition
  persid: ''
- desc: so Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: So now we can see the outcome of good design is consistent Okay, so the question
    is if it's consistent with what the rest of the standards I guess results system
    Yeah, but like yeah, like almost the same thing. everywhere so,
  persid: ''
- desc: what standards are so maybe we can say, we have an idea of what's an intuitive
    interface
  persid: ''
- desc: based on our experience with other interfaces. Control V. Control C and control
    V for cut and paste. It's developed over the years it didn't happen on the first
  persid: ''
- desc: 1940s When the first computer system and they said let's make a ctrl v. control
    c control v has cut and paste. It didn't show it exist as a concept so it came
    about over time.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, so when we develop new interfaces of new concepts it's a process of trial
    and error. So some might be better than others anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: Could you make the argument of time because some stuff wasn't necessarily
    intuitive when it came over just over time and got accepted like those designs
    I think it can be pretty well defined how to use the left click or right click
    and sometimes the school or extra buttons on the sides but for the most part,
    every mouse is now left to right click but I remember back in the day used to
    have like, balls that you can stand there the buttons around the balls and some
    things didn't even have mice baby computer by example. Tradition so
  persid: ''
- desc: on the Mac, the most handy one so I'm not sure I know. I know there's a trackpad
    on my on my MacBook Air. And I don't have the latest version of the mouse. The
    mouse. So it's an accessory has a couple of buttons that are real, so they can
    swipe. Yeah. And so I have a trackpad and I can configure one finger, two fingers,
    three fingers.
  persid: ''
- desc: I get some unexpected behavior from it. Sometimes I've tried to fix it a little
    bit with settings but it's it's a little difficult to do I want to tell you the
    story about the first mouse I didn't even know that the person who developed the
    mouse to begin with
  persid: ''
- desc: I thought IBM was the first the first people to make the kind of first business
  persid: ''
- desc: and maybe the first commercial PC mouse was IBM that wasn't the first design
    of that anyone heard the name Doug Engelbart before I don't remember the year
    Exactly. Do you hear you g duck Engelhardt? Yeah. If it's not going to make it
    better for you if I write Douglas make sure that she is. On so the way it was
    designed to add some buttons with the bottom and two wheels, one
  persid: ''
- desc: in the x direction and one in the y direction. So it wasn't maybe as smooth
    as some of the current designs. So you didn't make a ton of money off that.
  persid: ''
- desc: But the idea was that's what the idea was from the late 60s So
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks he gave the mother of all demos. I think it was called The Fall joint
    Computer Conference in 1968.
  persid: ''
- desc: We demonstrate a system with a mouse and then for the other the other input
    devices according keyboard. Anyway and he he later won ACM Turing Award
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. So I think interpret. So
  persid: ''
- desc: that brings up the issue of intellectual property and I think that there are
    some designs that are promoted. Not because they're good but because French and
    other people's patents are required licenses. So you could
  persid: ''
- desc: you could see this peculiar ways of being and maybe even pick up your own
    examples for that
  persid: ''
- desc: so, intuition is is a good concept to have when we're thinking about interfaces.
    But it's not it's not separated from context. So our intuition comes from other
    tools that we're using. So I want to mention. So they're showing you the link.
    an attendee is really heuristics. Yeah. 9094. So, when we think about using an
    interface, we can we can have
  persid: ''
- desc: a measuring stick, so a metric to evaluate design and see whether the interface
    is good or bad or whether it's just a personal me there are some things that my
    wife says, or just my my particular ideas about things. So it won't necessarily
    translate to everybody else.
  persid: ''
- desc: But using this list, so I'll just read through the list and then we can
  persid: ''
- desc: so visibility system status. design should always keep users informed about
    what's going on through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.
    There's a match between the system and the real real world. The design should
    speak the user's language use words phrases, concepts familiar to the familiar
    to the user rather than internal jargon. should follow real world conventions
    making information appear in a natural logical order.
  persid: ''
- desc: user control and freedom. So the users often perform actions by mistake. They
    need a clearly marked emergency exit to leave the unwanted action without having
    to go through an extended process so
  persid: ''
- desc: I using my phone to take pictures and then send them to Dropbox made me feel
    like I didn't have much control because I had to go through the process of selecting
    the photos and moving them
  persid: ''
- desc: and it's a nice feature but I made some mistakes and I did couldn't go back
    to undo them. I had to start again. So that's an example. So you may be able to
    think of examples of interfaces that don't follow these heuristics. Consistency
    and standards. Well, we've mentioned it here. On the last board users should not
    have to wonder whether different words situations or actions mean the same thing.
    Follow platform and industry conventions.
  persid: ''
- desc: Here error prevention, good error messages that are important but the best
    designs carefully to prevent problems from occurring in the first place. either
    eliminate error prone conditions or check for them and present users with a confirmation
    option before they commit to the action. So when you see when you get a series
    of alert boxes that said, Do you want to confirm and 99 times out of 100 Is it
    just needs to have a but the ok button clicked. But it's the one time out of 100
    where it's really doing something that you need to think about that gets gets
    hidden in the in the mass of alert boxes that can cause problems. So that's what
    I think of when I see we'll hear prevention. So recognition rather than recall.
    So instead of having to recall a command for a certain function we just it's much
    easier to recognize it. flexibility and efficiency of use shortcuts hidden from
    novice users may speed up the interaction for the expert users such that the design
    can cater both to inexperienced and experienced users. aesthetic and minimalist
    design. interfaces should not can contain information that is relevant, irrelevant,
    or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with
    the relevant units of information and diminishes the relative visibility.
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't know I think that is that clear. So a bit about the alert box example.
    We don't want to
  persid: ''
- desc: we don't want to put more importance information. So that can obscure the
    really important information. help users recognize, diagnose and recover from
    errors. Error messages should be expressed in plain language, no error codes and
    precisely indicate the problem and constructively suggest a solution
  persid: ''
- desc: and help and documentation. It's best if the system doesn't need any additional
    explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users
    understand how to complete their tasks Okay. In the last two minutes, I just want
    to introduce this concept of the Gulf of execution and evaluation the example
    here is in the textbook as well. So we'll talk about it in more detail. On Friday.
    So we have the user the person using the computer or the artifact So, this is
    supposed to be allowed to talk so there's information that flows two ways. So
    the person starts with the idea of accomplishing something they have a goal they
    like to accomplish maybe recording attendance in your courses. So they have that
    goal and they can convert that into steps into commands that can be executed on
    the interface. And then once those steps are taken, or alternatively you just
    hold on for one minute please for the conversations didn't help very much. Anyway,
    so the other direction so we can see that the interface is in a particular state.
    Whether we're on the right page or we have to use navigation but the flow of information
    this way. The user understands what's going on or what the impact of the commands
    were. So I think that's one minute late. I apologize for keeping your extra on
    a Wednesday. Anyway, so we'll pick up there on Friday. Okay. Thanks very much.
    For today. Is anyone for office hours? I was trying to be good about three and
    when I say I'm gonna be available I
