- desc: oh seven figured out why it's not recognizing my schedule meetings for class
    constantly notetaking anyway so, we have the individual assignment one do today
    are there any questions? Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: They're required number of items.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now I don't think there are more than one has that So, I gave you the target
    page. Yeah. So I don't mean you have to have a full page but more than one sentence
    and not another full page with 14 like fun either. So just use judgment on the
    target. Page lengths are just to be valid for you. So there's not a hard and fast
    rule. You had a question for you. The the goal is the bottom at the bottom so
    just focus on the quadrants or empathy mafia. I've gotten a couple of notes about
    some security issues where people can see other people's student numbers. So if
    you'd like to report those to me, I'll send them along and we can we can tweet
    being a teacher for learning roles. So we send a lot to me somehow. I would appreciate
    that. Okay. You can use the participation discussion forum. For example.
  persid: ''
- desc: By saying or thinking while doing your process, or like what do you mean by
    saying like this is a project, but you're just like
  persid: ''
- desc: confused. About that. Say When You Want me to show the barcode the QR code
    for attendance,
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll do that first. Pretty close to the false bottom of the window so anyone
    happy the Alouettes beat the MTA Elks on the weekend
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, that's sorry You're excused. That means the rays can still make the
    playoffs are nice. I guess.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, okay empathy. Okay, so those are the four quadrants right now in a
    particular order. So, does is probably the easiest one I mean, it's the most straightforward
    as you say. Take the cap off my marker and write on the board. That's what I'm
    doing. So that, that's pretty straightforward. So we can observe that. And when
    you're observing yourself, you have to take a step. Back to say okay, now I'm
    doing this you know, there are many things maybe that you riding a bike or something
    you don't always think about all the steps involved because you just know how
    to do it. So to speak, or whatever else when I'd rather activity and pick up the
    comes naturally to you. You don't think about the steps that you didn't think
    about when you were learning to do that activity.
  persid: ''
- desc: So as asking yourself, what you're doing to accomplish something in the interactive
    interface. That's fairly straightforward. I think
  persid: ''
- desc: that what's next maybe that's maybe easiest. And maybe says it's also on the
    easy side because you can just say
  persid: ''
- desc: suppose if you're really a method actor, perhaps or something, you're really
    getting into the role of being a teacher of the interface. Maybe you just turn
    your voice recorder on and then you can just imagine yourself getting into the
    role and then they'd see what you say and as you work through that. I'm not saying
    you need to do that. I'm just as an example, is that example, helping or causing
    me to scratch your head further? Okay, any one scratch? No. No Okay. All right.
    So what what you're doing so maybe recall the steps that you're going through
    okay, now I have to do this. I wish I didn't have to click so much. You can see
    this as my experience with your courses. Like that. I glad to be a wish I didn't
    have to click so much.
  persid: ''
- desc: Because everything seems to need to have 10 times as many mouse clicks as
    I would like to
  persid: ''
- desc: use so when we're dealing with other people. When we're giving, asking them
    to use an interface to do something we might ask him to think user think aloud
    protocol.
  persid: ''
- desc: Imagine what that is right. So when you're doing something explain what you're
    thinking about when you're doing that. So if you get if you get in the habit of
    thinking about what you're doing and talking about it for yourself and imagine
    what it'd be like for you or I'm not sure if he's becoming more helpful or less
    helpful, so you've helped me so imagine that someone else is giving you this.
    You can think about someone else giving you the task to complete as well the failing
    teacher per learning user in your courses. And then you imagine yourself taking
    that on and then speaking so the says part for them female may not not at all
    just your inner voice but some things you might say out loud, like we're clicking.
    For example, that's what I might say. Like any state would say, in common but
    using certain interfaces on your courses
  persid: ''
- desc: so that feels it's a little bit less subjective. It's about what you're feeling.
    I'm feeling frustrated and are feeling dissatisfied because I can just I have
    a goal in mind and I can just accomplish that goal by setting things up in your
    courses. Right, so that's more here. That's more of a user experience, kind of
  persid: ''
- desc: description so if I help you so questions not sure. Okay. Anyone else have
    questions? Okay, so I have an office hours today. How many people have tried to
    reach me on my office hour and have not been successful?
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, it's good and bad. Good that I haven't missed anybody, but I'm just
    sitting there. are still anyway. Feel like I'm somewhat off topic now. Let me.
    So where do we end up last? Day with metaphor discussion in our discussion of
    metaphors? We talked about cavemen
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. And the writing on bathroom stalls. So we can think of what's possible
    the goal of the metaphor is to help people understand what's possible. So if I
    say it's like punching a timecard or it's like, creating cave art leaving the
    cave art one is a little bit less and less practical, let's say the name maybe
    punching a timecard is a little bit more, more straightforward. Maybe that's more
    easily transferable to the idea of taking attendance.
  persid: ''
- desc: What about the fingerprint? fingerprint? I would say that's not necessarily
    a metaphor. Let's write it down anyway. Let's think about it using
  persid: ''
- desc: are face ID maybe. So maybe what we need is a metaphor to describe that
  persid: ''
- desc: it's a secure server the only person only the person who's in attendance can
    record their attendance. So since this isn't here to apologize again. So if you
    are going to indicate that synthesis was here so that you could do that as a punching
    a timecard you grab her card for her but if it's if it's a secure timecard that
    requires some biometrics. It's much harder to do.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's think about it. Do you have a comment? Say that
  persid: ''
- desc: sort of like a fossil
  persid: ''
- desc: fossil paper here so dinosaurs are here then the issue is when are they here?
    They are probably here before class started. And they were gone before class started
    as well. So what are the things we can do as a tenants in your courses. Or what
    does the attendance in your courses provide us and what could it provide us?
  persid: ''
- desc: That maybe? Maybe isn't, isn't clear from the way we talk about. So once a
    new way of talking about attendance that
  persid: ''
- desc: we could support advanced functions. Does that make sense? So it's more than
    just saying you're here because we can say
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe it's more it's more like a punch card. punching a card because we
    can indicate when when we said we are here we can also not only attendance allows
    for this but we can say I was a lot I started here and I'm punching out a certain
    time as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what other functions could be possible with your course attendance function?
    And what kind of metaphors can we think of to describe how to access those functions
    for people? I think the idea of signing out for attendances a big can of worms
    I don't want to get into actually but this is a little bit like a discussion from
    last week about the system keep track of us so you know when we're locked in.
    So we know when just to notice when you're gaudy and nice, so to speak, when we
    log in and what we're doing with the system or your course session and then when
    we log out. So a little bit of a group discussion so. So how do we describe it
    was a metaphor Okay, so those two things to think about Does that make sense?
    Well, so, attendance could could provide some kind of extra function. So just
    so right now you can record attendance and it doesn't matter when you do it during
    the session.
  persid: ''
- desc: So maybe that's all right. But I'm asking if there are if there are things
    that instruction could do that would be helpful to you.
  persid: ''
- desc: Saving features does that make sense? It's 10 o'clock. So I'm gonna spend
    five minutes talking about that. That'll get back together and then we'll get
    into project groups. So we'll talk about project groups. Make sure I was clear
    about that before at the end of our session today okay, discuss you sorry. It
    you You think about duct tape right that have to do with you take a picture from
    time to time to have to change the world right So, basically I want to talk to
    you You ever seen LSVT loud guys that work on Patreon morning day been waiting
    for more than two hours elementary school there are lawsuits or similar things
    think this video most likely be for the fire going on literally on still don't
    like want to get out my door
  persid: ''
- desc: sound
  persid: ''
- desc: okay should we get together last year was a very I don't have the outdoor
    you are the shirt okay everyone. So if you're comfortable or you are let's just
    say in our positions we'll have a quick a quick recap of our group discussions
    and then I'll ask you to get into your project groups. So everyone's familiar
    with your project groups. Okay, so anything that came up from your discussion
    about the possibilities for your course attendance. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: This isn't just your ability to mark yourself as present to the first 15 minutes
    of class. Figure out if you can do it but then I got mad at your courses because
    it sucks gonna do it when you get to class before you get to us. files the odds
    are once you get to class you're going to take a picture
  persid: ''
- desc: see seems to be so maybe I mean I can do I can. I can do something like that
    by saying from 939 45 I could do it
  persid: ''
- desc: but then I have to remember to show you the attendance between that range
    of time and if I don't have a QR code or don't have a password then that's another
    issue as time goes
  persid: ''
- desc: on, from President to late so when I saw a fight, I show you the QR codes
    and maybe five minutes the next five minutes you need to design an app is a tiny
    little bit of something
  persid: ''
- desc: that nobody looks
  persid: ''
- desc: at Okay, so. Okay, so how about some good discussions? Maybe we'll talk for
    a few minutes on Wednesday morning. Now, what I want you to do is so everybody
    should be in a project group. Maybe not everyone's aware of the project group
    you're in
  persid: ''
- desc: so some of you are I think so you should be able to I'm not in a project group
    I dislike for project group and members. You shouldn't be able to see the three
    people or four people in your group
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so is that as everyone access that is Are you clear about that? So if
    there are some changes that you want me to make, you just need to talk to everybody
    and make sure that's okay. And then telling me I can I can make the switch. So
    the first part of the project is due on the 12th. So it's a week from Wednesday.
    So we'll talk about that in more detail on Wednesday also. Is there a deadline?
  persid: ''
- desc: There's always a possibility we'll talk about that again. So everyone's happy
    with the project group or you're gonna tell me today
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, and if you want me to make changes, make sure you talk to everybody
    involved. So I still end up with groups of 416 groups of four plus one. Okay,
    so I didn't expect everyone to be so happy with the way things are set up. I thought
    there'd be more discussion. Okay. So we want to talk more about attendance. Last
    four minutes. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this feature Firstly, it's bound by the last time and what it is to take
    a selfie. So you have to take a picture, attach a picture. And so record the picture
    and the timestamp. So what the metaphor for that is just like showing up I guess
    the professor was no everyone to check the names. We think it was required. The
    fact that professor to check the selfies to make sure it's in the classroom
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah
  persid: ''
- desc: as timestamps.
  persid: ''
- desc: When you I heard you talked about this earlier I thought about the P real.
    So, these are posts these posts on the geekly fun options right. People wouldn't
    say proper track is fun. I think you're gonna say
  persid: ''
- desc: probably encryption of the attendance password along with limiting the time.
  persid: ''
- desc: About people in the back and the ideas their garage your name properly. Anyway.
    Any ideas in the back?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, we are talking about summarization of companies out there any other
    last thoughts about attendance? Yeah, so
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe like sort of awkward every time and you don't have that much been said
    beforehand? I'd say like the five minutes answer to my friends I can because I'm
    doing
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. So that you in the back there.
  persid: ''
- desc: We can discuss avoiding loss and then added as a response. To the meeting
    in this recording class Okay, last
  persid: ''
- desc: one here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Like you can make us watch your video informative video and we can respond
    to it within like two to three minutes. So that those who are not here
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, as an answer question I'll take a better picture. Thanks. Anyway, so
    think around a time maybe some clothes anyway. Okay, so we'll continue our discussion
    on Wednesday. Have a good Monday. Take care Thank you for today it's other chairs.
    You're
