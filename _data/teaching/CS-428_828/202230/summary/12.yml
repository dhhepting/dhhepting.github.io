- desc: If there was an artifact, the projects would disband and ask them to use a
    concrete example to go one thing there that I say I do but i don't i up Morning,
    Morning everyone can you hear me all right better now oh I didn't turn director
    on there we go refer the content but also mine is very you can tell exactly what
    the big content is technically Friday. Technically if your classes tomorrow tomorrow
    will be Friday I woke up thinking today was Friday and then realize it's Wednesday
    and you're disappointed but I made it better. But actually it's on Monday you
    know, I was really concerned.
  persid: ''
- desc: Either you're very tired or you've been traveling
  persid: ''
- desc: long distances
  persid: ''
- desc: well, anyway Thursday's don't buy the rest, other other weeks. So we're also
    going to be Friday. But so remember that Friday is the National Day for truth
    and reconciliation. So you're being encouraged to wear orange shirts tomorrow
    before them. Before Friday, the bookstore may have some they're giving the first
    nation so it's not a happy Friday and try to pay for reflection Okay, so. Now
    just see that the Right, exactly, see. See the whole screen every second I want
    to point out on it. It works on certain browsers but on others so I'm going to
    try and still work on that. And if you have suggestions about how to fix the JavaScript
    let me know what's happening with your JavaScript? Well, it's not this hard should
    come up with something.
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, as you said your next meeting date.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, and then over here? recognizes it's Wednesday. But it doesn't put the
    Lincoln for the meeting today. So there are a few issues. an iMac so now I have
    I got created. I started I tested Firefox on my Mac and it didn't work and it
    wasn't okay I couldn't find it. I thought it was going on and I upgraded to Firefox
    this edition got fixed. So then I downloaded Microsoft Edge for my
  persid: ''
- desc: MacBook
  persid: ''
- desc: so I could find a case that didn't work on my MacBook. I think Microsoft Edge
    has this PDF viewer is
  persid: ''
- desc: drawn to do whatever you want. It's pretty robust as a PDF editor.
  persid: ''
- desc: Just different
  persid: ''
- desc: that's good okay, well that's good to know. That Microsoft Edge on my Mac
    on my MacBook showed the page correctly as well. So I'm going to sit here after
    class for a little bit and track down some issues here. Anyway so let me go back
    to our meeting here
  persid: ''
- desc: I had a link in the outline for the day but I guess I didn't remove it. It's
    not showing obviously there's a password for today.
  persid: ''
- desc: History is everything teammates. Seems to me students which is children
  persid: ''
- desc: me now so we had a few students and I had discussion after class on Monday
    about attendance. And I said I was going to put a choice activity up but I thought
    I'll still do that but maybe a group discussion today dependents take. So the
    framing of the choice or the question I was going to ask on your courses which
    I'll put on the website today. is would you rather Evening? session
  persid: ''
- desc: so I apologize I'm writing a smile on the board here. I make somebody come
    up to the second row in the back of the class for the game board and so the question
    is Would You Rather record your own attendance each meeting? Or like the house,
    how would you like the system would monitor your access and when you're logged
    in during the meeting times. The giant computer down the central computer will
    record your attendance
  persid: ''
- desc: automatically
  persid: ''
- desc: or is there another idea? No attendance. Don't take attendance or
  persid: ''
- desc: I could just keep everything
  persid: ''
- desc: when you finish my idea so far I could meet everyone's names.
  persid: ''
- desc: Old school school
  persid: ''
- desc: take a lot of time. We have more than 65 students.
  persid: ''
- desc: We can get each other's secrets that he can treat with a handshake. You can
    verify me.
  persid: ''
- desc: All right, good. Go. Announce sounds fun. Low on the practicality scale.
  persid: ''
- desc: I was doing this like you just posted maybe if basketball
  persid: ''
- desc: so are we gonna keep the status quo doing so let's stick with the first two
    options reduce the
  persid: ''
- desc: amount of time that the attendance is opened up first aid
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I guess we could do that. The advantage
  persid: ''
- desc: to me it's worth I spent 3000 More than $3,000 to be here if I don't show
    up in class. That's because I've already kind of already taken a hit wasting my
    money on some client we're having we're already having a lot of discussions in
    this class. So people are posting the discussions and you've seen them in class
    and document class names you've ever seen before. Editing the wiki and just copy
    what other people said it may be pretty obvious to them.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so the question is what? What's appropriate nouns so there can be something
    that I'm giving a little bit of reward for terms of participation to make sure
    that you're to get it to give you an incentive to record attendance and not make
    it so much that it's putting undue strain on you. Think the only thing
  persid: ''
- desc: you have to consider with the current system as far as I'm aware I can get
    a phone right now.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so I think we address that issue already. If you're at home, and you
    just waiting you can text somebody. Like send this to say, give me the password
    or if you'd send me the QR code
  persid: ''
- desc: that was before enforcing this online. So now if you go to my web page, you
    can see it without asking sinless and then you can just enter the password and
    go back to sleep.
  persid: ''
- desc: So previously, before posting this case, you'd have to ask us to save your
    password. And then you log into your
  persid: ''
- desc: courses and password. Go back to sleep.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I don't think this is that that's always a risk of people. Not in not stay
    awake for the whole class. Anyone here not saying wait. Anyway, seemed like that
    was gonna be funnier. So when we talk about last name, we can relate to this discussion.
    Start talking
  persid: ''
- desc: about metaphors. Right so what are what are some ways that we can think about
    recording attendance? What are the what are some metaphors for that, that we can
    use to take an electronic signature
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'm gonna ask for five or 10 minute group discussion here. We'll use our
    groups to discuss this issue
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's also consider there any issues that come up okay. Does that make
    sense? So what are some what are some metaphors we can
  persid: ''
- desc: use to indicate use to help people take their attendance using your courses
    and then are there any issues that come up? And like maybe the metaphor we have?
    And exactly, maybe there's some room for improvement. So those two aspects of
    the question makes sense. Any questions or the questions? Questions? No questions
    about the questions? Yes, you're taking you're taking on the role of the teacher.
    We're not a real teacher who can see under student student numbers. That's that's
    the adjustment. You're like a teacher but you're better teachers for learning.
    Effectively teachers, yes. Okay, so, can we have a discussion about that? You
    can see your computers and messaging. Tuned our
  persid: ''
- desc: last piece
  persid: ''
- desc: when you actually want to have. Right like Okay, bye. What I did the I did
    on here you just do a count of like whatever the nature of who you are all need
    somebody you have to say the picture fitness without mixing across all genres.
    Yeah, but like it'd be nice to just talk to you are learning Haskell in response
    to everyone in our team forget everyone how are you training joining us? So we
    did that so basically just think about the secretary right are there hello, everyone
    what's going on? Ready
  persid: ''
- desc: yes next year alright guys let's hop right in Sure. You get it so.
  persid: ''
- desc: Attached to like reading the title now
  persid: ''
- desc: I have a folder on your web store. Or
  persid: ''
- desc: an IP are
  persid: ''
- desc: no data privacy. Wait they weren't done
  persid: ''
- desc: what can we do now?
  persid: ''
- desc: Kidding yeah no one of you thank you now it's always been a long week indicate
    the issues we're discussing today those are short like this was all so, so. Good.
    Right now. Not a lot.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can imagine some other interfaces. So, think about kind of far as this
    so recording attendance is like something so that's how we can phrase it metaphor.
    And I'm aware that we've been told similes are like and metaphors. There's some
    subtlety there that we're not going to get into.
  persid: ''
- desc: We'll just stipulate to that. potential conflict. Anyway, does that make more
    sense? Okay, let's take a look at a couple of minutes and then we'll get get together
    to discuss what's going on here and you've signed up. Up you Sure? You want to
  persid: ''
- desc: do that I guess. Gate out of sight out. Basically so what we can do is make
    sure that
  persid: ''
- desc: we can just use our student student data
  persid: ''
- desc: we Okay, shall we wrap up and then get back together as a group as as the
    class do you want to do something
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so can we get get get back together in the class setting please.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, just a quick comment about what I put on the screen here. This is a document
    that I thought I had like to make and make it available to you. But it'd be seen
    as of June 2021. These are some standards for cars this the doors so interesting.
  persid: ''
- desc: That switch should be
  persid: ''
- desc: not more than 1.5 meters from the door and then as the height tighter range
    of values words position so that hallway in education building doesn't meet those.
    Curious what are the standards for Saskatchewan? So when I was talking to the
    Saskatchewan buildings Council, they said oh maybe check with the city. So, Senator,
    maybe they just started they don't have a nice stocking your diagrams that comes
    up with
  persid: ''
- desc: Google search
  persid: ''
- desc: so anyway, we can keep that in the back burner. See how we can anyway I just
    wanted to show that this is what I was. There's some resource hours, there are
    some resources. So this is a metaphor. It's good like to share a metaphor Yeah,
    signing and. Right, okay, thanks. You had your hand up our stuff
  persid: ''
- desc: is actually a metaphor
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so I'm sorry. About that
  persid: ''
- desc: like clocking in for work. Okay. Yes, participation award
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. Attendance has likely been some graffiti and another.
  persid: ''
- desc: Two apps so for a good time, call
  persid: ''
- desc: just showing
  persid: ''
- desc: me maybe say saying that you were here without because showing up as is not
    quite the
  persid: ''
- desc: metaphor. It's
  persid: ''
- desc: letting people know I showed up. Okay. Okay, okay. Rogers secondary fingerprinted?
    I guess you could say registering a TNA satellite TV show. Morning so for those
    who don't know, v match is public database and use Track identify for this one
    I think serial so your information is not public, but it's not private.
  persid: ''
- desc: Could you also say registering your ancestry?
  persid: ''
- desc: Door 23 and not as more elderly
  persid: ''
- desc: man putting his handprint on
  persid: ''
- desc: okay all right.
  persid: ''
- desc: Opposite of collecting autographs at a theme park and book
  persid: ''
- desc: like other people's attention, it's not your own.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, you, me like getting the same sense as your art and it's true. Right
    so I apologize I don't want to discourage anybody. Sometimes
  persid: ''
- desc: like taking a picture okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay Is it like renting a house or like paying for a ticket in a parking lot?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so now we have two minutes left so, are there other So, if we think
    about attendance, these being reports for attendance taking in New York courses
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. Be real. Where everyone? Yeah, everyone's given a notification at the
    same time and you have two minutes to take a selfie and then a picture with the
    other camera on your phone. Show wherever you are doing.
  persid: ''
- desc: That that still pops up
  persid: ''
- desc: according to my brother Yes, he's a younger person
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, just so So are any anything that would count as an improved? So these
    are ways we can think about the current
  persid: ''
- desc: metaphor any improvements.
  persid: ''
- desc: Came up in discussion anyone have some improvements said already odds 21 After
    sorry. Too much fun talking about so these are these are good discussions to have.
    So I'm not trying to
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't want to cut off brainstorming because we can thinking outside the
    box. It's a healthy way to approach these issues. So anyway, having said that
    Wednesday, and 21 It's time for people to get to the next classes and so on. So
    thank you for today.
