- desc: So this is really frustrating that when I switch between roles I get error
    messages because they don't have the right permissions
  persid: ''
- desc: right error message is made some sort of logging activity so if the students
    somehow got on a session like the IPS and trying to go in I tend to log on
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: If you go to status set click on the top and status set. It will should allow
    you to change the settings No
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh status set and then scroll down to a new set of statuses
  persid: ''
- desc: that you scroll down a little further to show you the status is there. Okay.
    So you can remove them or change them or make them available for students first,
    a certain period of time
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so what I noticed Okay, so clicking on the question mark for available
    for students I can you read that all right
  persid: ''
- desc: so, thing that I want to point out or I want to do consider is
  persid: ''
- desc: makes sense but the titles available for students
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. Yeah, so, this one isn't too bad? I guess the question I get very So,
    is this consistent so, I want to hide I want to hide something for the students
    I set two minutes to zero and we noticed another way to hide things from students.
    So, there's an eyeball and maybe there's some other ones. So important is consistency
    or the lack of consistency in your courses for Moodle it's not. So the other thing
    I noticed about just a little too big now. automatically set when not mark so
    speaking of surfing people don't record it let's say so now how do we get rid
    of it?
  persid: ''
- desc: Did your available for me?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so the other thing I notice, so we just went read through the instructions
    if you do want to hide it from students enter zero minutes
  persid: ''
- desc: where it's blank,
  persid: ''
- desc: then it's always available. That was that was the part of the documentation
    that was good. So to explain that. But then on the other hand. We said well, why
    not just use the eyeball. But here's the eyeball. So let's Okay, so that removes
    the option so, and why is there a delete icon here but not on the other ones.
  persid: ''
- desc: Did you add delete? I mean did you add delete was late one that you've added
    yourself or
  persid: ''
- desc: no I did not do that excuse
  persid: ''
- desc: me, they probably have a couple of fields that cannot be deleted, specifically
    because the form probably will crash if you delete all the fields and try and
    run it and they don't want to do error checking.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so any any markers, any pupil, any students who have done marking error?
  persid: ''
- desc: So you notice if you download a worksheet you have you can't just it's not
    clear which columns you need. So it's better to keep them all
  persid: ''
- desc: and just add the grade adding. And then if you don't, if instructor hasn't
    clicked on feedback, comments it won't just give you that column and the download
    and grading worksheet. You have to go back and add it so I or the instructor has
    to add it so that it appears in the way that your course is or Moodle wants to
    read it should we set
  persid: ''
- desc: a time for President to make lady available for that entire session?
  persid: ''
- desc: So what I'm curious now is if I say 90 minutes or less to update it doesn't
    mind having the status available for longer than the class time.
  persid: ''
- desc: Can you set up for negative things? That means it's available for but as soon
    as we start the session
  persid: ''
- desc: it'd be interesting to see how that how it interprets it so can you I think
    you can add an attendance feature in the experimental course.
  persid: ''
- desc: So really, maybe you want to say for the first half of class you can be present
    and then
  persid: ''
- desc: see, I would like to say you get to be present for the if you click on the
    first 25 minutes late if you click on the last 25 minutes, but it's not clear
    that that's what is being conveyed in the interface. Anyway, so this sounds like
    a good midterm question. stumped the van
  persid: ''
- desc: '25'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so let's read the comment again. So it's not clear to me. So present
    might like to have that option. So I suppose if we set this, set it like this.
    Then the screen would come up with and we didn't just have
  persid: ''
- desc: so another one that sticks out here is. That's another heuristic that seems
    to be because I can set things up here like it seems to me the system was helping
    me that it wouldn't let me make the status available for longer than the attendance
    is open. And I wouldn't be able to enter negative numbers would have a better
    explanation of what
  persid: ''
- desc: perhaps is the valence. I have class objects because each category can have
    different so yeah, it doesn't make sense to make the present available outside
    of class but say absent that you can find yourself absent notes under class hours.
    If you're not in classes over, you can still Saturday or work their classes over
    you can say that you weren't there. It he said the timer for each different
  persid: ''
- desc: that makes sense that he would still you could still get a participation.
    You should suffer you're still participating and marking yourself apps class
  persid: ''
- desc: icon because when you access it has, of course instructor you can have options.
    That's the That's it. But does the icon also hide it from your interface? Because
    the no just said if you put zero in high school students
  persid: ''
- desc: switch roles
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay submit
  persid: ''
- desc: attendance okay 45 minutes Yeah, sure. I think the minute that 25 minutes
    is working late. summaries are common right now. Maybe QR code. So much latency
    Oh
  persid: ''
- desc: I thought we put 25 And I guess it didn't leave isn't available because I
    made it invisible excuses. So those two are not available in that I have apps
    as my other option
  persid: ''
- desc: excused as a default option. It's an interesting default option considering
    itself mark so it's I've decided that I was excused on doing it up like yeah,
    you know what I think they would excuse me to put a password on that. So
  persid: ''
- desc: you give them a password then they fix
  persid: ''
- desc: themselves so it wouldn't be so, present option because it's not hidden, but
    it's it's not 40 minutes before class time. would be helpful to have a note there
    to say
  persid: ''
- desc: you can only record if you're present. If you can 40 minutes before class
    or whatever it misinterprets imagery independent of that can or it could just
    not show it all. Anyway
  persid: ''
- desc: because assuming this activity is only available once it's an option, it might
    ever be difficult. So maybe a preview or some kind of explanation. would be helpful.
    Okay, just checked the patient for oh, are you able to get one
  persid: ''
- desc: that plays into consistency
  persid: ''
- desc: that it might be because I can't believe present
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe because they accept because
  persid: ''
- desc: that started and people have chosen them. I mean people also test a theory
  persid: ''
- desc: who can't be a class just to say they're absent.
  persid: ''
- desc: Don't want to download a spreadsheet.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe it is a few because as yourself as you can delete excuse me, so maybe
    if you just enter as a student.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what I see is that there are only present and absent options in the data
    file. For in their responses that I've received so far. So that that seems to
    shoot down the theory that that we had data that's why we couldn't remove the
    option
  persid: ''
- desc: well I just spent not today so it's okay
  persid: ''
- desc: Evening Okay, so I invite your suggestions for questions, and you can suggest
    answers as well. If nobody suggests questions and answers that doesn't mean you
    won't have to
  persid: ''
- desc: submit negative questions
  persid: ''
- desc: if we submit a certain number of questions let's say 20. We know for sure
    that of those questions like the midterm questions will be one of those
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so the midterm is going to be 50 minutes long in class. So chances are
    there won't be 20 questions.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, but I mean like, if we put a lot, a lot of work into this, then you
    can say okay, I will choose from these questions. Outside
  persid: ''
- desc: What if we just have random questions from random others? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: that could work. I wouldn't say random questions but you might find it example
    from another class we talked about interface design or our discussion about Unicode
    and jets on Friday might be a good source of questions.
  persid: ''
- desc: For short answer
  persid: ''
- desc: yes. So you can have different you're willing to Okay, so I said that. I believe
    that at the start a class you mentioned stores. I was just gonna say that. So
    let's end our formal portion of class now and a few minutes before we have to
    run off to your next class
  persid: ''
- desc: should be or your groups Okay, so see you on Friday. Thank you for today and
    we'll see you on Friday. For presentation cool cool stuff. I think it's there's
    two people so anyway, thank you for today and I'll be here if you have questions.
  persid: ''
