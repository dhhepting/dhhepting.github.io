- desc: emigrants? Your pastor this second monitoring I kept trying to pull tap I
    can see I just like to reopen Okay Is everyone doing today so there's our QR code
    for today you can make the QR code on Windows eight titled puzzles or you have
    to shuffle the pieces to get the right code. You can do attendance to prevent
    people at home from
  persid: ''
- desc: don't make it so hard for people because I know they Well, depending on what
    kind of QR code it is, there's a block and we we did these cards for the binary
    guessing game. We've seen those cards, four cards. So the idea was to show you
    four cards you told me if you could remember you guess the number between zero
    and 50 and you tell me whether I show you a card you tell me what your numbers
    on that card. And then once you answer those four questions added the psychic
    energy in the room and guess your number
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll bring up next time and there's there's a few sets in the office if you
    want to pick them up anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: seemed funny when I started writing it out but so there isn't a driverless
    cars because we designed them we put a QR code on. On Demand. We tried adding
    different graphics to the QR code. So some places we put the graphics you can
    still get the data from the QR code and other places are impossible. So I think
    I don't think you can mess with these corners.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: you can excited for the binary guessing game on Friday. I am okay. That's
    good to hear. You seem to be a little bit short on students today. Anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we'll talk about the exam questions so we've got this handled. So let's
    talk about the due date first. And so it's due a week from today. Is that all
    right for everybody or would you like a little bit more time? No, that's not it's
    too late. You do Friday and then
  persid: ''
- desc: we could do Monday. The 17th. Stover I met Chairman Friday of that week okay.
    So
  persid: ''
- desc: the current session of members of your group select an existing website or
    software application. So the idea is to look at something that's publicly available,
    because you're gonna want something that people have had experience with, or your
    group at least has had experience with and because you're going to have some people
    test, we're going to arrange it so that people will be testing your interface
    designs. So it'd be nice and people have experience with it as well. So and the
    reason you do something that's existing instead of designing something from scratch,
    it's a there are a lot of lots of opportunities out there for improvements. So
    we're not proud of the Golden project isn't to code something new or you build
    something from scratch, but it's the focus on looking at areas for improvement
    and making designs and so the first one will do a paper and pencil sketch. So
    that's the design you'll be testing with other people from class. And then based
    on your feedback and your experience in dealing with the tests you'll make some
    refinements to come up with two interfaces that you passed and then based on the
    feedback and your your insights in the process, accomplish one interface that
    you're looking for was to be
  persid: ''
- desc: Canada that you'll advance and we'd like you to do is make it more of a high
    fidelity prototype so kind of a mock up and you can use some of the tools that
    are available. You can do HTML you can do PowerPoint with buttons. So the idea
    is to illustrate your design, something that looks like it could be running on
    a computer. So you're not right. You're not creating the whole functionality interface.
    You're creating a mock up, it's running on the looks like it's running on the
    computer and giving feedback to people that you're not sure just demonstrating
    this higher fidelity prototype. Okay, so that's part four. The project.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the first part is is about understanding the issues so we're going to focus
    on empathizing, conducting research and to develop an understanding your users
  persid: ''
- desc: and to maybe understand the meaning of the speaker that's why I'm getting
    feedback.
  persid: ''
- desc: See that's hard to define is to combine your observations and observe where
    your user problem users problems exist. So I made a comment here that you can
    choose my website because we use it for examples of meetings. So we're, I think
    we're doing quite well with your courses with the attendance function as an example.
    So we do like that freedom to choose something on my website. I won't be upset
    if you did.
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't want to put you on the spot now to say your website sucks. It really
    needs
  persid: ''
- desc: it really needs some work so so I think I've I fixed that today. Page. So
    a combination of me update, using strict and cleaning up some of my JavaScript
    and then also browsers being updated to the current version. It seems to work
    so if you're please have a peek at at some time and let me know if you're still
    having if it shows up correctly or if it doesn't. Gonna get to the today
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's HTTP okay. So continuing is teaching.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'll check this one to see if it's. So notice this is working now. So let's
    come up with the links
  persid: ''
- desc: do you have a Mac? I think it would sneak so far it was working before anyway.
    So please let me know if you find problems. On this page or other ones. Working
    for me
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, that's good you don't have to do it now. Okay, so basically there are
    three phases in our design thinking approach.
  persid: ''
- desc: So about understanding what's going on exploring alternatives. So we're generating
    ideas about possibilities creating a prototype represents some expressions of
    our ideas. And then we're testing and implementing. So understand, explore and
    materialize so each of those has two parts.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the idea of the double diamond is imagine he's like diamonds first of all.
    So you start out and then you run your thinking you use divergent thinking to
    gather ideas, and you refine those ideas and then
  persid: ''
- desc: and then you diverge and converge again. So this is the first part that we're
    give me a link, or a better source for this then my poorly drawn diamonds
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so does that make sense? So there's three parts three things one should
    do. So first of all, so understand this involves at the empathize and define stages.
    So in your group so everybody in your group will describe a sufficient detail
    to be relatable, an activity and a user wanting to complete that activity. So
    if we want to take attendance then it's about making sure that you can scan the
    QR code or enter the password and then it might be a student who sits in the front
    row of the class every day. It's very engaged, but maybe doesn't have a computer
    or somebody who's not always coming to class or say, to see it when when the QR
    code comes up for right so the idea of being specific about who we envision as
    users of our interface. So that makes sense. Shows zoom in a bit for this.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: you have an activity and to use a wind group activity. So on the 31st, we're
    going to have a guest from Center for Continuing Education, the Dean of that unit,
    because they've undertaken a review of their programs. Use personas and journey
    mapping as part of their process. So that's the kind of stuff that we're interested
    in doing here. So have you Christy shorts, I think. I will make sure that I have
    her name right before she comes. Okay. So describe and then empathize. So everyone
    in your group will create an empathy map for each activity and user. So if there
    are four people in your group each person will need for empathy maps and your
    group's mission will have 16 in total. So if the four of you are in a group, each
    of you describes an activity and a user you have in mind for that activity and
    then each of you do an empathy map. for that. Do we all have to choose a different
    user
  persid: ''
- desc: can that be overlapping the user we're envisioning?
  persid: ''
- desc: There can be overlap
  persid: ''
- desc: so we'll refine things a bit before going into the next stage. This is sort
    of getting some ideas so over time, you won't have to you feel refine your ideas
    of users
  persid: ''
- desc: and activities.
  persid: ''
- desc: So together as a group, identify specific aspects of the current interface
    that cause problems for the users, and look to examine the roots of those problems.
    Identify whatever user needs may be unmet. So don't worry about solutions or fixes
    or just trying to illustrate a word or some issues. You don't have to solve the
    problem. You just want identify it and solving the problem as part of the process.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? Okay, so seem okay. All right. So I thought maybe we
    would just continue our discussion on attendance, and think about how we might
    approach design improvements. And then also talk about the today page. So what's
    attendance? Let me switch to that okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's anyone else? have different experiences? With this? Page? So, what
    would what would be the downside? If I can go to this page and say see the QR
    code and then scan it or
  persid: ''
- desc: I think we need to establish what our goal is within 10 minutes because is
    our tracks two minutes are shoring up? How do we How much do we care about false
    positives and how much does it matter if people are getting into the systems who
    are skipping class? Because it's our goal to get into people who are in class
    and will lead a more intrusive whatever our goal is just a slight reward than
    it needs to be. unintrusive and seamless.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so why not? So why don't we get the QR
  persid: ''
- desc: code
  persid: ''
- desc: so that reminds me, let me come back to editing. I think I feel like it should
    know that I've switched roles and not giving permission there.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so I think I've disabled the password. Switch back into the role Yeah, so
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe it's
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe it's just an added layer of complication to do the password. at all
  persid: ''
- desc: just to present right. Reason not changing.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, the thing we're changing is the administration so that I don't have
    to show you the password.
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't have to show the password because you already posted the password
    on your website, right. So we can just do it ourselves without you. You know,
    presenting it to us. Yeah, okay. I prefer to having the password because this
    shows that students are still recommended to show up instead of just presenting
    or showing up, the faster they can just click on present say, Am I doing something
    else?
  persid: ''
- desc: This is not really an interface solution, but it is a solution. So what you
    can do is you can either like that so it's just you just enter like what your
    status is. Maybe once or twice per semester. You do a random check data like paper
    so he's pass out the paper and Yes, everyone should write their name. And then
    if it doesn't match at the student will close attendance for the whole semester.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, that's right. Like there so you can see each student just reading like
    what
  persid: ''
- desc: if I broke my leg on the way to school or riding my bike and somebody gave
    me or something.
  persid: ''
- desc: Right the your it says here your presence and there is a field over there
    which says excused. So what do people use that excuse I don't know because you
    shouldn't even if it's like a thing so yeah, excuse yourself
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, I don't think these are valuable to different
  persid: ''
- desc: states I
  persid: ''
- desc: think excused absence should be only available for the professor. Even the
    late
  persid: ''
- desc: reward honestly like if you're honest, like they are off.
  persid: ''
- desc: Give this is for participation. Participate in class. We have main cards you
    know who's participating you can just go after. Remember airstone wouldn't shut
    up. I'm not giving them any participation rights for a stupid game and jokes but
    some distance and stuff I'll get to participation so
  persid: ''
- desc: talking about trade, trade on us is the password and important it's worth
    the pain of having the password. Whereas if I don't have a password, you can log
    in your courses and when the class starts at 930 You can register you can click
    so the way it said with a password is different than punching a time card because
    time cards you have. They're usually in the break room or your independent employee
    area. Can you punch that you don't have to ask the boss for a timecard so removing
    the password seems like a reasonable way to do this. And it is a trade off between
    making
  persid: ''
- desc: right there's more sectors or tanks are like tight for the company. You actually
    get paid. You're not paying to go to work.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, okay. So it's not a perfect metaphor. So we just saw what was our discussion
    and metaphors. We don't necessarily think we take everything from the metaphor
    though. We wanted to get some some essential ideas that are useful
  persid: ''
- desc: because we need to have an IP address restriction to do an activity there
    is a function in your courses for an idea.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. I seem to come across that in the past. So the other thing is, if I'm
    giving you record attendance during the class
  persid: ''
- desc: these aren't
  persid: ''
- desc: so valuable, I think it's just if you click a 930 or 935
  persid: ''
- desc: or you click at 1015
  persid: ''
- desc: That's a good indicator zone I think so. trade offs. trade off is really encouraging
    just like with the time punching the time clock or time cards in here that you're
    tracking, you're giving the way to indicate they were here.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we want to focus on on that and not being here. Getting paid to come to
    class
  persid: ''
- desc: which is which doesn't work very well. So let's see All right. So and at the
    minimum, if I take off the password
  persid: ''
- desc: people can still people who want to record attendance. Start off to log into
    our courses. For a minute or two
  persid: ''
- desc: and do that
  persid: ''
- desc: so I think maybe we exhausted all possibilities was attendance. To do it,
    there was an opportunity for an improvement here that instead of recording
  persid: ''
- desc: status present late and these, these aren't really mutually exclusive either.
    Anyway, so there could be other ways. So just not require an answer here but requires
    some different thing. So you just record the time okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I thought maybe it's useful to discuss this page so the question it says
    Anyway, now that it's working seems to be working reliably. Is this useful?
  persid: ''
- desc: I can see myself using it.
  persid: ''
- desc: To be truthful. I can gather most information I need about the classroom,
    the Euro courses calendar page, which is quicker to access to jump to your list.
    It's not so much your page design and more so a factor of convenience. Because
    if I have to go through your courses to get to your page and when I'm once I'm
    already in your courses and the calendar is there I kind of already have a little
    summary of the calendar stuff coming up. So
  persid: ''
- desc: Can people access my web page?
  persid: ''
- desc: I find the most
  persid: ''
- desc: beneficial part of this assignment portion of your website plays out the assignments
    nicely and the countdown is also nicely
  persid: ''
- desc: put together. I was
  persid: ''
- desc: if there's an assignment due to the issue
  persid: ''
- desc: seven pages to display the most
  persid: ''
- desc: recent are like the nearest assignment coming up. So if we've done assignment
    one now
  persid: ''
- desc: we have this new project coming out. If I go out today, it'd be nice to have
    a reminder that hey, this is coming up.
  persid: ''
- desc: But you should be aware that you need to deal with insurance.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if so sticking with the today page
  persid: ''
- desc: would I indicate what did you get
  persid: ''
- desc: would it begin to show the length assignment here
  persid: ''
- desc: or at the end of the day?
  persid: ''
- desc: And then what about what about the structure in terms of half hours? So I
    I'm just reading the data from I'm exposing the way I've organized the data because
    I miss scheduled in half hour increments.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it'd be better to not have two entries for the course. Just have it go
    from 930 to 1030. And then, I could have three to noon time
  persid: ''
- desc: so well, we'll pick up the discussion on Friday. Again. If you have a chance
    to think about things that are on my website may see us Department website and
  persid: ''
- desc: how they can be more useful. That would be helpful. So I have office hours
    a day but I haven't appointment so try this afternoon Yes, we'll talk about the
