- desc: So this is one thing about consistency I can just click a box to say no password
    once it's set up a password an ethical believe them all anyway so there's that
    if you're interested and being benefited display
  persid: ''
- desc: doesn't feel like a four to eight lecture unless I started off by suggesting
    a cure
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so maybe anyone have other ideas about an interface is like blank any
    ideas
  persid: ''
- desc: what's important to you? Over the budget for two year old like it should be
    straightforward
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I'm still trying to say that this interface is like,
  persid: ''
- desc: positive for 200 Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you any other
  persid: ''
- desc: degree they can be
  persid: ''
- desc: a bridge Any other thoughts in the back evening? was supposed to be a railing
    but now it kind of
  persid: ''
- desc: like the rage surface, but anyway so, what if this is like a diagram we've
    drawn before so, how would you describe the concepts Who did we discussed earlier?
    In terms of a bridge but perhaps Okay, so yeah, there's execution well maybe.
    Does that look like golf, like bottom a very deep pit that we're crossing
  persid: ''
- desc: execution to Oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: thank you very much so, we're gonna go this way deciding how to take our or
    wet and translate into So, we say I want to do something we have a goal that we
    want to accomplish. So that's a restart and then we can cross the bridge
  persid: ''
- desc: and end up with commands we can execute on the interface so once we execute
    the commands we can interpret the state of the system after the commands or we
    might also interpret the state before we decide the next thing that commands might
    say it looks like I met this. I'm in this situation and I want to get into certain
    situations so I'm going to execute these commands
  persid: ''
- desc: so there might be some evaluation or back off as
  persid: ''
- desc: well. There's another it looks like it's only one but there's two here and
    then we get them and that this you interpret the state of the system and we evaluate
    it and we understand them come to understand the impact of our commands or
  persid: ''
- desc: the state of the interface on which we're going to execute the commands. So
    Umbridge could be very small. It could be very sturdy.
  persid: ''
- desc: Or it could be very long and very rickety. Like in those movies where it's
    a rope, bridge and flanks are falling out so in that case so we might think of
    the interface as being well, we can think about the quality of the bridge I guess
    as a way that we're crossing. We're dealing with the Gulf of execution and evaluation.
    So if it's an easy journey across the bridge then that's another way to say it's
    a good interface
  persid: ''
- desc: is the bridge metaphor to our discussion of the costs of execution and evaluation
    Okay, good to know So before we talk about the midterm questions for the project.
  persid: ''
- desc: For the submission of it says I don't have a group so does the group members
    just completely blind or do we submit a paper PDF but just
  persid: ''
- desc: know if people don't have to do anything
  persid: ''
- desc: I mean, they've worked hard. Ideally, they've worked with us and document
    billing one person needs to submit it I think that maybe fix a date for this
  persid: ''
- desc: website is now looking at more fathers policy thing for the radio.
  persid: ''
- desc: networks they just have to press environments. Seeing not teaching
  persid: ''
- desc: so when you click the link on your courses where it says policy, that one
    just says that this page doesn't exist. But if you go into your website and then
    work it works,
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. I will fix broken links if you find broken links let me know. So the
    idea is to divide 100 points. So if this far and you're in the group, and everything's
    fine give everybody 25 And a thumbs up so I have a little JavaScript there on
    that page.
  persid: ''
- desc: To format it for your online texts. Okay. I apologize. I've not kept to my
    mind so I'll be right that last one on the other side. So it's going to be in
    class on Friday. Three minutes application All right
  persid: ''
- desc: cool. Just like you cannot read and write short answer MCQ
  persid: ''
- desc: and medium length application of ideas that look like okay looks like okay
    so what are some good topics for questions closed book
  persid: ''
- desc: empathy maps I didn't catch that. Attendance.
  persid: ''
- desc: You this Canada not to see is to be kept separate and can be understood as
    two in binary should that be a question in the exam gonna have lots of pictures
    today. On. Design equity versus appetit. trade off
  persid: ''
- desc: trade offs so the first thing we talked about formative and summative evaluations
    remember that so in the last half of the class we'll talk about other kinds of
    evaluations that we can do
  persid: ''
- desc: going I remember I talked about is the midterm is a form of evaluation. So
    it gives you some indication of where you are in relation to the concepts for
    studying in class. And the final exam would be a summative evaluation. So did
    you do you have a good understanding of the concepts we've covered?
  persid: ''
- desc: So designing an interface do some formative evaluation to get ideas so we
    might ask people what they think they need even though they're not sure what they
    want.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we start with conversations and less you get an understanding of what needs
    to be built and then are we on the right track? towards? So there's a good example.
    Sam the textbook was also in Nielsen Norman Group, web pages vote to golf execution
    and evaluation and Bluetooth controls on your Windows 10. Right people received
    under a version of Windows since training the Texas also online so that gets heuristics
    and the golf course of execution and evaluation anything else? More than 150
  persid: ''
- desc: So my goal is not cause you to cramp cramps in your and so I'm gonna would
    say less than 10 Questions writing. The midterm exam will be like walk your walk
    in the park. So watch my wife and I watched Top Gun Maverick on the weekend anyone
    seen that? You say a long time ago. Well, this is the new one. Yeah, well it just
    it just became available for rent on Apple. Not too long ago. No, it was released
    in May. Yeah. But yeah, but for a long time. You only could buy it for $25 and
    not rent it. So anyway. So many people have seen Star Wars A New Hope
  persid: ''
- desc: so people who have seen both movies who see recognizes some similarities between
    the two. Star Wars the first Star Wars and a lot of second talk and movie. We
    were very, very similar. So that discussion came up, point comes up thinking about
    a metaphor for the midterm exam. Saying it's like hitting the exhaust fan on the
    desk that that's a good that's not an accurate that wouldn't be a good metaphor
    to describe the exam. But it would not be correct. It's not a good metaphor because
    it's not I'm not trying to make it impossible for the target. So let me throw
    it open to your suggestions for two minutes. Here. What's what would be a metaphor
    for the midterm you would like
  persid: ''
- desc: to be true for the exam. Maybe I should put that on the exam okay think about
    that we can maybe touch on at the beginning of class on Wednesday. Okay, any final
    questions or concerns for today? Thank you for today we'll see you on Wednesday
    right question about the group.
