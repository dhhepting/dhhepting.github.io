- desc: be producing more stuff like something related outside or, or doesn't have
    to be like a base in my lobby point to have. So if it's like, for example, giving
    people access to cell doesn't have to be like sending like a friend request on
    Facebook, where does it have to be something basic like sending well,
  persid: ''
- desc: so it could be it could be both, I guess, if you're the group you're working
    with, is familiar with Facebook and then they can take they can transfer their
    interactions with Facebook into this new interface. I think that's appropriate
    to do during
  persid: ''
- desc: the break so you will so we just had this discussion about the due dates seven
    zero for the seventh option after break just forget about the project. Okay, so
    I'm okay as making the seven.
  persid: ''
- desc: extremely generous
  persid: ''
- desc: So, in the first part we are each one of us have specific activities. So now
    the second topic only focuses on activity.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. Focus on one activity and one user so if you had more than one user,
    okay, yes. Okay, so I want you to think of two different two metaphors two different
    metaphors to address the issue.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you have this activity that say well so the example we just had, this is
    like sending a friend request on Facebook. Okay, so based on sending a friend
    request on Facebook, that comes up as one one interface and how the steps so the
    way the screen through our controls are organized with supports metaphor. Then
    I'm asking you for a second metaphor and I might be moving sending an RSVP and
  persid: ''
- desc: sending some sort of physical invitation
  persid: ''
- desc: so there's, that's a different process. So then the interface design, the
    paper and pencil sketch to the interface design is going to be different because
    what's involved in the other metaphor the sending physical invitations in the
    mail and
  persid: ''
- desc: so you have two different metaphors. And so you want to express them in the
    face and see how to interface design carries through with those metaphors that
    help?
  persid: ''
- desc: Can there be a lot of users? I think every or any application will realistically
    have enough activities to have a distinct activity, but I can select from my group.
    I think there's only two users we have. So we have different activities with the
    same user.
  persid: ''
- desc: Focus on one I suppose the wind ematic activity. Certainly there may be a
    little there might be a couple of steps involved in that. So I just want you to
    focus on one one area the interface so you're not doing read theater face but
    vertical slice Oh,
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe I misunderstood. I thought that each group member had to do a different
    activity for different users. So we're all doing the same.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: just because the first group assignment had us laying out
  persid: ''
- desc: I know what the first group assignment sorry. So I'm asking you to come together
    as a group and say so think about what each did individually together and say
    let's focus on this activity with this user.
  persid: ''
- desc: So fluorophores are gonna focus on only one activity and are like, for separately
    for
  persid: ''
- desc: That's correct. Order
  persid: ''
- desc: to building the interface, should we stay away from functional or functional
    requirements to the website? Or are like part of our solution and that sort of
    functional thing? Or is it just we're focusing on improving with the functionality
    bits?
  persid: ''
- desc: So I would say the idea is to think about what the user wants to accomplish.
    So if the user wants to invite friends are set to set up dates in the calendar
    or register for a course or whatever the case is, think about what they'd like
    to do and then so what supports that. So the interface so if we take up a metaphor
    and maybe in that metaphor to realize that metaphor then we get
  persid: ''
- desc: I realized what it's missing. I don't have a microphone. I mean, people cannot
    hear me at all in the back.
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, you're not in the back. They can't hear you. They can't answer your
    questions. That's true.
  persid: ''
- desc: Some people commented at the mic doesn't work anyway. I think I think it does
    pretty well. Testing testing. Now that front row can hear me so it's not a question
    of I guess we want to take follower the metaphor leads you sort of get involved
    in a post structuring things a different way now application that's fine.
  persid: ''
- desc: So for like, for example, on a desktop, or Windows, let's say on a file and
    dragging, sort of metaphor, but if it but it's a new functionality, so if the
    interface doesn't happen, we can suggest because I help
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, I would say, I mean, you just you don't have to write code to support
    it. So just say your and you can drag so we can set things up. So it looks like
    you can drag and drop things on the interface that likely that's what these are
    going to do with it. So at this stage, that would be fine. To do. Does that make
    sense? Everyone?
  persid: ''
- desc: Hello So this part doesn't require any years of HTML, CSS, right?
  persid: ''
- desc: That's correct. So the idea of designing the interface is well, we don't want
    to keep our options open for a while anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: generate some ideas and get some feedback from people. So that's why it's
    useful to have to show people and say, you know, ask them what what do they want
    to say? Is this something that could help you accomplish your tasks? No, that's
    not at all what? I don't understand this. Because they don't like Facebook. I
    don't like Facebook after every time I try and post something there. The interface
    has changed since the last time I've done it. And it gets more difficult so so
    I wanted to post something. And then in a public spot where I could share the
    link to it. Well, Facebook could do it. So let me do the whole document of all.
    So a few other places I tried. It said Oh 2000 characters, that's the maximum.
    So that was it was longer than 2000 characters you might want to sound so Facebook
    living put them all in but then I couldn't generate a URL to share with anybody.
  persid: ''
- desc: or so. That's not true. I could find out a way to get the Facebook interface
    to show up the content but then it was a URL that was like this long and replace
    posting and I couldn't add HTML to hide the link. So leaving leaving this mesh
    text on the page is not a good solution. So anyway, I digress a little bit. So
    these are the things that people might you ask people. So this is what you get
    if you ask people what they want or what you might hear what they don't like,
    and be able to tease out some things they want from their stories about what they
    don't like buggy interface. At present.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway so Posties I think I did yeah. So, and these two two metaphors that
    I'd like you to start exploring with
  persid: ''
- desc: in the interface that they should be different. Maybe not like environments
    like inviting somebody by calling them on the phone, or it's like inviting them
    by sending them an invitation in the mail. That might be a little bit too close.
    So like he
  persid: ''
- desc: points for caveman themed analogies.
  persid: ''
- desc: I wouldn't say bonus points. You get, I would say you get rewarded for applicable
    metaphors that maybe aren't obvious so I just encourage you to think about it
    to brainstorm some ideas or different ways to present the interface. So brainstorm
    two different metaphors that lead to different fidelity prototypes. So the idea
    of doing this starting out with paper and pencil pro thanks. Guess if you can't
    draw straight lines any other way. You might use a sketch program but the more
    you do things in a formal more formalized way, or more presentable way the more
    attachment you have. The comment is going to make about designing. You want to
    spend an appropriate amount of time and beginning to generate ideas and to be
    okay with it. We okay with pursuing wacky ideas a little bit. They seem to have
    some payoff. So the idea is that once you if you do this phase with low fidelity
    prototypes and you do sketches and conversations about those sketches, then you
    have a very much better idea about how to proceed. And then as you proceed further
    along in terms of describing interface components and making them more making
    higher fidelity prototypes and maybe writing some code along the way, the class
    to make changes. As you get further down that path is going to increase substantially.
    So the time to generate ideas is the beginning. When you're just dealing with
    erasing pencil marks on a page and trying again. Does that make sense? Okay. So
    we want to illustrate just like to say. She might have different paid if it's
    a website, you might have different pages on the website to show them the first
    page and say you log in
  persid: ''
- desc: or imagine you're here and then you give them the same one. This isn't this
    assignment. It's next assignment. We'll do some testing.
  persid: ''
- desc: You won't have to configure the activity in terms of some details like you're
    going to register for classes in winter, or sell your car or something. So a particular
    car imagine you have this car I have a car so you make it specific but then you
    go through the steps and so it's not just one screen you're doing but so that
    depending on where they press where they say they would press, press that button
    goes to another screen to show their sketch. Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: So, they may not be just a single a single drive you have to represent each
    interface there might be a series that is illustrates the flow. of the interaction.
    So like a storyboard and that's not a bad way to think about it. But as you're
    letting the user build their own adventure, it's not like you're mapping everything
    out. So here's a choice. At the screen, here's a choice and they can do this or
    that they choose this one, then we'll follow this path and story
  persid: ''
- desc: together then we'll do that I'd say if you're designing if you're thinking
    about to operate in a certain way, then you can cut off some of those branches.
  persid: ''
- desc: Say oh, this could be a given a secure I mean you don't I'm saying so I said
    vertical slice.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it means following it from first screen to the goal completion. So it makes
    sense okay. Sounds let's go back to our discussion. of the Gulf of execution and
    evaluation.
  persid: ''
- desc: So are designing an interface What are how can we think about design? How
    can you label this diagram with a focus on design?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, the two words that start with I interaction Have you remember to try
    and find fifth slot in the index textbook. It's you I won't forget what your question
    Did anyone luckily index actually.
  persid: ''
- desc: I spent all my working class
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so we have one textbook. So until we were looking through the index
    so let me know if you find Fitts Law by the end of class. require a password Okay,
    I'll fix that. That's not what I did a spelling error like I said, What? No
  persid: ''
- desc: TTS Yeah. Okay, I'm less concerned about where it is in the textbook.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So do you see the index in your in your PDF version? So how do you it's
    not it isn't the index subtitle Yeah. So the index is that yeah, so that's a way
    it's it's not not not. Not organized. I think it should be organized. Because
    it's not under f. It's under some have a sub turret. Cultural affiliation. Yeah.
    So if you're looking for fifth slot, the index is not going to help you. Unless
    you'd like to read the index of attack. of the textbook from front to back.
  persid: ''
- desc: Next 16
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so how I'll let you maybe make notes about your discoveries in in the
    wiki page
  persid: ''
- desc: just calculating sets
  persid: ''
- desc: well, you can so I guess what I'm interested in discussing is is it is the
    index tool to help you find that term. And maybe, where would you put it? How
    would you class how would you write the index? So that you could find Fitts Law
    more easily? My two factor authentication request was not Oh, I didn't even put
    this on. So has the option to send me a push. The first time around it didn't.
    I didn't answer it quickly enough. So I asked them to push me again. Okay, so
    that should be set now. All right so just have to go to if you just go there and
    pick the highest available standards.
  persid: ''
- desc: You don't even have to know that explains a lot
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so whereas fits a lot in in our diagram which have presented
  persid: ''
- desc: so information design was about so, we'll talk about this more mundane but
    it's like crystal so for organizing things so we can use things like proximity
    this also relates a little bit Phitsanulok in the sense that they want to put
    controls the better doors in a window so we're not going to hit slide says. Before
    we started here interacting over here, and then we wanted to do we have the button
    to click on the target to click over here.
  persid: ''
- desc: Not so good. But then if we're interacting over here again. Then maybe our
    target is here and it's bigger. And it's part of the
  persid: ''
- desc: similar things that we'd like to do, which we'd like to refer, when you're
    interacting are grouped together and target and we need to hit based on their
    interaction here is close by. So there's also an element of proximity there.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. See, we're almost out of time here. Any questions or concerns?
  persid: ''
- desc: One of the things is like the time to move the planet to target
  persid: ''
- desc: was looking to be impacted by this.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I guess that's an additional concern, but this one just talking about
    the placement of it starting point to retarget. So the time it takes to do now
    depends on the distance and the size of the target. So if its target is close,
    and it's large, we'll be able to get that more quickly than if it's far away and
    small
  persid: ''
- desc: and under other combinations there. That make sense. Okay, so continue with
    this on Friday. On Friday, when we have a good weekend. Thank you. Yes, we do.
    So thanks you I didn't remember
  persid: ''
- desc: that earlier today.
  persid: ''
- desc: source where the game coming talking about dream mapping anyway, thanks for
    the reminder Have a great weekend. See you Monday.
  persid: ''
- desc: I've been doing a Girls CODE thing for the Science Center. We just started
    a new session on Monday. And it's for girls 11 through 16. But I used for your
    binary number guessing game thing I noticed that the one that I used was actually
    published by you, which was quite fun. Oh, good. But they all looked at, oh, they
    thought that was magic. And then I taught them about binary numbers.
  persid: ''
- desc: Great. It's a good one. So there we had to do the exam for freshmen Robert
    de fer for high school computer science teachers.
  persid: ''
