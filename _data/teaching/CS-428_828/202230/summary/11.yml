- desc: monitor the internals of the monitor working
  persid: ''
- desc: normally at the bottom of the monitor for cable management, usually the neck
    of a monitor actually has some kind of clip on that you can feed cables through
    to keep all your cables also keep the cords out of the way out of sight out of
    mind
  persid: ''
- desc: so just a big compromise here saying this is maybe a good compromise some
    users or not so, so if somebody encountered a new scale and it was not technically
    technically savvy, what would you how would you imagine someone dealing with that
    call? Maybe services from what I've seen call their technical?
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can think about whether that this is the best compromise or not. See
    if I can login quickly how's your weekend? Everyone Have a good weekend? Who makes
    those pains. So who makes those
  persid: ''
- desc: Canadian Tire brands so like that weird thing? Like that little Franken character
    on them? Like, if they were sitting out, um, that was the food option I would
    eat them but I don't think I purchased
  persid: ''
- desc: that they just made
  persid: ''
- desc: me. So I was hoping to have a video that Hamza and Marcille took on Friday
    didn't seem didn't catch it. So I hope it's gonna get sorted out after class.
  persid: ''
- desc: So anyway, here's the password. For today. Here's the QR code right. So anyway,
    here's a couple pictures of the door so the question is where are the buttons
    to operate the door? Let's see. So one thing I noticed the question is so is this
    really an automatic door so judging from the video I took Yes, because it pushes
    back against me want to try and open filtering the handle. So it does that automatically.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe not, it's not in the sense that we'd expect that nobody has to walk
    up and and the door open for us does not have a sensor in it on the ceiling to
    detect when there's movement in front of it. And open the door.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the other thing is, so if it's not automatic, we have to operate with by
    pressing a button wherever the buttons located, it just so happens the button
    on the far side of the door towards the hallway is in this facility here. walked
    by the sticker can't see it
  persid: ''
- desc: this case it's also blocked by the sticker but it's further down the far side
    of this wall between the artwork and the fire extinguisher or defibrillator I'm
    not sure which one of those things it is
  persid: ''
- desc: but there's around it's not that steep. The button is here so the question
    is if somebody is in a wheelchair, navigating by themselves is it is a time to
    the door is open appropriate for them for the person to come. up the ramp and
    through the door.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I included a search for accessibility standards. I didn't go through them
    rely on documents
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see if we can find some see if we can find some answers. Okay, so this
    one is most promising accessibility model standard for the built environment accessibility
    our doors operator our door operators. So I didn't expect to I didn't expect a
    statement that said button must be X number of meters and most x meters from the
    door
  persid: ''
- desc: a navy so I invite you to look through some resources and see if we can find
    some standards
  persid: ''
- desc: we can use to assess whether the door is accessible or not. I wouldn't say
    it's too accessible. But anyway maybe it's maybe it's a problem if the door stays
    open too long.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so there's a little bit of discussion. Here I'll draw the other button.
    There was some discussion about forming groups last day for the project and I
    just wanted to indicate that working in groups is is a good thing and helps build
    character gets you to experience different perspectives even if your group is
    so you choosing your own groups and you're not necessarily choosing your groups
    to maximize diversity. But working in a group, you can see that there are different
    different approaches different opinions, different perspectives that are valuable.
    And similarly if we're in a group, and we notice, so we might see the areas that
    are covered by the group members and the ones that are maybe are still
  persid: ''
- desc: no one covers no one maybe it's there are some areas where people don't cover
  persid: ''
- desc: cover them out of out of interest, but necessity, say.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the idea is that groups give you a perspective on working groups experiences,
    good experience for things you take on after this. That's why we do groups. And
    in the book, it talks about sort of the different multidisciplinary teams that
    are put together to do interface design. So we're talking about interfaces like
    this door, Soldier technical people involved in setting the timers to create the
    buttons to create the buttons and the timers and the motors and so on the technical
    things. But then there are also people who are maybe psychologists people working
    in the areas of accessibility who can empathize and maybe are members of communities
    who have more greater need for accessibility in the buildings space. So we get
    a range of opinion and perspectives. And so it's not just that we're trying to
    imagine what it'd be like if we had to use a wheelchair to navigate campus. You
    can engage people in radically different experiences.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? That's my microphone working today. Back row. Right
    Okay, thanks. So let's go back to that diagram. Start drawing just right
  persid: ''
- desc: good luck.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so here we have the user is a person, obviously a person Sorry, I'll
    make any console my drawing abilities. So, I have the person and the computer.
    So what we started talking about the Gulf of execution and evaluation. So out
    of those Can we talk about recall from our period of discussion how to label the
    diagram in that way? Anyone? So, we had an arrow going this way, the arrow going
    this way. How could we label was two arrows.
  persid: ''
- desc: So another possible label is this as an interaction and what what could this
    be the court to go with the interaction
  persid: ''
- desc: starts with the ones I'm thinking of see what I drew the right number of blanks.
    So you can you feel when I guess the word you can or if you want a letter
  persid: ''
- desc: information?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. Now let's see for bonus points, and I drew the right number of blanks.
    Looking good, okay. Right. So, when the user interacts with the system, and the
    user inter interprets the information presented by the system so if this is if
    it's straightforward, so we know what to do continue immediately. You see the
    doors well think I'm drawing too close to the screen.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's say lol doors and then our idea of keeping right we have to push
    on that side. So we could say well, no, we just have to push on that panel to
    open the door
  persid: ''
- desc: so the golf This is the conceptual distance between the person and the artifact
    or the interface. So if it's if it's easy to understand, so we're walking or keeping
    right in the hallways as we want. We talked about that. Let's say we have on the
    right hand side or the right hand door, push, we push it and open the door without
    having to think about here's the door How do I open up than that? Golf is very
    small. If it's if it looks like the door does in the hallway, the education building
    then it takes a bit more effort and so the golf is wider. So if if the golf is
    wider so so there's a golf. You can see it's a twin golf so the execution and
    evaluation because there's a distance between the user going from what is taking
    their goal opening the door and deciding what actions to perform. So that's one
    golf and there's another golf of saying here's the system state. Here's the door.
    Here's the information the door presents me how do I understand that? side of
    the door so they're twin girls okay, so don't want to start on your side so what
    can we do to minimize the design, minimizing the design the sculpts of execution
    and evaluation of the options so the options
  persid: ''
- desc: don't know what's necessary.
  persid: ''
- desc: Provide clear concise information. Sorry. Okay, make that one word. Okay,
    so think about that. Any other thoughts about how we can minimize goals in terms
    of design? Testing can do testing amazing information saying well more about that.
    How would you analyze it?
  persid: ''
- desc: It might be just an extension of testing but getting the actual end user to
    try it out. Like you mentioned earlier having somebody in a wheelchair accessible
    a donor more concise way of phrasing. It analyze information from the tests so
    we can maybe do that as well. So we've mentioned information a few times about.
  persid: ''
- desc: Visual,
  persid: ''
- desc: you get a visual or subconscious indicators rather than
  persid: ''
- desc: documentation books.
  persid: ''
- desc: The simpler the information is presented on how to use it the better
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, okay. signifiers of different things that you can see and understand
    as ways to operate interface.
  persid: ''
- desc: Stick to people
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. Okay, so we had a little discussion on this the other day
  persid: ''
- desc: how do we how do we stick to what people know? Or how do people know what
  persid: ''
- desc: that was the word to start by last week. Random discussion or intuition Okay,
    so. So they know from previous experience so, we can say the concepts so, a famous
    metaphor before your time I think probably So, when the when Macintosh
  persid: ''
- desc: came out with a commercialization of the Xerox PARC desktop interface and
    then Windows also adopted the same approach with files. So, you can see on the
    desktop sort of tracking we talked about desktop computers that's a metaphor as
    well. Where that's the points in metaphor. We're gonna organize things like an
    office. So on the desktop, we see file folders. We can drag files and put them
    into folders. And then if we want to delete something we dragged to the trash.
    And that's not a perfect metaphor for the way things behave because some things
    you want to throw away you want to move on the Mac, I'm not sure I'll be able
    to Windows. drag this to the trash and when you delete this when they erase the
    contents of the desk but it wouldn't remove this from your desktop learns you
    couldn't access
  persid: ''
- desc: the files on the disk anymore. So the goal is to stay indicate. idea of what's
    possible. Without emphasizing too many details so to the desktop metaphor for
    computer interface works. So we can sort of take the concept of putting things
    in folders being directories
  persid: ''
- desc: and organizing files that way but it's not a perfect because he doesn't predict
    everything that's going to happen. Surface besides tweeting if you make it too
    general data say to see if we make it to specific.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's say we have to imagine that everyone has some useless coins
  persid: ''
- desc: and paper plastic wheels. So if the interface I should show you something
    like this $1 sign
  persid: ''
- desc: what does that indicate to you for say methods of payments in a parking machine
    if the input slot we put money in is labeled labeled with $1 sign. What would
    that indicate to you?
  persid: ''
- desc: I think shape it's a small little like slip points along the horizontal line
  persid: ''
- desc: bills. And it's just a plastic pad with the NFC contact contactless payment
    or tap pay that just depends on
  persid: ''
- desc: the additional context along with it. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: so aside from the additional
  persid: ''
- desc: context
  persid: ''
- desc: I won't draw this let's say I was drawing entries or shooting photographs
  persid: ''
- desc: ever had these coins illustrated would you say that it's possible to put in
    dimes and nickels What if I just drew this Okay, so is that concept clear enough?
    I apologize.
  persid: ''
- desc: You look at it, exactly what coin accepts with a diagram of the coin.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, the idea is when we're working with metaphors so we can we'll talk about
    this more next day to think about metaphors. You are operating an interface to
    go from there on Wednesday. Thank you very much for today. Have a good day. You
    ever question. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, the idea is when we're working with metaphors so we can we'll talk about
