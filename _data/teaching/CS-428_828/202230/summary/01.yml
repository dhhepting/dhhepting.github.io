- desc: 'Okay. So starting a bit

    late for our first meeting, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m just making a transcript for

    myself that I can share online'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So here's our
  persid: ''
- desc: 'page for the meeting today. It''s

    the first of 36 meetings. So in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a normal semester we''d have 39

    meetings because of the Truth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and Reconciliation Day and Labor

    Day and semester break and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different things that come up.

    We''ve got 36 meetings, so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should be okay. So I talked

    about attendance already. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this should go to the your

    courses page. Let''s see. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that that it did do that. Yay.

    And then the class calendar for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today so you''ve started the fall

    class fall term classes. It''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interesting that classes start

    at midnight, but the term only'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'starts at 7am. Excuse me. So

    here''s, here''s a link to the'
  persid: ''
- desc: attendance event for today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Excuse me.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That exercise that brisk ride

    here in the morning'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'takes it''s a little bit harder

    to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well, it''s not hard but I got a

    tickle in my throat. I don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: think I'm
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sick for you at all. So speaking

    about being sick, I brought'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'masks in case anyone. I''ll try

    and remember to bring masks in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'case someone is uncomfortable

    with not having a mask or you''d'
  persid: ''
- desc: like me to wear a mask.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I have these
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the ones I brought today.

    But I also have ones that have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little window so you can see my

    mouth I don''t. I didn''t. I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'didn''t do a study. I''m not aware

    of study to see whether the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'little window is more conducive

    to learning or not. But I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bring them along one day too. So

    I have this set D of respond to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting one and that opens right

    after class and it closes at one'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'minute to midnight. So it''s one

    minute to midnight so that it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'always appears as today. So

    that''s that''s the latest I can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make it appear. Have a show up

    as today''s date. So the idea is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you can take a minute, five

    minutes to reflect on what we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'did today. And I''ll show you

    that in a second here. So, what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''d like you to do in response

    to the meeting, think about,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pick one of these three things.

    What''s the most important thing'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that you discussed? That you

    discussed or that you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'encountered during the meeting?

    What was the most difficult'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing for you to understand if

    there''s a question you have, and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the thing about what you''d like

    to know more about, about what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''d like to know more so pick

    one of those and write a few'
  persid: ''
- desc: lines so
  persid: ''
- desc: '512 characters is the most and

    so if you if you submit'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something before midnight, so

    we''ll lot two marks for each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'response. So this is another

    participation thing. So if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'write something, but it''s and

    it''s related to fits with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what we talked about, and follow

    the instructions and you get a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'two for that. If you write what

    something but it''s not clearly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'related to that doesn''t clearly

    follow the instructions are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'related to the meeting and give

    one for that and if you don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'write anything, you get zero

    marks'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this one is set up the other

    ones aren''t. Don''t have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'correct dates. yet. I''ll fix

    that before next meetings No'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'wonder here I can do like a TED

    Talk that doesn''t look strange'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at all. Anyway, I''ll get some

    advice from audio visual about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how to arrange the microphone

    okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So upcoming events should also

    give you a list of things from'
  persid: ''
- desc: the calendar
  persid: ''
- desc: so this
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so part of what we''re gonna do

    this semester is talk about the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'design of user interfaces.

    That''s it Good thing I''m not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'concerned about how I look for

    the sounds better, I think of'
  persid: ''
- desc: shooting with my wife and kids
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what I was gonna say is we''re

    talking about human computer'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'communications in this class and

    design of interfaces. And so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a textbook that talks about

    interaction design. And part of'
  persid: ''
- desc: that is being observant
  persid: ''
- desc: of what people do
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and how things can be done

    better. That''s why I think is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interesting is always to think

    about ways not just to make it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something possible but make it

    satisfying for people to use. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if people have to figure out so

    I know there''s a way to do this.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And they spend five or 10

    minutes just deciphering how to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how to achieve their goal.

    That''s not necessarily very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'satisfying. And so, what I''d

    like you to think about is this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'semester, looking around and

    seeing being observant of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interfaces around you and seeing

    if they''re good interfaces if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they can be improved and and

    what what would make them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'better. So I took a class as an

    undergraduate student, it was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called math 231. And this isn''t

    it think it was a special'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'offering. But anyway, basically,

    we studied wallpaper patterns.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Do you know there are 17 ways to

    have a wallpaper pattern repeat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on people knew that anyone? So

    what I found is that over the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'semester, I spent a lot of time

    looking at wallpaper outside of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class and thinking, Oh, that''s a

    glide reflection or that''s some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other kind of I know they''re

    setting teams when I''m hard'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pressed. Glider flexion is my

    favorite something I shouldn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have anyway. But just the idea

    that I want you to come approach'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is looking at interfaces

    more critically.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t have the link here. But

    there was a commencement speech'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'by I say David Wallace, but

    actually let me go to the web'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'page and I''ll find the quote so

    I can read it. in dramatic'
  persid: ''
- desc: fashion.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'David Foster Wallace said

    there''s ever commencement speech'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in 2005. He said, there are

    these two young fish swimming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'along and they happen to meet an

    older fish swimming the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'way. And the only fish nods at

    them and says Morning boys.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How''s the water? The two young

    fish Sivan for a bit and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'eventually one of them looks

    over at the other and goes What'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the hell is water so pardon my

    my racy language here'
  persid: ''
- desc: it's so the idea is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to think about what''s going on.

    And being being aware of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'surroundings and not being aware

    of what the assumptions are that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re making, so that we can

    question them and come up with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something better if if need be.

    So the other code that I''ve'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mentioned here, I''ll put the

    link to this page. So this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from JCR Licklider, who was the

    head of DARPA in the night in'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1960s. This is from 1960. So in

    short, it seems worthwhile to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'avoid argument with other

    enthusiasts for artificial'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intelligence by conceding

    dominance in the distant future'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of celebration to machines.

    Alone. There will nevertheless'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be a fairly long interim during

    which the main intellectual'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'advances will be made by humans

    and computers working together'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and intimate Association, a

    multidisciplinary study group'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'examining future research and

    development problems of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'United States Air Force

    estimated that would be 1980s.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Before developments, artificial

    intelligence make it possible'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for machines a lot to do much

    thinking and problem solving of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'military significance that would

    leave say five years to develop'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'human computer symbiosis in 15

    years to use it. The 15 may be'
  persid: ''
- desc: '10 or 500. But those years

    should be intellectually the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'most creative and exciting in

    the history of humankind. So if,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if military significance if

    computers could solve problems'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of military significance in the

    1980s, then Skynet would be'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'running things by now. Now many

    people got the Terminator'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reference only say that that''s

    way before my time but it''s not'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'really because they keep making

    Terminator movies every few'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'years to get some more bucks out

    of the franchise. Anyway, for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those who aren''t familiar with

    Terminator, you can look up you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can do some searching on the

    internet. To find out more'
  persid: ''
- desc: details. About that reference
  persid: ''
- desc: so here's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s my semester schedule. I

    have to do a little bit of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'tweaking still, but today''s the

    first day of the term and it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'goes until the classes go to the

    center sixth. And last day, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: terms the 22nd.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There was a page and so these

    are my office hours for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'semester. So an hour and a half.

    Immediately after meetings'
  persid: ''
- desc: Mondays and Wednesdays
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then Tuesdays and Thursdays

    one to two ferry. So you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'actually come and see me in

    college west through your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'waypoint, you too. They used to

    be in the alphabetical section.'
  persid: ''
- desc: That's gotten messed up now.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'They''re all all the H''s were in

    a row But time flies I mean that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was at one point in time, but

    it''s, it''s near the tee. So if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you come around I''ll see if I

    get some WD 40 for this tool as'
  persid: ''
- desc: well.
  persid: ''
- desc: So CS and math
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is North. Here''s the men''s

    washroom you go around that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approximately where I am so when

    when you have to get into this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hallway, then when you turning

    in the hallway, three branches'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the left then you turn right

    in you should very firmly door'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when''s the last time you were on

    campus for four months'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so this should so this should be

    getting getting back to my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'website for the course DHH link

    and your courses should bring'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you to the your courses page.

    And this one will connect you to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the zoom that I have set up for

    the office time so you can come'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and see me in person or you can

    join join the Zoom call for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'office hours okay? And then if

    you''re not able to if you need'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to get a hold of me but not

    You''re not available during the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'times I''ve set aside for Office.

    Send me a note this will create'
  persid: ''
- desc: a note let's see it should work
  persid: ''
- desc: we'll say it works
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay so last year. We talked

    talked to I talked to students'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about creating something that''s

    maybe a little more accessible'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in terms of linking things so

    I''ve I present the following for'
  persid: ''
- desc: your consideration
  persid: ''
- desc: so this is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today is going to tell you

    what''s going on today in terms'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of semester. The fall semester

    for 2022. So this is a link'
  persid: ''
- desc: these are the same links so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is one aspect of things

    where you can give me some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comments and kick the tires so

    to speak, and see if this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'helpful and what could make it

    more helpful'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I have divided it up into half

    hour slots so the first one goes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'from midnight to 830 which

    doesn''t have anything scheduled'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in it and then it goes from

    838 30 to 530 and a half hour'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'increments and then from 530 to

    2359. So I did that so that I so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we''re not in a time for

    something going on it''ll show'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you the time which segment of

    the schedule will be that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'doesn''t make sense. Let me try

    that again. So whatever time it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is, you''ll see if the JavaScript

    is working okay. You''ll see a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'highlighted with the half hour

    or the if it''s a stone before'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the start of the day or after

    the end of the day. Then it''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just be a larger block but

    during during the day at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'university that will be half

    hour increments. So you can see'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whether that''s useful or not or

    we can have a discussion about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what would make it more useful

    and so forth.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instead of going to navigate to

    this page, which is longer you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can go to this page and should

    be a jumping off point for what'
  persid: ''
- desc: you need to see for the day.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s similar right. I was

    going to also in the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participation I wasn''t sure

    where to put this so I''ve been a'
  persid: ''
- desc: class wiki so I originally
  persid: ''
- desc: 'call it your responses wiki and

    then of course your courses'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Moodle win. Let me change that.

    So it has this page has two'
  persid: ''
- desc: titles.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Anyway, I''ve made a list of

    meetings I don''t know why. I got'
  persid: ''
- desc: double headings there but
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I would say and here''s an

    opportunity to make some notes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about what happened in the

    meeting today. So I didn''t set'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up breakout groups. Yeah, but

    what I''m due for Friday is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'breaking into groups and then

    all assign a group per meeting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to be in charge of writing a

    summary of what we just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'discussed. And then, when

    there''s breakout group'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'questions, we can record

    responses. Groups can record'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their responses on the wiki as

    well.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So to not give you too many

    places to manage, but we''ll just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll just try and keep the wiki

    as a place to record discussions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and things that happen. So we''ll

    put one group in charge of each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting and then we assume that

    different groups can also add'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'their own material from their

    discussions that seem okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''ll we''ll start that on Friday

    as well. Oh, the other question.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Was about
  persid: ''
- desc: how do you feel about midterms?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Even better than final exams. So

    when we''re doing things online,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I hadn''t had a midterm for the

    past couple of years. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'now we have the opportunity to

    and I guess who knows what will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'happen within the next by the

    end of the semester if things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'will still be as they are here

    today or not? But I I''m thinking'
  persid: ''
- desc: that maybe a midterm is good
  persid: ''
- desc: so here's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how it relates to class content.

    So we''ll talk about evaluation'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of user interfaces and so we can

    talk also about evaluation of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other things so we can do a

    formative evaluation as a way to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give you some feedback to see if

    you''re on the right path. If'
  persid: ''
- desc: you're
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if you''re that is a way to check

    if you''re comfortable with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'material and so far, and if

    there''s some issues it was the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'midterm. The formative

    evaluation will be so much'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weighed on your mark, but an

    opportunity to say here are some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'things they need to work on. So

    I''ll work on them and then the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'formative summative evaluations

    at the final.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''d say that the midterm end

    assignments and so forth are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'parts of the farm evaluation of

    your work. And then the final'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'exam is a summative evaluation.

    So the final exam won''t be it''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be worth about 20% of your final

    grade or you''ll still need to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pass it and that''s not good to

    scare you. It''s not for me to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a way to fail people

    because I don''t want to having'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to pass everybody and have

    everyone. Happy that everybody'
  persid: ''
- desc: does well. But it's about
  persid: ''
- desc: it, their
  persid: ''
- desc: 'final exam is a way for you to

    demonstrate your own'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'understanding of the material.

    So whereas we''ll be doing things'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in groups and and then

    discussions with colleagues or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'peers in the class here. So the

    final exam is just the sudden'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'evaluation of your work or your

    learning over the semester. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look forward to engaging you in

    designing and how to format the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'midterm and final exams, so that

    they''re fair evaluations of what'
  persid: ''
- desc: we've done in class.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I''m inclined to have for now

    we''ll say that we''ll have we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: be in class
  persid: ''
- desc: sometime in October. Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, I would say not. But it we

    might ask you to do something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not so much. Write an essay. But

    other than that, a mix of short'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'answer questions and something

    some kind of application sort of'
  persid: ''
- desc: question.
  persid: ''
- desc: We'll figure it out.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'We''ll make sure together we

    reach some consensus of roles'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so on will be on the exam

    Farben before the exam takes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'place. Does this makes sense?

    formative and summative'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'evaluation. So in terms of

    interface, you might say I like'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do this. You have an idea for

    an interface and you say, here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are some ideas that we might

    employ to realize the interface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then you can do some

    formative evaluations with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'people who might be using the

    interface to see if you''re on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the right track. And this

    different evaluations help you'
