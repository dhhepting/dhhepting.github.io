  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''re gonna see whether this

    extensive we tested the server'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'testing test how''s that so made

    a difference a little bit I can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'even hear okay. Is not working

    no input okay so this is based'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on our discussion last sales you

    have something to share so,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'based on our discussion last day

    with adding a midterm exam'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I had So, as the midterm and

    of course 8% as I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do so that means we have six So,

    let''s create first of all is'
  persid: ''
- desc: '9100. And then there''s also a

    bonus of 2% for research credit.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Has anyone heard about the

    participant pool idea before?'
  persid: ''
- desc: They've been psychology and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer science so the idea is

    if there''s an opportunity for my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'district that down the track

    it''s all on your courses where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s more legible so responses

    to meetings 6% in dimensional'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'assignments 20% project has been

    40% exams 28% So they present'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the midterm 20% For the

    final participation 6% bonus. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s not certain whether there

    will be opportunities to earn a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bonus mark on the research

    credit during the semester.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'There is I''ll post them and let

    you know about posting post them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here at the bottom. So for every

    if he participated in a study,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''ll get one mark that you can

    apply to whichever class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accepts. So you can in one class

    you can get up to to these bonus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'marks. So there''s software user

    study going on for example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s credit so so 1% isn''t a

    lot, but it''s enough to say'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thank you. So it''s not enough to

    say I''m going to do that. versus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sort of an ethical aspect of

    collecting data that we''ll talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about later on in the semester

    as well. But it''s enough to say'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thank you. It''s a token of

    appreciation, but it''s not so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much to say for you to decide,

    well, I don''t really want to do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this, but I can''t afford to miss

    this opportunity for Mark. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said research credit was gonna

    give you an extra 50% of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'mark. You might not. You might

    not feel that way. So free and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'informed consent is an important

    part of what it has to do with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'collecting data. So we don''t

    want to collect good data. We'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to make sure that we''re not

    putting added pressure on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'person who is giving us the

    latest they might just tell us'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what we want. What they think

    they want, what they think we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'want to hear Okay, so that''s the

    reason behind the research'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'credit. So just seem okay. We

    didn''t have to stop official'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'syllabus you have seen Okay, I

    need this in the issues. Yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How many assignments? Okay, so

    there''s Do you like the pictures'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I sent or posted last time of me

    and my'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to do it my do it. Myself

    microphone. I think I put them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'online. So So for individual

    assignments there will be rest'
  persid: ''
- desc: '20%. To assignments and how''s my

    writing at the back of the room'
  persid: ''
- desc: could be bigger or
  persid: ''
- desc: 'helps you focus by concentrating

    on my I''ll try and make it'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bigger so one of these will be.

    So divide the project into four'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pieces so you''re welcome to

    especially for for 28 students'
  persid: ''
- desc: to make your own groups.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And I won''t say no if you want

    to work if you want to have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'group that''s mixing for 28 and a

    28 students'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so if you''re an 828 and you have

    some of your research, relates'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can relate or you can include

    user interface design and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'evaluation in your research. You

    might want to do that'
  persid: ''
- desc: individually
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Does that make sense? So you can

    talk to me about that if you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like? Okay, does that make

    sense? Does that answer your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'question? So, Monday we''ll have

    the details and assignments'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'posted for you okay. Okay, so

    let me do attendance. Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Always has been down onboarding.

    Usually these names on it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, okay. I remember getting

    some email about that. Right.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. I was fixing some things

    and i i fixed some things and I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'broke some other things. So I

    fixed the display here so that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meetings are Monday, Wednesday,

    Friday, so we didn''t have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting this last Monday. We

    don''t have the meeting coming'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Monday because that''s Labor Day.

    We don''t have a meeting on this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Friday because that''s Truth and

    Reconciliation day. And then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here''s Thanksgiving. The meeting

    is. Okay, so the thing I was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'going to print out were these 10

    cards, which I used to do when'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we had in person meetings before

    so I thought I would try them'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'again because we''re all here

    together. So I''m gonna get those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'working for a minute. It''s a way

    for you to write down your name'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and put it on the desk. So that

    I can know how to call you in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'class. So I can call in you.

    Sort of Alaskey if you write'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'down the name you''d like me to

    call you. It''s whatever that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'might be. And then I also

    suggested that we''re going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a lot rupestre classwork

    discussions'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I wonder whether we can maybe

    do crease in each row across Can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can we pick a table or?

    Anywhere else see how it works.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But if we have eight people in a

    group that''s maybe a bid size up'
  persid: ''
- desc: to eight people.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So don''t always have don''t have

    to end up with the same spot so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'everyone comes on here and all

    the people are in one side of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the room so you can mix it up. A

    little bit. See what works for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you. So it''ll ask you to maybe

    report to me in an email or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'something, people who are in

    your group and we''ll keep those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for just semester going forward.

    Okay, so that makes sense. So,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'in the same row that you''re in

    get together with the people in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your row for some discussion.

    Okay, and then somebody sent me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the names of people who are in

    the group in your row and I''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'set them up as groups going

    forward for it good class'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'activities. Okay, so please go

    ahead and do that thank you it a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'look right was able to do this

    there''s no way'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I can say just like going Did

    you want us to stay as a group'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'registrate the name to status.

    So, got a couple questions we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just want to basically send

    these to you. week it was very'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'hard on myself but you know I

    knew what it was like there''s no'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other reason. Interested in you

    can see this little boy or girl'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your client I can''t see it in

    the course of the show. order'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for him to truly start thing

    over again for'
  persid: ''
- desc: your seats only, so.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so as I watched all of you

    were discussing and that''s been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'very good. I realized that maybe

    it''s easier for getting together'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for discussions and groups can

    be groups of eight people. So I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know when I''m messed up, what

    people have already done for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lists that may be a feature you

    can adjust your seating and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'based on what what I get

    through, people see some people'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'give me some handwritten notes

    and some people send me emails.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ll set them up. I''ll make sure

    everybody''s in a group that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the same size and then

    even your hands to facilitate'
  persid: ''
- desc: that in the future, okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so I have two questions

    for you to discuss. So we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a discussion for five to 10

    minutes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so, two questions are what makes

    an interface good or bad? What'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do you see are those important

    characteristics? And then what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are some examples of good and

    bad interfaces? So this website'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is the best interface ever or

    this interface this website is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the worst interface ever. I

    don''t have to be your best or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'worst ever. Examples but if you

    have if you have some a he has'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'some things that are frustrating

    very satisfying to us. Let me'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know. discuss those things as

    well. Okay, so can we get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'together and have discussions

    so?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'To be here out. Your time to get

    up could just be Oh yes yes what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is your next session I already

    have that face to face oh yeah'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are many years later on as

    marketers used to be able to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'call it whatever it is say okay

    yeah, yeah, it seems like I can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make this demo I go over my four

    bills that''s what I expected'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s all jumping up at your

    house at this moment where are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you going? To take that there is

    no better way refer on strong.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'People I would like you, oh, I

    didn''t get backed up on privacy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because sometimes especially

    when I was in the G O th Oh'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'yeah. If I can add to that. What

    was the last few years so many'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of you we''re going to find out

    how to get them Oh, what do you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'guys think about need to charge

    me even my seminars pretty much.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, video. I would like you to

    see exactly where'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s one of them that goes

    back to direct versus being'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'positive in the same time, it

    was by us being'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there I don''t say I''m selling in

    fact. I guess I know that. No,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one that people say it''s not

    good. It''s either.'
  persid: ''

    information or direction but it'
  persid: ''
- desc: shows you where
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to go that that was that was

    that was like really good for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the class, everyone. I have your

    attention please. Let everyone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know. Microphones still working.

    But anyway, so before we ended'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'up class today, no five minutes

    left. So any thoughts about what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'makes an interface good or bad

    and what are some examples of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the design without first?

    Accessibility'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the liability really easy to

    use,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay. Response okay okay okay,

    other groups, other discussions'

  persid: ''
- desc: 'comment about Armageddon getting

    mistaken or you doing the wrong'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thing Okay any examples of good

    or bad interfaces? Yeah so we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have no matter what I was gonna

    do okay some other ones Yeah.'
  persid: ''

  persid: ''
- desc: 'I think I put it in there on

    LinkedIn. I put it under the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'participation. So this is

    different than the response we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do every meeting, right? Yeah.

    And then did we have to do that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the first meeting? as well?

    Because we all have to this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'strong. You can you can do it

    for every meeting. Okay. And if'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you do it for most of them and

    you fall in structure, they will'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get six marks towards your final

    or by I couldn''t do the first'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one I''ve just forgot. So it''s

    all right. So you can do it for'

    all good. Thanks.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'A grenade student. I''m not a big

    so student. So can I do my'
  persid: ''
- desc: project individually?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I would prefer not. Okay. So do

    you know people? Oh, yeah. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see how it goes. I would prefer

    to be free to be a group project'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if it''s not something you''re

    doing for research. Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'And is there any limit on the

    group number?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Ideally, for let''s say, if we

    have to make some adjustments on'
  persid: ''
- desc: that we can
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do we need to do coding in that

    basis. Like for the 800 levels?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m the same one like I''m not

    research student and the course'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for the 800 level. So just

    wanted to ask about the project.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the project is more about

    design. So you need to implement'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that, right? You don''t have it''s

    not about implementing, it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about creating a mock up. So

    it''s not strictly coding an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interface but it''s making it

    look like okay, you have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'functioning interface. So there

    are different tools and you can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'write make a web might do with

    using web stuff. We''ll talk'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about some more detail or the

    semester but it''s not strictly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reading, reading in your face

    from scratch, it''s just about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'making it look it''s creating the

    illusion of of the interface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that you''re presenting. Okay,

    thanks. Thank you.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So for the classes question I

    just posted here'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, sure. And also I have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a question about so the response

    to meetings. It''s like a general'
  persid: ''
- desc: market. It's not per
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one. Oh, he get marks. So I

    described. If you follow the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instructions so you''re reading

    about today''s meeting and you''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'following instructions like

    picking one of those three types'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and you submit it so you''ll get

    two marks if it''s if it''s all'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good. One mark, Have you

    submitted but it''s not clearly'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'following instructions. Like

    it''s not as he''s described what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we did in class instead of what

    your reaction to it is. Or you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know, saying what we learned

    what we discussed. So say well,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we covered this well, you know

    that that''s not what I''m asking'
  persid: ''

    reflect a little bit. So anyway,'

    but it doesn''t follow'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'instructions, you get one mark

    and if you don''t consume'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anything, you get zero marks. So

    over the semester, we''ll collect'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'those and then that''ll turn into

    here. So I will make it I won''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'require everyone to have 36 or

    35 of them to get a full mark'

- desc: 'but maybe 30 I guess now that

    I''ve said 30 I''m gonna have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'stick with that. So you have a

    little bit of wiggle room. Thank'
  persid: ''
- desc: you. Make sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So the one chord per day it''s

    set for 2021 that dates for I'
  persid: ''
- desc: thought I fixed. I did.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so maybe I checked it

    earlier. Yeah. You will like us.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'To read chapter 1234. Okay.

    Okay. Yeah, that''s a thank you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so much. You''re welcome. Hello.

    Actually, I have a question'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about the, what we can interface

    good or bad. She talks about,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for example, the design patterns

    or something like that, or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you''re just one abstract because

    I can''t say for example, how how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'much we should deep into to this

    comparative to this comparison.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'That''s my question. Because when

    we want to compare something'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good and that should be talking

    about the design patterns or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like something like I don''t want

    to say no to that. But I just,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''m just trying to engage some

    discussion. Okay. So so so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s no wrong answer. If you

    want to talk about patterns,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like the Swiss Army Knife

    pattern or whatever, whatever it'
  persid: ''
- desc: is.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Yeah, okay. So yeah, yeah.

    Because I want to know what your'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'expectation and how how should

    compare compare for example,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because you know, interface some

    teams subjective evaluation is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'subjective and I want to know

    that, okay, how how, how we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'should go for this. Yeah. So

    okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So I would say, it''s not always

    subjective. I mean, there there'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are some issues about preference

    involved, but I think there are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'also some very empirically

    verified choice choices that are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'good and that are bad. So it''s

    not it''s not all subjective.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. We can absolutely we can

    define some. We can define some,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe scores to make it

    quantify. But you know, the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'interface for example, when we

    look at at first shot, we say,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay, that''s so beautiful. When

    we have an expectation Yeah,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s good. Or that''s bad.

    Yeah, that''s I''m talking about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. That''s why I''m asking for

    how you should follow.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so your comments are

    things we''ll discuss or this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'semester, okay. So we''ll get

    into those things. Okay, so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re starting out we''ll keep

    those thoughts in mind, and'
