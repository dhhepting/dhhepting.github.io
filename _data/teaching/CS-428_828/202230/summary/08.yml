- desc: Today Okay, thanks. Anyone catch some watch the TV this morning no TV or for
    our online videos of the funeral this morning a year for the humans anyway forward
    to today's visit she was
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so happy Monday and we have a guest presenter this morning. Send us
    who's the board member from our perk okay so we welcome send us
  persid: ''
- desc: over here thank you everyone. Okay. All right. Hello everyone. My name is
    Cindy us and I'm from the Regina Public Interest Research Group here on campus
    also known as arburg, which is how I'll refer to it in the rest of my presentation.
    But I'm here today just to talk a little bit about what we do, how we interact
    with you guys on campus and why it's so important for get to know about this.
    So before we begin, I'd like to acknowledge that we are based on treaty for territory
    and the homeland of the maytee people. The Cree the Soto, Dakota, Lakota, Dakota
    and maytee. Peoples continue to be in kinship and practice reciprocity with a
    sled that has sustained them for countless generations. So it's very important
    for us at our product that we acknowledge that and that we try to be active in
    dismantling all the harm that has been done. Alright, so on to what our product
    does. Has anybody here heard of Hartford before? Just raise your hand? Oh, awesome.
    That's more than I expected. Okay. So we're a student run nonprofit here at the
    U bar, we operate as a resource center for students interested in social and environmental
    justice. So as computer science students, we don't typically get a lot of experience
    with that kind of stuff in our classes. And so this is a really good way to supplement
    that part of your university experience which might be missing and I'll talk about
    those resources as I could go on. So we focus on research, education and action.
    So research. There's an example that was done recently, so we helped someone do
    a study on our green patch garden. So we help somebody do a study on our green
    patch garden just to how to make it more sustainable. We do a lot of education.
    I don't know if any of you guys have heard of the disorientation week that happened
    this this past week can get a lot of guys have heard about it. And then action.
    So putting those initiatives and those things that we learned into action to make
    our campus more sustainable. So how do we operate? It's run by students. I'm a
    student myself. We have a board of directors that gets elected every two years
    or every one year depending on how many vacancies we have. And applications are
    available all year long. So if you're interested, go to Rp irg.org. And make sure
    you either sign up for our newsletter or you sign up to become a board member.
    And we're also funded by students. So every semester we collect a small fee from
    your tuition, and then we give back as much as we can in the form of funding in
    the form of events for our students. So definitely check us out because you guys
    are the ones that are funding us. These are some of our values. I won't read them
    all out but if any of these are interesting to you definitely check us out on
    our website. And then we have two major projects that we do every year so most
    of you guys have probably heard of the art period, green patch garden is just
    right outside classroom building in that little area over there. We also have
    an orchard over there and it's free for students to come and pick whenever they
    want. If you want to volunteer, this is also a really good place to get your volunteer
    hours into. And then we have a leadership camp called generating momentum every
    year. We didn't have it this year due to COVID. But it's usually around the end
    of August for anybody from the ages of 18 to 35. Interested in learning more about
    activism and gaining those necessary skills. So if you're interested in that,
    I think I put or this signup sheet will start up in the beginning of July next
    year. Probably. And if you sign up for our newsletter, we'll definitely be sending
    out reminders for that too. This is just a little bit more information about our
    garden. This is definitely one of our biggest projects that we put into place.
    And I think September 28 and 29th There's going to be a harvest celebration. So
    definitely come check us out there too. And then funding for students. This isn't
    the most important part to most students here. So if you're thinking of you know,
    putting any sort of project in place that aligns with our values, come and visit
    us online. We have many different funds available right here as you can see, and
    if you or even your like student group, if you guys are interested in putting
    a project in place and you don't have the funds. We're definitely one of the people
    that you can come check us out as a board member every month or every time we
    have one of these funding cycles. Sorry every time we have one of these funding
    cycles, we check out these applications and we make sure that we either you know
    fund as many of them as we can or we give advice to people on how they can make
    their applications more strong.
  persid: ''
- desc: And we have more resources too. So we have an alternative library. Our office
    is located if any of you guys know where the Women's Center is or the Student
    Union. It's in that same area you just have to go down a small hallway. We have
    a button maker some of you guys might have seen us on the Greens making buttons
    for people. If you or your student group are interested in renting that out. We
    can definitely help with that. We have a parents on campus. So if you are a parent,
    we have lots of support for that as well. And then we have training so if you're
    ever interested in going to a workshop or something and you can't afford the plane
    ticket or anything like that, we can help out with that as well. And then our
    final thing is just major events in fall. So from the 12th to 16th. This already
    happened this orientation week was put on by us and then on the 22nd at 1pm. If
    you guys are available, come down to rebel center multipurpose room, or will also
    be live streaming the AGM and the workers rights workshop. If you guys are available,
    please attend because unless you've opted out specifically, which is one of the
    options for you guys, you guys can definitely do that. But if you haven't opted
    out then you are a artpark member and you can vote at our annual general meeting
    and we need to have as many people attend as possible so we can so we can put
    those actions into place. That we need to get done. All right. Are there any questions?
    All right, I will just make a if it's okay with you. I'll make a small note about
    our website on the whiteboard so you guys can go check it out. We have a newsletter
    like I mentioned several times. That's where you will get all the information
    about what we're doing. And then these are also our Facebook handles and Instagram
    and Twitter. Awesome. Thank you so much.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's not just you Avara that has a look interesting research group. Talk about
    there's a larger
  persid: ''
- desc: Sure. So every university typically has a Public Interest Research Group.
    There was a I think it's called the L PERT. That's one of the ones that we collaborated
    with in the fall with the Lethbridge University of Lethbridge Public Interest
    Research Group. So we definitely collaborate with these groups all over the country.
    And they're a good way to just get involved in these social advocacy schemes or
    anything that you guys are interested in bettering about your university as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is maybe just started by Ralph Nader, or I get the information to
    awesome thank you so much for letting me speak turned on to a microphone so let's
    see what we get.
  persid: ''
- desc: So is it alright to fail it so we're gonna leave the PowerPoint on here? Yeah,
    so the PowerPoint is on the website under Files. So you can have a peek at it
    and get more if you want to get in
  persid: ''
- desc: some more details there as well. Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so today we're meeting aid of Six. Thanks so there's there's the QR code for
    today All right. I didn't know if people planned it this way, or whether I jinxed
    it by mentioning it before noon on Friday, when there was 41 votes, but after
    44 people voted that was equal split.
  persid: ''
- desc: And I I flipped I took a penny from my desk that's been there for a while
    and I flipped it and decided on Friday. October
  persid: ''
- desc: 21 I didn't put the microphone thanks Can everybody hear me now? Can you Oh
    Wait Can you hear me now? Can you hear me? Now?
  persid: ''
- desc: Testing testing let's try that the base station was turned off I think I think
    that's on now.
  persid: ''
- desc: Can you hear? me okay. Okay so you're enrolled in the experiment with your
    courses.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyone want to? So I'm not going to delete people again from this but if there
    are problems that we observed, I'll just I'll get them fixed. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let me switch to my role is look at this. Didn't change my role was going
    on there so magically so it says you have no roles but you really do have a beta
    teacher for learning role.
  persid: ''
- desc: And I know people who are locked in before say like Laura, for example. Says
    you can have never been logged in. That's because I deleted Hugo on Friday. And
    then you've been restored since then. So
  persid: ''
- desc: so if you if you observe any other issues with this role, let me know. The
    assignment is to claim a topic that's even creepier floor cuter I suppose. However
    you feel about it so Laura cleaned the first one. There's a few others Okay, so
    let me so we had this empathise of teachers due on September 26, which is a week
    from today. So how about we make made it a week later? I shouldn't really sorted
    by date. So make it a week later. October 3. So let's see him okay. All right
    any thoughts about what we've done? As
  persid: ''
- desc: I wouldn't like a marble. You want one? It's all fine. To have to hold your
    dog and guests get to hear your messages
  persid: ''
- desc: and I guess some people will leave messages to your dog you can maybe have
    a scented waterboy everyone, first a cartoon or something really professional
    checking his phone. The owner checking his phone for messages and the dog sniffing
    the fire hydrant. For his message.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have one vote for no. Anyone. Would you like? Would you consider having
    a marble latching machine in your home?
  persid: ''
- desc: Not at all. So there's two aspects we like to think about is usability issues
    more practical issues about what to do with the marbles and how to organize them
    and keep them color coded, sorted and if you run out of marbles and different
    things like that,
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah. Functional issue as well that occurred to me is that how do you stop
    a message if you don't want to keep playing it? There's no buttons or interface
    at all. You just have marbles that you push around the machine on my phone even
    though there's 30 different venues I have to go through if a telemarketer leaves
    me a message all I got to do is press the seventh one and it's
  persid: ''
- desc: I guess you could just take the marble
  persid: ''
- desc: My first guest would be take it out and then but then you put it back into
    the inbox or do you have a special erase block, have some other functionality
    read bits off the message to not take messages from that number again.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's also something called user experience which is important. So good
    thanks the barbel answer she might be fun to
  persid: ''
- desc: work to Avature home. So is that an important part? Okay, so right now the
    fun aspects don't overwhelm a way the usability aspects and issues of keeping
    track of marbles.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we usability issues we can address in a more practical way we have some
    we have some heuristics and but we also have theory that can guide us in terms
    of creating usable interfaces in terms of color contrasts and speaking of color
    contrasts, I have to deal with this bar at the top fails and the color. I do pretty
    well other places but that's one spot where I need to improve it. So we can deal
    with usability issues in a more direct way. Use user experience issues we can
    say. We can say that the interface is going to be fun to use or enjoyable experience
    but we can't make people say here's here's the marble answer sheet. You're going
    to have fun with that. You're going to enjoy it and you're going to be happy all
    the time and you're using it. I mean that could be our goal but that doesn't mean
    it's going to happen. So so we can encourage. So we can we as designers can encourage
    an experience what we can force people to have a certain experience with the interface.
    Does that seem okay? And I was volume with my microphone. Good. Okay. Throw that
    out so, what is empathy and is it important for user interface designers have
    empathy for users so, what are some other other options instead of empathy? Oh
    we can also go out and say well telepathy but
  persid: ''
- desc: that's that's not a very good I think it's good to get a laugh in class and
    then let's move on. Anyway so empathy is. CMRA Camille, we can everyone apathy
    Do you agree with that error Stan
  persid: ''
- desc: and sympathy understanding someone else's perspective is really too busy too
    expensive before getting to someone else feeling
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm not sure that it's so much understanding.
  persid: ''
- desc: My understanding of the difference between empathy and sympathy is good or
    not. You've experienced the same thing before.
  persid: ''
- desc: So let me write out some put something down and see how this works. Maybe
    sadness.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe sympathy is like college, someone's perspective and the other one is
    empathy is I looked at
  persid: ''
- desc: it Okay, well so if we approach design problems with empathy we get to the
    goal is to put ourselves in the others position and understand their perspective.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now, what else we designed with apathy will say that's good good. Design with
    accuracy. Don't generally Yeah. So we're just gonna say here's what the requirements
    say. I'm gonna do that in a way that makes no sense to me and I don't care.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, because we use it or is always wrong.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. reading comments, user forums and so on. I get that some people have
    that new users ever right?
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe if it's more of like a sophisticated software like you're trying to
    teach the most efficient way of something you want the user to rise to a specific
    level and that way you like the user to like learn a lot.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have a user interface so it's a challenge that we're setting so that
    the user can develop themselves
  persid: ''
- desc: that's pretty generous. I think. Many people feel like they see this idea
    that it builds character. And designers are forcing you to build character when
    you're using their software. Anyone. Does anyone know not clear? And what I mean
    by builds character is kind of an idiom. And you either prefer professor who told
    me and builds character and for us would put hair on my chest.
  persid: ''
- desc: That wasn't recently so don't times have changed what's appropriate anyway,
    for I get you fired or remade say it's a badge of honor for people to accomplish
    a task. It was difficult to program should be difficult to use. These are these
    are statements and you can have interface design maybe comes from an apathy towards
    users. And one unless we approach design with sympathy towards users
  persid: ''
- desc: all those like question mark symbols where it says like it's trying to help
    people but it doesn't.
  persid: ''
- desc: So that reminds me. So Dave Palmer who who's alumnus of the department, who
    went on to write Windows Task Manager. He told us I told a variation of this joke
    before that. I thought maybe I should. I shouldn't I shouldn't stop using it.
    But then he's he told the version of it and I thought maybe it was okay for me
    to use it again. So his version someone's flying a helicopter around Seattle.
    And it's foggy, very low visibility. But he sees an office building there was
    a wet winter sun was on deck with windows open. He could communicate with somebody
    and he said you know, I can't I can't see I'm not sure I'm right. Can you please
    help me out?
  persid: ''
- desc: He said while you're in a helicopter anyway, so took that information and
    made a course correction and found where he needed to go.
  persid: ''
- desc: It said because information was correct. And completely unhelpful. The use
    of Microsoft?
  persid: ''
- desc: Tough crowd Okay. Thank you not so, before user, I know what I can do, what
    I know what you need in the interface. I don't have to really focus on advertising,
    whatever you like and just I'll take care of you. So have those so say no.
  persid: ''
- desc: No there. I went to the football game on Friday night. And they had a piece
    of film to put over the flashlight on phones so that you could do like the turn
    the lights out and then see all these green lights in the stadium.
  persid: ''
- desc: There weren't that many people there to begin with. But then it took me quite
    a long time to get the film off my camera case. So I think that promotion was
    not designed with empathy
  persid: ''
- desc: just wanted to really easy to put on and then to get it off. That's sort of
    what
  persid: ''
- desc: wasn't easy to put on either. It was difficult to peel the film off because
    they gave him a piece of the game. A little card with a film on it
  persid: ''
- desc: can reserve work on the assignment and or?
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, I was just going to cover the last bit here so something that can help
    us in three minutes
  persid: ''
- desc: so. So there's a
  persid: ''
- desc: link in the assignment to a template for this. So a map is just the we're
    going to record
  persid: ''
- desc: what a user might say or do when they're using an interface to complete a
    task when they're completing a task, so I'm asking you to empathize with teachers
    by using your courses to create little activity with a couple of constraints.
    So imagine as you go through this, that you say, Are you be mindful of what you
    say and do and record that. And then also, what you're thinking about and what
    you're feeling. While you're using this and say I can't believe I have to prep
    so much. That's my general feeling of requests
  persid: ''
- desc: especially when you're getting stuck making this so many places to work
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, so you might feel
  persid: ''
- desc: confused.
  persid: ''
- desc: All right. So there are right or wrong answers. For this is a way for you
    to put yourself in the shoes of somebody else trying to understand why some things
    might be difficult for other people who think this is better of course if we're
    designing for a particular group, say senior citizens. Then instead of trying
    to imagine like if your senior citizens Nice to talk to somebody from the people
    from the group of people who will be like to use software I was 20 athletes. So
    in a way better with my time anyway, thank you for today. I'll catch up responses
    actually thank you very much for joining
