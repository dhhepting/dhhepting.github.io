    conversations still makes it into toxic understanding, feel bad That's totally
    what I wouldn't have had a chance to share is that in my earlier career, I didn't
    like communications
  persid: ''
- desc: and so I conducted usability studies. Where Oh yes, I sometimes I forget these
    things. So I'm happy to just answer questions and the students seem to sort of
    share their marketing as well. But from a needs analysis perspective, which will
    often come up because I just want to get rid of I'm happy to refer to you more.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you good so it's 930 now, so should we start? Yeah. Okay, good morning,
    everyone. It's 930. Monday, October 31. Happy Halloween. So if you're good, and
    if you're not so good, but they make hits I get tonight in my house. There'll
    be chocolate on Wednesday, I'm sure. Anyway, without further ado, please help
    me welcome Dr. Christy Schulz, who's director of the Center for Continuing Education.
    She's going to talk to us about personas.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm using the mic so you should be
    able to hear me even at the back of the class today. And as noted, I'm here to
    talk to you a little bit about personas and specifically how we use them in continuing
    education and I would say in development of university programs quite broadly.
    I will share with you to begin a presentation that I've delivered now at Dean's
    Council at Faculty of Science Council, which is where this invitation came from
    faculty of arts leadership team and a few other places. And so the hint here will
    be for you to listen for my use of personas in this presentation. It takes about
    seven minutes to go through the content here connected to understanding adult
    learners. And then I'll be happy to talk with all of you about the ways in which
    we use personas to think about program development and program design in continuing
    education and higher education and I know just enough to be dangerous about persona
    use in web design and marketing. So I'm really happy to talk to you about those
    things as well though that will be a little bit of a stretch from my current experience
    though. Not so far away from some of my past experience. So today, and this is
    where I'm going to go into the mode of pretending that I'm talking to you specifically
    about adult education but you'll catch the piece about personas in a few minutes.
    So today I'm going to talk to you about defining the adult learner and making
    a case for specifically this would be in the context of the University of Regina
    for an adult learner recruitment plan. Acknowledging that in universities, most
    of the effort is spent thinking about the traditional undergraduate learner and
    to a degree to a lesser degree, the graduate student but many of our students
    most of our students at a university are undergraduate learners. And so I think
    we often think about the 18 to 22 year old. So in the context of this presentation,
    some of what I'm going to talk about is connected to the university's recent student
    journey mapping project which was designed to craft a request for proposals, an
    RFP for a new student relationship management system. And in that context, there
    were probably a dozen personas that were actually used. And so this will shed
    help shine some light on what adult learners need. To begin, I'll share spend
    a little bit of time talking about some of the definitions we use to think about
    adult learners or non traditional learners in other contexts, and how we might
    want to consider those learners here in the University of Regina context. I'll
    then share a few data points as to sistex which you might find interesting. And
    then I will look to some opportunities that I think the university has, and this
    will of course, leave plenty of time for questions in both the presentation that
    I get to deal with council Science Council, etc and also here. So first step,
    defining adult non traditional learners. So believe it or not in Canada, we don't
    have a consistent dish definition of the non traditional learner or adult learners
    across the country. We sometimes have definitions of these province by province,
    but nothing that is a national definition. So I'll take a moment to define some
    of what the US uses to define a non traditional learner. So these are learners
    who delay enrollment, that is do not enter post secondary directly from the same
    calendar. They finish high school. They attend part time for at least part of
    the academic year. They work full time, 35 hours or more. They are considered
    to be financially independent for the purposes of determining eligibility for
    financial aid. They have dependents other than a spouse. So usually children in
    this case, but sometimes older adults or parents or other family members and and
    or they do not have a high school diploma. So within the scope of this definition.
    So this is sort of starting to in the context of this presentation a little bit
    beyond the curtain here. This is where some audience members or people like you
    who might be listening about adult learners are going to start to think about
    these kinds of individuals. So within the scope here 75% of all learners in the
    US in undergraduate degree programs would actually have one of these characteristics.
    So if like me, you might wonder why we use the term non traditional and I don't
    have an answer for that.
  persid: ''
- desc: A few other definitions and these might be a little bit more connected to
    what we use here at the University of Regina. learners who would be 25 years or
    older. Those who returned to post secondary education after a break from schooling
    have gained entrance through something like PLAR or through other experiences.
    PLAR is Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition or have completed a program
    or degree and now re enter to pursue updating our second area of academic study.
    Probably worth noting that these kinds of definitions are used when thinking about
    undergraduate students in particular, because most of these characteristics would
    apply to graduate students that I know there's some graduate students in the room
    today. So the adult learner at the University of Regina, for the purpose of talking
    about adult learners here, I'll ask you to think about those who are 25 and older,
    with some attention to those who are working part time or full time or maybe returning
    to school after a break. So non direct entry from high school learners. Here's,
    here's the time for the fun facts and I'm not sure if you'll be able to see this
    all the way at the back of the room but here at the U of are those who are 25
    and older we've had on the credit side. In the 2021 fall census state 38% of our
    overall students are over 25. So the proportion of our students who are over 25
    has been growing little by little year over year. Here at the you have our students
    are more likely 65% to be employed. This is out of 2020 data and compared to 56%
    So not a huge difference but a little bit more likely and where I live so on the
    other side of the lake, in continuing education, almost all of our learners are
    over 25. So perhaps not very surprising. Mostly we're offering programs for for
    those who are seeking career and professional development. So what does this mean
    for the University of Regina, and just a heads up in about 30 seconds we'll get
    to those personas. Broadly speaking, I believe that we can continue to build upon
    the strengths that the University of Regina already has, and the ways in which
    we're already serving adult learners. But perhaps we can do so just a little bit
    better and perhaps be a little bit more intentional in our recruitment. So before
    being able to think about some of the opportunities. I'll share a few observations
    with you. And I'll invite you to consider a couple of learners and their personas.
    So number one, consider a 28 year old single mom living in swiftcurrent Who would
    like to begin an undergraduate degree for the first time. She is currently working
    and not able to move to Regina, but she does want to become the first in her family
    to finish a degree. She is also motivated to inspire her daughter or to consider
    a 35 year old man who has completed two years of his bachelor's degree before
    getting a good job in the resource sector. His career has plateaued and he has
    noticed that those who are promoted in his sector and elsewhere all seem to have
    degrees he would like to complete his degree while continuing to work. So now
    I can shift into thinking about some observations about what adult learners really
    want. And in the context of the research and there was some of these things might
    not be surprising. It's worth stating. Adult learners want flexible open access.
    So admission without traditional entry qualifications, which is something we do
    very well in continuing education but something for us to think about in the degree
    world, flexible modes of study including online and part time options, and broadly
    continuing education opportunities, including microcredentials, seminars, certificates
    and other shorter programs. In addition, adult learners when surveyed will say
    they want clear and easy to understand admission. Program and cost requirements.
    They will say they want Student Services and advisor access outside of normal
    business hours and they want ultimately to earn their degree and they want to
    see people like them and so the longer information on they want the degree they
    want to see represented in university marketing materials and recruitment materials.
    Students who look like them who have stories like there's so thinking about a
    working mom or someone who is in their 30s Who wants to go back to school and
    they want to see those kinds of things.

  persid: ''
- desc: I know that you're just scratching back there, but it looks like you might
    have had a question No, it's not a question at all. So perhaps I will open up
    with a question that you might be able to respond to for me. First of all, just
    a show of hands. How many of you noticed when I used personas in talking about
    adult learners? So good, most of you, most of you notice that? What did it what
    did the use of personas in the context of thinking about making a case for supporting
    adult learners? What did that do in your mind? When I arrived at that persona
    moment where you were saying so it helped to help visualize? Yes, so just so for
    everyone at the back can hear that. So it helped to clarify what I'm saying and
    to visualize the kind of person that I was talking about anything else? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Probably needed more religion, because we would know that kind of person was
    a minor difference.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, excellent. So more relatable because you might so I'm just repeating
    for those at the back so more relatable for because you might know someone like
    that so you can you can imagine their experiences. Anything else about what that
    what that moment was like for you?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, all through a second question your way. So, I'm trying to imagine how
    you might be thinking about personas in the context of software design, software
    design, right? Primarily. Computer science so computer science writ large, perhaps
    with software design, more specifically, but how might you use personas in your
    work or in the kinds of work that you might do in computer science? Yes, at the
    back.
  persid: ''
- desc: So in that sense, you will find a lot of use cases a lot of people of different
    age groups or people or different culture groups, and that's the way to achieve
    performance.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so that those use cases and understanding the the variety of possible
    users. Excellent. Anyone else on that? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: So when we paid our empathy maps, which is what like a user would think feel,
    say and do you have to sort of create a persona like what kind of user are we
    pretending to be when we use the software and what do we
  persid: ''
- desc: That's very cool. Okay. I've never heard the phrase empathy map before. And
    I love that, indeed, to be able to imagine what they think feel do and say Is
    that Yeah, so indeed, anyone else for how you would think about personas in in
    your work and computer science?
  persid: ''
- desc: I think the default is to design for yourself. Right? And not to stop what
    other modes of interaction are out there to power other people?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes, I'm gonna going to pick up on that for a second. So thinking about you
    know, you often think about yourself, one of the things that is an interesting
    conversation that comes up periodically in higher education, whether you're, you
    know, a faculty member, or you know, a PhD student and you're teaching for the
    first time is that we're often we often forget that we're not teaching ourselves
    so imagining those experiences, but so we might not always want the same kind
    of teaching experiences that we had. Though. Most of us I will say, try to imagine
    designing a class designing learning experiences drawing on the best of experiences
    that we had, but still, often remembering who's in art who's in our classroom
    is different than the classrooms that we were in ourselves. So. So I think that's,
    that's a really good point. So not just about yourself. Now, if you're thinking
    about thinking about the design, I'm curious just to hear from you about needs
    analysis and personas and how those might come together. Needs Analysis is something
    we think about in in learning design. It's something we think about in web design
    in program design, but I'm curious to hear from you about. So I'm setting the
    table to say that there is a relationship between needs analysis and personas.
    But how might the two be related? Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: for designing software, know what arbitrators are about the user's interest
    and difficulties. So for understanding that and making personalized the habit
    process of gathering requirements This is used for knowing the person making the
    requirements
  persid: ''
- desc: making. Excellent, excellent and yes, the gap requirements gathering is another
    phrase for needs. analysis needs analysis in my world requirement gathering in
    your world indeed, other ways of seeing those connections.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, I'll leave you with one more question and then I'll turn things back.
    If you want to throw in any more questions or throw questions my way? What are
    some of the challenges of Persona design? What have you encountered or when you're
    thinking about the opportunity to create personas? What are some of the things
    that you need to keep in mind? What are some of the challenges? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Understand the persona per se, so like more or less sympathetic perspective,
    so we think we understand the persona. So I guess we have to enter our users
  persid: ''
- desc: interesting, this hat. So just for I'll repeat for those at the back so that
    you might not really know you might want to have that sympathy that understand
    that empathy map, but you might not really know what that person is about because
    you might not know them. Yeah, that's a interesting challenge. Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: So related to it. He said. We had a presenter who was colorblind. And so I
    would have no idea what a colorblind person would think when they look at something
    like it might not be accessible for them, but I would not be able to tell. So
    that's why like really doing said you have to interact with people and understand
    like, what are those struggles that they have when you're building this
  persid: ''
- desc: person? Yeah, indeed, those kinds of those accessibility challenges are probably
    some of even so in learning design, as well. Probably some of the most challenging
    to consider and think through is if you if you can't, it's beyond just imagination,
    but if you are not colorblind, you're not going to be able to have that experience.
    So you have to learn more about it. Indeed. There was a comment at the back as
    well. Yes, yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Everyone's wanted me to get on satisfy everyone. So yeah, that's
  persid: ''
- desc: yes, indeed, there it is very likely that they're, you know, we're at what
    7.5 billion people on the planet and growing so probably not, we're probably not
    going to be able to imagine all 7.5 million billion people in our persona design.
    So, so part of what you're hinting at here is being able to narrow to some of
    those key personas that then stand in for and represent a large group, which might
    mean that you're missing out on my personal lived experience, but hopefully, you're
    thinking about a persona that is going to capture enough of my experience, if
    I'm one of your intended audiences and one of the intended users of the software
    or their computer design so I'll pause now to see if I should turn things over
    after some questions.
  persid: ''
- desc: I was curious how
  persid: ''
- desc: the most common data use or
  persid: ''
- desc: identify people the characteristics from or how the same characteristics?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I think for within, that's a really great question. So the personas
    and in thinking about that, the degree that I mentioned that, you know, online
    available degree, we have that actually about half a dozen different personas
    that we've outlined there. And those come from stories and are sort of anonymized
    and compiled so group together, have stories that our student advisors have heard.
    That's so the true answer the reality is that they've come from decades of experience
    in student support in the continuing education field. And yet, because it resonates
    with the data that we do have, in terms of some of the characteristics of those
    who come for degrees after you know, in their 20s or 30s. It resonates and it
    matches. If I were to move forward with something that was even a little bit more
    formal. I would want to do that through some with some data as well. As some of
    that storytelling from the advisors experience. Characteristics versus students
  persid: ''
- desc: and one of the things I was wondering whether it is related to non traditional
    non traditional
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, and I think some where the definition is defined nationally in the US,
    there's absolutely work being done on that. So you know, there are, you know,
    I'm not sure which characteristics but say 40% have three or more of these characteristics.
    So some of that work is being done. But, indeed, I do think that many people in
    higher ed today, still imagine when we're thinking about undergraduate students,
    because we hear this still imagine an 18 year old who's graduating grade 12 as
    the student who's coming into first year university and, and data and these kinds
    of definitions helps to dispel that myth. That is still you know, the 18 year
    olds are still really important learners. But the I do think that it is important
    to think beyond just the what we used to think and I think that's where part of
    the use of personas can help is to think beyond what is a default mode of thinking
    for for many people. So I've got a couple of good questions that have come from
    back any questions from the class?
  persid: ''
- desc: I suppose a lot of like, a lot of what you have to do is a little bit of guesswork,
    because like I fall pretty firmly into those categories, but you wouldn't know
    which ones is.
  persid: ''
- desc: Like you, you have to take some guesses as to who's out there.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, and some of the data that we do have come there's the Canadian university
    student consortium, I think is the what Kaskade stands for, and they survey students
    and students in their first year, then they do a middle of your survey than they
    do have a final year of survey. So some of that comes from data, but it's survey
    data. So it's not population data. I think that I think you're right, I think
    and this sort of picks up on the question is, do we have interviews? And I think
    that doing interviews, especially in research, but also in program design, or
    software design, I think interviews can be incredibly helpful. And then further
    on in the process. The kinds of work that you might experience in a usability
    study by recruiting people who have those kinds of characteristics actually try
    things out. And this is perhaps we perhaps do that more in software design or
    web design than in, you know, a university degree design. We don't just recruit
    people to try it out. But we might want to have conversations about does this
    really work for you have our if our assumptions been correct, because there are
    going to be assumptions made along the way as even even with survey and interview
    data. So So I think it's yeah, it's important to keep thinking and to test assumptions
    whenever possible. Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: apart from the ones we discussed, do you face any challenges when developing
    these personas?
  persid: ''
- desc: Any challenges while developing the personas? Probably the limit of imagination
    and experience. So beyond data, interviews, conversations with staff who've interacted
    they're still I still am sensitive to that. That blind side, that not understanding
    because it's outside. It's too far outside of either my experience or the experience
    of people that I work with or the data. And that's a little bit of futurist thinking
    there. There may be students who we don't know about because perhaps they haven't
    presented themselves to us just yet. But I think one of the challenges and one
    of the things to keep asking is, who have I missed and what have I missed? Because
    I think that that does happen. And I think that it's worth being. It's worth being
    aware that that does happen. It's worth being aware that there still might be
    things that even with just enough expertise, there's still gonna be things to
    think about. So, and with software design that could really matter. Thinking about
    accessibility in software design. I think there are aspects of that that really
    require extra effort and extra wondering about what what have I missed? Yeah,
    great question.
  persid: ''
- desc: I was curious
  persid: ''
- desc: how many people would say
  persid: ''
- desc: fit under one of the characteristics you say you're not
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so. So yeah, well, we can just do one at a time. So how many of you
    have started your university degree? Not directly from high school with at least
    a one year break. So a couple How many of you attend part time so don't have full
    time status? Yeah, so we've got part time. How many of you are working full time?
    Few. How many of you are financially independent for financial aid eligibility
    purposes, which is a bit of a you know, so your Yeah, so some of you have dependents
    other than a spouse, so children or other people in your family that you're taking
    care of? Yep. Few and how many of you don't have a high school diploma and have
    been admitted on other grounds? I'm here so how many of you have at least one
    of these characteristics? So in this room, my quick math here is probably about
    a third. A third of you would be defined as non traditional, which I can't consider
    a badge of pride. So I've been a non traditional learner many times in my life.
    But certainly, these multiple characteristics do do absolutely matter, and often
    do impact our experience. I know in just thinking about the students who are in
    the graduate course that I'm teaching right now, many have families. I would say
    most are working. And a graduate program has a little bit of a few different characteristics
    than an undergraduate program and I know many of you are in an undergraduate program
    right now, but but it does shape even the way that I would experience my teaching.
    So something characteristics of you know humans really do matter. I may have taken
    that in a slightly different direction.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any other comments? Let's thank our speaker again. Thank you
  persid: ''
- desc: all for the engaging conversation. I really enjoyed presenting to you and
    thinking alongside all of you today and I will turn the computer back over to
    you. Thank you very much. You're wonderful. Have a great day. Everyone and happy
    Halloween Okay, so how many recognize she was wearing a costume for Halloween
    like the batch yeah to start. But I don't know what it is. So what are you talking
    about? Users they take the tenant password off the tenants Right? But that's also
    for makes sense why you don't really get afternoon. possible we should do
  persid: ''
- desc: something after seven
  persid: ''
- desc: days later.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I took off the password so that the fact that I'm there then forgetting
    to clear the passwords off the rest of them. So, Norman had a discussion so we
    can distinguish between slips and mistakes. So the one hand if we know what is
    required, but we don't we don't execute it properly. So okay, I know what I have.
    That's a slip. But then if we're in a situation where it's not clear where we
    get stuck and
  persid: ''
- desc: we don't know what the proper way to resolve the situation is. Then that's
    a mistake. And that's that that's a design issue. If there's a slip, it may not
    be so much about the design. It's just
  persid: ''
- desc: we did it. We did something wrong and renewable. We did and we can correct.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what So going back to our topic so how does understanding users help us
    to? To deal to catch design problems. So the more specificity we can have an understanding
    users
  persid: ''
- desc: the more we can we can take on their perspective. Yeah, I'm gonna give you
  persid: ''
- desc: an example when I was teaching. Also students are actually both perspectives
    and they can identify problems with their left distributors. And just
  persid: ''
- desc: because it's basically the students they have the way they expected to teach.
    That just doesn't fit in with our students so looking
  persid: ''
- desc: at teaching material from a student's perspective, it's important not case
    because we can we can now empathize more easily with students. So the idea of
    personas we can help prove your craft personas to represent students in labs that
    might help the lab instructors who are to remind themselves about what it's like
    to be a student
  persid: ''
- desc: that I know catch your drift your meaning and your comment. So the idea is
    that we're writing a detailed, detailed description of a representative user.
    So then we can test our assumptions against our detailed description. Say if we
    have a single mother who wants to go certificate or degree so it would be good
    if we can have conversations of people who are who we imagined would be users
    of our interface. So the persona isn't a particular person. We're not describing
    somebody's personal details have enough detail that we can say oh, this is a thing
    in the front row. We don't want to single out people but want to include a variety
    of features from the number of people who represent this particular kind of user
    we have in mind and we might have different personas representing different parts
    of the population. So first project installment we're asked you to look at
  persid: ''
- desc: a few activities occasionally.
  persid: ''
- desc: He recruited members could look at an activity and possibly a different user.
    So for the second part, I want you to focus on one category of activities one
    activity, one user so the user can make that connection if that makes sense he
    went going up for Halloween night I dress with this
  persid: ''
- desc: candidate children's event in restaurants for work
  persid: ''
- desc: I saw somebody get on the elevator she described it was a great red gown and
    a black wig. And then we have one costume the other costume
  persid: ''
- desc: in the Haunted Mansion dress is that
  persid: ''
- desc: sure. Anyway let's leave it there for today.
  persid: ''
