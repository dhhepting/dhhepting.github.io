- desc: seen you have no physical danger theory to use in a positive or negative direction
    not sure what I wanted us to quantify but I don't know how appreciate that okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so far so good
  persid: ''
- desc: right Okay very good we have to make sure that makes sense going to get to
    Chapter
  persid: ''
- desc: Four okay here we are that's interesting I was gonna say how do you like this
    today? Ah and
  persid: ''
- desc: it's not doing very good information as the right day but it's not okay, so
    I'll work on that how many people have like the page until it stopped working?
    How many people have looked at the page see if I know
  persid: ''
- desc: the meetings counter.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah the page about what's going on today. This shouldn't be linked to meeting
    seven I guess I didn't test the right cases Okay, so attendance I'll show you
    this page as well as the QR code and then of course you can also access it here
    for people.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there are comments, concerns that if I put the picture up they'll discourage
    people. From coming to class. And I appreciate that concern. But I'm wondering
    so I'd like your feedback on that. Does it discourage you from coming to class
  persid: ''
- desc: if someone is gonna go to that leg? I think you can just ask someone in class
    to send me a text. Yeah, that was
  persid: ''
- desc: if you wanted a foolproof method, you could ask them in paper. Or they could
    just write their friend's name, the most surefire way but he had to give to each
    and every single person at the door, check their student ID devices.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe I'll get I'll get the university's RF ID scanner so you can read your
    chips that have been implanted in here
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so anyway, I thought that was people were not going to be here. They
    could ask somebody who's here to see it. So the password to send them password
    in chat or discord or whatever. So this way, the pictures on is still only valid
    for the class time. So people will have to log in. They don't want to talk to
    their friends. People who don't come to class who didn't go to talk to their friends
    have to log in to my website or visit my website and then log into your courses
    during our class time to be able to record their attendance that seemed to me
    to be a reasonably high barrier for
  persid: ''
- desc: or dishonesty. So you can let me know what you think about that.
  persid: ''
- desc: As we go on. Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so I said we're going to talk about the projects and the assignments today.
    Let me first show you this experiment with your courses so, there's been a new
    role created called beta teacher for learning. I can name that role. I think it's
    not a bad name.
  persid: ''
- desc: So it's essentially a teaching role, but it obscures your student numbers.
    So if I show you the list of participants with my normal role that would defeat
    the purpose of me going through this exercise Well, partly defeat the purpose
    so I can switch my role and so I can switch to beta teacher for learning so you're
    only going to be this role
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so the magic is that there's no student ID and because your your role,
    so this is where the beta comes in. It says you have no roles but you do have
    a role you have a beta teacher for learning role.
  persid: ''
- desc: Because there's I searched for it. I suspect that I made a spelling mistake.
    Vaccination at the end didn't help. Okay, I tried this earlier. No, it worked.
    So I may have tried it from my teacher role. That I could list participants from
    the
  persid: ''
- desc: beta teacher for learning role. You can see that role administered as the
    top right so, I'll take this as a good sign that you don't have permission enough
    to see things like compromise the information you're trying to protect. Protecting,
    we can just change your role. Role Can you change to change? I tried to
  persid: ''
- desc: support staff that it shows the same for everyone. It goes down into the efficiency
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. I didn't need I did a little bit of testing and I I didn't think about
    that case.
  persid: ''
- desc: I thought maybe I thought maybe okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so everyone behaved themselves. And I'll get this I'll get this fixed I'm
    curious Okay, so now I can look for fighting go back to my own role that I can
    look for.
  persid: ''
- desc: So then I can look for Oh, no. Okay. Yeah. So it finds them Yeah, okay, so
    you shouldn't have the role of non editing instructor. Curious going to have any
    lab instructors teaching I am good. Going guys up okay, Mark let's try that. Once
    more.
  persid: ''
- desc: Morning. Evening next time Okay, so I don't know how I managed to get zero
    when I ran the same query earlier
  persid: ''
- desc: so Oh, isn't that cute? I'm gonna guess that's not a standard animation and
    somebody added that
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so just remember you're doing this for everybody. And so be responsible
    Okay, so I can diagnose this problem. I can guess what the problem is, is that
    a teacher role has includes teaching assistant and non editing teacher rules so
    that I can have the same capabilities as markers and assistance in my class. So
    I'm going to put this to information search, support it support and ask them to
    make a change to the beta so there aren't any included roles underneath that.
  persid: ''
- desc: Bless you. So what I this was a lie. I tried many times to add these. It's
    by having those cognitive student numbers over and then a few times the page would
    go blank on you so I'd have to start over again. So I don't want to erase everybody
    from this view again. So
  persid: ''
- desc: if we just could you switch on off to students that wants it's like switches
    that?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, let me try that. That's a reasonable idea. Let's see what I can do.
    Think that I can edit does for everybody. Let's see and it's like okay, so I can
    just remove everybody. Like nothing better to do than sit for hours on these point
    and click User you are courses interfaces, so let me do that.
  persid: ''
- desc: evening gentlemen Okay, I'll put you back hopefully later today so maybe this
    is goodbye for today. Good goodbye for now. To change it from
  persid: ''
- desc: me come back on to the course. You say hello again okay so I've gotten some,
    okay. Let me some other things in your courses. To date. Choice closes at noon
    so unless we have a tie, I haven't looked. I don't want to influence the process.
  persid: ''
- desc: We should have an arm wrestle. representative from each.
  persid: ''
- desc: She sounds similar to our wrestling Oh, look. Fine Okay. Set up a few project
    groups based on email. So if you send me an email about a project group, and you
    haven't noticed those come set up at honor in your courses. I will do that today.
  persid: ''
- desc: But if you know people you'd like to work with on the project so we're looking
    for groups of four
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe five maybe three in special cases. So if you know people you'd like
    to work with send them to me. And I'll take that into consideration. And also,
    if you're an 828, and you're doing research for a project or thesis, and that
    research involves user interfaces you know, the opportunity to continue to work
    on your research on the interface as of course project in this class. So let me
    know if you want to do that. So one person's talk to me about that already. So
    I know some people when they turn eight, don't have a research project going on
    so that you can just create a group with anyone else in the class. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: can you have something on your courses to check out four person group I can
    only see on your courses currently. I might just be missing the in class discussion
    groups but I can see the purchase or it could be just
  persid: ''
- desc: so not we cannot see. I'm focusing on beta learning teacher learning, teaching
    teacher for learning role and getting that
  persid: ''
- desc: I thought set up that was my priority little work on revealing all the project
    stuff today as well. And if you have other questions or concerns about your courses
    stuff
  persid: ''
- desc: then I'll encourage you to post an hour again Okay, so I guess we're not on
    track for tie yet because we will have 41 votes
  persid: ''
- desc: so participation discussions, that might be a good place to put questions
    about things that aren't working or could be improved.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay you could not see the result.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I changed that. So the first one I said, after you've answered you can
    see the results. Now this one I said that once closes you can see the results.
    So trouble one today you'll be able to see the results Okay. Project is four pieces
    especially.
  persid: ''
- desc: The names I have on the website so the first first part is to understand So,
    what I'm asking for groups
  persid: ''
- desc: or for for anyone, whether you're doing it individually or in a group is to
    if again, not your research, find a website that your group is somewhat familiar
    with and may have some issues with say it's always very frustrating when they
    log into your self service.
  persid: ''
- desc: Portal change the picture to a stupid waving
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so I don't know about concerning your self service but so maybe it's
    your self service your courses a website that you're you're familiar with and
    there are some issues so then the first phase of the project is to understand
    some opportunities for redesign. Talk about the process for doing that. So once
    you look at some opportunities for design, unmet needs in the current website.
    And you undertakes a design activity to come up with a couple of determinative
    interfaces. So we're going to think about metaphors and how they can influence
    the interface that we create, present to users. So for example, this is an example
    it's used a lot and it's in the textbook as well. Say somebody is not familiar
    with online shopping so the interface for online shopping for us borrows some
    ideas from a bricks and mortar store so when you go into the online store you
    can you might have a card because people are familiar with taking a cart and going
    down the aisles and putting things you want to buy into the cart and then going
    to checkout to pay for the items. So these are metaphors and if metaphors are
    done well. They can encourage people to transfer the behaviors they know from
    the online from the bricks and mortar store to guideline case. So when we're trying
    to address the unmet needs in webpage, you're you're selecting you want to approach
    it with one or two different metaphors that might be appropriate. And then sketch
    interfaces with paper and pencil. low fidelity prototypes are sometimes known
  persid: ''
- desc: to sketch on different screens and then in the third part we're going to get
    you to look at other groups interfaces so So they do idea is so if I take somebody
    from the Project group one
  persid: ''
- desc: I know I'm gonna make these testing groups largely of three people. So person
    one presents May and then person to some of the people from different groups person
    from group one person from group two and then person
  persid: ''
- desc: three. Is your intention with this that each group would have essentially
    one representative intermingling with other individual representatives or the
    groups who just split up and mingle amongst each other? Just every single member
    will be talking with every single other member of other groups about what's being
    worked on.
  persid: ''
- desc: So in my head, that picture is going to be less complicated. So I'm going
    so I'm not mingling I'm carefully creating groups where each the member of each
    of these testing groups is going to be from a different project group. And so
    three people can make. So person one would pair with person two, and they would
    present their interface first interface to the second person. So, person one person
    two would present, say their interface a to each other and run a test that way.
    And then person two and person three would pair up and they might present. Your
    face be to each other and then person one and person three would pair up and Persona
    presenter face B and person three will present interface a so the idea is that
    you get experience running a test and experience being the test subject and then
    get some exposure. Two other work being done in class. Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: this is going to be more of a informal sort of test where we can just it's
    always going to be more formal and we should set up some performance PowerPoint
    tests
  persid: ''
- desc: so the company collecting some data and we'll talk about that as the time
    comes. The whole big thing that helps clear things up. My explain that and drawing
    it. So then the fourth part is to cater your experience to tests and then make
    higher fidelity version presenting Do you progress on the project over the semester?
    Now the first assignment which will get on track soon I call it empathize with
    teachers. So the idea is that you can empathize
  persid: ''
- desc: with somebody setting up things in your courses and I think we're out of time
    plenty after Have a great rest of your Friday and have a great weekend.
  persid: ''
- desc: I should also apologize briefly I was going to put the little waving thing
    but I thought it was cute I wanted to arouse innocent just saw the upward picture
    and I thought I could have some honest fun with this. And thank you be offended.
  persid: ''
- desc: I was I was just wanted to remind people to be responsive. To get to the other
    questions here I want to thank you so I appreciate
  persid: ''
- desc: it. So my name is Kate and this is the second offense of trees and you will
    come out of detention centers project is always regarded by authorities whenever
    should happen
  persid: ''
- desc: right now. Both of the lecture classes actually we're going to do sounds very
    interesting. So I mean, for starters, I kind of like in Android phones you only
    have like
  persid: ''
- desc: one button How many of you people are like why they purchase decisions and
    stuff like that coming from the Presidency of
  persid: ''
- desc: the Republic Yeah, so the first step is activate this design. So we'll take
    a look at one baby. Step three is organizing stuff and it's becoming clear to
    be making my
  persid: ''
- desc: tax free Thank you. Thanks you too. So let's say the three of you are really
    into it. Testing. So that would be I would do that because you're in three different
    project groups.
  persid: ''
- desc: You got one person is to design
  persid: ''
- desc: and, you know, know everything everybody's happy to do this is a group project.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you do it together. I was talking about our test tested the voice interfaces
    sketched out you would say? Three of us. So I'm in a project, different project.
    So I would say what do you think?
  persid: ''
- desc: Why basically give me the feedback.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then so so we do that pair and then we would send a pair I would present
    my other interface. Is one your project grows together with you to design or testing
    all that you will take on issues faced by adding cables soliciting input for bonus
    ideas or something for that started which is perfect for
  persid: ''
- desc: me weeks too long for us to design to design and that we will share with each
  persid: ''
- desc: other designed to and that's based on what feedback you get
  persid: ''
- desc: based on can recover for
  persid: ''
- desc: food 28 and 28 or
  persid: ''
- desc: no I don't think so. But still, like she's asking for 28 and he can make a
    Chromebook. That's okay. Thank you for taking the time. You're welcome. We have
    a question. Like what do we have to do?
  persid: ''
- desc: I was unable to hear you at the end. Also I do so can access
  persid: ''
- desc: if you don't can't hear me, let me know when I'm talking. So I can turn up
    the volume. I can do a couple of things. So the individual Simon is about taking
    on a teacher's role in our courses.
  persid: ''
- desc: The 26th one right, the nearest 26
  persid: ''
- desc: No not be due on the 26th because we haven't started so I have to go back.
    I have to fix something with still
  persid: ''
- desc: and what to do teachers
  persid: ''
- desc: like there's a description there
  persid: ''
- desc: a great day as you How do I access my role as a teacher because I tried it
    yesterday but I was unable to access the that thing.
  persid: ''
- desc: a great day as you How do I access my role as a teacher because I tried it
