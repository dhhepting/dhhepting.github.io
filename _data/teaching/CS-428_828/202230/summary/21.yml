- desc: Have you interpret instead of Oh, that was no oh yes I get a couple of old
    me monotone I don't remember what. Year I wish she had the funny thing is like,
    this is important this is just like you say this is a corporate event with me
    and want to be one of the right What did you see I'm the worst I said because
    they're 15
  persid: ''
- desc: passwords from the date of the midterm until I got home and I was like oh,
    I didn't get any attendance.
  persid: ''
- desc: No, there is no explicitly turned off attendance.
  persid: ''
- desc: There is still a response to me. And I just wrote in
  persid: ''
- desc: I apologize for that. I moved to change the week
  persid: ''
- desc: I would have been easy with fingers these are the questions.
  persid: ''
- desc: So one comment on my feedback for me was the mic isn't working how's that?
    Is that better? All the controls are going if I turn this up now it seems like
    oh, there we go. Professor Kevin used to be barred from discerning our graduate
    if he doesn't watch this teachers are all busy final thesis this video really
    just a temperature too. Hard to just talk to me see chapters of the. Constitution
  persid: ''
- desc: I have not just like all over the place. I swapped from engineering to like
    computer science and I suddenly have like, my friends like Hey, Jason like Okay,
    it's time to do
  persid: ''
- desc: that oh, okay. It's getting gradually brighter so I know either there's some
    comments I'm not the best at using time effectively. So I I'm mindful that again,
    that's a challenge for me. So
  persid: ''
- desc: I went through the textbook.
  persid: ''
- desc: Going through it, I felt we covered everything.
  persid: ''
- desc: Simultaneously, using the textbook and explanation we feel that we have not
    done anything but a lot of the topics were covered. Thank you for that.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's not obvious that we're going through the textbook it's obviously screenplay
    learning.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I want ascension today. well. So I realized I'm ready to go to small there.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I'm thinking about our project. And we have done some work to understand
    what where people are having problems. Clarify where you're having problems because
    we're, people hear. Hear the users of the application or exploring that you're
    seeking understand. So we don't wish to so there's a sir. I would like for it
    again. Sir David Kelly, who I've mentioned before, as the one of the people involved
    in ideal industrial design for he talked about say imagine the customer comes
    to you and said, we'd like you to redesign your toaster and what we need is an
    needs more curlicues on the side. So we understand what's needed but we would
    like you to do the design.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if we just look at these cosmetic changes to the design. We're just focusing
    on narrow area. If we just go to a solution too quickly, you might
  persid: ''
- desc: completely miss an opportunity for spatially improving design so that not
    just everyone who wants to these toasters or toasters and new new settings because
    this is your wonderful job of making bread Chris.
  persid: ''
- desc: So he said that instead of having the design instead of having the kind of
    the client say what the design should be, so we have to take the veterans taking
    responsibility as designers so that we're not just putting a rubber stamp on somebody
    else's idea or contributing to the process of validating or verifying this is
    the most the most practical way to achieve our ends. And so how do we do that?
  persid: ''
- desc: So his approach is to take a look at the history of red crisping examples
    of Renaissance France and the space shuttle. So there might be different things
    that are maybe not to be adopted wholeheartedly, but there are maybe pieces of
    ideas of this and other designs and ideas from other sources that can be applied
    productively to our design.
  persid: ''
- desc: Call it the history of bad crispy but that's not so that double diamond approach.
    shape that looks like this Imagine those are squares turn 45 degrees those of
    you in Canada to Shreddies turn to shreddy diamonds. He did that. Anyway, so the
    cereal is square. They said they've made it now they've made diamonds so this
    shirt, swear cereal. Rotated
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. So I wanted to talk about a bit of this evaluation today. Okay so we've
    talked about two ways to think about it, talk about it say one dimension of valuation.
    So what were the two words that we've used? For evaluation? Thanks so we might
    apply formative evaluation when we're talking with users to see if
  persid: ''
- desc: we're on the right track and then once we get some assurance that we have
    a good design work implemented, and then we're not testing if it's a good idea
    anymore. Testing computing summative evaluation to make sure that we're we've
    reached our goal afterwards okay, so that's a little bit when and a little bit
    why
  persid: ''
- desc: our summative evaluation does not give us a positive result. Should we then
    do a formative evaluation
  persid: ''
- desc: well I guess a negative summative evaluation. Shouldn't you shouldn't you
    shouldn't do a farm evaluation say yes. Using like some feature x.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then at the end you get a test and there's four results because there
    could be many more costs involved depending on what the gap is.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense? So so for a summative evaluation might be that on a
    rating scale if Sophia, we have a Likert scale. So Likert scale gives you a range
    of values. So on my formative on my feedback instrument that there are nine questions
    that have a Likert scale. So it gives you five values. So you can have a different
    number of values on the Likert scale. You might do for you might say strongly
    disagree, disagree, agree and strongly agree. The idea of Likert scale is that
    you have these items
  persid: ''
- desc: equal just and scale so let me so we have a five point scale. The middle is
    so we're looking at we have the middle occurring at a player the sale so sometimes
    is the fuse in Indian English so you can sit on the spot and sit on the fence
    and not have an opinion one way or the other can take and same sometimes or I
    don't know maybe. But some never and always are. I think have the same conceptual
    distance from the and rarely and often are also. So what's another scale? Do the
    cost per station what kind of so we did for frequency, the first one the agreements
    and the second? Thinking about it. Let's just make a bad example of agreement.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any kind of skill whatsoever. The first skill that comes to mind is the sad
    face. To happy face in terms of pain you're experiencing when you're at the hospital.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway. I'm so that's another example
  persid: ''
- desc: very unsatisfied, unsatisfied. Satisfied. Very satisfied.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, that can be so now I want if I just say let's just for simplicity is
    that another descriptor on the one hand so as this same quality just added the
    idea that the scale is balanced. So we have to take care of that if you want to
    make some we want to collect data and use it. We should make sure the sales are
    balanced so when you mentioned the faces of pain, I remember watching dope sick
    and part of those scales or those evaluation tools came from pharmaceutical companies
    that are trying to sell more pain medication. But anyway, that's another yes on
    some scales
  persid: ''
- desc: you have. So you have those on the left you have any because I don't know
    if it's just you but I rarely use that
  persid: ''
- desc: survey or the questionnaire usually. And so my understanding of that arrangement
    is that you're not answering the question about the scale so then isn't on the
    scale. It's, here's the scale or, you know, I don't think it's appropriate. It's
    not applicable. So the again, a number doesn't factor in scales. Although you
    might think about how many people are saying na when you ask the question, like,
    you could go the opposite way you just have
  persid: ''
- desc: one or zero. Strikers result and you don't want to go the way of
  persid: ''
- desc: me sometimes. Yeah it's just always if you want a more decisive
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, I think that has its drawbacks to Sony Does that make sense? In the
    back there and if you're having trouble hearing me please let me know. Or yeah,
    I can hear you
  persid: ''
- desc: wait for the next feedback
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so I would say an answer to your question earlier. We're not doing for
    evaluation then going away and working on our own and then at the end saying this
    is what you want, right? This is what you want it. So we might come back. We want
    to engage users in a discussion
  persid: ''
- desc: so in that SAS car side, I think I have to check whether I got a reply but
    i Last of all what I can share with you the SAS presentation but one of the slides
    said, why do we ask users what they want when you just don't know what they want?
    That was the gist of that. Any thoughts? If we're not sure what we want, how can
    we answer your question or that you don't want Okay?
  persid: ''
- desc: We get a perspective like the users spend on solar. So disconnected from them
  persid: ''
- desc: okay so what about the may start out not knowing what they want, but it's
    through conversation
  persid: ''
- desc: some ideas might emerge. Okay, so that's another contribution. A designer
    can make. So it's not just about everybody can do this. We don't need designers.
    We don't need programmers. We can just
  persid: ''
- desc: go on the website and do all this stuff ourselves. So I think the textbook
    criticizes the idea of design thinking and making design thinking available to
    everyone because the associated then is the evaluation of signers skills. But
    I think the arguments made another way is to it's not just because people can
    do things on their own doesn't mean that they don't need professional input and
    guidance. direction. The law is one thing so people can represent themselves in
    court, but probably that's quite rare. Because they benefit from having somebody
    who has been trained and understands the system. That was an argument made. As
    Eric Raymond spoke about open source software, so it's not about your by make
    source code available. You're not
  persid: ''
- desc: devaluing programming but you're getting more eyes on the problem and you
    think you're getting a better solution or better code because you have input from
    people who aren't
  persid: ''
- desc: so gonna write the code for a living that. least contribute ideas that are
    helpful. So we get that perspective.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anything else about? Well, I asked users when they go into what they want
  persid: ''
- desc: it's Monday afternoon okay. Okay, does that make sense? I mean. So we're thinking
    about formative evaluation as a way to to check that we're on the right track.
    And then finally we've been moving in the right direction all along, and then
    suddenly, we're off track. That some evaluation shouldn't be a surprise. Results
    shouldn't be a surprise. So if we get something unexpected then then we're gonna
    we're not just the
  persid: ''
- desc: perspective of users the same as me.
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry, I didn't hear that is gaining the
  persid: ''
- desc: perspective of users
  persid: ''
- desc: gain their perspective or exporting feedback differently, of course, feedback
    or separately
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, I I don't mean as a separate thing from getting feedback. We might be
    engaging in conversations. So if we understand who the user is and understand
    their perspective
  persid: ''
- desc: and so on by asking them what they want, we get get to know them better. If
    they say they don't know what they want I don't know if I'm helping defend answering
    the question or
  persid: ''
- desc: clarifying the answer or not. The general idea is that it's useful, even if
    they don't know what they want to talk to users because we can understand more
    about users. And in talking with them and what they do. They may not articulate
    ideas to us but from the conversations we might be able to suggest alternatives
    to them that
  persid: ''
- desc: are really helpful if that makes sense. So some of them are formative and
    summative. Talk about why when. So thinking about pairs of terms what other we
    think of other axes of valuation that we can use.
  persid: ''
- desc: So without getting without requiring both both words in a pair, what are some
    adjectives? Help help us frame other kinds of evaluation
  persid: ''
- desc: question location just thinking
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, this is this is me it's not all right. So that's good. Not to run some
    thinking. Yeah, that's one that I was thinking. So we might say I spelled that
    wrong start off with a quantitative and qualitative so we might say if we have
    numbers, and then we have some objective truth and we have
  persid: ''
- desc: open ended, answers that it's subjective. It's not a string so we have a tendency
    to value objective or subjective.
  persid: ''
- desc: Same age think an average score. Know I'm sorry. The other one that you can
    think about on Wednesday is. Thank you very much for today. We'll see you on Wednesday.
    That's an A maybe you're fine dining. For the second part of the project. like
    to talk about it when the second part of the assignment is due we will talk about
    it too.
