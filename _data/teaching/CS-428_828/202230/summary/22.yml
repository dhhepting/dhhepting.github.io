- desc: You. Wednesday today Happy Wednesday so I just want to mention some of you
    have noticed an email about the flag being and half mast on Friday
  persid: ''
- desc: so, Larry Saxton Professor Emeritus of computer science was one of the first
    hires in Parliament. He passed away on the 13th.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, Friday is a day of service for him. So I'm gonna go to the service and
    it's gonna be live streams as well. So anyway, I just wanted to share something.
    stories posted today about Larry. So he retired in 2011. I mean he'd been on campus
    more recently than that so maybe there are a lot of connections with him in the
    serum aside from me, but I just want to let you know
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're talking about evaluation yesterday lastly. So you can think of different
    ways or different types of evaluations and what were the ones that we've talked
    about so far.
  persid: ''
- desc: Start over here. Actually, let me turn on I think yeah, formative and summative
  persid: ''
- desc: I think there were two more so
  persid: ''
- desc: yes. Yes, those as well. So fixed help us with turn the projector on. As well
    I guess.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what are some kinds of qualitative data we can So, again you don't need
    the QR code because there's no password something Something will happen
  persid: ''
- desc: so what what are some kinds of data we can? Some data that asks you what did
    you like about the interface or What didn't you like? So those are qualitative
    sorts to get some some open ended text responses that we can analyze in a different
    way. It's not just a matter of calculating the average quantity and then we can
    do some more standard things and look at averages and standard deviations and
    so on.
  persid: ''
- desc: Right so time to complete is something we can look at, called quantitative
    data. To a count the number of errors we'll make gonna say something. Okay, I
    realize I'm writing too small. I apologize. We'll be back next time. It's time
    to leave the number of errors the user
  persid: ''
- desc: user makes and maybe the numerical average satisfaction. Are you satisfied
    with the the interface strongly disagree, strongly agree. And the range that we
    talked about like a Likert scale
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so, yes, last day I left you two words, or two blanks. One starts today
    and one starts at the knee.
  persid: ''
- desc: Any thoughts about that? Yes, if I wrote the right number of blanks so, we
    can do evaluation by collecting data from users for example, is that a word
  persid: ''
- desc: something like analog or at all analogous
  persid: ''
- desc: because it sounds like that
  persid: ''
- desc: because it's like empirical data is usually like digital one or zero true
    or false but analog is all the in between something you
  persid: ''
- desc: get twisted on or something's getting now political analytical
  persid: ''
- desc: collect the screen loves the best we get to film the details, like continuous,
    discrete and continuous we can talk about those in terms of data All right now
    we're blanks. Okay, so you're collecting data from users? So we can analyze an
    interface without having people use it and so this might be useful
  persid: ''
- desc: so that we get a sense of the issues in an interface before we present it
    to users.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what kinds of analytical evaluation are possible so I think we've talked
    about one already this heuristics so we can do we might do a walk through sort
    of do a heuristic evaluation and say,
  persid: ''
- desc: here with this list of heuristics, this is what I observed about the interface.
    So that's done without users. So the expert is making judgments about the interface
    based on what they see. And so this is this can be helpful because we're using
    these time tested heuristics. But it can be a negative because we're not observing
    people using the interface. We don't we might put too much weight or too little
    weight on some features that we notice in a static interface and not take into
    account our being used by actual users of the interface. So there's also another
    it's part of a larger part of a larger model. Called gums. I'm 95% sure that I've
    written the proper have expanded that acronym properly because there's just seems
    like a lot of words that could fit with a review. Anyway. So in particular, we
    have the kale LEM, which is not the Dutch airline, but the keystroke level model
    thank you for the knowledge front of my Kaylynn. Or, or maybe it was repulsion
    from my comment, but anyway, I'll take it. So the idea is
  persid: ''
- desc: so which of these as if I like this are from user data? So if we have like
    a design company already built, someone says before, and I'm building something
    else, and I already have some user data, which is a bit about others.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if we have easier data, then we would be doing some analysis we that would
    be an empirical evaluation. So the general idea of our analysis is to describe
    interactions with the year face is key with these different quantified so for
    typing a 10 character password then we have 10 K's in a row. So we might choose
    values with an average, some average typing speed so maybe point one seconds for
    the key press. But switching between those keyboard is more expensive. It's at
    the point four seconds. And then we have to run the mouse and we have to target
    it still. So there's an increased cost for that. And then also thinking that's
    an important element as well. So it's not so important. If we're comparing two
    interfaces. And not it's not so important to say
  persid: ''
- desc: that we have timings that are representative for computer science students.
    Whether they're under your pet, how many people type like this. I just want to
    how many people are touched typists I remember, my mom took typing lessons when
    I was 10 or so. So just the other day and she's she convinced me she strongly
    encouraged me to go through her book that's really helped. Most days, I can do
    pretty well typing. Anyway, so it's not so important to take an individual person's
    speeding speeds of typing. The idea is to compare one interface with the other.
    So if one is
  persid: ''
- desc: what is the amount of time it takes me to delete it at random letters? Until
    autocorrect figures out what I'm trying to say
  persid: ''
- desc: is that yeah, okay, so in that case, like on my Mac, I get these suggestions
    sometimes. I think I don't want the suggestions I just keep on but what I realized
    is that I have to hit the X to not take the suggestion
  persid: ''
- desc: otherwise, I have to go back and mental effort and a good portion of my goodwill
    towards try to have a second question and there's a cost to uncorrect to correct
    the corrections that we can model that AMI by saying we might have a probability
    of having the correct solution that we have to refuse so that's
  persid: ''
- desc: the mouse need that happens tempers time. So this is a flexible, fairly powerful
    way to describe interactions with some probabilities so that we get on average,
    a good expression of the time it takes to process a good level of what's required
    to interact interface.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we have one interface that involves a lot of typing. And one that involves
    a lot of what I was pointing clicking. So one aspect of our comparison is to say,
    what if we run the computation we find that the key keyboard based interfaces
    better has a shorter time to completion than was spaced one. But is that a reason
    to pick on compact keyboard interface? Think I did this already
  persid: ''
- desc: depends on how we implement this website and I don't remember which I think
    it's set verification just put it in it will automatically submitted.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if you put in like basically like a password, or a verification code, instead
    of going and pressing submit, in Turkey, I remember correctly just submits it
    for you. So if it's, I think it's if it's a seven character thing, and then we'll
    just as long as as long as you have seven characters and it does work most of
    the time, but maybe four or five.
  persid: ''
- desc: I'm gonna make a bold assumption, say that most people here are aware of programming
    and have done at least a little bit of computer programming. And I think most
    people are aware of techspace editors in command prompt because that's where everyone
    kind of starts at CS 110. And so it's a bit of a running joke of if you need to
    generate a txt file full of random nonsense, just get somebody to equip them.
    But after looking into them, it's kind of purely keyboard based. There's a keyboard
    shortcut for any possible thing you can think of go between brackets, go to the
    end of the line, find the second set of quotation marks and insert the cursor
    between them. You can jump to line numbers, so it's entirely keyboard pressing,
    and there's no most control however, it's a big trade off in intuition and when
    I think that's something we didn't consider too much with the last point, just
    keep prices and most pressing is how intuitive the key presses and most input
    is. Because if I have to click around for 10 minutes to find the thing that I
    wanted probably a little bit more than 0.4 seconds.
  persid: ''
- desc: Right. So I was good. These things sorry, but thank you for bringing them
    up.
  persid: ''
- desc: So with them I knew it when I was three I how it's been improved. I think
    that's a big step. Anyway so J small J is a cursor this is this is the one that
    catches me when I'm not paying attention from time to time, so I'm happily moving
    the cursor around but then if I accidentally have a CapsLock key on then I see
    my file shrinking because all the lines are being joined together and then I swear
    to myself join levels my mentoring join lines. So a keyboard interface that just
    lets us put in commands may be great for experienced users.
  persid: ''
- desc: So the question is, do we have experienced users are we targeting this for
    people who
  persid: ''
- desc: do do this stuff every day for hours each day? So if user community isn't
    this isn't native experienced users then maybe the efficient keyboard interface
    isn't the one to choose.
  persid: ''
- desc: So most basic interface. I apologize. They're hiding. Good for novice users.
    But they may get tired of it quickly.
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is my feeling in your courses or Moodle is that there are some things
    when I'm making groups the groups interface and you're welcome to do look at that
    as being teachers for learning in the experiment course. So this is these are
    some trade offs. How do we design things for
  persid: ''
- desc: I mean, so maybe we'd like maybe the keyboard interface was appropriate for
    very experienced users. But we'd like to
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe the question if it's a mouse based interface, where people are clicking
    a lot, maybe there's a way to think of a different metaphor, organized differently
    so that we're not doing so much clicking Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: Most basic input. Where do we start? Because there's a few different types
    of
  persid: ''
- desc: devices we have today. Like obviously we have a contract that has some different
    functionality than normal noses. And then do we consider mobile phone touches
    it touches on those considered? Input or is that a separate time
  persid: ''
- desc: whatever the style is?
  persid: ''
- desc: No, we care. So I'm not sure all of them have significant differences in terms
    of timings and interaction with them.
  persid: ''
- desc: More realistic. People don't use phones, but there might be devices I'm not
    familiar with that people with disabilities use or interact with computers. I
    don't ever want to see a close up blind fellow would still fall on your face.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we see that the speed with which we can accurately hit a target on screen
    depends on the size of the target and the distance to the target. So this is expressed
    as Fitts Law those of you with a textbook I want you to find Fitts Law in the
    index.
  persid: ''
- desc: So on a Mac we just gonna knock me so we might think. Well, okay, if there
    was a map because we have the menu bar at the top of the screen. Regardless of
    where we are, we know that we can just move up quickly. And we can't overshoot
    it because it stops at the beginning as a matter of clicking on the right button.
    So that helps us I have had frustrating experiences with word in the past where
    I tried to adjust the margins the margin and try to use the graphical interface.
    It's Pixlr two wide target it seems like to me to get the second tab or two similar
    manipulation that it's very time consuming. So I think I didn't check this, but
    I think that they've updated the web page up to just the last meeting and I read
    through the comments about the exam. So I want to just touch on one thing about
    my feedback instrument
  persid: ''
- desc: so I'm aware there's a potential as you get giving me information that I might
    not want to hear. Well, if I if I didn't want to hear it, I wouldn't ask for it.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I suppose that there's an implication there that you express the information
    in ways that I I can.
  persid: ''
- desc: I can hear it more easily. Instead of calling me a bunch of names. Not that
    anyone does. But I frequently get responses like what would what do you like best
    about the class? Nothing. What would you change everything and so on. So I'm asking
    for feedback in the middle of the semester so that I can so that we may
  persid: ''
- desc: benefit for the remaining time with the feedback so in a give you the option
    of having or giving me some feedback at the exam because that's a good time. I
    found
  persid: ''
- desc: if people have a minute or two after the exam to fill out some feedback. And
    in fact everyone who wrote the exam submitted some feedback so so I asked you,
    I reminded you to not make any marks any identifying marks on the paper but anyway,
    in light of comments about the ethical issues so I'm I'm not look my interest
    is is just to to solicit your feedback in a non threatening way and give you the
    option to not to not give me feedback so you could give me your feedback form.
    You could give me a blank feedback form because
  persid: ''
- desc: I asked you to put them face down or you could not return a form at all and
    so I just want to do you think there's should I? Is there room for me to make
    a more clear statement about the purpose of the feedback and the precautions?
  persid: ''
- desc: I was talking about this with my friend recently. And while they realized
    when I was preparing for the midterm that we had much more material than I thought
    when I was going through the textbook I know I remember this Oh, I remember this
    too. And so I think the biggest drawback of this class in terms of within the
    class itself is that we're always learning to smoothly it's under the radar. It's
    almost like you expect some resistance and because the operation so smooth, if
    there was some indication of where in the textbook we are, that might help a little
    bit but that's just my opinion and others may disagree.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, thanks. So that's why I give you the chance to give me feedback so you
    can I can get those opinions, those suggestions from you without having to solicit
    them in front. I mean, you're sitting in the front row of the class. So that means
    that you will be interested in talking to begin with, but I don't want to put
    pressure on everyone to make comments in class. So my question was about, is there
    a way to modify the instrument to put some language at the top to make it more
    clear about the purpose of collecting the feedback and and other details. So for
    the final exam, I'll collect some summative feedback from from you, but I won't
    look at those until after the exams are marked. So any thoughts about the feedback
    stuff?
  persid: ''
- desc: It'd be nice to have an indication of the feedback we're providing a strictly
    for the course material as you present it or is it going to play into assignments
    or play into the exam?
  persid: ''
- desc: Like are you looking for feedback specifically to influence the lectures or
    is it influencing the entire class? Performance
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's about the class if you have particular quit suggestions about assignments
    or something so I'm not trying to make it about everybody a particular thing,
    I guess I'm just get I will am trying to provide a way for you to give me some
    feedback about whatever thing in the class you would need to give me feedback
    about that you want to give me feedback about and do it in a way that doesn't
    require you to do speak up in class about it just those I was thinking having
    another batch of the test the feedback you get will be less than number of feedbacks.
    More helpful. Like it takes initiative initiative
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah
  persid: ''
- desc: so I guess I can make clear. Here, here's a survey. You can complete it or
    not. It's anonymous and voluntary. Some of us that's creating something online.
    Yeah, I recognize that. That I will so the trade off there is giving you something
    online to do to the participation rate would decrease. So during an in class increase
    participation rate and I can make
  persid: ''
- desc: all the assurances in the world but that I'm not matching handwriting to exams
    or other samples I have. So I wrote a time here, but I just I want to
  persid: ''
- desc: say that I welcome your input about improving that process. So we can think
    about my feedback instrument as an interface and we can improve the design of
    it that event and the process other option would be to for the hospital to have
    a six year mark
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's have a discussion about the final exam. We'll start that online and
  persid: ''
- desc: so if you need to go Ryan especially in the back he seemed primed to get up
    didn't mean to anyway was it gonna save of let's just keep the discussion going.
    Okay, and let's pick this up again on Friday.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thanks again for your attention today. Have a great day and we'll see you
    on Friday.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thanks again for your attention today. Have a great day and we'll see you
    on Friday.
