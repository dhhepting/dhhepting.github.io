- desc: classes canceled. No good try case six today so I remember now there's a hyphen
    in the Yamo file that is preventing this from splitting
  persid: ''
- desc: all this stuff but so what I've done here not to take away or stuns your name
    not to take away your material for the responses, but somewhat what I've done
  persid: ''
- desc: so I don't have to put the password up every day. I've made a PDF of it so
    you can access it from the webpage so you can not rely on me to put it on the
    screen or have it on the screen you can access it and if you want the password
    the password is still there
  persid: ''
- desc: you think fire at the end of the day or?
  persid: ''
- desc: No it's it's during class time. It works during class time. So I invite you
    to consider whether this is a good alternative
  persid: ''
- desc: to attendance so I want to mention about so we had 43 of 67 answers or 43
    of you voted for the midterm. He tried to say again how sad is that better? Okay,
    so I'm asking is the sound better? I'm not asking for the front two rows, maybe
    the back two rows.
  persid: ''
- desc: Can you hear me okay? Okay, thanks. So you may have heard that September 19
    is a federal holiday
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I was curious about another one.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's no holiday in Saskatchewan. It's it's declared a day of remembrance
    and commemoration Guys. So a question for you to consider is, is there something
    we might do to
  persid: ''
- desc: commemorate the queen? Remember the Queen Anyway, okay, so that's September
    19. So we're still meeting.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now midterm date so I can display well, I guess I can change the settings
    but anyway, I didn't change the settings here. So we had four dates. Start with
    Friday the 14th. Monday, the 75th Wednesday Friday the 21st for votes 16.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so those of you who voted can see the results so I didn't change them
    to make them just available after the choice closed. So I made another run off
    choice I changed the setting. Change is saying so as a Friday noon whoever whatever
    whoever scored is
  persid: ''
- desc: not voted everyone will be able to see the results here. So So drop this one
    off the ballot. This one so because we had 16 People choose Monday and 23 people
    not choose part 27 You will not choose Monday the choice between Monday and Friday
    so that starts after class so we finished the finals. Yeah, well I just championship.
    Yeah, this is like this is all on September, October.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes. Not talking about dates. This September talking about October. Okay,
    so I saw some people come in since we showed this so I'm trying something new
    for the passwords and the QR code. So I created an image here. You can go to the
    My my website for the meeting today and get the information yourself so you don't
    have to rely on me to put it up on the screen. That's the idea and I welcome your
    feedback about this as well. Okay, so things should be ready on Friday. I need
    to conclude a conversation with somebody on the fifth floor. About this on site.
    I want to make sure that things are resolved. But it support created this new
    role so that seems to have handled all the concerns. Okay, so we'll take some
    time on Friday to talk about answering questions about that individual assignment
    just the due date maybe. Still okay, it's Can you hear me now? Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. So that that's that so I wanted to just talk about the wiki as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: Meeting for the eighth comes from eight groups for in class. So, for each
    meeting, starting competing for not the midterm. It'll take us to the end of the
    semester. So
  persid: ''
- desc: for each meeting, there's a group who I liked it I'm designating taking care
    of the summary of what's discussed in the meeting. So for meeting for group A,
    for meeting five Group B, and for meeting six, Group C, and so on.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's I mean, you don't want other groups to add anything to that would
    get all that specific group.
  persid: ''
- desc: No. So I'd like all groups to add their discussions. So when we have in class
    group discussions, each in class group can post their discussion.
  persid: ''
- desc: What about different group deletes?
  persid: ''
- desc: There'll be a trade there'll be history edits. Here
  persid: ''
- desc: for our group as well, after meeting, like I posted it, but then it wasn't
    there but
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. That's it meaning five. Okay. So cut the history Yeah, well I'm wondering
    how to select two okay. So I can only compare.
  persid: ''
- desc: I think if you click for example, my name at the bottom, it'll let you move
    to the top one as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: It might just be that you're in teacher view and
  persid: ''
- desc: you can call today a very different view on mine.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, let me switch to student. So there's a question mark here. Let's click
    on the question mark to see what excellent help as you provided to our courses.
    Selected versions of the page may be compared in order to find differences. I
    think the
  persid: ''
- desc: radio button needs to be after the left hand radio button because it has to
    be a change that comes after the left turn radio button.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, you can just convergence forward instead of having an experiment the
    little number of people and just see what it means. Okay, hey
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah, so it's not clear this is a separate link
  persid: ''
- desc: so there we compare two different versions. Each version independently as
    well. Yeah, it seems like the comparison elected is almost like a git push or
    merge where it shows you the differences. And the for versions.
  persid: ''
- desc: Now let's see what happens when I click Next.
  persid: ''
- desc: Those Americans seem to just voice their radio buttons. Which selecting prior
    now All right.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so it's not Group B to the exclusion of other groups.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's this view. I don't know who said you're seeing something different.
    Do you see this now but I'm hearing as a student All right. I can't. History
  persid: ''
- desc: I can only see I can't see all this. I can't get what I
  persid: ''
- desc: think you're looking at the right. It was acquired. Is that make sense? So
    having said that, I will. I don't know how to reliably get the table of contents
    to come up in the wiki page.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I don't know if I want to make this a group activity or not but let me
    go back to right so let me create a place. Okay, so by entering text inside double
    brackets, that'll create a link so, the read I think it's read I tell like says
    there's a link here. But the file
  persid: ''
- desc: the destination file hasn't been created yet. So if we click on that create
    a page okay, that's far so good. To go. But if we want to create it, think about
    a template for the meetings. So do you want to create a heading for class discussions
    and then everybody add something under that heading
  persid: ''
- desc: for example, okay. Okay, figure that out. Actually, let me test something
    that was a word, okay. So it's a problem with
  persid: ''
- desc: with the last one Okay. Okay, so just to review a little bit. You can see.
    So, it's a representation of all messages that are in the system.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we don't have to go through the wall to find one that is interesting. To
    us
  persid: ''
- desc: then the other things dimension I didn't mean to make this a tough question,
    when asked what the value is, but there's some lack of clarity about that I suppose.
    So. I was thinking why is it useful to go through the process of having conceptualizing
    and as you wish she was marbles
  persid: ''
- desc: because that presents the idea of using like an array instead of the normal
    answering machine we were it's like a queue. So you have to go the first one to
    get to the last one. But in a format you can just take one, two, whatever you
    want.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so I was thinking a bit more generally. I mean that that's a that's
    a specific example of the benefit. But going outside the usual paradigm for voice
    message systems or answering machines so does anyone has anyone seen this example
    also? Does that look great? I wasn't sure if it was three by three or four by
    four the problem has it Yeah. There's this okay. So before you look it up on the
    internet so the challenge is to connect all the dots without lifting your pen
    and use them those four lines Anyone want to take a shot at it? Okay. Someone
    who may not be familiar with it. That's one of the statements on the first statement
  persid: ''
- desc: 123456. Okay, so what we notice about your potential solution is that we didn't
    go outside the boundary of the box. So think
  persid: ''
- desc: outside inside
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. Does that make sense? Okay. So now when people say things outside flies
    you know these that's the box I think of comes up so, in terms of implications
    for modern systems, I thought there's some interesting thinking outside the box.
    That we might use Apple, Apple air tags or tags,
  persid: ''
- desc: some arfid technology. But thinking less specifically about marbles that might
    get lat or arfid things that might get lost or just the issues of managing those
    physical representations, but there could be a web based interface you could see
    messages align for different people. Anyway, bro, the time people are giving me
    the universal signal, we're out of time because they're putting books away and
    eagerly trying to depart so thank you very much for today. have office hours and
    we'll talk about the group stuff on Friday take care
  persid: ''
- desc: I can just imagine like children eating or losing an order no question. For
    the individual project. I was thinking of doing like an HTML page that contain
    the important dates and create a web page it's easier access
  persid: ''
- desc: whether it be a database
  persid: ''
- desc: or a low yet, that was fun to work on. As my project for the ability to track
    your
  persid: ''
- desc: goals. So you want to do it individually that would be my project for the
    project. Oh all right. Right. Okay. Was kind of fighting.
  persid: ''
- desc: Thinking there wasn't.
  persid: ''
- desc: That sounds interesting. Yeah. Okay. You're all cuz you
  persid: ''
- desc: were crashing because the final final be like nine to 12 That'd be like a
    24 hour
  persid: ''
- desc: topic. It's it's a chance to we'll be in here. So it will be I'll give you
    a paper and I'll be invigilating
  persid: ''
- desc: I gotta be like an open because I have another guys that final exams not the
    14th. So I have to choose. If I should say both of them are like my mic as well
    as my practice and I just want to know because I remember do it we did or was
    mechanochemical practice
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so decided essay format that was. past two years online so we can learn
    more. But it won't necessarily. Just because it was done a certain way in the
    past doesn't mean those are the kinds of questions we'll have future in this semester.
    We'll discuss. Thank you. You're welcome. We'll have to see
  persid: ''
- desc: if we can continue
  persid: ''
- desc: so over to you. I'm trying to create a template. And so what I've done so
    far is done all this and I also tried to change it so that the headings like match
    so hopefully the Table of Contents will so much I'm trying to make Oh, never mind.
    I think it's worth trying to make this a paragraph and it was just like okay let
    me just get the one thing I'm gonna say
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks, YouTube.
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks, YouTube.
