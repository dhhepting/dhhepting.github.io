- desc: Okay, so aside from the doors on the main floor of education building between
    AV services or photography and the elevator, are there other ones on campus that
    are problematic? Yes,
  persid: ''
- desc: multipurpose room where it has like the same crowd on both sides have no sort
    of like labeling. And so because people keep on trying to pull it when it's pushed,
    it's like automatically awkward already off balance. Like this way. We keep trying
    to pull it in. So pushing events which Keisha multipurpose room into one of the
    residences it comes to mind
  persid: ''
- desc: or we can think of the on campus.
  persid: ''
- desc: Their College has a string of fire doors that are perched exactly where I
    send everyone
  persid: ''
- desc: there's the doors of the entrance to the building that have just been
  persid: ''
- desc: ordered the last like multiple years and fire exits. Anything think that's
    for us to be? College Ready there's a couple doors that have just been with them
    for multiple years at this point.
  persid: ''
- desc: So are there any interface examples you've come up with? noticed? So people
    are coming late exam will be on paper on Friday. So any any examples of interfaces
    even notice since you've been more sinister?
  persid: ''
- desc: Sure. So it's a laundry machines and solder machine is the Tuesday machines
    and the residents here. You have to add money on the card on like a card or the
    laundry machines and the machine that you put in the money for it doesn't say
    like the interface doesn't tell you to put your credit card in like after like
    looking around for multiple minutes. I saw that they had like an instruction poster
    above the machine that you had to read. So like the machine has instructions on
    it, but at no point when you're trying to have money doesn't help for a credit
    card or debit card. So you're expected to see the post.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's a parking machine at the airport isn't the most secure as well.
    I've noticed. So we can observe lots of examples like that. I think what I want
    I want to bring up that one example I talked about it's in the book and I mentioned
    that
  persid: ''
- desc: let me first Okay, so so if you weren't able to record attendance on Friday,
  persid: ''
- desc: because we had set it up to be minus, minus 40 minutes ahead of time. And
    it still didn't work. Send me a note. I'll fix it.
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's no no password here. So you can use this or go to the link directly
    Okay, can you see that all right. Zoom in a little bit Okay, so this is from 2018.
    So, last week I bought a great new Bluetooth headset then sadly proceeded to spend
    over an hour and a frustrating quest to connect it to my computer
  persid: ''
- desc: does that opening line resonate with anyone? Despite the promises made by
    both a headset manual and the computer support site, the headset did not automatically
    connect to the computer after rereading the instructions, checking to make sure
    both devices were on. scouring the headset reviews to confirm was compatible with
    my computer, and even testing the headset by syncing it to a different computer.
    I was just about ready to give up and then turn the darn thing and return the
    darn thing when I found a random Help page from a completely different hardware
    manufacturer which changed everything. The new Help page showed an actual screenshot
    of what the windows and Bluetooth settings switch looks like when it's turned
    on. Looking at this screenshots and they realized my mistake, the Bluetooth settings
    of the screen I'd be staring at for the past hour was actually showing me that
    the Bluetooth was off on my computer so here's
  persid: ''
- desc: what's okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so how could this be interpreted? So, now we see this is on so it's clearly
    visible design. But how does that one look like? How does that appearance need
    to be touched? On to begin
  persid: ''
- desc: with maybe the thought was like the play button, or the play symbol is showing
    I mean it's not
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so that's one thing. So Bluetooth positions to the right, switches to
    the left. Also most the most pen keyboard at shows then it's connected. So this
    seems to show that it's it's on and it's working. They detected
  persid: ''
- desc: it to throw the device screen click on the plus sign to do that. So this style
    of label response to this interpretation of the bottom
  persid: ''
- desc: right. Because it says click the button to add a Bluetooth device or other
    device.
  persid: ''
- desc: So click this to turn it off so how do how do we address that kind of problem?
    If we're designing this interface, how do we make it better? Avoid this issue
  persid: ''
- desc: so that you can
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: they just have the button hammered on and off on the side to indicate which
    sides off and I'd say gone
  persid: ''
- desc: So they've fixed that for Windows 11 has now turned it off. It says like a
    small message under Bluetooth it says Bluetooth is turned off
  persid: ''
- desc: it also depends on what you're looking at. Here is a quick pop up now and
    Windows. With the quick settings. I feel like I've moved to public quicksave it's
    a completely different point where there's no on or off. I think a little carry
    character will appear on the side that you can put down on this device okay so
    what what kind of metaphor is available to us in this situation? You're in a cave
    sofas license to search
  persid: ''
- desc: so what about a control panel so with the control panel behave this way that
    things that the slaves would change if you're a bank and switches. You change
    them and then the labels also change. I don't think that will happen. If you're
    looking at a console so the console here share this with you after I'll have a
    blinking button to maybe I should do a movie so if we have a light switch unless
    there are multiple switches switches up is on I'm thinking the other day so if
    we're going to play the metaphor of a light switch, you know when you're going
    to include three layer switches. In the interface we have a different kinds of
    switch
  persid: ''
- desc: where it turns green rockets are occupied
  persid: ''
- desc: so we could have some idea of that. So in that case, both alternatives are
    available, so we'd say
  persid: ''
- desc: so maybe, then if we're going to put the label on one side, indicate the state
    of the switch and we can also indicate there's more than one variable and the
    other metaphors we can employ
  persid: ''
- desc: when he learned the structured theory, term closed and open flow switches
    often
  persid: ''
- desc: we think often is like connected causes but it's just the opposite.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah okay. So how about
  persid: ''
- desc: the ones in zero switches that are labeled one and zero. Do understand zero
    is zero as often so one is true. Zero is open
  persid: ''
- desc: that means disconnected.
  persid: ''
- desc: This class I'm taking a course we're doing like tables where we have to deal
    with keys. And he said one is elected T but a productive use for one is it acts
    the same way is one
  persid: ''
- desc: so I tried to make a draw rocker switch there Yeah, so I guess one is true.
    Zero you think abs and oh for on
  persid: ''
- desc: is always good to know for all.
  persid: ''
- desc: So I would say that it's not completely guaranteed that one, we're going to
    press one and everyone's going to understand that it's going to be different so
    what can help? Was your like full picture so you had to say. Oh, wow, thanks.
  persid: ''
- desc: But that's just about you. Don't have to show the race.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, it's all
  persid: ''
- desc: assuming that the user has the ability to read Joy not just hang on to the
    text of the word is the state. So as long as that way, confusion from the bottom
    we're actually telling the user what the state is. So it's a fair environment.
    That the user be able to read these computer we just the global standard.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. So there's consistency issues here. Are we displaying the current state
    or are we displaying the future state if we activate the switch or the control?
  persid: ''
- desc: Of course. I haven't seen this in like a real life thing. But I've seen it
    in games where if you have a button for multiple states more than two it often
    reflects the future state. So is that
  persid: ''
- desc: I think it's a matter of being consistent.
  persid: ''
- desc: Because if we got to this value button for iPhones, I mean if it is silent,
    it shows her at night
  persid: ''
- desc: so where does it show the red
  persid: ''
- desc: line? That's the red line.
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh I never I didn't realize that I just thought if switches down
  persid: ''
- desc: silent so instead of red line i That didn't help me at all, but because then
    I could see that there's a color there but that
  persid: ''
- desc: we just wrote the wording entirely for one and given the current standard
    to show it for Android and most devices. It's
  persid: ''
- desc: just having a lit up button. If you swipe down on top your binary now lit
    up or not and it's not gonna say any words and you know, information you need
    from that. So if
  persid: ''
- desc: that's the standard, that's where the really originated kind
  persid: ''
- desc: of migrated from mobile to computers
  persid: ''
- desc: that I think you should just follow the standard setup and it's the same one
  persid: ''
- desc: all of a sudden disappeared. Too much. Although Apple also has it separated,
    I know on
  persid: ''
- desc: my laptop as well.
  persid: ''
- desc: So Bluetooth and other devices are two separate sections and settings rather
    than having them as one section, which would probably
  persid: ''
- desc: make more sense to make the switch vertical instead of horizontal about this.
    Some cultures really bad because I was gonna say if you read the other way that
  persid: ''
- desc: something's up culture is like
  persid: ''
- desc: so in that case, if you're reading right to left the nice feature of the interface
    would be to read the locale settings and then put so if if we have left to right
    off on that appropriate if we switch the order of labels
  persid: ''
- desc: more confusing someone is like multilingual. The baseline computer settings
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so if we're doing like we should and reading the locale that set up
    on the computer then we should have the best chance to have a meaningful display
    for the person so the question here learning problems with is what are the other
    options so that it says it's on Zenmuse off now or it will be off if I flip switch
    and what are the other possible states for the switch?
  persid: ''
- desc: So that's a little bit of recall versus recognition. Having to recall that
    we want you to switch and see all the options that are available under control
    from the switch. And you can decide by one either on or off. So I'm going to see
    if it's off and I'm going to turn it on so that makes sense. So
  persid: ''
- desc: when you say feedback is the most important thing in this instance, because
    for example like a light switch, no matter how confusing it is, you'll just try
    and see what happens sort of like the feedback, but because of this is more like
    embedded. So maybe some sort of pop up or text messages are important are the
    most important.
  persid: ''
- desc: Oh, it's a little bit like we talked about so far just looking at the interface.
    Some things might become apparent to us if we're doing a walk through interface.
    Some things might be red flags, we notice the red line on the side of an iPhone
    is clear. sort of saying that's clear. But then when people use it. You asked
    about the red line maybe people don't understand that reference, maybe. Experience
    with users is maybe very different than the experience we have to sort of an analysis
    of
  persid: ''
- desc: the interface. So this feedback, the most important thing I'm not sure that
    I would say that but all these things can
  persid: ''
- desc: can help to reinforce the message. And if we have a metaphor that we're applying
    consistently right so they give a metaphor is that we have some description of
    we have some models, some idea of how the thing is operating based on our experience
    with the thing.
  persid: ''
- desc: We're making the connection to so if we've reinforced the metaphor every step
    then then we're conveying the message more clearly. So I want to kind of kick
    off the next design next project piece. And so that's basically
  persid: ''
- desc: start from the needs that we have identified in the first
  persid: ''
- desc: and the understand portion. We wanted to design two different interfaces.
    So first of all, clarify what you're focusing on what aspect of the interface
    you're going to focus on. And then think of two different metaphors. That can
    be used to help people are symbols that some symbols
  persid: ''
- desc: will say yes. So you want to different metaphors, and and then based on those
    metaphors, I want you to sketch two different interfaces that
  persid: ''
- desc: leverage those metaphors. So going from the needs, the unmet needs to the
    interface sketches. So it's okay to include some far out ideas video I think it's
    been a while most of the group from ideal industrial design for was designing
    a cuboid for Gilbert cute. cubicle for Gilbert cat, they went through some foreign
    ideas and it's kind of a fun video. To watch. I'll get the link to that. Any questions?
    Or concerns? So I didn't know the COVID test today and I'm negative understand
    what every shot is. Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: Regarding the forces
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I'll get that sorted out this week. So soon okay. Well have a good resting
    your Wednesday today. exam on Friday, and I'll give you a chance to provide some
    formative feedback as well as I'm collecting feedback Okay, have a good day. Yeah.
    I figured it was bugging sound far as I know so there is a document that you have
    on the center like those types of videos for watching he told me somebody was
    like LEDs and wraparound anytime you probably short about suicidal ideation you
    are doing the job it's pretty easy and when you still stay by studies in English
    it's very disorienting. Did you hear about the show when
  persid: ''
- desc: do you want to know when the lights are that electricity? We had to go to
    like elementary school that later so we did that call so much all the parents
    like that so I think that's all they should have to let me know if you have any
    more information about that thanks. Thanks See you Friday. Hello, hello. Hi. Can
    I scan the QR if you didn't scan that I'm sorry. It's okay. Thank you
  persid: ''
- desc: everyone I just have a good day bro
  persid: ''
- desc: I had one question about the midterm exam four chapters of the reference book.
    So I started start reading that that was so good, but there's so many details
    that was that was somewhat related to
  persid: ''
- desc: so so we talked about in class you can find additional material about our
    classes. Chapter chapters one through four. But it's gonna be focused on what
    we
  persid: ''
- desc: did in class. Oh, I see. I see.
  persid: ''
- desc: Because so I think we came up with a pretty good list of possibilities
  persid: ''
- desc: because that's what's so good because for example, I find a question, for
    example, in the previous midterm, about the correlation between intuition and
    metaphor. And this question was a little bit weird for me, so I didn't find I
    didn't find the answer. Exactly. So I just want to ask, how should we answer for
    example, such questions what do you think? No,
  persid: ''
- desc: I wouldn't give me such questions. I wouldn't give you a question that's not
    grounded.
  persid: ''
- desc: Because because, for example, was previous, you know previous exams for example,
    in 2020 2016, or something like that. So I'm just curious that one, because was
    the all topics covered? All of those terms or those those can be a little bit
    different? With each other?
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, I think going to talk about the same kinds of things, every class but
    the details can be a little different. So if something seems weird to you morning
    anyway, it's not COVID If the rapid engine test is accurate
  persid: ''
- desc: for me was the same action because the weather was getting cold and yeah,
    I saw a lot of people who
  persid: ''
- desc: I think this is killed.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is not working because the time is over.
  persid: ''
- desc: This is not working because the time is over.
