  - msg: well see that's, that's an interface issue as well, because the error messages
      that come up. So basically, so if you're writing template files, so the HTML
      files that get generated based on a template, so that way, you can have it based
      on the data that's on the website. So that's the static site generator. So it
      doesn't use any, it doesn't make any database calls. When, when the website
      is running, so though, when people look for a page, those pages aren't dynamically
      generated, they're all statically generated and then uploaded. But templates
      are a great thing. for consistency. For example, I'm getting error message now.

      trying to think about these ability of this front end to, to track down errors,
      it would be nice to have a facility to generate line numbers. So I could figure
      out where in the code this is coming from. I can take a guess. Then I've been
