      So it's not clear what information is being carried over with a template and
      just how it's being used, for example, whether this sound played when people
      enter the room or not enter or leave the room, pardon me. That's not in the

      have any intuition about how to make it useful. Because it doesn't say save

      So, if you strongly disagree, then you have the others other option of strongly
      agree. And then you can have disagree and agree. So they're both, so those,
      so there are two options on either side of the neutral position. So if we have
      an even number of options, that's how they'll look. So we could have four or

      part, little point, so strongly disagree, disagree. Unsure, agree, strongly
      agree. So those are equidistant. And they're symmetrical. And the choice to
      make is whether or not we want to give people the option of saying unsure. Sounds
      so so as to say, sit on the fence not lean one way or the other. So it's useful
      because we have a way to quantify reaction so. I mean, they have their own views.

      is, question is I then where do we push or do we pull the door to open it? And
