      and not think about cars, but think about, like the Lamborghini sports car.
      And not and not transfer ideas about cars that say, you know, that have four

      in an efficient manner? Is it clear what needs to be done? Are the gaps of the
      goals of execution and evaluation? Are these smaller or large. So if they're
      small, then then that's a sign the things are usable. The so you may have the
      issue where things are usable, but they're not particularly fun to, to work

      interface and applying the ideas we've discussed in class, then it's harder
      to cheat. And so I think we can have a bit more flexibility that way. That's

      might

      verbalize what they're that they verbalize what they're going through in terms
      of their thought process. And this may feel a little bit I say. So this might
      change the results that we get from just by having the people do things the
      way they do them, instead of having to describe them, because that might make
      things they might do things differently as they're describing them or thinking
      about them, in order to describe them, and they may not describe them, exactly
      the way they would do them.

      And they're probably going to be more related as we're doing things for ourselves.
      If we're talking about ourselves, as the user being with whom we're trying to
      gain some empathy. But even for ourselves, there might be some we might expose
      some things by code to the process and talking through it and thinking about
      it. And verbalizing questions and concerns we have and we might get some more
      insight anyway.

      I would say that maybe some things appear under says, or maybe some things appear
      under thinks. And it's less important to think, to get classified in the proper
      quadrant, but to record them in a way that lets us have more empathy for what
      the user is going through.
