      goals of execution and evaluation? Are these smaller or large. So if they're

      change the results that we get from just by having the people do things the
      way they do them, instead of having to describe them, because that might make
      things they might do things differently as they're describing them or thinking
      about them, in order to describe them, and they may not describe them, exactly
      the way they would do them.

      If we're talking about ourselves, as the user being with whom we're trying to
      gain some empathy. But even for ourselves, there might be some we might expose
      some things by code to the process and talking through it and thinking about

      quadrant, but to record them in a way that lets us have more empathy for what
