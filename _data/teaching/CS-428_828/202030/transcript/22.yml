  - msg: Hello, sir. Hi. Hi, I have a question regarding today's assignment. Like
      in the assignment, you said we need to discuss about unmet needs about the topics
      that you have linked on the website. But I was just wondering, is it like, should
      we give you design issues on the website that we are we feel that is not appropriate
      or unmet? Or should it be related to the topics that you mentioned and the topics
      we are covering in class?

11h34:

  - msg: So it's about the use of the topics and whether they're their unmet needs
      compared to the use of the topics in the assignments and the notes and and the
      meetings
    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: Okay, so we should just put example we choose a topic like empathy map. And
      then the know that we discussed it well in the class and then we had it in our
      assignment and then we had it like pretty much everywhere. So that is a topic
      that has been well meant. So we choose another topic and do the same analysis.
      Is that what you mean?
    persid: Unknown

      done this. And I've been trying to find a way to make a stronger connection
      between the topics from the curriculum. You can see here and and how they're
      presented. And if they know they're taught to talk about in a meeting, actually
      used in the assignment and so on.

    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: So, what are like, based on the topics and like, I went through the project,
      like Assignment Description. And what I did was I went through the topic section,
      and whatever was the design issues and the topics, and the design issues in
      the website is what I mentioned in the assignment. So that is not right. So
      we need to do it like this, right? Because even the design issues in the website
      is I feel that they are like unmet needs or the problems that I find on the
      website. I don't mean it's unmet needs in terms of topics. But yeah, I was just
      wondering if that is right, or should I change my whole assignment?
    persid: Unknown

      at in your assignment,
    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: for example, and the topic section. There is no specific mention about empathy
      maps. But we discussed about empathy maps, I did not find anything specific
      to empathy maps and all the topics I went through the topics. Yeah, so I was
      just wondering like, if at all, we are covering it so strongly in our class,
      it should be incorporated in the topics to to have a better connection. That
      is one. And the other one was all related to the design issues. Like for example,
      if we maximize

    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: Yeah, but yeah, not too long. But if at all, I open all the sections and
      I want to go back to the top section to identify what is the one that I saw
      in the first part, and you just scroll back a lot. And then if I open three
      at a time and close the second one, the third one just pops right beside the
      second one. It's not like one below the other like how it is, but the other
      ones. Yeah, just open another two and try closing the second one.

  - msg: So it's like
    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: the ones that are close it like in the first look of that it's like hate
      ci design integration or, like, I need to have a cleaner look of what is the
      topic that's been discussed beneath that, because we have two headings as of
      like, it looks like we have two headings to the same topic. So I need to go
      into the topics I need to look okay, this is programming interface systems,
      it I can track the ERP system. So I need to have a clear idea of what it is.
      Because I need to be clear on what it is. Yeah. So is it fine if we do it like
      that? Or is there I think
    persid: Unknown
  - msg: that's, that's reasonable.
    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: Yeah. So there are a few issues are related to those. So I was just wondering
      if I should change the assignment, or is that good enough to go through?

      So they're the reason there's supposed to be was supposed to be a curriculum
      ces 2020. Coming out, but that's been delayed for? I'm not sure. Well, certainly
      COVID has an impact on schedules, but I'm not sure even for for COVID how things
      are progressing. So. So this is the quickest computer science curriculum from
      2013. So that was published at the end of 2013. So it's not, it's not it's probably
      finalized, or quite finalized by sometime much earlier than that.
    persid: Daryl Hepting
11h42:

  talks:
  - msg: They don't change very much. But on the other hand, some concepts and some
      vocabularies. Man, some of those, some of the terms that we use may change quite
      rapidly. And so if it's less so, from 2019, might be a bit of a stretch for
      some things. Melo in 2013. So there are some limitations with the the curriculum,
      as its laid out here in terms of knowledge areas and knowledge units, and topics
      within those.
    persid: Daryl Hepting
11h44:
  chats: []
  talks:
  - msg: So yeah, that makes sense. So overall, to summarize it, what is that? Like?
      I'm going to discuss few issues in topics like one or two issues and topics,
      and what are some two or three issues in the design that I find? And I'll just
      compile it into a report. So that should be good enough for this assignment,
      right.

      you really have a third one that's related and you want to, and you want to

      these points and ideas and the sketches? I actually went part of the three days,
      like three pages one, you said the target is one to three pages, I ended up
      having four pages. So should I cut it short? Should I cut short?

      Yes, that's exactly as in my question as well, cause markers seem to be keen

      is just so I say one to three pages. I don't mean 10 to 30 pages. All right.
      I want to get the ballpark right. So if you're if you're generating 10 or 15
      pages, maybe too much, slightly too much. But if you have four pages and I'm
      not sure what
    persid: Daryl Hepting
11h50:

  talks:
  - msg: What the better languages to describe that?
    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: That's because of the scatters mostly because when we are scattering, we
      definitely will go beyond two pages for the scattered and if we add a bit of
      explanation, so particularly, these are two ideas and few discussion. So if
      it was only the written part, we can take you two or three, but with the sketches,
      you know, it will take space like beyond three.
    persid: Unknown
  - msg: Okay, so what's, what's a better word? Should I not have a target in there
      at all? Should I take out that line?
    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: No, I think we are good with that. For I think that will be enough. But as
      my follow has already mentioned, the last time it was like, one page description,
      one page explanation for this, and if it was like, almost one, and for example,
      four or five lines less than one page, the marker said, okay, it was not one
      page completely. So I am going to deduct this much marks and I was like, Oh,
      I had to type in few more spaces and few more sentences, just to fill in the
      page.

      though, I think it will be better if we can ask the questions in the next class.

      is really not my decision. So I'm curious what kind of known security vulnerabilities
      there are. I thought I used to have had a different, more recent version of
      jQuery. What's the latest version of jQuery? Anyone know offhand?

      So I mean, you have to know a little bit about how the website or what, what
      things are being used and so forth on the website to make good use of this information,
      as it still still might be useful. Even in a casual way. Let me go back here
