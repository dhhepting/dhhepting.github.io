      a handle. So they put the sign over there. Like, rather than pulling, you should
      push. So rather than proving their design, they put a passage over there for

      concerned about stampeding purposes. And there's like regulations for like,

      predated the name of the building, so it's

      how to work with a bad design. And that reflects positively on us. Or maybe
      it's a badge of honor to be able to, to operate a certain difficult control
      or interface. Rather than saying, No, that's a design issue. And that we shouldn't,
      we shouldn't demand better designs. Because we can figure them out. And in terms
      of the designers or the builders, or the programmers who create software or
      physical devices, if they're not considered if they're not taking the user into
      account in a meaningful way, then

  - msg: sorry, I got off track. So anyway, getting back to the idea of invisibility,
      whether the door is invisible or now another example is hammering nails, and
      you're you're hammering a nail smoothly not bending at you not hitting your
      fingers and you know the tooth the tool the hammer disappears. In a sense it
      becomes invisible. Once you hit your thumb or you get a bent nail or anything
      out of the ordinary then the tool becomes present. And especially hit your thumb
      then that sensation of frustration of bending the nail. So a lot

      use the hammer before I'm kidding, I'm kidding a little bit, because now they
      have these Brad nailers that work with an air compressor. So that the prevalence
      of hammers and nails is decreasing a bit anyway, as much as typewriters, and

  - msg: so forth a door to be invisible, to hear the example of when you need to
      push this a flat plate on one side. So that's clear. So you don't even realize
      that you're opening it. So it's clear that the door affords pushing, pushing
      open when there's a flat plate, so we could talk about the idea of affordances.
      So, when the action is clear, action supported by the interface or feature the
      command available through the interface is clear. And then, and then you can
      think about those as affordances, if

  - msg: On the topic of hammers, it's not like you can do anything about the risk
      of bending a nail. A nail has to have that design to be able to hold the object
      together once nailed in, and the hammer has to have that ability to project
      force onto the nail.

      to a UI. And for doors, I think it should be MUCH lower than a hammer and nail.

      when I bend, given bend a nail for it goes straight in. Before it's all the
      way in. I'm, I think that is user error on my part. Because I haven't hit a
      prop straight or something else. So it's interesting to think that. So I've
      been thinking about people not accepting support interfaces, but then I didn't
      even question that is our nail interface. This is a way to, to improve it, so
      that the experience is more positive for more

      time today. So by Tuesday, I either have groups made up or be ready to be put
      into a group. Okay, and I just think about interfaces in those ways, using the
      heuristics that we've discussed and applied today. If you have notes from your
      breakout room that you can share with me, you can send them by email or post
      them to the forum in your courses. Okay. Thanks a lot. Have a great weekend.
      Sorry for keeping you longer today. Take care, they will.
