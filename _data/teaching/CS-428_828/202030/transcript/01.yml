  - msg: Let me just if you're looking at my website on desktop, it's it's not very
      pretty. It looks like a bunch of lines. The headings are are not arranged nicely,
      they just go from top to bottom. But this is designed so I'm thinking about
      you having your phone with you. So here are the meeting site. You can you can
      click to get to different meetings. And the title of the meeting is the date
      for a meeting. So our next meeting is Tuesday, September. And then so on and
      so forth. So we're meeting 26 times.
