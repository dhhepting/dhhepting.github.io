      So it took me a while to send out the invitation today because I realized, I
      thought yesterday, nobody sent me an email with helping me to give us a sign
      there to connect to email these to use to register for the meeting to the one
      that I have for you in groups. So I thought, well, that's too bad, I should
      ask again more politely perhaps. But then I thought I'll look at a list of the
      previous registrations. So I, I found a few names there. So I had the list of
      previous registrations with names.

      list has the names not just emails. So look up the name with the email address,
      find out which group and then I add a line and the other spreadsheet with group
