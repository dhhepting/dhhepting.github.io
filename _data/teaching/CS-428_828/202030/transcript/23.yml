      fidelity prototype, a and b. So after that, what we need to do like we need

      two prototypes, interface a and an interface to the prototype, which are paper

      Create a single interface design combines the best ideas from your to Lofa low

      you just explained that we need to make a final prototype interface I mean,

      need to give two final outputs, right? an interface a final output an interface
      B final output?

12h35:

      a design and your experience with the project in general.
    persid: Daryl Hepting
  - msg: Okay, you need not be dependent on the metaphors that we used in Project
      two. Like we did two different metaphors in Project two. So I was just wondering
      if you're, we need to improve that.
    persid: Unknown
  - msg: Okay, so the idea is, so your interface, your low fidelity prototypes are
      based on the metaphors that you selected. So you're creating so as part of the
      second project, installment you're, you have two metaphors that you're exploring
      in a low fidelity In sketches of the interface and the prototype. So a way to
      think about the testing that's going on in this third installment, excuse me
      is to think about which are the which prototype, which metaphor, better suits
      the activity
    persid: Daryl Hepting
12h36:

  - msg: it says one best version
    persid: S03
  talks:
  - msg: that you're presenting. Which of the two metaphors is better at conveying
      the aspect to the interface to your participants. So that's one source of data.
      But you might also realize in the process of doing the testing, so the comments
      that are made, you might. And I'm not saying that this essay has to be that,
      that you have to discover something in this way. But you might say that, well,
      based on the feedback we got, we realized that the interface protocol, or interface
      design should have something to

      something like that. So it's not strictly just from your testing of the two
      low fidelity prototypes, based on YouTube metaphors. That's not the only source
      of data of you insight for your final interface design. So instead of finalizing
      the two different metaphors are going, I'm asking you to create a single design
      that takes the best ideas from both of those low fidelity prototypes. And your
      other experience related
