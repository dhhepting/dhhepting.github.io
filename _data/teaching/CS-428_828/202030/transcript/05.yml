      legitimate, so it should take that as an input. And the second thing is like
      I knew everybody, almost no 60 minutes in one hour, but San Dimas, somebody
      is following a recipe that says like he should make for a cook for 60 minutes
      altogether. So I think they must have the layers to exactly go with that and
      not to get confused why it's not taking another

  - msg: Yeah. Yeah, my thought is if it had, it's the blinking the air. So it seems
      to understand how to convert 60 minutes to one hour but then it tells me an

      aggressive response. Well, you entered it wrong but I'll correct it for you.
