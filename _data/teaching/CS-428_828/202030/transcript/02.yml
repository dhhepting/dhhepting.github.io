      it's possibly helpful. But that's not my reason for recording. My reason for
      recording is the audio and the automatic Transcript generation.

  chats:

  talks:
  - msg: Although the documentation says the transcript will be ready shortly after
      the video is ready, but in my case, the test I did on Thursday and Friday. It
      was a long time hours. So maybe we can expect to see the track transcript of
      our of the audio. Tomorrow, sometime so when we have the transcript of the audio,
      it might be helpful. It couldn't transcript on the transcript to the audio that
      might help to give context to chat. So you can see when things are going on.

      a feature

      don't have this is something to think about. Well, I could increase the usefulness
      of this in terms of the timestamps. So would it be helpful to have

      in optimizing
    persid: S15
  tags: []
  talks:
  - msg: So instead of suggestion is instead of time stamps the question prompted
      the responses. I think that's a worthy, worthy goal, to be able to have that
      It's a little bit hard to do.
    persid: DHH
11h55:
  chats:
  - msg: I think having the time is still important, cuz then you can go and get the
      context within the video and see if something is missing.
    persid: S16
  - msg: It feels like some are close together, could group close ones together since
      they will be on similar topics. Like group ones that are 2 or less minutes apart
      maybe. Though they open easy so we can infer that ourselves as well. If the
      questions grouping are easy to implement I support that option as well that's
      helpful for context.
    persid: S10
  - msg: it will be complex to have the topic from the audio. but if questions were
      put in chat, that the convenient way
    persid: S01
  tags: []
  talks:
  - msg: So I'm going to gonna hope that the transcript will help that provide that
      context. So the reason I didn't include seconds in the in the timestamp was
      to group common sense Same time.
    persid: DHH
11h56:

  chats:
  - msg: Oh sorry I did not mean to include SS . I mean to have it in standard time
      format like HH:MM
    persid: S07
  - msg: Maye we can change the way we formulate the question in the chat, students
      can take the extra effort of using Q1) and then post it, people can answer or

11h59:
  chats:

    persid: DHH
  - msg: What I think is it might be very difficult to track question numbers for
      students, sometimes we end up mentioning wrong question number and it can introduce
      challenges for the person who is referring the chat later
    persid: S14

      a delay in the chat. Now just coming up on the chat are chat is an asynchronous
      communication form here because you can have that one and that's both a positive
      and a negative because we have to try and put things back together in terms

      you can answer the first question. And maybe you start to talk about the first
      question before in more than one message before you get to question two. And

      format the audio transcript in, in a way similar to the to the chat transcript.
      I have a suspicion though. The timestamp in the video is from the beginning
      of the recording notch. Not not the time of day that is being used in the chat.
      So, there might be an issue of synchronizing that although you think this is

      say that there's more to march working. There's more to it than just working.
      So working is the is the bottom rung on the list. So first of all, you can you're
      caught so that's the question is can you accomplish a given task with a website?
      And if you can answer yes. So then he might say that it's effective.
