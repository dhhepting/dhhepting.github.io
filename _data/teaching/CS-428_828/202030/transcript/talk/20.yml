      that was the first time we made a sketch like the low fidelity
      prototype. And when we analyzed it, and we have to, like add the
      improvements. So the low fidelity prototype the sketch itself,

      What I just add here is let me show you what I'm looking at.
      I want to add a line here, let's say or a sentence that says

11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I can spell that properly.
      Okay, so does that match up with the rubric then so I in the
      rubric, I said, iteration process description. And then the
      third part is analyze, and finally describe the results of this
      iteration process. Those things match up.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      All right. So they're on doing okay with ideas, metaphors and
      how they can influence the interface. So I know there's some
      discussion about whether we do an empathy map as a visual
      representation, or is the list so let's think about an empathy
      map is a list. And well, then it's not so much a map as a list.
      So an empathy list or a map which is more visual. So what are
      the characteristics that we gained from doing a visual map was
      the fourth four quadrants
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so there's a chat comment here about. So he described the
      final iteration and changes that were implemented collectively.
      So if you've so long as you indicated the, the process the
      process that you followed, say, whereas you began with something
      more like
      to Ghana was this and changed into that. So you don't need to
      align and in depth each, each individual change, but the idea of
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      things that things that came up in the metaphor, though, weren't
      clear that are made work here, and so on. Does that help?
      clarify that? Honey?
      Okay.
      So, so if we talk about a list versus a map, what are the things
      that are implied? With each
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so I have a list of things. tendency to think that there may be
      in sequence
      or somehow ordered. So I'm taking Have a look at Google Maps,
      for example. So you can have a map view and you can have a list
      view of the direction.
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the steps,
      steps in a in the list of directions might be confusing if we
      miss a step or we don't do them in order. So that's an example
      of where they might be sequential. Or, well, we'll get lost if
      we don't follow them in sequence.
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, I just realized I did that privately to somebody.
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Let me copy the other ones. So now this isn't sequential. So I
      started out with asking a question about what's the difference
      between a list and a versus a map might be. So lists might be
      sequential or ordered, or map view as we get to. We don't we
      don't have the temporal dimension. So much so. So present, we
      just see things laid out and we can move them around. Or you can
      see relations between them. Whereas in less, we may have trouble
      making associations between
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      between if we have four lists for each quadrant, then we might
      have might be more difficult to make associations between each
      of those four lists are a sub list for the for the different
      quadrants.
      So right and empathy map does need to be sequential. That is
      addressing a common for a few people who thought that making
      lists were what was more more convenient.
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Because there's ability to put more detail into the
      into the list items. So right, so you can see that the list is
      more variable, or it's more prompt more
      is afford writing, maybe more than we need to write. But if we
      do if we put a if we think about sticky notes on on the map, and
      it's
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      it encourages us to be more concise perhaps and that way.
      express the idea with and fewer words.
      Okay, so does that make sense? I mean, that sort of
      conversation.
      So
      I want to go back to the zoom window here.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, let's switch to this view.
12h13:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so now you can see the zoom meeting.
      window. This is the web interface.
      Now I know that if I click on my picture, I get to my home
      screen. So I don't think I'm showing anything terrible here.
      Let's let's think about so this is my account and I can see
      meetings, webinars, recordings, settings, account profile and
      reports. So what kind of metaphor is being used with this
      interface?
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Is any metaphor come to mind? just you know, in terms of looking
      at these headings, meetings, webinars, recordings, settings,
      account profile and reports.
      Okay, so conference
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      conferences, can you save more of a conference in metaphor?
      So I think about conference in a couple of ways, so we might
      happen. And conference might be a meeting. Or we could take a
      lot of conferences like a gathering of many people, and then
      have different meetings within that conference, or different
      presentations or different session.
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So then, if I was looking at a conference Planning Guide for in
      the second case, then I might decide which sessions I'd like to
      attend which meetings I'd like to attend.
      And then make up a schedule.
      So if if I have a digital assistant as a metaphor, maybe that's
      that fits in with the scheduling
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      scheduling process. So what are we scheduling? scheduling
      meetings? To schedule a recording outside of meetings? Or do
      Andouille generate reports outside of meetings?
      Okay.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I think we decided webinars is an advanced feature. So it's
      really not available to us right now. So we just click on that
      to make sure webinars whatsoever. What is webinar? How is
      webinar enabled? I like how do I start? So that's not not
      something that's available.
      So it's, it's good for them to have it
      visible here so people can ask what it is. So they know it's an
      option. If they get it.
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      It's an option for them to add on to their service. Now, if you
      look at meetings, we think about meetings
      and then recordings.
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So they're up in the meeting, the recordings are all tied to
      meetings, and reports.
      So these are all related to meetings as well. So what would be
      an alternative way to organize this an alternative way to
      present to convey the information that recordings and reports
      are part of are attached to meetings?
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if I look at previous meetings, so meeting 19 was the midterm
      exam. That's why there's no we will go from 22 dates back to 18,
      two weeks ago. 17 and 16
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the confusing thing for me is, if we schedule a meeting for a
      particular time,
      you know to say that it's going to take place on October 27. At
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      30am.
      It doesn't show how long it is.
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      But then it also lets me start this meeting again. Even though
      it's not a recurring meeting, I can still start the meeting.
      Again.
      So to me these
      these characteristics aren't the choices that I have? are, are
      not consistent. So if I'm scheduling a one time meeting, say for
      October 27. At 1130 was when we had meetings 16.
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      And how does it make sense to start restart that anytime?
      So I understand the recurring meeting. idea.
      Go back here to
      although I don't see the recurring the I've had office hours all
      semester, so I'm not sure when why they haven't appeared.
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      Why don't see office salaries in the list of past meetings.
      Let's look at how this is set up.
      So this is just the link that I use for all showers. So there's
      no particular time.
      Because there's no way to specify Tuesdays and Thursdays two to
      3pm and Wednesdays 11 to noon,
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      about live streaming.
      So that question makes sense, in terms of this interface. So
      there seem to be seven consistencies as far as I can see, in
      terms of carrying through the metaphor.
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      meetings of conferences so we can have these different sessions,
      different meetings.
      So what are some ways to improve the metaphor? To make it more
      consistent? Right? And so let's the trade off when we're talking
      about metaphors. If we make it very general, what's what's the
      downside?
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      Are we good to General, then we may not be getting conveying the
      information we want to convey about the metaphor. The metaphor
      we're trying to the metaphor we're trying to establish is it has
      the goal of influencing how the users mental model of the
      interface will work. So if they're familiar with the metaphor,
      and they can take pieces from the metaphor and apply them in the
      interface.
      Alright, so if we make it too general, then we may not be
      clearly indicating what are the specific things we'd like to
      convey to the user? And what if I make it too specific?

      Did you like the name and save the picture of the Lamborghini

      website and I give reference to the website, right? I got it
      from
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      right. So if, if we provide a metaphor, a metaphor, or free,
      say, we're not just driving a car or driving a sports car, an
      Italian sports car, then things we are trying to convey with
      that metaphor. It's like driving a Lamborghini. People may not
      have experienced driving a Lamborghini or they might think
      triangle only driving sports cars. So we have to watch out for
      potholes. Because there's no clearance or
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      we may not get the
      we may be too constrained by thinking about one particular kind
      of car. So that we can generalize enough to the point where
      we're dealing with generalize the ideas that we're trying to
      transfer to the new interface. That makes sense.
      Okay, so we got a few minutes left. So how about Do the breakout
      rooms. And you can either talk about your project or two. Or,
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: 11
    msg: >-
      or if you're not, if you're on the same page with that you can
      think about what improvements you might make to the zoom
      interface that would.
      So we would improve the zoom interface you could make by
      thinking about a more helpful metaphor or creating or using the
      metaphor more consistently. So
