      you.
      Okay. My role is as a student here.
      So you can send me an email. That's such a earth shattering
      thing, but it gets it has a subject. So they'll give me a
      consistent subject. So that'll relieve the burden of giving a
      subject for you. So the syllabus schedule.

      So the interesting thing, quote unquote, zoom office link, is
      that zoom meetings, asked for times to be scheduled and for
      length of time to be scheduled. But they don't respect that. So
      class meetings can be reconvened afterwards, or if I did make
      the office hour for Tuesday, at two to three, it had to be
      recurring.
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      It wouldn't just restrict to that time. You could open that
      office hour anytime.
      So this zoom link zoom office link is for office hours. So if
      you want to talk to me outside of office hours, you can arrange
      a three an appointment.
      Okay, requiring subscription discussions. So
      those are things this is a forum to which you're subscribed
      automatically. And that's where I'm posting the zoom meeting
      stuff, to meeting links.

      Okay, so this is the advanced feature here. I can send forum
      post notifications with no editing time delay. Sir just so We
      talked about trade offs is that a trade off? Is this a
      worthwhile trade off to to hide one button? To make me click one

      p No. p. p Yes.
      You don't have to fill in all the blanks if you can see not from
      here. Aggressive,
      straight progressive disclosure. So the idea is that we hide
      some material that we don't need immediately.
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And then the other part of that is
      poor, but that's one of them.
      So if there's more, if there are advanced controls. So the way
      this works now, it's it's an example of my pet peeve about how
      you click on something and then you don't know where exactly
      you've you you've been taken. In the case of the forum. I know
      that to get the I know that there's this feature that says post
      immediately. And because I don't see it right away, I click on
      Advanced and I can then see it. But I don't know what else is an
      advanced feature. Do you understand that?
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So we think of the heuristics, right. It talks about having an
      undo or redo command available
      in some ways
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So we can have the microphone. I'm gonna just do this for
      everybody. By default, mute mute.
      I don't know where that is now.
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so everybody else is muted, but me. So that that's
      probably good practice. So you don't have your background sounds
      from your location. When you're just listening to the
      conversation are when you're not speaking, it's better so you
      can unmute yourself when you're speaking. But by default, have
      the microphone muted.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So would you say that progressive disclosure by indicating that
      there's more material there, and then being able to hide it
      again is like having and then
      having an undo or redo button, I think that that connection is
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      is appropriate.
      Oh, wow. So my group zoom group chat was hidden under the
      participant, windows here. And I see I have 14 new messages. So
      I thought nobody was responding because it wasn't updating. But
      it just says, oh, as more messages
      started typing, you can type your answers
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      okay.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      The conversation is somebody turn your microphone on and tell
      them that I'm cheering around the stream with you.
      So So what's your experience about being in this zoom
      environment compared to a regular class?
12h13:
  talks:

    msg: >-
      To try and add a question quickly.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So my feeling about zoom and I don't know what extent you get
      this is that it doesn't manage windows very well. Because if I
      want to create a poll,
      then I've got a bunch of different windows going on here. And
      they're overlapping and
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      Okay, so I'm gonna ask you for your, the one that you like best

      I'm going to take a screenshot of my computer here. See, I'll
      put it into
      into the media file so you can see a little bit about how I'm
      experiencing the zoom here. So here's the poll getting launched.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, wait for another, they're always told another 30 seconds
      now close the poll to people like face to face better. I like
      that better too, because

      just talking to my computer screen is not the most

      Okay, so for groups. For the project assignment. I'd like to I
      believe we have 48 participants in class. So okay, this morning
      before class. So we can have about

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I guess, it would be 12 groups of four or you can have some
      groups of three. Is there a question about groups of two, and
      I'm not keen on that.
      So I'd rather make a groups of four groups of three. So if you
      have a group already, send me an email with the names of the
      group members. And then I'll make it up today. And then we'll
      start

12h28:

      groups of three or four.
12h29:

    msg: >-
      So forming groups, this is an age old problem.
      And some people want to have their own people in their own
      groups. And then not everybody wants to have them or notice
      people. So last winter, I tried the approach of making everybody
      equally unhappy by making groups randomly. And then that still
      isn't a perfect solution.
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So anyway, about forming groups, and I'm I'm open to suggestions
      and taking me a bit longer to put our did not put together the
      your courses quiz that we discussed last week. So I'll do that.
      I'll try and get that done today. So we can pull it out there
      and then use that as the basis of,
      of assessing groups that are formed or to form ones that need to
      be formed. Okay, so regarding the gap and Breakout Room
      discussion on On Thursday
12h32:

      Okay, so have a try a breakout room thing again and I'll make as

      about maybe having a picture doesn't have to be a self portrait
      or photorealistic self portrait is a representative picture that
      you can add on. Zoom for your face, your public identity instead
      of the name. Or if you want to put the cat camera on, you can do
      that as well. Anyway, and I have an office hour too. So I'll be
