      Good morning.

      So the Sorry, I'm just reading something now. And my camera
      covered, sorry.
      So it took me a while to send out the invitation today because I
      realized, I thought yesterday, nobody sent me an email with
      helping me to give us a sign there to connect to email these to
      use to register for the meeting to the one that I have for you
      in groups. So I thought, well, that's too bad, I should ask
      again more politely perhaps. But then I thought I'll look at a
      list of the previous registrations. So I, I found a few names
      there. So I had the list of previous registrations with names.
11h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And then I had another screen with a list of group members. And
      then a third one with a spreadsheet. So the spreadsheet for the
      breakout groups is just
      is just to call on the breaker room and email address.
11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I think, so far, so good, I've got everybody in their
      breakout rooms.
      It's just a long process to go through that. Because I have to
      click on one spreadsheet to select the email address. And I have
      to look up the registration list has the names not just emails.
      So look up the name with the email address, find out which group
      and then I add a line and the other spreadsheet with group and
      new email address. So I have more than
11h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      more than three or four group members in the spreadsheet, but
      you should only be signing in with one name with one email
      address so the fact that you have more than one email address
      shouldn't be a problem.
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Doesn't matter which email you use this list to do get into the
      proper group.
      Okay, so
      nobody's unassigned.
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      All right, 1359 1012 1314 1618 1920.
      Okay, so I see that the maker room that
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      instead of having a category of unassigned people on the Reiko
      room screen. So, I added a copy of
      the breakout room screen.
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So this is a picture that I posted yet last day. I've taken the
      names out, but you can sort of see the structure of recurrence
      screen. So it's not it's not being added there. The people who
      aren't assigned, I can't see them on the breakout room screen.
      So I have to go to
      church share the screen here.
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      So this is the URL courses. I think you can see that it looks
      like you can see it. So I've added a link here. The top one is
      the project group list under the project so you can see who's
      supposed to be in every group.
      Okay, so based on that, let's see if we can add the other people
      into the project group into the breakout rooms.
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I have to arrange just so they can see both things here.
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I can't I just
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      see can't see much of this can you
      I'm not sure how to do it better.
11h46:

    msg: >-
      Project
11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I think I've got everybody into their rooms now.
11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So here you see the screen that has the group list on it. Let me
      show you the
      Hello. Yeah.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Hello, how are you? Sorry just so the, the email was it
      was a little bit busy but I'm fine.
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so there's Let's talk later Okay.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Okay, your recording is right. Yeah.
      Okay. Okay, so you will send it to me. Yeah, I will. Okay, thank
      you very much.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Thank you to the movie right
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so now you can see this. This is from the registration. So
      it gives me the name, email addresses, timely registered and
      then approved because everyone gets approved. So there's that.
      And then let me show you the other screen.
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it's sharing it but it didn't bring it up. didn't make it the
      top window here. So I have the project group rooms and then the
      email addresses. So I have to go through from the first
      spreadsheet to the group list to the breakout room list.
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So now I've got more participants see if I can.
11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I think I'll see whether it comes up on the video. But so on,
      if you remember that waiting room stuff that would give me a
      message to say there are people who are in the waiting room. And
      then I could let you in. But what I notice here is that people
      who join but aren't, their email isn't on that list. That second
      spreadsheet I showed you. And that means that I don't know that
      they've arrived. So let me see if I can
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      figure out who the new people are
      underneath all the windows
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay,
      so got people into their groups now, I think.
      So what do you say about making things easier for me? And
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so Can everyone who wants to use a different email address or
      addresses?
      register for zoom? Send me an email
      with your project group.
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I know they're kind of making this up as we go along.
      It seems to me that
      seems to me that it doesn't shouldn't have to make up the
      spreadsheet beforehand and loaded when the meeting is defined. I
      should be able to do that now.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And there's a few other deficiencies noticed here.
      So if I'm looking at the activity of
      making sure that everybody's in there with the groups for the
      breakout rooms so I'd like to know
      like to know when there are People aren't assigned to a breakout
      room. So I could assign them
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      or, or get an email address from people from the city from the
      sign on, so they could update my spreadsheet so that I could do
      this without.
      So it's working, it works a lot better today.
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      There's still some people who aren't on the list.
      Okay. So I wanted to show you
      your courses page.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I guess you're seeing that now. So that's the group group
      list.
      So here is the assignment for the Chris project. So there's a
      description discussion link. And then this is resubmitted. And
      because you're in groups, you can give some feedback about your
      group. And then
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      you know, you can see what your group has rated you. So under
      rate your group.
      So if everyone contributes equally just you get added points
      need divided amongst yourselves equally. And if you'd like to
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      be something different than you can.
      You can call it you can make a comment well see? So I won't go
      through the whole deep of the details of this, but you can look
      at it. And if you have any questions, let me know
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      All right. So
      So I'd like to think about new groups. Today is look at the
      activity of in your breakout rooms. Look at the rubric for the
      first group assignment. And
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and let me know how that goes. That makes sense. So the activity
      would be to
      cat trying to get into the room. So the activity would be, I
      don't think he can hear that scratching noise.
      That's pretty serious. Now they're starting to now. Anyway. So
      if you look at the activity as an activity of finding out what
      what the rubric for the first group assignment is, first project
      assignment. And then
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and then think about that in terms of what I'm asking for the
      group assignment, as an example of
      empathizing with the user with that activity. So there might be
      different ways to get to the assignment description. That's on
      my web page. And so there might be some other issues. I haven't
      considered that. That's what I'd like you to think about. Okay,
      so I'm going to start the groups.
      Here we go.
