      Hello, professor. Good morning. Good morning.
      Okay.
      So I'll write this in the chat as well.

      Sure. We have three submission today. Yeah, I'm just it's not
      three. Yeah. Ah, I didn't just project to make, right. Because I
      saw the method, contract box and someone write this. Yeah, I'm
      just gonna explain it. Okay. I'm typing it typing out my
      explanation as well. Okay, so thank you. You're welcome.

      So, the assignment project Part one is due today. There are a
      couple other things you can. You'll notice there, there's a
      retreat group and then The seer group's ratings have you reading
      Have you? So I'll explain that in a second.
11h34:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, sorry, I'm not. Some days I'm not a very quick typer.
      typist. And now what I'm trying to talk and type at the same
      time. Anyway, so that's, that's what we're where we're at with.
      That's my reply to the three things. So I'll go to your courses
      in a second here.

      Yes, it does.

      Okay. All right. So
      the students so you can see that, so you see it with online or
      you'll see on yours.
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so there's three assignments. There are three labeled as
      assignments. So submit is where you would submit the assignment.
      Reach your group is the opportunity to get feedback about how
      you're how you're working with your group. I realize you don't
      have my video on my camera's not uncovered.
11h37:

      So are he group so that you get 100 points. And you can
      disappear if you distribute them equally amongst your groups,
      and everybody, and everybody is doing their job, but if you
      think that somebody is not doing their job, you can send a
      message to me and to your group members by giving them less than
      an equal share of 100 points. So let's go through and the CEA
      groups rating is not a place for you to submit something because
      that's where the results will appear in in your courses. Just
      giving Get a place to appear for you in the
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      in the in the grand scheme of things so you can press three to
      look at them if that makes sense. So Raichu group
      so this is an online text
      and then I have a link there for group policy so I haven't This
      is older don't have a card background
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      very nice as of that program to take over my window like that
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      okay.
      Okay, so back to the group work page. So if all members
      contribute equally allocate points equally to each group member.
      So if you have three group members, you can add you can do 99 So
      three, three times 33 is 99.
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I have a few examples here. So this is equal allocation
      you'll get a rating between point five and and one which is an
      indication of how much how your group members think thought of
      your work on the project assignment. So if everybody gets one
      everyone's happy that everybody's pulling doing their job and
      contributing. And then if we have
11h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and this is kind of an extreme example here
      so if Thomas so the points are allocated by Thomas Thomas good
      himself 97 out of 100 and then gives 1.2 Richard Harold and
      Sally so you can see here that Terrell doesn't like Richard so
      much. doesn't like Thomas so much and then. So there are
      different ways to get. You can individually do anything you like
      except as long as they add up to 100 or 99. And then so to get
      the total points and then divide by the highest score so nobody
      can get more than one and nobody can get less than point five.
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So
      way to get some feedback about relative contributions on the
      project on the assignment.
      Okay, so if I wanted to
11h44:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      I said it's the 33 and 33 again, and

      then I can copy it and then if I go back to

      her bonus point does anyone remember that? This is kind of a
      reference to a show and Bob Newhart? I don't know whether you
      who knows who Bob Newhart is.
      CNN once I submit
      then you can see the online text to just be there for you your

      Okay.

      Yep. to Bob Newhart. Shannon
      okay. Anyway. So that's okay, good. Actually, he's been on he

      there were some characters in the show that was in the 80s.
      There are characters that they three brothers and they Want to

      anyway, I'm sure you're happier now that I've explained that.
      Okay.
      So I've updated some things on the website. So here's today's
      meeting.
11h49:

      So if you've been following along, I've been changing things a
      little bit here and there. So now I've updated these so that
      they're behave the same. So anytime you go over anywhere in the
      area, in the box, then the link is active. And if it's
      progressive disclosure, there's more material to see, then I
      can. And I've added the chevron that moves.
11h50:

      I did have a plan for today. It seems to have not occurred. So.
      So the upcoming events is in your courses. So we have our
      meeting today, which we're in right now. Sorry, later, and then
      reach group.
      So this is a lie that your groups reading of us do because
      there's no submission there. So that could be a little more
      nuanced in the way it describes it. Because it's a it's a read
      only kind of place, but it's so it's a place where you can go to
      find that information.
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      Everyone.
      So should everybody in the group submit? No, you can submit one

      So how
      so the names I have for things is I'm trying something different
      this semester. And I'm I'm wondering if it's successful or not.
      So if I look at
      so I have for the individual assignment, so I'm

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I put the title of the assignment here as the label and then
      I've indented the three things here so the description of the
      assignment goes to
      my page here as a new source goes to the separate open separate
      web page and then discuss Oh, that's not good I didn't hear
      about that that was an error.

      Somebody reported it to me I apologize for not catching it
      just want to go back
      Oh, so I managed I seem to fix the position of Of course, here
      so now it appears in in the fall 2020 I I changed the dates of
      this of the class
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so that that did the trick with the

      the position of since easier to find now in Fall 2020.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      So this is the one so if I say discuss topic
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      No, I know I'm gonna disconnect go and check my file about that.
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So in question about how to include people's names in the
      rating. So if it would help me if you could just use their first
      name, but the one that matches first name on the your courses
      list would be helpful. But not required because it song is weak
      i can i in the marker, the marker and I can distinguish between
      the members in your group. Now that's sufficient because we'll
      look at the ratings
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Look at the ratings based on your group. So as long as not
      everybody is as the same nickname, for example. Then we can
      match them up.
      Okay, so I was gonna
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      was the number that I had.
      Anyway. Oh, looks like I had the right number here. So I'm just
      looking at 704237. Should I've done the right one?
      Oh, maybe.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I just wanted to say quickly before I start fixing that you
      can manage to fix and get out of student view. So the heading is
      designed in a very low flow prototype presentation. prototype
      Hi, fi. So those are things that
      so those who've done I've done in the past way to break them up,
      but we'll, we'll package those four things into two more
      assignments each worth 10. And I'll get get that out to you
      tomorrow. So you don't have to concern yourselves with it today.
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Turn editing on.
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I realized that
      I'm, so I've, I'm just thinking about a way to stop having two
      separate places for that information. Because I have a link here
      and discuss.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And then they have in the description I have the discussion link
      to. And that one's correct. One was correct or the other one's
      correct now, too.
      So I mean, the small details are important. I think
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      it's anyone familiar with the expression Pennywise and pound
      foolish?
      Nobody?
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, that's right. So you careful about little things, but not
      all the big issues. So, do we need to not just be good with
      pounds, we need to also be good with pennies as well, I think
      you might get to the point of saying, somebody.
      If somebody makes comments about small details in the interface,
      it might be easy to dismiss, analyze whether they get the idea
      or they can manage, they can complete the task or complete the
      activity that we set for them. We can see that there's
      opportunities like when the same control is presented
      differently or interact. One can interact with it a little bit
      differently then
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so it's not consistent and that's an important part of helping
      people navigate the interface.
      see and know. Because someone wrote to me privately, I replied,
      and that was,
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      chat helpfully, send it back to that person privately. So no, I
      see that I'll send it to everybody. Distract writing out what I
      said before.
      Okay. So
      when we when we talk about design. So we need to be focused on
      what the users want. Are they the humans using the systems want
      to do? And they may not know exactly to begin with what that is.
      So that's the idea when we try and take what take the
      information about their present activities, what they're doing
      and what they're frustrated and so on. And then we can,
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      we might be able to suggest to them alternatives, they might not
      realize are possible.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      But we don't want to us neither do we want to go off. And with a
      bit of information from the people using the software, the
      interface and say, Okay, I understand now, and then don't talk
      to them again until the software is ready to go.
      So I mean, you might get a little bit of points, you might get a
      few points from the people for talking to them once at the
      beginning. But then that's not a way to keep them engaged, is
      it? So, we might very well iterate a few times. And this is why
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      paper and pencil prototyping and keeping in conversation with
      people throughout the process, as they develop ideas and, and
      clarify their own thinking. I mean, as we, as together we
      develop ideas and people using the software, clarify their
      thinking about things and what would work and what wouldn't
      work. And then so we have the conversation that begins with
      understanding their current situation. And, and in, in a new
      interface, address some of the opportunities for for that
      redesign that have been presented by users.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So when we're so we talked a little bit about this. And I'll go
      back and find stuff in the transcripts of the earlier meetings.
      And I apologize that I've, I had a snag with my translation of
      transcripts to data for the webpage, so I'll get that sorted for
      next day. But anyway, so.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the idea is that as the as the designers of the interface we
      have, we have a view of the system that we're designing that's,
      that's complete, and it's organized and maybe we can even aspire
      to it being elegant.
      So has anyone
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I want to make it easier for you to say yes. How would you
      describe that's a better word if eloquent doesn't do it.
      The point is the point I want to make, not to make everybody
      listen to make everybody more shy but contributing. But
      is that no matter how good we think that we've as designers and
      coders, developers, that we've
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      we've addressed all the issues and put things together in a
      great way. People using the system may have different opinions
      completely. And it's not a question of them having and then
      being wrong. It's a question of their experience being valid or
      near the question of how that their experiences can be validated
      and considered when designing things. So on the one hand, we
      have so both the designer and the person using the software have
      mental models of the system. So the designer has mental models,
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      which is complete and maybe elegant, maybe nice. Maybe? What are
      the what other adjectives Would you like to use for that?
      Okay. So but what what is the user's mental model? Like the
      person using the software? Do they have benefit of understanding
      the whole system? and seeing how each function fits nicely
      together? Yes or no?
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So okay, if the answer is yes, how do they How do users come to
      know about system and it's come in its totality.
      Go ahead, ferrier.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      I think if we're talking about designing process and
      users being an early participant in the designing process, One
      thing is that we exactly know what they want. And other thing is
      that they will have their confidence in the system while it was
      being designed. So they already have it know how.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Right, okay. Yeah, so they've engaged and thanks.
      being engaged in the design process there, they have a better
      sense of how things fit together.
      Let's, so let's say that that was done. But we can talk to
      everybody. We can engage all use the software. So we can engage
      all users of let's say, Moodle or Microsoft Word, in the same
      kinds of conversations. It would impact the design. So let's
      think about users who haven't had haven't been directly engaged
      in designing the software. How do they come to know about how do
      they come to get a model of the system?
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Can they get a complete understanding of the system?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      No, I guess all the users cannot be made a part spin,
      they have to choose, like, they have to do sampling or how to
      pick some of the users from each group or category.
      Yeah, the other ones that are left out.
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      I wonder what they think. Yeah.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah. Yeah. So, you can say that those users
      develop their mental model of the system in an ad hoc fashion.
      So basically, they see the screen for the interface. And that
      becomes a piece of evidence that they use to develop their their
      idea of what other features can be used are available to them.
      So if so, we can't enforce as designers we can enforce a mental
      model on on people using the software. But we can encourage it.
      So, some of the ways to encourage that are
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      like, I think the requirement the user requirements are
      already taken. Like what they will like this is to to do, how do
      they the format of the data like, even about the date, format,
      and so on in for that quick one is a questionnaires. Although
      for the designer itself to take a look at the questionnaire, it
      will be time consuming, but quick data gathering or an opinion
      gathering? He can do that. Yeah.
      But suddenly
      they have to realize the interface by their own. I'ma say,
      static senses.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So you're talking about the user then?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yeah, we can take their requirements. But obviously,
      all the users cannot be the party spend like when we are
      designing. When if we go with the type, like dividing into
      phases, and then having the user interaction and then moving to
      the next step, and then a user interaction to like we're clear
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      to every step or component of our design phase.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Mm hmm. So
      so that that's, that's right, that having more data and more
      interactions with with the people using the software, or
      potential users will help us in the design phase.
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So let's, if we think about a way to conceptualize the system,
      to present it to the, to the users, and to encourage a mental
      model that supports our way of thinking about the system and as
      a whole. And so like I said, we can't tell these years to have
      this modeling system. But we need to design it in a way that
      supports an interpretation of it. So one way that we can
      encourage users to have a certain mental model of the interface
      is to use metaphors and
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and then to use metaphors and to
      make them consistent, and to apply them consistently. Now, the
      level of detail we want to convey with the metaphor is maybe not
      too specific. Because then people will think they won't, they
      won't be able to generalize to the new behaviors that they're,
      you want to convey to them. And we don't want it to be too
      general. So that they don't get enough information about what
      they're being asked to do. So they don't, they're not clear
      about what what metaphor is trying to be, what aspects of
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      metaphor should be taken to work with the task. Work with the
      activity.
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      an example of a metaphor for,
      for an online stores going through and saying, like, when you go
      to the supermarket or different different stores, you might get
      a basket or a cart to begin with, and then go through the
      aisles, fill up your cart, and then go to checkout. So you want
      to
      so the idea of saying, well going to doing online shopping is
      like going to a market and getting a shopping cart and going
      through a checkout. So that's true, but it's not just that

      it's it's has marketability, because you don't have to find the
      location of the thing on the shelf. You can search for it in the
      catalog, and you know, you don't you're not having to navigate
      the aisles that may be too close together or
      you don't have to wait in line for a checkout clerk or you don't
      and you don't have to ask for. Try and find somebody is on
      staff. If you You can't find something you know. So there are,
      there are some things that are,
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      are helpful. And some things that are more specific to the
      bricks and mortar shopping in that kind of store that are not
      helpful for the online experience. But But going through and
      saying that
      it's like going to a store can be helpful for people who don't
      have a lot of experience with this kind of fruit with online
      shopping. Although at this point in 2020, I think people who are
      not, we're not big online shoppers before have become more so.
      Would you agree with that?
12h29:

      Yeah, that's true.
      I myself has done to be one of them.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah. That's a good way to social distance, isn't
      it?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Is and finally when you don't even have an option to go
      out? Or you really can't. So that that seems good. And even I
      think when the pandemic started, there was a shortage of masks.
      So if you can't find it locally, just go online and get it from
      somewhere in the world.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah.
      Yeah, so no. So we can see. So we have some intuition built up
      about how to go shopping in a physical store, which we translate
      to the online experience. So there are still some, some online
      stores that that give us much more trouble than we'd like. It's
      my experience. So I mean, just changing things just for the sake
      of changing. It's not a great thing to make. If you evaluate a
      design, make a design statement, by the way, doing something
      crazy with the controls, or have them behave in a different way.

      Seems like there might be also some inclination to do things
      differently to avoid patterns, and fights.

      But that's another discussion. For another class, I think that's
      so much this one.
      So in the next part of the assignment, next part of the project,
      I want to ask you to go to
      the activity, the activities you defined for your users, and
      think about how to present that activity with two different
      metaphors. So it's like so. So if we say choosing courses is
      like shopping online, you know, or choosing class courses is,
      like, filling in the calendar. You know, those might be two
      different ways to approach. So we'll talk about that more on
      Tuesday. But the idea is to give you a sense of the bigger
      picture. So now that we understand, understand, and can
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      empathize with the user users you've identified for your website
      or application. Then we say,
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      what kind of metaphor? What are two different ways to think
      about this. So there could be more than two ways, you can pick
      the most promising two ways, which are different from one
      another. So pick two different ways to think about it and the
      metaphor. And then we'll develop the an interface and presented
      in create a low fidelity, paper and pencil kind of version of
      the interface for the activity that you identified. So two
      versions of the interface, according to the one for each of the
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      two different metaphors, and then create paper and pencil
      version of that new interface that's based on those metaphors
      based on the metaphor that that you can test with other people
      can show to other people and ask them what they would do. So
      that's kind of the big picture of how this is going. And then
      that makes sense. Yes. Yes, that there were 30 other people on
      class. You read this? I get only one person is saying yes. Okay.
      No, two people are saying yes. Three. Okay. I my faith is
      restored. Thank you, everybody, for
12h35:

      for for typing in the chat.

      So let me come back here. Let me ask you, I want you to think
      about
      how this is organized. So this is this is the homepage for the
      class, I guess. No, I thought
      is this interface to the meetings
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      useful?
      It might be more helpful to put the number in the text as well.
      So the 15th is not confused for October 15 or so on anyway. So
      I've decided I've had to put them into these progressive
      disclosure. But maybe that's and then I can say, well, it's
      still open. And then I thought about organizing them in terms of
      information.
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Maybe it's just too much that I should just put all these
      entries here under the information heading into the onto the
      main page and get rid of the of the progressive disclosure
      heading. So these are all these are all promoted. And that I
      format these links so that all of them are they're all headings,
      they all look the same. And the only distinguishing thing is
      whether there's an Chevron or not. There's no Chevron and it's a
      link.
12h39:

      And then this is from the ACM IEEE Computer science curriculum
      that was last updated in 2013. So HCI is the knowledge area. And
      then there are different knowledge units. So if you click on
      them,
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      you can see them and then they're not the stars that's behind
      the line there. So two stars means they're most important. So
      there should be included as high priority, they should be
      included, lower priority, and then if they don't have a survive
      in them, then they're an elective part of the of the curriculum.
      So even though we have these
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      topics and learning outcomes, and I'm struggling with a good way
      to present them to you as part of the semester plan.
      So I've done a little bit there. So I guess so what I'm
      proposing to you is a question to think about is how to think
      about the integration of the curriculum topics and learning
      object learning outcomes into into the semester that plan.

      So I would like to go to the I would like to go to the meeting,
      but I don't have a link to that I have a link to the plan here.
      So maybe I should add a link to the meeting as well.
      So I'm working on. So I just pulled up an image that I had
      marked up in the in the transcript. But I'll work on getting the
      other main topics or highlights from the transcripts. So we can
      do that. This is from the previous day.
12h44:

      So I'm looking forward to
      having that discussion with you.
      Okay, so it's already recorded one.
      So I guess it's time to say goodbye. For you to say no. That's
      from the sound of music, I think. Goodbye. Anyway. I will try
      and anymore singing on you. So anyway, thanks for today. So let
      me know if questions come up about the assignment is due
      tonight. Just before the stroke of midnight, and any other
      questions that would be? Well, thanks, Matthew.
12h45:

      Anyway, I'll be I'll be around online, if you have questions
      today. Okay. Thanks again, and we'll see you on Tuesday. I have
      an office hour two to three as well. Okay, still everybody. So I
      went got my flu shot and I voted on on Tuesday afternoon. So I
      encourage you to do the same if you're able. Okay, bye.
