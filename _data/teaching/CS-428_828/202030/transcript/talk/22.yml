      Good morning Good morning.
      So did people see my posting yesterday about the about the free
      online course
      if I turn that off the doorbell
      so our last meeting is two weeks from today. So this time this
      time been going for you
11h32:

      stand
      Yeah, it's gone. It's gone by very quickly for me too.

      So I need to get things updated on the website. There is an
      assignment due today at 2359. Any questions about that?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Hello, sir. Hi. Hi, I have a question regarding today's
      assignment. Like in the assignment, you said we need to discuss
      about unmet needs about the topics that you have linked on the
      website. But I was just wondering, is it like, should we give
      you design issues on the website that we are we feel that is not
      appropriate or unmet? Or should it be related to the topics that
      you mentioned and the topics we are covering in class?
11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it's about the use of the topics and whether
      they're their unmet needs compared to the use of the topics in
      the assignments and the notes and and the meetings
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Okay, so we should just put example we choose a topic
      like empathy map. And then the know that we discussed it well in
      the class and then we had it in our assignment and then we had
      it like pretty much everywhere. So that is a topic that has been
      well meant. So we choose another topic and do the same analysis.
      Is that what you mean?
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Well, okay, here, let me
11h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      share my screen here.
      So I believe that I, I thought I put a link to the topics here.
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So taking. So my my feeling and I mean, I'm not attached to the
      way I've done this. And I've been trying to find a way to make a
      stronger connection between the topics from the curriculum. You
      can see here and
      and how they're presented. And if they know they're taught to
      talk about in a meeting, actually used in the assignment and so
      on.
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      That make that clarify things.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      So, what are like, based on the topics and like, I went
      through the project, like Assignment Description. And what I did
      was I went through the topic section, and whatever was the
      design issues and the topics, and the design issues in the
      website is what I mentioned in the assignment. So that is not
      right. So we need to do it like this, right?
      Because even the design issues in the website is I feel that
      they are like unmet needs or the problems that I find on the
      website. I don't mean it's unmet needs in terms of topics. But
      yeah, I was just wondering if that is right, or should I change
      my whole assignment?
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So what's, what's the topic related design view,
      is an example that you looked at in your assignment,
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      for example, and the topic section. There is no
      specific mention about empathy maps. But we discussed about
      empathy maps, I did not find anything specific to empathy maps
      and all the topics I went through the topics. Yeah, so I was
      just wondering like, if at all, we are covering it so strongly
      in our class, it should be incorporated in the topics to to have
      a better connection. That is one. And the other one was all
      related to the design issues. Like for example, if we maximize
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      to three topics, it keeps on opening up a large topics,
      sections, and the page goes on and on, like, into an infinitely
      long page.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it's not infinitely long.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yeah, but yeah, not too long. But if at all, I open all
      the sections and I want to go back to the top section to
      identify what is the one that I saw in the first part, and you
      just scroll back a lot. And then if I open three at a time and
      close the second one, the third one just pops right beside the
      second one. It's not like one below the other like how it is,
      but the other ones. Yeah, just open another two and try closing
      the second one.
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it's like
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      the ones that are close it like in the first look of
      that it's like hate ci design integration or, like, I need to
      have a cleaner look of what is the topic that's been discussed
      beneath that, because we have two headings as of like, it looks
      like we have two headings to the same topic.
      So I need to go into the topics I need to look okay, this is
      programming interface systems, it I can track the ERP system. So
      I need to have a clear idea of what it is. Because I need to be
      clear on what it is. Yeah. So is it fine if we do it like that?
      Or is there I think
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that's, that's reasonable.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yeah. So there are a few issues are related to those.
      So I was just wondering if I should change the assignment, or is
      that good enough to go through?
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, I i understand where you're coming from
      now. So that that makes sense.
      So they're the reason there's supposed to be was supposed to be
      a curriculum ces 2020. Coming out, but that's been delayed for?
      I'm not sure. Well, certainly COVID has an impact on schedules,
      but I'm not sure even for for COVID how things are progressing.
      So. So this is the quickest computer science curriculum from
      2013. So that was published at the end of 2013. So it's not,
      it's not it's probably finalized, or quite finalized by sometime
      much earlier than that.
11h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the issue with
      with the current computer science curriculum, that it's
      I mean, because computer science, some things about computer
      science, are are durable, and the wording and some of the theory
      and so forth.
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      They
      don't change very much. But on the other hand,
      some concepts and some vocabularies.
      Man, some of those, some of the terms that we use may change
      quite rapidly. And so if it's less
      so, from 2019, might be a bit of a stretch for some things. Melo
      in 2013. So there are some limitations with the the curriculum,
      as its laid out here in terms of knowledge areas and knowledge
      units, and topics within those.
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      So yeah, that makes sense. So overall, to summarize it,
      what is that? Like? I'm going to discuss few issues in topics
      like one or two issues and topics, and what are some two or
      three issues in the design that I find? And I'll just compile it
      into a report. So that should be good enough for this
      assignment, right.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I'm I'm hesitating about the good enough part.
      Okay. So
11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and I'm not saying that you just need to keep going and going
      and going until things or you've exhausted ideas.
      That's.
      So what's what what is sufficient for this Simon is what I've
      described in terms of the what the Andean. So let's look at the
      assignment.
11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I said, describe the end that need or unfulfilled potential
      upon which you're basing your ideas and present at least two
      ideas. So
      that, hey, hedgie without imprecise language, at least two
      ideas, so present two ideas. But if you really have a third one
      that's related and you want to, and you want to include it for
      completeness, then you can do that.
11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I'm not trying to be indefinite about the number of ideas. So
      you should have two ideas, the sketches and explanations, so.
      So does that make sense?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yes, that makes sense. So one last question is that
      when I jotted down all these points and ideas and the sketches?
      I actually went part of the three days, like three pages one,
      you said the target is one to three pages, I ended up having
      four pages. So should I cut it short? Should I cut short?
11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      No.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Because the last time when I submitted my assignment, I
      submitted paperwork, which was like, three, four of a page
      instead of one page and a last few months for that. So I was
      just wondering, wondering if I should just take the three?
      Yes, that's exactly as in my question as well, cause markers
      seem to be keen about the number of pages added there.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Well, I will talk to the market about some of
      those things. So mine,
11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      my intention, the same target, let giving you an idea of the
      number of pages. is just so I say one to three pages. I don't
      mean 10 to 30 pages. All right. I want to get the ballpark
      right. So if you're if you're generating 10 or 15 pages,
      maybe too much, slightly too much. But if you have four pages
      and I'm not sure what
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      What the better languages to describe that?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      That's because of the scatters mostly because when we
      are scattering, we definitely will go beyond two pages for the
      scattered and if we add a bit of explanation, so particularly,
      these are two ideas and few discussion. So if it was only the
      written part, we can take you two or three, but with the
      sketches, you know, it will take space like beyond three.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so what's, what's a better word?
      Should I not have a target in there at all? Should I take out
      that line?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      No, I think we are good with that. For I think that
      will be enough. But as my follow has already mentioned, the last
      time it was like, one page description, one page explanation for
      this, and if it was like, almost one, and for example, four or
      five lines less than one page, the marker said, okay, it was not
      one page completely. So I am going to deduct this much marks and
      I was like, Oh, I had to type in few more spaces and few more
      sentences, just to fill in the page.
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, so that, that that was unintentional on my
      part. So. So the Mark and I have not been communicating as well
      as clearly as well as we need to be. And I didn't realize that
      issue
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      as a concern.
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So to avoid that aid,
      I should have
      should should mandate a font size and other things. So I could
      if I was really concerned about getting a full page and then and
      then defining what a pages page shall be. Now
      there shall be up to this many lines on the page and
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      there should be that at most this much space between lines and
      so on. So I mean, that's a big
      big trap, I think.
      So I'm curious as so I will get this address retroactively.
      With what's up what's Captain marketing adjusted?
11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, what? So given this unmet need of my so here's an unmet need
      in my description of the requirements for the assignment. So
      what are some ideas to clarify, so that
      but if I say suggested length, that make it sound more optional,
      less strict.
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so, and maybe based on the our discussion today we'll just
      say that things can be submitted tomorrow at 2059
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yes, that would be great. Thank you.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      You're welcome.
      Okay, so let's go and do that now. So
      waiting for this
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so I find that if I was zoom I feel like if I sharing the house
      screen that's
      cause problems with your display because it wants to make it a
      full screen wants to take up your whole screen as I'm sharing my
      whole screen. Then if I don't make it, full screen then I'm
      sometimes doing things without you seeing them. So I'm going to
      changing target to suggested like
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      change due days tomorrow
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so the submission is her just a blank 123 pages so let's
      try that out as a
      as an improvement so also
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      improving for you and for the marker and for everybody
      concerned. I guess there aren't many other people concerned on
      you and the marker and the
      Okay, so let me go to the assignment
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      see if I can
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      okay so that look alright. So I've now made it tomorrow so that
      the time remaining is one day in 11 hours. Yes,
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      thank you.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      You're welcome.
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So
      I realized, so I'm, I've been thinking about assignments in this
      course. And realizing now that we're two weeks to the end of the
      class. But still, we're the further away from the final exam,
      which is on the 22nd, I believe in the afternoon. So you can
      start thinking about what kind of questions like what kind of
      format you'd like to see for that exam. And so I haven't
      forgotten about the midterm. And perhaps we can talk a bit about
      it on Thursday. And I have it all the marks finalized before our
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      meeting on Well, we'll say, within the next week, I'll have all
      the marks sorted.
      So I, I've been editing the assignments I've had from previous
      years, so the fewer of them that I realized, I understand the
      comment about having them be at the end of the semester. Meaning
      most of it, most of the due dates are towards the end of the
      semester. So I'm wondering if possible workaround for that is to
      maybe consider them as the last assignment, the last individual
      assignment is an optional. So my plan was to make it due in
      three weeks from today, which is just be a week passed
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      our last class meeting, which is on the eighth, so it'd be on
      the 15th. And then our final exam would be on the 22nd.
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, so next, next Tuesday would be the would be December 1.
      And then they did their last meeting. And so I was thinking
      about and we do on the 15th. And then the more I thought about
      that,
      maybe maybe that became more problematic than not. So that's
      what I thought about making it of making it an optional part of
      the final Mark calculation. So any thoughts about that?
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Does this mean we can opt for either submitting
      assignment three or not, if that's how it works in house It will
      be like graded for the ones who have submitted and one level
      down. Because there are some incentive, or we can totally skip
      it altogether.
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, sure, that would be the option of keeping
      it
      just reading a comment in the chat. So I would say
      that it would be treated as if it helps your final Mark
      calculation, then that would be included.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I just, I'm just thinking about because
      because it's getting late in the semester, later than I and
      intended. But then I didn't want to, I want to do as a second
      individual assignment first. And so here we are today with so
      the, at the end of the submission date, by now plus one, or
      minus one, one day away from the submission of assignment two,
      so I was prepared to put things up for the third assignment, but
      then I thought that we could have a discussion first about it.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So there wouldn't be a penalty to for not submitting it, it
      would be
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the option of adding another data point to your marks
      something like we did in the winter semester. Or to add some
      different calculations that would well for the classes that I
      taught in the winter semester had different ways of looking at
      it submitted work and so different ways to congressman mark, me
      and I would use the one that was most favorable to you.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Let me do a poll. Now we can discuss
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay here's the poll.
      So I'll give you a minute or so to fill it in. So why not why
      not result response? Please.
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, let's do another 30 seconds is five people that love to
      vote. See if it's a five. Not yet voting are going to submit us
      a choice
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, going, going?
      Okay, so there's
      no most the most favorite of the four options is to make it
      optional due on December 15.
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So we'll go ahead on that basis. All right.
      So
      and I will clarify the marking information.
      So I have some rules about how to how it would be counted if
      it's submitted and versus and
      submitted versus not submitted and impact on your grades. Okay.
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, I ended the poll but in share results. There we go. I was in
      a meeting the other day where I was on the receiving end of a
      poll and I was expecting the different behavior based on my
      experience with the poll as host of the meeting.
      So it
      it was a little bit confusing for me. distinguishing between the
      two views. Anyway, Okay, here we go.
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Stop sharing. Excuse me.
      So just a quick discussion about Proctor track. So is the
      feeling that we're not using proper track or proper track with
      some produced set of invasiveness, invasive features activated
      would be okay.
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay so we're getting a clear signal. I'm getting a clear
      signal.
      So there's six people 543
      ces last year you're gonna vote.
      Okay, let's stop it there.
      Okay, so I'm really surprised. Not really that nobody said yes,
      we should use it. There's a little bit of interest in using this
      subset of. I didn't, I should have made that for a subset of
      monitoring features activated. But definitely most people are
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      preferring to not have it at all. So that's what I'm feeling as
      well. So
      I would I would appreciate your input and participation and in
      deciding what kinds of questions to put forth on the final exam.
      So please keep that in mind and make use of the discussion
      forum.
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so in our last 15 minutes here, I thought I would shift to
      discuss about the third part of the project. So materialized. So
      instead of building a higher fidelity prototype,
      we're going to do the testing and decide which features would we
      would like to proceed with. So describing them but not realizing
      them in
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and then working.
      When I say working, it doesn't necessarily mean we're not
      dealing with code from the application or the website, but we
      will look at a reasonable outcome would be to create a prototype
      that looks like it's running on the computer. So that's not
      required. And in the assignment description, just a note from
      your testing, to indicate which features and what what you've
      learned about the design you through the testing, or the process
      that you've gone through. Not exclusive are but so taking

      everything together your experience with the with the process of
      going through the website, and identifying unmet needs and
      opportunities for design redesign. And then what you've
      discovered in presenting your low fidelity interfaces to other
      people who aren't familiar with your project. So, all those
      influences together, then you make from your interface
      prototypes, and B then you come up with the best of both are the
      best.
12h33:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And the best advice which includes your ideas, which may not
      have been expressed in the prototypes that came along with your
      experience and doing the design and doing the testing. So things
      that you may have observed and so far, I probably am not trying
      to say anything different than what's already online. But isn't.
12h34:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      So the first part is the idea of the testing groups. If you have
      any questions about that.
      Do you have any questions about making contact with the people
      in your testing group
12h35:

      Everything's clear as mud.

      I think I have questions like in the upcoming class,
      because so far everybody was more concerned with the assignment
      individual assignment submission. So I guess we really have to
      go through the ideas, how we'll be communicating with our test
      participants and how we'll be scripting our own group. For the
      participants, though, I think it will be better if we can ask
      the questions in the next class.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Sure, and you don't have to you don't have to do
      that asking in the synchronous meeting, we can post your
      courses. Right, as well.
12h36:

      That's a good idea. Thank you.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, you're welcome. So they went see the video
      about rocket surgery made easy. I did share that link in the in
      the transcript the other day, right? I'm pretty sure I did.
      Speaking about videos, I'm gonna put another one in today's
      transcript.
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that's from 2004. And I think it's quite interesting. And
      applicable to our discussions here and about human computer
      interface design.
      Anyway, so I invite you to look at the video about the user
      test. Three, they're testing out a functioning website.
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      Yeah. Okay.
      So, in the last five minutes here, I show you one other thing.
      So this is a
      this is a Google thing. We have got. No remember if like I
      mentioned in class last week or not.
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So just happens I have a test of my website here.
      So here, let me let me run it on it again.
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So there, so this gives us one set of data,
      moto website for some things I can control more easily than
      others.
      So I can see recommendations based on.
      So this is a go now, how did I get that?
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so let's improve my score for best practices, I could use
      HTTPS, which is really not my decision.
      So I'm curious what kind of known security vulnerabilities there
      are.
      I thought I used to have had a different, more recent version of
      jQuery. What's the latest version of jQuery? Anyone know
      offhand?
12h42:

      Like, can you only test your own website or you can
      just run the test for any of the website?
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Whether it's, you can do it on for anything.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Logically, if it tells the downsides of your website,
      it can tell the downside for any of the websites
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      like yeah, as far as I know that it's not. I was
      just, let's look at the textbook website in a second here. I
      just wanted to see what version is most current.
12h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So 3.5 point one. So that's a little bit more advanced than 1.0
      to say 1.2 1.1 12 1.11 point 12.4.
      So these are long ways to go for particular, I mean, to track
      track them down.
      And it's not always clear for whom this is being written. So I
      mean, you have to know a little bit about how the website or
      what, what things are being used and so forth on the website to
      make good use of this information, as it still still might be
      useful. Even in a casual way. Let me go back here and
12h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      This is
      so this is the website we're looking at, I put in to test. So we
      asked you to look at this early in the semester and the comments
      were, well, it works. It's working. So then as we see it on the
      screen now maybe Can we look at some or think about some other
12h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      more fine grained assessment of whether it's a website, it's
      working. Okay.
      So those key metrics, performance is better not a secondary
      rennet. 58 out of 100, accessibility has 74 of 100 best
      practices 64 100. And that search engine optimization is 92 out
      of 100.
12h47:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So we're out of time for today. So I don't want to keep you any
      longer but I'll post the URL in chat as well. We will continue
      our discussion next day. Okay. Thanks for today. Have a great
      Tuesday. And we'll see you on Thursday.
