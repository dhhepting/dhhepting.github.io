      humor out of it, let's look at that webpage if you're
      interested, and then there's some links to explore. I don't have

      Yes, very Oh
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      yes, I think
      the thing we have seen is the consistency and the standards we
      usually follow we are used to how we open the door and that's a
      very trivial thing in our everyday life. So, consistency and
      standard I think it It must be there.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      So consistency is good.
      But if we If we have doors with pull handles on both sides,
      that's the consistency of the check mark for consistency. But
      it's not, it's also not clear which side to push and which side
      to pull.
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Is I'm following that idea. Like, if it's a flat side,
      we only have to like push as it's a handle. we'd certainly have
      in mind we have to pull.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah. Yeah. So that that's that's the pattern
      that we'd like to see. Standardized. So that's more maybe
      aspirational? Because there's lots of doors that don't follow
      that pattern. Yes, that's right.
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, okay, so good for the positive cases. heuristics relate to
      good doors? And how do we see the heuristics play out when we
      have less less good doors?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      He has one thing, like, at the caption of the video,
      like it says, pull and it also has a handle to pull. Adding
      there, they are more like doing that. Error prevention, error
      handling. And like what they did, without pushed or they have a
      handle. So they put the sign over there. Like, rather than
      pulling, you should push. So rather than proving their design,
      they put a passage over there for people to Okay, handle it like
      this way?
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah. And so like, so that's, that's part of help
      and documentation. But better than having documentation of how
      to operate the door. It's better to make it clear what to do
      with the door to begin with. Yes, you're right. So anyone else
      has thank you for your comments. Anyone else like to contribute
      to the discussion?

      So from what I understand, there's actually regulations
      involved, at least with front doors, where it's, you actively
      have to have the majority of the doors as pull when you come in,
      and then push when you're going out just for concerned about
      stampeding purposes. And there's like regulations for like, the
      size of the hallway going into it and all this, that and the
      other thing. So there are like rules and regulations in place.
      It's just a matter of like,

      And it's independent of the visual visuals of the door

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah. So one thing I find frustrating is that
      well, there's many things I find frustrating, but I try and use
      the right hand door as I approach sir. Like stick keep right is
      the rule in North America. Right. I know the one point We're
      keep left signs in the UK. I don't know if they are so much
      there anymore. But it would be nice if we had keep rate signs
      here, I think so trying to enter the door on the right side or
      exit or exit using the opposite door on my right. Sometimes
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      there are two doors, but only one is open, and then they have an
      extra latch to push.
      This is a problem for me. So I'm aware that there are other.
      There are other issues involved. I mean, there are regulations
      involved, but it's still I think that we should not well. So
      let's see what we can find for the regulations regarding entry
      doors, and see how well they they match up with design
      guidelines.
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So for the web, in it, as an example, the web has lots of
      ARIA
11h57:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      not to name. The words to go a few abbreviations are escaping me
      at the moment. But there's a standards for
      rich internet applications. But they switched internet
      applications that are there, but then it's
      it's whether or not people follow them, or whether it's easy for
      them to follow them.
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if if the regulations you're talking about are
      going against the design guidelines, or would make for Norman
      doors instead of invisible doors, so to speak. And then and we
      need a nice to be a conversation about that. Would you agree?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yes or No, um, I get the rationale for it. But my
      understanding is it's like the fire code, which circumvents
      entirely any design flaws, or any design choices in the matter,
      because it's regulation has to be there. Otherwise, it doesn't
      get permission to be built or to continue to be used.
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So is there something to
      it if it's a fire code example where the regulations are part of
      the fire code? The fire code is the intention to keep people
      safe. So if there was an issue with the door that cause people
      that have problems opening it in an emergency then that would be
      An issue of safety that should could be addressed in the in the
      guidelines and the or in the fire code.

    msg: >-
      so Shannon, just to read your cut your chat post made me check
      what else?
      Yeah, so speaking of clear doors there in research and
      innovation center there's the Regina integrative cognitive
      experimentation lab race for short. Which, which predated the
      name of which predated the name of the buildings, so it's not
      like we just added the need to wreck. But anyway, as a design
      choice, the builders put the lock for the door at the bottom of
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the bottom outside corner. So not only so that you had to get
      down on your knees to open the open the lock, and then try and
      get the animal. It be down at the floor with tea and have your
      other hand On the handle to jiggle it to see when it's open,
      because sometimes a lock would stick. So that was not a not a
      pleasing experience. Anyway. So Shannon's commerce doesn't say
      Apply to interior doors, which case things can become ambiguous.
      People then need to be informed of the standards at some point,
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      which is then documentation. Not sure that these sounds are
      consistent or nationally, which reinforces ambiguity. I'm not
      sure that our schools teach fire code regulations to all the
      school kids, for example.
      So these are all good points.

      not to stick with a main group discussion, but I'll make up some
      breakout rooms again. So I'll just put you in terms of four or
      five and then you can
12h10:

      Do some research and some discuss with each other about
      consistency of
      issue find some examples of fairs where the building code is at
      odds with good design choices or windy weather building codes
      support Norman doors or or support invisible doors and you don't
      necessarily have it you can use examples from there but related

      so I have a feeling that the people who aren't all right moving
      on may not be at the computer
      or a step away from the computer so so last day when we did
      breakout rooms, I was trying to chat with a few people and get
      them to find out what the problem was tonight and later occurred
      to me that it might be just that they weren't. Anyway, that's it
      computers or phones. Okay, so the question is Hello

      Okay, so, let me try talking
      in terms of
      in terms of feedback, I guess we can think about me sending
      messages. So it gave me the option to broadcast a message to
      everyone.
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So there wasn't there wasn't feedback about the messages were
      received or there is no idea about how the messages messages
      were received. And similarly for you either receive them
      differently than in the chat window. But there's no way to reply
      to them.
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And then also, there is no way for me to speak
      to all the breakout rooms so it's not you One would think that
      would be possible since first or not.
      If I can write a text message to all the rooms and I would
      expect that there is a way for me to speak to all the rooms
      because when I went around and joined the rooms the other day so
      I have it set up to save the chat room. So I think when I
      created the breakout rooms, and I'll see what it looks like
      today after the meeting, but my feeling is that it created a
      separate copy of the chat room for each breakout of the chat
      session for each breakout room without indicating which chat
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      which messages belong to which breakout room
      so ended up with about 10 or 12 messages because 10 or 12 safe
      chats because this is I understood it anyway, is that creating
      the room created, creating the breakout room caused a new chat
      to be saved. But it wasn't any different than the other chats,
      it was just up to a certain point was saved.
12h40:

      So in terms of being able to understand, make use of new
      features as these a little bit to be desired.
      And I think a lot of things, least leave things to be desired.
      Not designs are perfect. Or some, some are more perfect than
      others. Some have smaller goals, so the execution and evaluation
      and others.
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I think as people we get stuck thinking that it's up to us to
      figure out how to work with a bad design. And that reflects
      positively on us. Or maybe it's a badge of honor to be able to,
      to operate a certain difficult control or interface.
      Rather than saying, No, that's a design issue. And that we
      shouldn't, we shouldn't demand better designs. Because we can
      figure them out. And in terms of the designers or the builders,
      or the programmers who create software or physical devices, if
      they're not considered if they're not taking the user into
      account in a meaningful way, then

      So anyway, getting back to the idea of invisibility, whether the
      door is invisible or now another example is hammering nails, and
      you're you're hammering a nail smoothly not bending at you not
      hitting your fingers and you know the tooth the tool the hammer
      disappears. In a sense it becomes invisible. Once you hit your
      thumb or you get a bent nail or anything out of the ordinary
      then the tool becomes present. And especially hit your thumb
      then that sensation of frustration of bending the nail. So a lot
12h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      more or visit when you hit your thumb and so on. So I should
      ask, does anyone use the hammer before I'm kidding, I'm kidding
      a little bit, because now they have these Brad nailers that work
      with an air compressor. So that the prevalence of hammers and
      nails is decreasing a bit anyway, as much as typewriters, and so
      on, and
12h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so forth a door to be invisible, to hear the example of when you
      need to push this a flat plate on one side. So that's clear. So
      you don't even realize that you're opening it. So it's clear
      that the door affords pushing, pushing open when there's a flat
      plate, so we could talk about the idea of affordances. So, when
      the action is clear, action supported by the interface or
      feature the command available through the interface is clear.
      And then, and then you can think about those as affordances, if
12h46:

      that makes sense.
12h47:

      interesting about the interplay between the hammer and the nail,
      and so on, when I bend, given bend a nail for it goes straight
      in. Before it's all the way in. I'm, I think that is user error
      on my part. Because I haven't hit a prop straight or something
      else. So it's interesting to think that. So I've been thinking
      about people not accepting support interfaces, but then I didn't
      even question that is our nail interface. This is a way to, to
      improve it, so that the experience is more positive for more
