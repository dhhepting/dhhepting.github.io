      Good morning

  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so I asked the question in chat Oh, I should put my video on
      if that helps or not so the reason I asked the question about
      whether the experience is different is because I'm changing some
      settings because okay that does anyone get an email from me
      about the event tomorrow night
11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I just want to make sure that we got a lot of bounce messages
      so I got a lot of bounce messages from my email to CS students.
      So I wasn't completely sure that it worked later on I felt like
      it did so the reason I've been changing some settings is because
11h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I found in because I was saw the recording set up the way it
      was. So I got notifications that there were new video recording
      new recordings from my event tomorrow night. And so they were
      muted and there is no camera just some people were just tried
      for a few seconds to try out the link I guess. So I thought this
      isn't necessarily a very good thing to do. I mean, not that it's
      I might wake up to find some strange things in my in my video
      recordings.
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I decided that I would. Now that people join any time so I
      don't know if it's bad for the class or not to do that.
      I thought that having random people kind of walk into an empty
      room and and recording even though it's blank Essentially that
      for some seconds, that didn't seem to be very encouraging to me.
      Or that doesn't seem like a good default behavior to have. So I
      switched off
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      some options about joining anytime. And whether you can join me
      for the host.
      So when you got when you had to wait for those to start the
      meeting before you could join today, that
      cause you do something different or just introduce away time.
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Thank you did the same things, but you just have to wait for a
      bit in between.
      Okay.
      So what came to mind when I was looking at these zoom settings?
      I used to get lots of emails about symposium unusable privacy
      and security.
      So the idea that security is usable, the privacy settings are
      usable,
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      is an important thing these days.
      So if I'm, if I'm not sure what the settings are, what the
      impact of the settings are, or if I get completely unexpected
      behavior out of the the settings maybe not unexpected for the
      developers. But unexpected for me the user.
      Is that. So giving me confidence or is leading me on the in
      giving me trust in the in the security and privacy settings that
      I've selected. With that I have confidence in what I selected.
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it occurred to me while
      I was thinking about how to process the polls and do them on the
      fly.
      I thought I could ask you Paul in your courses or ask a question
      in your courses. So here's what I'm going to do here. I'm going
      to post the link to your courses for choice. So which is a
      single answer? poll question.
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      How does that feel compared to doing the poll in zoom
      right So I looking, I can see the responses but I can also see
      people's names. So that's not a good solution in terms of you
      can see them individually but I can't
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I can't click on this and let you see the results. I mean, it's
      not a big deal in terms of your preference for zoom or your
      courses but if I wanted to collect some other information I
      would
      in travel will not travel but that would not be encouraging
      trust, would I
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      to show you the screen I'll share the screen if that's okay.
      Let's see. Looking at the chat there for a minute.
11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the
      so you can see that zoom is more popular than you are courses in
      this example so the reason I thought your courses would be a
      possibility is that I can create a new poll without
11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      without in a shorter amount of time
      because I'm not flipping around
11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So why does that have exclamation point decided?
      Oh, so it's required. It doesn't seem like it's required. It
      seems like there's a problem.
11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so let's look through the settings to see whether it can
      make them hide the names from me too. Okay, so that sets the
      availability
      results show to students after the answer, so the option is
      so that's, that's the usual one so you can get the results after
      you
      after you answer Okay, publish anonymous results.
11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Mission tracking.
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I go ahead and seem like a reasonable question.
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Let me see about adding a different kind of
      questionnaire.
      Thank you. Okay
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so, without reading the instructions it's a small does a small
      space I'm trying comma separated responses let's see how that
      works.
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, preview oh
      three the instructions now.
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so that looks not too bad
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, well
      certainly adding to the time for this option
      yeah okay. I don't know what that is
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so somebody has I don't remember answering this. So let's
      see whether I can post this link to you and
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so does this link work for you? Are you eligible to take
      this questionnaire?
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So go ahead if you like to do that. Go ahead and take the
      questionnaire.
      And I'll see whether we can get them updated here.
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So there are different options available I suppose for polling
      and different things, so third party applications. So I've tried
      my share them in the past. But the feedback I get is, it's
      better to stick to your courses as much as possible. So the
      reason I think the using your courses for questions related to
      the meetings is
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that people, people, the results can easily persist outside of
      zoom meetings. And so I don't have to transcribe them or copy
      the data or anything else. And if I'm going to create them on
      the fly, then it's easier to deal with.
      So I got a question last night, and this morning again about
      testing groups for this assignment and I can, because I got what
      was flagged for me was an issue that I had put some of the same
      project group members together in the testing groups. And so I
      found, reviewed my script that I used and it was found one
      thing, I didn't use a test that I use was didn't return any
      problems. But it didn't do anything either. So I think that I've
      fixed things up now. So the problem is that many people have
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the contact with groups and so on through testers. So I'm just
      wondering if there's more than
      if this happened with more than one group.
      So I also fixed
      I've written a better version now. But I would say is because
      things are very late in the game before this is realized.
      You just do the best you can with what groups you have.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Make sense?
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Now I'm going to see whether I can add a question to this quiz.
      See if you're able to reply to this.
      Okay, so
      let me try and make the next question. Let's see questions.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so is that second question available on that quiz.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So now that you can see both questions
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      okay.
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So those who responded the two thirds have been successful in
      arranging things. So, if you haven't been successful in
      arranging things so have you not been successful in completing
      things or successful in arranging things? Have you been able to
      make contact but not yet?
      Have a meeting.
      So, the reason I thought this is a is a feature not a bug is
      that I can keep it So, if we had a questionnaire opened
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Open for each meeting that I can add questions and have them
      answer during the class.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So in terms of doubling the feedback, so I noticed that Yeah, so
      the numbers of responses are 42. And we've only had 34 people
      in, in the class.
      So we're getting more than 100% participation.
      That's maybe still easier to deal with and listen with the
      benefits of having.
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if I didn't make it anonymous, I bet the numbers would be
      better.
      Let's Let's try one more.
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I'm getting congestion from the windows here. Okay,
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      see if that help without any more problems.
      See how it looks like for you, please?
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I'm gonna look at the responses. I hope I don't see the
      names.
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so that seems to be a good way to
      to get some feedback and so we can see the number of
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and then what if we added another question here?
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I don't know why your is underlined.
      Okay.
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So 100% of the respondents like this way of doing polling,
      there's only been one person, but that doesn't lie that details
      get in the way of a good story. Right.
      So getting back to the assignment and the groups. So perhaps
      what I'll do is I'll send an a note to everybody sent an
      announcement saying you're not replying to groups and messages
      to arrange testing. Well,
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I thought I made it somewhat unclear about how to do this
      arrangement for those of you who are here who have arranged
      things.
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So now I have another question. So I see that we have a
      responses to the question of do you like collecting responses
      and sway and three people said no. So is there a particular
      reason why this is not a great way to do it. Because you have to
      have a window open on your courses as well.
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      So the reason I'm looking considering other ways to do it is
      because the adding pull questions during the zoom meeting is
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So reading Ferrell's comment about repeated copies and being
      unclear about whether things have been submitted.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, so going back to other polling platforms, like top hat,
      for example requires students to buy a license so sort of like a
      textbook expense for you, the students to do top hat. And then
      it could also be third party platforms that are instructor or
      institution pay and free for students. But the other idea is the
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      just the fact that more platforms are being involved. Kind of
      dilutes the focus. You know, if everyone had if you have one
      email address, then it's not so bad but if you have five email
      addresses and then you have social media and messaging and the
      always on becomes difficult because there's so many ways so many
      hoops to jump through, so to speak.
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So instead of having
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      instead of having one questionnaire open for the whole meeting,
      and add to it, which
      which could
      reduce mean, you wouldn't have to go through different URLs then
      to get the different questions.
      So I wondered if, if I maybe put the Well, I can look for some
      other options I suppose. To see whether they ways to address
      this. So the
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I think I understand the issue, issue issues that you're having.
      Anyway, thanks for your involvement in that exercise. Just
      trying to trying to see if there's a silver bullet that we can
      immediately improve the behavior for me, is the person asking
      questions in real time? And make sure the behavior for you as
      the students answering the questions is,
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      is also good.
      Okay, so regarding me, testing groups,
      is there any confusion of all what the intent was? And
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      is there any any problems, you've seen instructions that are
      causing gaps for people to?
      To to not be involved? I mean, just wondering if any more
      communication for me would be helpful, or is it clear that
      what's what needs to be done?
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So yeah, so as I said earlier, I uncovered a bug in my script,
      and I thought maybe it would be discovered sooner by having your
      eyes on it. But it was only discovered yesterday. So I suggest
      that instead of trying to make things
      trying to affect us a solution for that today, we'll just leave
      it the way it is.
      Okay, so I will make a post just to remind people that
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      their participation is not optional in these tests in groups. If
      they don't, they don't reply to repeated attempts. So what are
      some ways to to go ahead and did
      you have ways to go ahead with testing?
      So yes, in the comments on the chat, Continue with the way
      things are set up. That's when I said, I said that earlier. I
      guess it wasn't clear. Thanks for your notes.
12h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      For the people who have trouble getting hold of the group
      members, or they lose some testing possible, or is some testing
      possible with what you've arranged already.
      So the Commodore Ricci group. So that seems like a good way to
      collect feedback. So I will add a richer testing group
12h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      assignment for you. That makes a lot of sense, I think. So I'll
      do that after our meeting today, which is almost over. And this
      just happens to be the last meeting, official meeting. But I
      wondered whether we might informally get together on the week
      from today. And I'll do some updating material online. And make
      sure that any questions or marks are sorted out before the 22nd.
      And then we can also collect, I would welcome your input about
      final exam questions. And all those other things.
12h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So instead of getting friends or family to do testing, which may
      strain your friends and family, the relationship between with
      your friends and family, I'd say instead of that, you can
      discuss the issues you've encountered in getting the testing
      organized, and we have some suggestions about how that could be
      improved. Okay.
12h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      All right. So so I'll be around let's see on the 15th in a week
      to discuss things I know people are people's schedules are
      different. Maybe a kind of have a drop in session. Just be
      available. Like I should be available for office hours or two,
      today, two to three. And if you have questions, you want to get
      ahold of me. You can use that link to email me or post to your
      courses.
12h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So maybe next week, we'll just send her a note. But we can just
      use my office our link for the meeting for drop in session. So
      it seemed okay.

      And remember the third individual assignment for grads and
      undergrads is coming up. And it's optional, but recommended. So
      if you don't do it, you're not gonna
      being a lot of hot water. I just think it's better to do it if
      it's possible. But I know everyone's busy and I didn't want to
      add extra pressure with that. Okay, anyway, I've been talking
      too long today already. Thanks very much for today. And maybe
      see you at two o'clock today in my office hour or maybe see you
      at the virtual lecture public lecture tomorrow at 7pm. And I'll
      be around if you have any questions or concerns, let me know.
      Okay, take care everyone and talk again soon. Bye.
