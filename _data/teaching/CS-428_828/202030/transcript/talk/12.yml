      So I made some progress with the documentation for zoom. And
      I've I found a way to well I found some different ways to
      allocate people to breakout rooms. So let me start

      Well, it's worked Then
      see you can't, can you see this zoom dial dialog box. I thought
      I had set somewhere that I could show you now. Okay.
      So I imagined having to go through a long process of

      I'm just gonna share this with you for today. Some of the things
      I realized some of the screenshots that I'm sharing I don't want
      to make public are available on the web even though still
      somewhat hard to find because of individual names on them.
      Let me show you this

      I share my screen with the application that has that. No.
11h35:

      Okay. So this is a snapshot from a few seconds ago. You can see
      that. Can you see now that the breakout rooms are set up
      according to project groups?
      notice a few groups who have more than one person in them today.
      So what I did was I thought about asking questions like, do you
      have a concert resume? Did anyone register without using a
      different email address than the original one? You can just

    msg: >-
      Can I guess not. We just see 224-789-1113 1516
      Okay, so I have 17 people allocated in groups but there's 31 or
      30 participants, excluding excluding me who are in the meeting,
      so.
11h37:

      Okay, so it's not it's better than I expected, but still some
      problems. So the suggestion I had with the thought I had was
      that if people could rename their rename themselves to include
      your group number in parentheses, or somehow otherwise included
      on the on the name line. So let's see if I can.
      So if you click on your picture, I'm clicking on mine right now.
      And then I'm doing rename.
11h40:

      I'm gonna try that again. So I can see it.
11h41:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I thought zero because I'm not in any group particularly, but
      I'm in every group. Okay, so a few people have been able to do
      that. Now, let me see if any of the people in the list
11h43:

      working my way down the list here, sorry. I forget what you can

    msg: >-
      Okay, john Sorenson. Carter was there for a minute.
      All right. Yeah. So it's an opportunity for improvement with the
      design of a window. I think
11h47:

    msg: >-
      boots are not inclined to fly into it.
      Okay, so
      I just called some names again here and if you can reply in the
      chat with your group number, okay.

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I'm going to stop sharing the screen so I can look at the
      names of everyone

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So in future Can we?
      Let's see. So the people who weren't pre assigned to a group
      earlier, did you register with a non eugenic email address?
11h58:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I'm just gonna type this in. So doesn't matter which one you
      have

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay,
      so I think I have everybody in the right group now including for
      people in group 14
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so if you so either if you register with your email
      address but if you're happy registering without if you'd rather
      use not your your vagina address to register for the zoom
      meetings then just let me know what is your preferred email
      address and I'll update it so.
      So the process can go more smoothly.
      If you want to change your net rename yourselves to be to
      include your project group in your name. That's another way to
      speed things along.
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, everybody's in a group. See?
      I think so.

      I put you there.
      Check again.
      Okay, so there's a common vote. Group numbers to group members.

      in the right in the proper groups. Okay, so I'm going to start

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So maybe I'll post that in the link to the chat before I break
      away here.
      So I'm a little frustrated because the breakout rooms window is
      over top of everything. And I can't even if I give another
      window of focus, it's not. It's not giving up its front row
      seat. so to speak.

      email address. Send me an email so that I can link the two email
      addresses together. And I can update the spreadsheet for the
      group assignments. So then you'll just be put into the right
