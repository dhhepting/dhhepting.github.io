      Okay, so let me start by sharing my screen and we'll go over a
      couple of things. there any questions? So thanks for some notes
      that people sent me about the date for
      the second assignment, I fixed that now.
11h34:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so here's the semesters, our, our class page here. So
      we're meeting 18. So I rearrange things a little bit here. So
      instead of having next meeting at all, and reading this
      separately, I've put the button for the table meetings to be
      here as well.
      So if you have comments or concerns or problems with the way
      that I've got things set up on the web here, please send me a
      note in the participation forum,
11h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      think that'd be the best place to do that. So we can discuss the
      usefulness of this page that I have created here. Okay, so
      then here are the assignments. So then the IDA ideate. Ida, I'm
      not sure how to pronounce that differently.
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      This sounds funny when they say it. So three weeks from now, and
      basically, I want you to think about based on your own
      experiences, my website
      issues, unmet needs that you have, or maybe it's
      unfair, unfulfilled potential. So the use of topics might be
      interesting if they were expanded in some way. So that's, that's
      the general area, I would like you to brainstorm on. And present
      a couple of ideas at least. I mean, not not an order of
      magnitude more than two but not zero and not one, but two or
      three are far too is fine. But if you this is where I get into
      problems by saying this things like the target is 123 pages. It
      could be more, and it could be a little less than that to that.
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      That's the general idea.
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I know that last night, I had a problem with your
      courses that it said that it was overloaded. That's first time
      I've ever gotten that message. But then when I reloaded it, I
      got in. So maybe it's just an intermittent problem.
      Anyway, okay, so that's due in three weeks.
      Let's see if I can get into your courses. So the topics that I
      mentioned in that assignment are right here on the course
      offering page.
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Your courses work for me earlier today. I sent out the
      invitation.
      Waiting for your courses. Yeah, so it's just waiting for me.
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Just says to me, it's still waiting.
      So I have this page up. Let me try and refresh it. Yes. So this
      is the same message I got last night.
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      It went away. It went away quickly last night. He appeared once
      but seems to be a little more persistent today.
      Oh, okay, I got in now this time.
      Okay, maybe I spoke too soon she was his son look like oh,
      here's another database connection failed, looks like to me
11h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I won't click on anything here but maybe you can just
      look at things quickly.
      Little bit here No.
      So I've created these different I've created different forms
      instead of just having a required and optional subscription. So
      I'm printing the zoom meeting invitations the form in our
      meetings topic this list of meetings goes to
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the table of meetings as I showed you earlier and the list of
      media for meetings
      and then individual assignments
      so instead of having a discussion with each one I've put them in
      the individual assignments discussion that's in the for its own
      separate forum.
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So and then there's a difference last assignment last individual
      assignment depending where they're undergraduate. So that's
      group you and then or graduates which is group g for grad
      so I'm trying to make it connect here so i three dash g needs to
      belong to group G. So this link is still available outside of
      your courses, but I've just made the link to the description
      anyway
      restricted inside your courses so you can look at it on the
      website. But then the assignment submission is the more
      important one in terms of restriction so you can submit to both
      of them
11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so here for the project to have the project assignment
      discussions and within group communication forums
      so I don't have any, any discussion for the individual pieces
      anymore so when I put the discuss link on my way Page, I'm going
      to this this more general forum.
11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay. So all the stuff here that you can't see that you can see
      because it's on my screen. That's just some leftovers from last
      time. So I have a shepherd exam discussions forum. And the link
      to the previous exams and the midterm is Thursday. And the final
      exam is the 22nd of December. And then the participation,
      attendance and meeting attendance, engaging in meetings, reading
      your group members, densifying bugs just in features, of course
      related websites. So that means your courses and my personal
11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      website for the course. You could suggest additional resources
      and annotate meeting discussions and suggest exam questions. So
      those are all things that are part of participation, I think.
      So I don't know that I saw anything about exams.
      Okay, so let's go back to
11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      this this semester link helpful. I'm curious how you get to
      material on my website? Is it through your courses or Kiko to
      this website directly. Anyway,
11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so it's a good connection between your courses and this website.
      That work well.
      Okay, so if you can't, if you're having problems with your
      courses today. And so you can, if possible, put them in the exam
      discussions, forum if you have questions or suggestions about
      the exam, because if you're not able to do that, send them by
      email to me. You can use that you can send to Daryl Hepting at
      you regenda.ca. And if you
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      put 428 and or 828 in the subject that'll be out. For me to find
      it in a timely fashion.
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I have I think I've updated all the transcripts, except 11 is
      still giving me a little bit issue, some strange character in
      the file that I have to, it's not allowed. So I have to figure
      out what that's what's happening there. And I'll do that after a
      meeting.
      Anyway, so exams. So let's take a look at midterm from last
      offering and see if there are questions or concerns.
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I got in trouble with this because
      not everybody saw this one, or it was not uniformly recorded in
      people know what's going on the web in terms of I think the
      meeting where I discussed this was written over some at some
      issue. That wasn't caught until later. And then.
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Anyway,
      so Double Diamond isn't a way to think about design process.
11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So here's a description of the Double Diamond. Anyway, we didn't
      talk about this particularly, but I just wanted to show you an
      image of it. Let's invest time.
      So, the idea is you start position every discover you see the
      sorry, where I'm pointing.
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, in the discovery phase,
      looking to think broadly and maybe do a bit of brainstorming or
      breadth first processing, divergent thinking, so or another
      number of alternatives we have is growing. And then at some
      point, then we try and converge as we define things.
      And then once you develop, define the problem word another
      narrowing here in the center. Then as we develop ideas as we
      begin to design alternatives for our, the things we've defined,
      then arc thinking can then diverge again, we have breadth first,
      read first brainstorming to get to develop different ideas. And
      then we converge. And then that's more of a depth first
      thinking. We're pruning branches, so to speak, and going deeply
      down the path and fleshing out the path to deliver the best idea
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      from amongst all the alternatives we have at this stage.
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Does that make sense?
      Thanks for the feedback. Okay, so that's
      go back to
      midterm exam here last year. Okay.
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So trying to be cute and Leon and never go away? So I presented
      a multiple choice question. So the advanced danowsky run is a
      black diamond, Double Diamond.
      And the brand of cheeses also blackdiamond. Strangely enough.
      So the second question is, give an example of a trade off and
      design and explain it. So I think we talked about the idea of
      trade offs.
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So for example, when we're looking at putting, using a metaphor,
      and we're using a symbol on in an interface.
      If we have a symbol that's very general, it may not be
      suggestive enough. But the other concept we're trying to convey
      or it might be too specific.
      In that we, the concept gets applied too narrowly because the
      example is too, too specific.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      For example, let's see if you're trying to convey the idea of a
      car. And if we have a
      let's say a sports car something say a Lamborghini or something
      like that. A very relatively rare sports car although I there is
      one scene around in town maybe two years. But that doesn't
      necessarily say car to people. So much as i don't like a Ford,
      Ford Fusion or Well, they don't make those anymore. Could a four
      four door sedan might say car in the general sense? Does that
      make sense?
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Any questions about that?
      Okay, so how about in future? If you just, if I ask to make
      sense, you can just click Yes or no? How's that? If it doesn't
      make sense, if there are knows that all I'll do some explaining.
      Or I'll try a different way to explain things.
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      Okay, so to trade off.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, I tried to use the example of metaphor is a trade off. So if
      we use a specific metaphor, like a cut, like a picture of a
      specific make and model of a car, then we may encourage people
      to think too specifically about vehicles and not think about
      cars, but think about, like the Lamborghini sports car. And not
      and not transfer ideas about cars that say, you know, that have
      four wheels and a motor and so forth. car doors, and they need
      some kind of fuel to run and so on and so forth. So those might
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      be some general ideas that we're trying to convey with a with a
      metaphor with by by focusing on or by using a car, you want to
      get some of those ideas at some of those ideas. And the car
      provides transportation
      and so on. So if we have a sports car, we may not think about
      cars as transportation, so much as cars, the car being some
      other kind of signal signifying something else like recreation
      or status, and so forth. So the trade off is
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      if we're using the, the image, an image, let's say, to represent
      the concept.
      Then the trade off is between using a specific, detailed
      image and then having things be taken to literally Your views
      are focused, the risk would be having the user focus too,
      specifically on aspects of the concept
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      related by the picture, or if we have more of a conceptual
      drawing of a vehicle,
      then we might lose some of the details. It might be too general
      and not specific enough to convey the information to make the
      connection to the user of what's important in the interface. So
      make sense.
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Somebody's got their microphone on. Do us Yes, I'm gonna say to
      drew
      No, sorry. I just kind of do my blue that at first and it is
      done. Sorry about that. Yeah, that's fine. I'm gonna I'll meet
      you.
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay. What's the difference between user experience and
      usability?
      Can we have good user experience and poor usability?
      So user experiences are the emotional side of interaction.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So something might be fun to do.
      And gives us
      as positive feelings as we interact with that. So that's more of
      the user experience. And the usability is more of the technical.
      Can we accomplish things? Can we accomplish tasks?
      in an efficient manner? Is it clear what needs to be done? Are
      the gaps of the goals of execution and evaluation? Are these
      smaller or large. So if they're small, then then that's a sign
      the things are usable. The so you may have the issue where
      things are usable, but they're not particularly fun to, to work
      with. They might be doll playing. So that can affect so the
      usability might be good and the user experience might be poor.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      That makes sense.
      Okay, thanks.
      What is design thinking? No. I yes.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yeah. Okay, so for question three, I do have a question
      today I do have a question. Because the third part of the
      question is saying kind of, can an interface have a good user
      experience and a poor visibility. So I was also thinking about
      what we did explain was an interface having a good visibility,
      but a poor experience as a poor user experience. So can you give
      us an example where the interface is having a good user
      experience and a poor
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      usability?
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Well, there's a video that comes to mind and I'll
      share that just in one second here.
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So this is the one good design makes you happy.
      So there's an example in there. There's an example of a juicer
      done by Phillipe Starck I think, but it's he has an example
      where
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      there's a gold plated version of the juicer, it looks like a
      spaceship reminds me of the original War of the Worlds movie The
      spaceships. Anyway, so it's got three legs.
      Anyway, so it's gold as a gold plated version of this juicer,
      and they come so it's very nice to look at and can appreciate
      the design and you have very positive experience with it. But
      it's not usable because the orange juice or the acid in the
      orange juice would peel away the or adult the gold plating on
      it. So that's an example of
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      something that has a good user experience that has poor
      usability mean so there's, there's regular version of the juicer
      that does work for for juicing oranges but and there's another
      example in the video but Austin mini where the car is is
      indicated you know, has lots of faults but you should consider
      it in review says it has lots of faults but considered anyway
      because it's a lot of fun to drive. The design is is lots of Fun
      details in it. It's it's a nice car to drive. It's nice car.
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Nice car to drive. Yeah. Thanks.
      Okay, so question five is an example of an exam question that
      uses recall, rather than recognition, is it preferable? So this
      is the this is one of the heuristics that we talked about. So
      recall rather than recognition, or anywhere has to be able to
      recall something, we're saying, let's see, no, what's the name
      of the command to do such and such. So that's recall,
      recognition would be having the commands listed in a menu and
      then being able to select from them. So instead of having to
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      remember whether it's delete, or remove or expand your extra pay
      to her, I've seen expense for deleting things, but not sure but
      an even Wilder version than that. Right, instead of having to
      remember the name of the command, Jaffa type in you can see the
      the options that are available in a menu. So that's the contrast
      between recall and recognition.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that makes sense.
      So then I had a bit of a longer question here about doing an
      empathy map for something that you might do on the course
      website.
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Any questions about empathy maps?
      I see one No. Okay.
      Go ahead.
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Hello, professor. Yeah.
      I was thinking about the empathy maps like whenever I was making
      an empty map, for the feels like every user feels uncomfortable
      about it, ask or happy or satisfied. So usually, I try to like,
      like, happy for doing this or unsatisfied about this feature.
      And I have seen like, not to give the reason the sick and happy,
      satisfied, confused. So what's better just to write the feel
      that way or the reason as
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      well.
      So if you're talking, so if you're doing this with somebody
      else, and you're asking them how they feel about added. I mean,
      you might ask them why. So I mean, so I think that's not bad
      information to include. If it's available, you know, I'm
      frustrated that I can't,
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I can't find a certain thing. Or I'm happy that I can.
      I can come that it's clear that this is I'm happy that the
      interface supports be doing this, because it seems to be
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      design designed for the task I want to complete. For example,
      maybe. But so I would just say, My feeling is that if you say
      happy, sad, frustrated, and you go through the range of
      emotions, that it may not just be.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      It's not clear, like at the same time, it's happy and
      sad. So we're actually pointing out something the user is happy
      about, and something that has bothered
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      by Yeah, I mean, not, it's not a requirement for
      for the user to be, you know, sad or frustrated. They may have
      just have a really good experience with the interface. So if
      anyone has a really good experience, then there are many
      opportunities for design. And I saw an article recently that
      said, you know, the, the baseline is improved a lot over the
      past years, because there's fewer changes that are
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      being demanded, I guess. But that doesn't mean that everything
      is doing well. I mean, I would say that, you know, in our
      experience with zoom, for example, the idea of putting together
      breakout rooms and and managing them is a bit different than
      it's a bit more of a challenge than I would like them to be. You
      know, for example, if I can create random breakout rooms, it'd
      be nice to
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      keep get a list of the people in each group. So I could use them
      again next time or if there is more of an integration between
      the breakout room feature and other ones. So that reminds me of
      that Apollo 13. And I don't think I shared that link with you.
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So here's an example or here's a more detail about that.
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, I just got it. I don't know if you can see this No, probably
      not because it's a different application. But responses have
      been restored on your courses. So this should not be a further
      problem.
      Cuz another one in here. Well, I'm here.
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so anyway, the reason I brought that up is because there
      are different formats for lots of things and zoo. And I think
      now that it's becoming more popular, it was COVID to do classes
      and online meetings and so on,
      that some of the differences are being or some of the
      difficulties or or the limits of design, the present is coming
      more apparent. So if I go
12h28:

    msg: >-
      so you see here, so I have my profile. And then my current
      profile and then webinars, meetings and webinars, recordings and
      settings and reports. So it's not clear to me what the
      difference between meetings and webinars are.
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So webinars couldn't handle 10,000 participants.
      That's good to know, I guess. So it's not
      not something that concerns us. So then, so I'm not sure that
      needs to be here.
      But so we have meetings, and recordings and reports.
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      And then I want to upload
      the breakout room spreadsheet then requires another format
      and then also the breakout rooms. The chat chats from the
      breakout rooms are not saved in an orderly fashion, either which
      It's disappointing.
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Anyway, not to pick on soon too much.
      Okay, so those are the questions I asked last time around.
      Anything that's
      soon, they already like to
      have any questions or comments about are things that you like
      better than others.
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I think that the way they did it last semester.
      Okay, let me try and keep up with comments on the chat on the
      chat. So the exam will be done synchronously. So it our class
      time.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      We won't be using the proctor track, we'll just use your
      courses. And we'll see how it goes. We can think differently
      about the final exam. And we have not set on particular way of
      doing things. So last, in winter, we did I gave an option for
      doing the synchronous exam or kind of a take home rate in exam.
      But they were both timed the time differently.
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So my feeling is that if we're doing things that are
      related to designing and and doing analysis of interfaces, and
      yeah, sir, working working with an interface and applying the
      ideas we've discussed in class, then it's harder to cheat. And
      so I think we can have a bit more flexibility that way. That's
      just my feeling about it now.
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so that's that was a private comment in chat. Now,
      regarding empathy maps, so some things might be very similar.
      What do you see the major difference being okay, well,
      so it's hard to understand what other people are thinking. And
      feeling so the way we might ask them, we might ask them
      questions. And we might
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      ask them to use what's called known as a think aloud protocol so
      that they verbalize what they're
      that they verbalize what they're going through in terms of their
      thought process. And this may feel a little bit
      I say. So this might change the results that we get from just by
      having the people do things the way they do them, instead of
      having to describe them, because that might make things they
      might do things differently as they're describing them or
      thinking about them, in order to describe them, and they may not
      describe them, exactly the way they would do them.
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So maybe it's true that some people don't, wouldn't say anything
      when they're talking to the screen, you know, maybe some people
      don't get into arguments with Siri. But I am guilty of that from
      time to time. You know, so maybe there's not so much that you
      can hear people say to record on in the under the, under the
      says, In the says quadrant of an empathy map.
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So between thinks and feels and says and does.
      So I think they are related. And they're probably going to be
      more related as we're doing things for ourselves. If we're
      talking about ourselves, as the user being with whom we're
      trying to gain some empathy.
      But even for ourselves, there might be some we might expose some
      things by code to the process and talking through it and
      thinking about it. And verbalizing questions and concerns we
      have and we might get some more insight anyway.
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I guess when I think about the difference between says and
      thanks.
      So I would say that maybe some things appear under says, or
      maybe some things appear under thinks. And it's less important
      to think, to get classified in the proper quadrant, but to
      record them in a way that lets us have more empathy for what the
      user is going through.
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I would say the map is the whole process.
      Using the map is part of a process to understand what the user
      is going through. And so sometimes the distinctions are, are
      more important, and sometimes they're less important. Now if I
      helped clarify that or not.
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, thanks. So. So for this midterm, should you prepare by
      practicing these questions? Well, so as I, as I say, my standard
      joke is, if there are no suggested questions, there's still be
      an exam. So the idea of suggesting questions and both terms of
      topic and format, will help to
12h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      have an exam that that's a fair assessment of what we've done to
      date. And I know that we've, this has not been an ideal
      situation. I think part of the experience, I'm going to say it's
      a positive from the online experience. And so we get to think
      about
      the interface that zoom or other things provides us and so that
      we get to explore and interface in

      sometimes in real time, as we go through and so you've had her
      share hiccups using the breakout rooms and so on.
      Like I mentioned with the my experience of studying wallpaper
      patterns first semester, if you think about
12h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I got a lot of comments here. So I would encourage you
      to think about in terms of preparing for the exam, think about
      what we've done and what we've discussed so far this semester,
      and create some sample questions that you'd like to that you
      think would be a good assessment of our learning. So should we
      prepare by practicing these questions? Yes. And that's one way
      to do it. And another way is to create your own questions and
      share them with me.
12h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so.
      So, the question of PowerPoints and so forth. So, the book
      website has PowerPoints for each chapter.
12h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that's those are available online
      if you'd like to, if you're not happy without PowerPoints.
      So thanks for the posting the quote about everstream says, and
      thanks.
      See, we're at a time here. So I hope that was helpful in some
      ways.
12h47:

    msg: >-
      And I'll have an office hour today at two. And if you have
      questions or concerns, please post them online. I'm encouraged
      by the note to say that your course is going to be back back to
      normal. So we can use that as a platform for our discussion.
      Anyway, so let you go then.

      Yeah, I just wanted to ask one last thing, like we

      during the exam? Or is it like, we just need to go to your
      courses and take the exam.

      It'll be on your courses, so we won't we won't
