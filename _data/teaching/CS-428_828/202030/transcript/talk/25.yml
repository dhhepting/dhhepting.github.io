      Oh
      well, so how many people saw the email about the meeting or the
      presentation on a week from yesterday makes sense on the ninth
      of December that we talked about the other day.
11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So let me go to that web page and
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      This is a
      talk and eat proctoring or proctor track
      let me paste it into the chat before I get the other thing going
      here.
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so let me get the
      screen that I want to share with you.
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay I'm sending you links and like event. Facebook anyone still
      uses Facebook
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so here's the details on Facebook and two people have
      responded.
11h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And I'm one of them. Okay. I want to tell you how to get a
      Christian.
      So here's the here's the page with the meeting registration.
      All right. So moving the host, I'd like to register. I'd like to
      get more information registrations. Does it seem like this might
      be a good place for me to find out that information?
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I'd like to let people know that I'm going to be there. And you
      anyway.
      All right. So what happened here is a message that says
      there's a message that says the host cannot register, but it's
      also not necessarily in a spot. It's easily noticeable. If I had
      let's see if I have
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      a page like this. I know this event I want to register. Okay,
      I'm not a robot.
      I'm not a robot.
      It doesn't show me the message and then I have to go and find
      it.
      So is this an issue of interaction design, or information
      design?
11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So what's the problem here? I'm getting feedback, but I'm not
      getting feedback, right? where it's at the site of interaction.
      So if I'm clicking the Register button here, that's the
      interaction design. But then the information design part
      is having the display of the message be near
11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Then just need to send a letter over again.
      So I know that something's going on here because now an arrow
      notice how that change the display the positioning of the
      information. I got another error, because I made it a little
      more noticeable, I think. And it also changed the message so
      drew my attention more easily.
11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So ha, oh, what's an approach to let me check on registrations?
      If you are the host of this meeting, how would you check on
      registration? You see, this is the page where it should be
      available.
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Makes sense? Question
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the question is, my question for you is
      how do we convey the information about
      where to click, where to click for the most information?
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So how would you present this information or this capability to
      people?
      And would it be only available to people who have
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so let's look at
11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, I guess I can close this and this floor and shirt.
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So let's look at the help documentation for
      registration.
      So it turns out that when, once I set up, registration is
      required. We're here Then registration and brand new tabs will
      appear. And I can click view to see less people have registered
      for the meeting.
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so then there are some options for registration. So let's
      see what it looks like for that meeting.
      Okay, I don't think I'm gonna give away to any top secret
      information here showing you the screen.
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I didn't, I thought that I didn't have waiting room set up. Let
      me see if what happens if I click on this? x, there's an X
      beside a waiting room. Okay.
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So before, and I was looking at this for at least 30
      registrants. So let me see what.
      So going through this to understand a little bit more. If I'm
      going to guess what this means a security, there's a passcode
      set that's not visible to you. And there's no waiting room set
      up.
      So it's either either the X would mean delete the waiting room
      or it means there is no waiting room to be deleted. So you can
      see the issue of
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      importance of consistency and feedback and interfaces when you
      look at
      these ambiguous pieces of information.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it's interesting that, so have a setting that says when
      people join when participants join the meeting, they're muted.
      So in this case, I'm considered a participant. I'm not
      considered the host. So that is not consistent. And it can lead
      to some issues, I think.
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So let me just go back and check on
      the southern meeting. Okay, I'll stop sharing that.
      Okay, so that's better now I have 4034 people registered.
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, otherwise these tabs, as they're called in the documentation
      for registration and branding don't appear unless I'd have
      registration required.
      So now, let me get back to our discussion about
      well, Okay, one more thought about one or two more thoughts
      about the registration page here for the meeting. Would you be
      interested to know how many people are registered for the
      meeting if you're thinking about going
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if you don't want to know who is how many others are
      attending, you don't need to look at it. But I don't think that
      just having the number of registrations available or the number
      of people registered as a number of a display is compromising
      anyone's information.
      There's no option for that.
      So anyway, back to my homework for yesterday from yesterday
      about
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      templates for meetings.
      So let's see if I can show you
      coming up.
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so you can see this one is set up with 14 breakout rooms.
      I have the option to save this is a template. So let's do that
      for the back of it.
      So now, if I want to create an
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      go back to my meetings, and then I can say schedule a meeting.
      Then I can select a template. So now that there are templates, I
      can select them and use them. So let's
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      see what happens when they use the template that we just
      created.
      The date
      time
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so here we see that checking the meeting options that we
      got, I guess, would really set with a template, Breakout Room
      pre assign are not pre assigned.
      So it's not clear what information is being carried over
      with a template and just how it's being used, for example,
      whether this sound played when people enter the room or not
      enter or leave the room, pardon me. That's not in the list of
      things available from the template and the meeting settings.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that part seems to be off the table in terms of having a
      template. Which is
      problematic for me who if I'd like to have my office hours that
      people have announced their presence by having a door bell ring
      or something like that. But not have it for public lecture
      series events? And I'm not and then I'm not quite sure how to
      deal with it
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      based on I've seen in the interface, so that makes sense. I
      mean, in terms of some, basically, whatever my expectations of
      templates are, they're not being met by the template feature
      here. So the template may be useful. But I don't have any
      intuition about how to make it useful. Because it doesn't say
      save the time. It doesn't save.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      It doesn't certainly configure or maybe it does, let me choose
      which items to include in the template, but I don't know how to
      access them without getting into health, which is always so
      helpful. So
      So let's see if I have been successful in updating my website.
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I can get updated
      okay let's see whether I can get my Krishna one local coffee
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      not sure why
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the parent directory
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Just want to make sure that it's working on the website now
12h22:
  talks:

    msg: >-
      regenerators
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, I have to figure out why not DITA let's let's the kinder
      gentler version of don't want to beat a dead horse. Anyway.
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, this is what
      trying to get I was trying to get you on my website. I think
      I've created a PDF of this file and I just wanted to make it on
      the part of the same exam series of exams as before, past exams
      as before. So these are the eight questions that were on the
      midterm. And I wanted to talk about some today that 15 minutes
      left. And I wanted to get your sense about
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      if using proper track is necessarily with all its full blown
      nausea inducing
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      features are keeping track of you. But so the first link I said
      at the beginning of the meeting was about the recent statement
      from the levar. About you proctoring. And so you can, I will put
      a discussion about that on on your courses, so if if the
      information you have, you're providing to Proctor track is
      protected, so you're not exposing yourself in any way is a good
      to have a proctoring setup so that we can be convinced we can be
      confident that the playing field is level, so to speak. or is
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that not a concern for you? And you'd rather avoid any kind of
      proctoring.
      So I don't want to I would I value your input, but I'm not
      certain. Well, I'm not sure now.
      Oh, not using reasonable technology to support
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      fair assessment of your work and learning in the class
      is optional for me. So I will look for your input and we can
      discuss it further on Tuesday.
      Okay, so just to go over these here. The first seven they
      weren't in any order, and or they were in different orders for
      everybody.
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      The first seven is listed here are four marks each. And the
      question eight, St. Mark's. So the relationship between
      intuition and interface metaphors. So we talked about that
      today. In fact,
      I'm looking to get some I have some intuition when the the
      phrase template is used. And when I observe the behavior of the
      interface, I don't see how my intuition that comes with a Word
      template. metaphor, how it's
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      how it's my intuition is being supported or being well used with
      a template metaphor.
      So we talked ourselves anyway, so it makes sense
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So by using a zoom meeting I think I think that is actively
      discouraged to Proctor exams. Anyway, oh. So thanks for that
      input, and I'll review it and contribute it to the discussion,
      which I'll create on your courses. And we can go from there over
      the next few days.
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so Likert scale question is, so we have options. So you
      agree with the statement. So we have the symmetrical options
      presented.
      So they're symmetrical about the middle, whether or not the
      middle is a specific, an option for rating. So, if you strongly
      disagree, then you have the others other option of strongly
      agree. And then you can have disagree and agree. So they're
      both, so those, so there are two options on either side of the
      neutral position. So if we have an even number of options,
      that's how they'll look. So we could have four or six now,
      because you're gonna have to as well.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the idea is that they're perceptually equidistant. So we can
      have the disagree side the
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      using very strong adjectives and the agree side using weak
      adjectives, let's say so that the difference between them is is
      not uniform. So if we have an odd number of alternatives, then
      and we say
      and we, we can label the
      middle part, little point, so strongly disagree, disagree.
      Unsure, agree, strongly agree. So those are equidistant. And
      they're symmetrical. And the choice to make is whether or not we
      want to give people the option of saying unsure. Sounds so so as
      to say, sit on the fence not lean one way or the other. So it's
      useful because we have a way to quantify reaction so. I mean,
      they have their own views. It depends maybe on how people
      understand the scale but we can analyze and summarize the
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      results is in a numeric fashion. So it gives us quantitative
      data.
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, progressive disclosure. So that's a little bit about what
      we talked about today is whether the chevron or whatever
      graphic, we use a plus sign or a minus sign. Whether that
      indicates
      the state of the system, or the command. So what do we click on
      to open the display? Or do we see that as
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      this arrow represent? Or does our chosen display reflect the
      status system or a possible command? So that's, that's kind of
      the issue about it. And then if that affects information,
      presentation or design and interaction design as well. So if
      we're not sure which is which, whether it's a command or whether
      it's the state of the system, that it that affects the clarity
      of our point of view, the clarity with which we can interpret
      the interface and
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      can widen the Gulf of evaluation.
      So, what is necessary to achieve Human Centered Design?
      So, in general, talking with humans
      and empathizing with them, understanding their their needs and
      and their goals and so forth. So to explain Norman doors in the
      context of golf and execution and evaluation.
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, unless it's a really difficult design, in terms of
      usability, know which side of the door to press on to open it or
      to activate, we know which side is the inch, in which side we
      can push or pull on to open the door. The question is,
      question is I then where do we push or do we pull the door to
      open it? And so, there are ways in design there are ways to
      indicate whether a push is possible is required or a pole. And
      for the party that is can be designed.
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      If we have a push and then we could just have a plate on the
      door to push and if we have a full door that can that can be
      communicated by a handle that we grab and pull.
      So push or the pull
      is the choice of the command the the execution And then the
      feedback we get whether or not the door opens, whether we
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      hurt ourselves by going into the door, we expect to be open. And
      then there's other feedback as well, whether the door is locked
      and so on.
      So what is the difference between recall and recognition? So
      this is an example of recall, being asked to recall, the
      definitions of recall and recognition.
12h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, one is about, say recall would be, what's the command to
      delete a file, and recognition is a button that gives you a
      command to delete a file. So you can recognize the command
      without having to look it up or to test it.
      So, there's between usability and user experience. So usability
      is
      smart, more, perhaps quantitative, and user experiences more
      qualitative.
12h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I'm just looking at the time. So
      I will have the marks posted very soon.
      We can discuss them but I'm just LNG to know that I'm,
      well, the 10 marks for the midterm are not going to be a cause
      for concern for anyone. And so I'm not going to be strict in
      terms of marking on this. But I think that reflect
12h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      not gonna be too strict on marking this and value the ideas that
      are expressed. So let's think about that in terms of what the
      final exam will look like and how it can be managed. So that the
      questions asked, Are both fair? Or both the questions asked and
      the process that were you write the exam is fair, as fair as
      possible, under the circumstances, both is a fair assessment of
      your work and,
12h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and fair instrument for evaluating your work if I made enough of
      a distinction between them there. So the last question about how
      to address my unmet need for student participation in this
      course. So I was wasn't with the intention of dealing with
12h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      participation in the dinner zoom sessions, that there was more
      broadly construed, or I took it, I thought of it as in a more
      broad sense. So we'll continue that discussion on online. So
      we'll start that off. And then we can revisit it on Tuesday.
      Okay.
      Anyway, I hope that gives you something for the weekend. I'm not
      trying to
12h47:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      can cause anyone to be panicked about anything. I think we've
      done this semester, it's have a conversation about interfaces
      and how real interface issues impact our performance and looking
      at opportunities to redesign and all those good things. So.
      Anyway, I'll stop there. Anyway, so thanks very much for today.
12h48:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And I'll see you on Tuesday. I'll be around at two for my office
      hours as well. Okay.
      Thanks, everyone. Have a good weekend. Stay well.
