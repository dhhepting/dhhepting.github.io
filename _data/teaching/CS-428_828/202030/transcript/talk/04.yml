      Okay. So we talked about doing an audio transcript class today.
      I think figured out a way to do it and a way to present it. So
      let me show you the screen.

      All right, so here's what what should be on available to you.
      This is actually on my computer but it should have been
      published to you as well. So I have my sketch here
      so I'm working on getting those things together but here let's
      look at the transcript so I can open it up. And then 1127 i,
      this is from last Tuesday. So Can everyone hear me all right,
      come on yeses. Okay. How's everyone doing today? So, I'm With a
      chat transcript, I didn't do very much editing or any at all. I
      may correct some typos if I see them, but I'm going to leave it
      as this. However for for the audio.
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I don't want to subject you to just unedited version of my
      talking. Because that doesn't charge very well anyway. So here's
      the combination. So this is the, this is the audio transcript
      first. Another one from iPod Transcript and then an 1133. This
      is from the chat. And this is from the chat. And there's also an
      audio comment here about seeing that the meeting is being
      recorded in the cloud because there's little dots beside my
      little cloud with a.on. It says it's recording

      said we're going to be experimenting I mean this is a this is a
      class for human computer communication. So let's engage in a
      discussion because I can, so I can identify ways to improve the
      presentation of information in the transcript and otherwise so
      that we
11h42:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      get the most the most benefit from it.

11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Can you? What kinds of things can you see yourself? doing?
      So do you think that the presentation of chat and audio
      transcripts will be offered to you? The kinds of things can you
      see yourself doing with this display? What are the features
      Would you like to see? That was supposed to be a question mark
      there? So if you have, you'd like to use the microphone, put
      your hand up. And if you'd like to answer in the chat, then you
      can go ahead and do that. So can you see the transcript? Just
      one or two people can see can give me a yes. That you can see
11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      the transcript on the window. Okay.

      so I'm gonna thank everyone who said yes, but it doesn't help a
      lot with
      it doesn't help a lot with the specifics of what we might do
      with it.

      Okay, so I'm going to assign you automatically today into
      breakout rooms and there'll be four or five people in every
      Okay, and then I think I can just Go around there. So the reason
      I'm putting you into rooms is to have discussion about the
      question like so the key is I want you to be specific.

      Okay, I can see a few people haven't joined yet.
      Okay Priyanka, run that as five people
      so common about screen names
      so I would appreciate if if you're comfortable doing this just
      to make the your name be the name you'd like me to be calling
      you in class. So first name is fine.

      So just
      see someone who has a screen name of iPhone. And I don't
      remember iPhone being on the class list. So, just a suggestion
      that if you and if the name of the class list isn't the one that
      you'd like to use it here You can just like thinking about
      having a name tag.

    msg: >-
      Okay, so anyone have any particular comments if you had, if you
      strongly disagreed if you didn't think they were useful or if
      you strongly agreed or anything in between any observations
      about the So remember, our discussion will wallpaper the other
      day wallpaper patterns. And so when I was taking that class
      about wallpaper patterns than I was looking at analyze every
      piece of wallpaper I saw. So I'm asking us to be aware of the
      interfaces that exist around you. And think about
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      you know, are they usable? Do you have a good user experience
      from them?
      So there's just a note somewhere on my webpage, there's a story
      about these two fish. Or these two young fish we're talking one
      day and Neil and then older Fish Lamb Bye. Hey, boys. How's the
      water? And then after a minute, the two younger fish look at
      each other and say, What the hell is water. So this is sort of,
      to me, that means that I recover, becoming aware of the
      environment in which we're immersed in. So there are interfaces,
      there are interactions that happen all around us. And I'm asking
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      you to become more sensitive to them. And think about them and
      the client, make notes about what is good about them and what is
      bad about them. So that means breakout rooms, zoom classroom,
      the transcripts that I had. Okay, so enough NASA that any
      comments about or any reports back from the break rooms about
      the question about transcript display so long question, but
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, does anyone have like to speak for their company about the
      discount tell us about the discussions you've had in your
      breakout room about
      the transcript display. So you can
      so I'm looking at the chat transcript, and I thought that group
      chats weren't being put into the main chat. Because what I saw
      when I looked back at the main chat was the last thing that I
      wrote that there is no indication that there's messages below
      what I had last written.
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So I was trying to use the chat window as thinking that the
      latest chat was displayed. The latest chat messages are
      displayed. I click it to mean that breaker room chats didn't go
      to the main chat, but it looks like
      that wasn't the case. So okay.
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so we, oh let you respond yourself to that. So when I
      thought about What I've experimented with in the past is
      encouraging students to do annotations at the meeting. This is
      sort of a summary of having a summary of what was done in class
      and maybe adding a bit more detail to things. So in keeping with
      that, I wonder what seemed to me to be useful is well, so having
      the transcript of the meeting would be useful as a way to focus
      on certain aspects or certain questions. And then I thought
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      perhaps if I'm make an For the different timestamps that you
      could refer to them in your discussions or annotations about
12h42:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      If you wanted to make reference to the ideas in the in the
      meeting, discussion
      then they could use an anchor
12h43:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      so any other thoughts about
12h44:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So there's a common from a student have to conclude the breakout
      discussion we had a similar thought of a chat and voice
      transcripts. We have a shared opinion of breakout rooms and how
      it could be beneficial for each group and then for the little
      So quarter one already. Let's see that we'll take that up at the
      beginning of our meeting next time. So think about how you would
      use the breakout rooms what was good about This is how you would
      use the breakout rooms. And well, I guess so. We'll see you on
      Thursday. And we'll talk more about assignments and things then.
      Okay, thank you for today. See you on Thursday. And I have an
      office hour today from two to three. I also put a link on your
