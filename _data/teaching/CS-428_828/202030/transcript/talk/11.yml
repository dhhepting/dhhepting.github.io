    msg: >-
      and what I need to do is get a list of groups, group numbers and
      email addresses and first I started with the order view which
      gives me a grouping overview which gives me the group
      participants but the link is to your profile on your courses and
      not
      not your email address directly and then I thought well and go
      to participants and I see the information and I can download as
      a CSV which is a comma separated value file and then it didn't
      include the groups so that I have to cut and paste the groups so
      one thing I noticed in Excel that I found is this contact right
      click menu option to remove hyperlinks and that seems to be very
      useful

      sharing my screen but then I'm okay I guess I can do that.

      not sure about these
      column headings. Not what I would have picked
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      We can paste here because the cut area and paste here at the
      same size. Okay?
      Okay, so that should be the correct format. Now let's try and
      save this as the CSV.
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, now I want to select the format. Can you see the dialog
      box for the files in my shared window or not? You see this drop
      down?
      Okay. One minute one yes.
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I assume chat and participant windows or overtops Excel window
      and I can move it around. There we go. So now I'm going to
      select comma separated value. And I just want to make a comment
      about avoiding being aware of little traps that may exist for
      you. So they CSV UTF, eight common delimited void on that one
      because that puts an extra it's called a byte order marker. And
      file which is not a good way to save UTF eight. Anyway, so we'll
      just do the special specialty format. csv, and
11h40:

    msg: >-
      that to me is driven to be less problematic. Yeah.
      I really like these controls to go away. These HTML buttons
      They're not in their own column. And I can't select them. You're
      floating on top, and I can't move the spreadsheet out from
      underneath it either.
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Anyway.
      Okay, so let's see if we can
      accept our groupings
      didn't expect to have the issues getting the email addresses and
      the product groups into this format. Okay

      let's go back to the web interface.
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So before we go into our breakout rooms I want to show you what
      they've been doing to the website here.
      That's a question that we can consider today as our example.
      So here's the first part of the project. So
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I have Okay, can you see this Yeah, you can. Let me switch the
      sharing just this window.
      Okay. So here is so the project is divided into three parts,
      which correspond to the three parts in this diagram. So
      understand
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      rude shape here like doing a sketch Does anyone know about Etch
      A Sketch?
      there? So there's part one
      of the project here. So
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      take screenshots
      after watching CNN a bit yesterday, I feel like I'm sometimes I
      get comments like, I look like wolf blitzer. And so I'm feeling
      a bit of wolf blitzer ish today.
      Whatever that means. You won't get the reference to wolf
      blitzer.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      That's interesting.
      In capture
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so now I just see the blue line of floating over an empty window
      from my attempt to capture the screen.
      Save the screen.
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      So the idea of the project is to take an eight
      an existing website, or application, because we're not going to
      be changing code. We're going to be addressing interface issues.
      So the idea that you start from scratch when something is less
      productive, I think Then then working on something that exists
      already. And
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so I just said here in the top note group, we chose to choose
      this website. And I put a change, I was gonna put, I'm not sure
      about the voice here. I was going to say my website. But anyway,
      because we're going to use it for examples in class.
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so there are three parts to this submission. So describe
      what you're doing. So for each part member of your group,
      describe an activity using that your chosen website or
      application and a user wanting to complete that activity. So
      maybe this needs to call me here to complete that activity with
      sufficient detail to
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      be relatable.
      So it's it's modifying, should be modifying the script both
      descriptions. So I should move it over. I should move this. Over
      here.
      Put as a subordinate clause, here describe with sufficient
      detail to be relatable, an activity and a user way to complete
      that activity. So you can, you don't have to, you can use
      yourself as the user, you don't have to use your name. You can
      change names to protect the innocent, so to speak.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      But there might be something that you find as some discussion,
      your website that you're choosing has some discussions online
      from users who are asking questions about features, how to do
      certain things. So that that could also be a source of the
      activity and user descriptions. So then everyone in your group
      will create. Everyone, everyone in your group creates activity.
      And the description of the user wanted to complete that
      activity.
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And so if you love the show, you have three or four activities.
      And then each group member does an empathy map for each
      activity. So then you'll have each group member will do three or
      four, empathy maps and then together. You can look at the
      results. You can look at these empathy maps and look for issues,
      unmet needs. And
      and that's the person thanks The other side of the stage is
      concerned with understand the opportunities for redesign with
      your selected website or software application.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So don't think about don't say it has a problem with this, which
      I'm going to fix this way or that way. Because you want to take
      time to understand problems. So we can do some. So we're not
      restricted by previous ideas
      of shut down the breadth first ideas
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      before by going too soon, to depth first and getting getting to
      the fix for that issue. So first, so like for, like when we're
      fixing software, or maintaining software, we want to make sure
      we understand the problem and all the implications of the
      problem. So you can apply, you can create a patch that addresses
      the root cause and not just the symptoms. That makes sense. Does
      that seem okay for a start?
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, and as I get questions, so you can see when this gets
      updated, it'll be appear here. So there's a link to your courses
      here.
      So looking at the links, I think I made this see this link in
      the other one she needs to discuss link. Let's see.
      Yeah, I flipped them around. So I'll fix that quickly. shortly.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I thought this would just resolve itself, we're going to have to
      ask your courses support for what possible solution.
      Okay, so I'm not going to show you that. But I did create a
      discussion forum for it. And there's a link to the your courses
      submission. And so based off your questions, use the link on the
      your courses page. Okay.
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So let's see if we can switch over to this other meeting. So
      that's the link that I sent you.
      The links in the chat.
      Okay, I guess I have to
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      just needing to
      make sure I have this link here.
      Okay, so we're gonna end the meeting and start the other one.
      Okay?
