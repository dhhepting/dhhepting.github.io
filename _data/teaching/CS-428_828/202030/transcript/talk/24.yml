      So fast qu created Microsoft Windows Task Manager and it comes
      up with David Plummer. And he's an alumnus of the University of
      Regina got his bachelor's degree in 1994. And then he went to
      work for Microsoft. And he's going to give a virtual
      presentation on the Secret History of Task Manager a week from
      Wednesday.
      So I'm leery well not leery and double checking my settings for
      meetings. So that I don't have registered registration link or
      the meeting setup to have the doorbell glossy every time

      Ah, I was gonna, I said before, when I came back in, Did you
      miss me? And I said, that wasn't a serious question. But then I
      realized that I was muted. And my camera was off so
      sorry to make a bad joke When, when, when no one can hear me
      almost as bad as what just happened. So I realized that my
      computer was unplugged, and the battery is not in good shape on
      its own. So without warning it get the computer shut down. So my
      apologies for that.
11h45:

      Anyway, where are we here?
      So this is where I was just about to go on from so David Plummer
      is an alumnus. He lives in Seattle area. That in celebration of
      Computer Science Education Week, which has gone on for about 12
      years now. We're having a public lecture. He's going to talk
      about his secret history of taskmanager. So, infected December
      9, because it's grace hoppers birthday and because it's the day
      after exam, after classes finish and the before the final exam
      period starts. So is anyone interested in coming along see that

      I'll give you a few seconds to buzz in so to speak.
      Okay, that's enough I think enough time so I'll share their
      response.
      So Would anyone like to chat about maybe already have you see
      here?
11h50:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      can anyone who knows who she is? Right in the chat a little bit
      about her why it's important. And her connection to Computer
      Science Education Week perhaps.
      So one of the four people answered Yes.

      So she was one of the first programmers. She gave a talk she
      visited the University of China in 1974. She was involved in the
      development of COBOL. Anyone heard of coal all before?
      Yeah, so common business oriented language. See, if I, if I beat
      farewell to the punch line, they're not. Not sure.
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So we used to have a class dealing specifically with COBOL,
      writing COBOL applications, which I may have taught as a grad
      student here some years ago. But maybe she's more familiar, more
      famous for creating the term creating the use of term a computer
      bug. Because one of the earliest systems with all the vacuum
      tubes and so on, she found a MOS that had shorted out a circuit
      and at given a slave

      inside the computer, it's hard to think of a loss, doing much
      damage inside a computer of modern proportions. But when
      computers filled up parts of her entire rooms, and there's
      plenty of space for mods to fly in. Maybe makes more sense.
      Yeah, so she popularized the word, the phrase computer bug. And
      I think somewhere there's even a picture of the life that she
      found a picture of the mosque along with a note about error it
      caused. And she also, I believe, is more importantly, create

    msg: >-
      credited with the, with the phrase, it says it's easier to ask
      forgiveness than permission. Or some variation of that. Yeah.
      She made an appearance on David Letterman. 1980, something to
      think it might still be available on YouTube.
      Anyway, so computer science education, started in 2010. To
      promote the cause of computer science education, in schools. And
      it was scheduled to include the date is December 9, because
      that's when that's grace hoppers birthday. And so it's a nice
      connection for the university here. When the computer science
      department or Department of Computer Science first started.
      There was she was the first speaker in the computing science
      speaker in the vaster field lecture series which was run by the

    msg: >-
      Faculty of Science
      and you I digress a little bit. So what I wanted to do let me
      see if I could find the right.
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So you can see this web page, right? Because that's
      just in the web browser. It's not in zoom per se. So I want to
      what I want to do is
      review my settings for
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the zoom meeting invitation. So I can send it out and if you're
      interested

12h01:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      It's not enough information.
      Okay, so I think that I've turned a sign turned off the waiting
      room.
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And I'm meeting participants upon entry. All participants to
      join anytime. So that means they can come in and
      after 7pm start
      required alternative.
      Okay, so there's that. And now here's the tricky part I think.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the way where the doorbell is located it's already here in
      settings.
      So which I remember earlier today
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I can turn on the host video, audio time.
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So to me, it seems like there's I have a feeling with your
      courses that I'm selecting as a feeling similar to with your
      courses is that I'm selecting options. But I'm not sure whether
      they work together or how they work together.
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So again, here I'm not sure about because on the earlier earlier
      when I say on the details for the meeting, I set mute all
      participants when they join a meeting. All right, did something
      similar so let me turn that one on.
      Okay, so here's the one that I was turned on and I forgot where
      it was found notifications enjoys your leaves. So if I turn that
      on, I can play sound for everyone coming and going, or the host
      or co host.
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      The sounds are better, fewer sounds are better. I don't think we
      need file transfer on.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I think I've gone through all that irrelevant.
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      Okay, so I think I've got the settings sorted out here.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Now, if I can go back to
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      See if we can create a template
      Okay, let's see where the template
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      okay.
      So my screenshare still working all right, still seeing that
      let me go back and see those directions
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so the directions are this. You can choose a meeting, edit
      and save as a template
      All right. So let's go do that.
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So is it a good sign when users doing full text search on the
      web page to see what options are available?
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, there we go save meeting as a template. Not on the Edit
      screen. But
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      all right. Go back to meetings.
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      is a template already associated with the other meeting? Or
      is it not associated with it?
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it seems like I can't I'm not sure that I can edit the
      template and have changes be applied to all the meetings that
      use it.
      What kinds of behaviors Do you think that's a reasonable
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      understanding of what template is?
      Okay, so without me drawing, there's an eight letter word. I'm
      not going to draw the blanks here.
      So if I, if I'm new to this interface, and I say use the meeting
      template
      that's a metaphor that helps. Helps me shift around the word
      blanks on a page
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that helps me to influences my mental model of cable, what
      capabilities exist in the interface.
      So if I don't understand what template is, or maybe their use of
      the word template is different from my understanding
      and maybe I'm different maybe all of you would get a certain
      sense from using the template
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that's different from mine.
      So let's make up a poll and
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so do you get to see these windows? The Add a poll window.
      I'm not sure that it's coming up for you.
      Okay, so, what are some things that we expect to be in a
      template
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      leading
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I have a couple features associating template with
      meetings, or that you can associate a template with meetings and
      editing associated template and make changes to the meetings.
      Anything else? Any other ideas about features that you expect to
      fear the word meeting template?
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So maybe this is a little different copy of.
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so, a comment about a template. It's a format a prescribed
      way of doing something.
      So what I've written Is that another way to think about a
      template is to copy the settings use copy settings used to fill
      in started starting values for new form.
      Meeting.
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, any other Additions for me? Put this to vote.
      Okay, seeing none for now.
      If you started other than you can tell me what you think they
      should be in the chat. Okay, so
      seek an answer. These are not just Choose one, but you can
      choose multiple ones.
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So a question is, if number three, the copy of settings used to
      fill in starting values for next meeting is that compatible with
      the other two
      especially the number two, and it associated template changes
      meetings.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So while we're letting you answer that, I mean, this tell you a
      little bit of the canadapost app that I use because my son is in
      Amsterdam, and he's not gonna make it home for holidays. So we
      sent him a package and the app they have
      there are a couple of things what one is said make a detailed
      list of contents because they were creating a customs form for
      me which I thought was a nice way to do it. And then it gave me
      a QR code that I could scan at the at the post office to create
      the paperwork that actually associated with the package. But it
      said be detailed and signs being detailed. Then abruptly it told
      me that I was being run out of items in my detailed list so then
      I had to edit things to be less detailed.
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And it would have been helpful to say you can describe up to
      five items in this package
      and then another thing that would have been helpful for I put a
      half roll of tape around the box to have been asked the question
      Does it contain any dangerous goods so lithium batteries I
      understand are dangerous but and sanitising gel and acute.
      Spencer? I didn't think to be dangerous, but so then I had to go
      through at the post office and surgically remove the offending
      item from the package.
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And then I think that those are the two main ones.
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, shut off this pool here. Okay, so nobody voted for other
      which is consistent with our consultation beforehand.
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so one in three, we're the one, add one more vote than
      number three. And I suppose we can think of them as not being
      incompatible.
      But to go and do some more looking at who voted for Which ones?
      What, what is or if they're different votes, or how who voted
      for multiple lines.
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      See,
      sorry. Okay, stop sharing the result. And
12h39:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      my meeting
      doesn't say here that it's
      kind of a template, or which template it's using.
      And I go back to
      using templates. And it's not clear if I can edit the template
      directly. So trying, I'll try and gain some understanding of
      this. I'm going to see if I can get my office hours to have the
      doorbell on and everything else to not have the doorbell on. So
      let's see with that.
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      That's possible. So looking at the settings, they seem to be

    msg: >-
      so they're grouped by security. And
      so let's see if I can find where sound is.
      So that's the basic in meeting basic, okay. So I'm going to do a
      couple of experiments. And record back on Thursday. So I
      realized that now we're coming up to our last Thursday meeting.
      And they keep talking about the midterm, talking about the
      midterms but not making time for that in our meetings. So let's
      say that our meeting on Thursday we'll deal with the midterm.
