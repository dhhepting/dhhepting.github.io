      The transcript might not need to be open all the time so I could
      hide some of them.

    msg: >-
      looking at everything is an interface. And looking critically at
      all the interfaces that we encounter What's going on?

      certainly aren't easily discernible in terms of their ordering,
      or which are they're in alphabetical order, but it's not. When
      people have more than two NAF first and last name, then it's not
      clear what name is being used for sorting.
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So there I created a group

  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yeah. There's
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      emails, email, Dr. hafting. Yeah, if you click on
      that, it says it comes out with my name, instead of as my name
      and then the subject is CS 428 plus 828 email contacts.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      And it's good.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that's easiest way to get a hold of me and
      some people have given me contact requests.
      So I, oh, I didn't put on here and the other to update that. And
      just so the people who do for whom I've declined from web to
      client contact requests, it's nothing personal. It's just you
      trying to manage communication, not have it pop up into many
      different places. So I apologize because I thought I had a note
      there.
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so let me add as your group and then we're gonna have a
      discussion about
      this interface for group creation.
      And then I've got another so I'll just do one more group and
      then we'll just have a discussion and I'll, I'll take advantage
      of the other group requests. I'll do that offline or once you're
      in your group disk discussions that seem okay. Alright, so now
      I'm at the homepage. So I have the setting at good yet. I would
      say a wheel like settings more than Actions menu comes up. Can
      you see the the tooltip
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Can you give me Yeah.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Anyone can give me a yes if they see that. Okay.
      So then I go to users. And then
      Okay, so got the empty group and I say add remove users.
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I find it easier to add a person to the group. And
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      more always Shira, Anna and john v.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      All right.
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so we have some groups set up.
      So now there's groups. And so they're also groupings.
      I'm going to create a grouping for that. So
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      not the right one. Not the trash cans, that must be the shot.
      Okay, so I have created 16 blank groups doesn't mean they have
      to be 16. But I just created that so I could avoid this step of
      creating each individual group. So I could create more than I
      need. And then I'll remove the rest of them. See notice.
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      They can also go to overview. I'll show you that one.
      So you can see that there are still some people who aren't in
      groups.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      All right, so
      let's cool discussion about this in in breakout groups, so I'm
      not sure about keeping track of notes from your breakout rooms.
      So if you have a chat window, you can say that and post it so
      maybe what I'll do while you're going to the breakout rooms
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      is a creative forum called breakout activities or something like
      that, and then you can post your notes to that. Okay.
      So let me see Craig
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so here we go. So the question is, before I send you off
      is what do you think about the groups creating groups interface?
      How could be made more straightforward? And how can I make How
      can you make sure that everybody's in a group, and nobody's in a
      group of more than one or two different groups. So that
      everybody, every active participant in the class is in one and
      only one group. So it makes sense.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      If you notice anything else about the group's group creation
      interface. Make note of that, too.
      Okay, so there's a comment about project to group list, because
      I made group numbers.
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      But the way your courses just set up, it doesn't do zero filled
      numbers. So doesn't do Project 01 at this project one. So then
      it's not in numerical order, but it's in. It's in will express
      it so sorted by the alphabet. So shorter word, project, one
      counter for Project 10. So that's why c goes from Project
      110 1112 1314 1516. And then 23456789.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, any other questions? So we'll do 10 minutes in the groups
      and then we'll, we'll come out and talk about things.
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if you can hear me, you're still in the main room. So please
      join your breakout room.
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay I'm just waiting for the countdown on the breakout room
      closing.
      So people will be kicked out of the breakout rooms and 54321

      So we have a list of meetings, media for meetings and then
      Breakout Room activity discussions. So 15 seconds ago he had a
      contribution. And we can discuss
      whether this is a good way to continue our discussions and break
      rooms or if there's some other some other method that would be
      useful. So, like I said before, this is in some ways, classes
      about considering interfaces as it relates to the delivery of
      the course. material.

  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yes, so we did see the page where you create those
      groups. But afterwards, when we went into the breakout room, we
      don't have access to that page itself to play around with the
      controls. And also because the page wasn't in front of us it was
      you know, we were just working off of our memory and
      unfortunately, foresight to take screenshots
