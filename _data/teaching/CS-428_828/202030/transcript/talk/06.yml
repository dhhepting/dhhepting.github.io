      I'm asking this in the chat as well as your registration
      process.
      So I noticed I included that link. So anyone have any issues in
      getting registered with the desktop app? Because
11h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      everyone has the desktop app installed. I think that's the that
      was the only requirement that
      okay. So when I created it this morning, I went to my zoom app,
      my desktop application to create it. And when I created the
      meeting, I realized that I didn't have the option to register or
      require registration. So then I finished creating that meeting.
      I thought, well, maybe I could edit it, to add it later on. But
      that wasn't the case. And so I went to that help file. And it
      said, go to the web client. Which seems somewhat ironic, because
      you can't register with a web client. But anyway, so it was a
11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      web client, I got a different interface. And I was able to
      create the meeting. So then I had two meetings. And I thought,
      well, it'll be clear which one is requiring registration and
      which one isn't? But that was not the case.
11h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it's,
      maybe that's a feature maybe maybe people don't think that.
      To me, it seems like that would be a an important thing and that
      registrate and the invitation to say registration is required.
      But
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So to answer some, a couple questions that came up in at the
      bottom of the chat here that I can see how about muting everyone
      on joining the meeting? Yes, I thought I had done that. Let me
      see. I can do that from here.
      So
      there we go. Now you're all muted. You can turn yourselves your,
      I think you can still turn your mic on when you want to speak.
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So regarding the weather prevents zoom bombing. I think
      that that is that in itself, it wouldn't prevent it. It gives me
      a record of who I can get a record of who was registered for the
      meeting. So if there's some issues later on, I can revisit that
      list. And I think between having registration and a waiting room
      it seems like maybe registration is an easier way to go.

      I will set up see their meetings in the future and let you

      I have to be like running around with him to change his diaper
      and this for the same time. I was wondering, oh, I must have
      missed the registration. So for me, that was a very small and

      You're welcome. Krishna, you have like, say something.
      Professor. So, regarding the registration link, I actually when
      I registered, I even before I got the email, as similarly
      mentioned in the chat, I directly got the link displayed on my
      webpage itself. I got an email A minute later, but even before
      that, I got the link directly on the webpage. So I could even
      directly join from there. Okay, so I think I think because the
      timing years are close to the meeting time that it just gave you
      a link to join him. That might happen five minutes before the
      meeting. Okay. I'm gonna guess that so I mean, there, there are
      lots of things cuz I'm guessing out here. Okay, maybe that was
      the reason Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for your comment.

      so maybe Oh okay, cool. Oh,
12h06:

      So if you can think about
      both Amazon and Netflix.
      So are there differences?
12h07:

      experience?
      Okay, any other thoughts about user experience?

      Okay, so I'm not sure VPS
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so for me, I'll tell you about my experience.
      So I have access communications. And I have a Netflix app. Next
      looks button on the remote control, which works fine. Then I can
      also do prime with going through the apps. Once I press the TiVo
      button,
      go to apps and then select prime and that works. So I can get to
      them both. Without having to go through too much. Too much
      hassle. My feeling is see, so the controls seem to work less
      well for Amazon compared to Netflix and I want to rewind it that
      I seem to not be able to have very fine control over that. And
      an Amazon the way things are phrased
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      see Amazon customers have also watched The show or something or
      the show is available with prime but to me it seems like
      everything's either you have prime or you don't so there's a
      feeling that I get from using Amazon is not like I'm I'm
      welcomed as more than a customer paying for Amazon Prime
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so I feel more comfortable as if you were on Netflix
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so that's definitely a user experience kind of thing because
      it's about how I feel about using the application so it's not
      necessarily about weather I can do the things I'd like to do but
      it's about how I feel about them
      so I noticed there's lots of ads for Milan lately before before
      the coverage for the negative curvature the movie said that it's
      available on Disney plus and then it seemed indicate Disney plus
      was not close enough because you had to be a premium member to
      see it
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So this seems to be to me this is a bit like looking at Amazon
      the store and seeing the items but then realizing they're not
      being sold by Amazon directly there
      there's third party sellers who are listed
12h14:

    msg: >-
      Well, just that they seem to keep adding tears that you
      keep having to pay more money for and at one point crave was
      kind of everything and now you're increasingly you're not really
      a creative customer, you're a low level customer until you get
      money
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      kind of like
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      you're you're mentioning with Disney plus, and you have
      to give them more money to be a premium member to get Milan or
      that was never really part of the original deal.
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, so they kept I think they kept the name
      creative, but then they got rid of the movie central or
      something. And then that became It was your get reorganized a
      bit to get a list of movies I think I hadn't thought about them
      is different, but Yes, that's true. I can see I can see and find
      that. I just crave. crave doesn't get you all the HBO stuff like
      Game of Thrones or turn off showing my own interests there.
      Okay.
12h16:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so we've been talking about streaming services. What about
      TV and possibly with DVR, so anyone have cable? TV?
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that's another interesting question to ask. I think, who has
      a TV
      I used to have a CRT TV. That was huge. When I bought it in the
      early 90s asked if I could get a TV without the tuner. So those
      just be like a monitor.
      And that was gonna be a lot more money. So the idea of building
      the tuner into the TV was that's what the market
12h19:

    msg: >-
      so I'm going to put these questions together in a quiz on your

      next time
      me

      Okay, so this is the list of 10 heuristics for user interface
      design. So if you notice the date here, they are first published
      in 1994. And yet, they're still relevant. So you can see that
      they're not.
      There's some basic principles that they're getting at griffeys
      heuristics that stand the test of time.
      So I should be
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so late. So we can see that they're listening to topics and
      heuristic evaluation of human computer interaction and web
      usability. So I'm going to, in the project, I'm going to ask you
      in groups, to look for a website. It can be an application as
      well, but it's something that you agree upon as needing some
      redesign. And then we're going to go through the steps of
      getting
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      going through identifying the opportunity for design, proposing
      a new solution, and prototyping it in in a low fidelity way, and
      slightly higher fidelity way. So you can see the benefit of
      applying and and these statistics are a good place to start.
      So maybe he can, you can let me know whether you can identify
      with ease. So visibility of system status. That's something that
      you can think about is
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      being a feature of a good design or frustration when it's
      lacking in a poor design.
      So maybe that's just a yes or no.
      So any anyone can identify with lack of visibility system status
      as being an issue. You're the usability of an application or
      webpage that you're dealing with.

      the issue with volume is.
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Anyway, does that make sense about system status?
      So if you remember that diagram, let's see Christina and the
      computer, we had the arrows going between the user and the
      computer and the computer and the user. So, which of those two
      directions does two arrows or the information flow between the
      human using the computer and the computer as it is affected by
      the visibility system status
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      from what to
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Any other responses?
      Okay, so execution is human to computer
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      evaluation.
      So. So I mean, they're both involved in this. But primarily if
      we're talking about the visibility of system status, we don't
      get feedback about what the command was, but the impact of the
      command we just issued. So I would say that's primarily an issue
      of evaluation, or going from the computer to the human.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      That makes sense.
      So because we're not clear about our feedback, the system, let's
      be clear about, we don't receive clear feedback about the state
      in which the system is now in, that affects the commands that
      we're going to issue from the human to the computer. So it
      impacts that is as well. So let's recycle.
      So there's the two aren't independent. Okay, so let's go.
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Let's go back to our heuristic number two, we won't do videos
      that include this link, well even posted in the chat, but I'll
      put it in our in more detail in the record of our meeting today.
      So the match between the system and the real world. So the
      system should speak the user's language with words, phrases,
      concepts familiar to the user rather than system oriented terms.
      It should follow real world conventions, making information
      appear in a natural and logical order.
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So when we're communicating when the system provides information
      to the user, it should be understandable by the human using that
      computer even using the interface. Who's ever seen error
      messages? Like oh, err minus 18 3762?
      Has anyone ever seen an a message like that on the screen?
      Nobody? Yes. Okay, one person
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so it's where in whatever interface. So when that.
      Okay, so that's one example of a mismatch between the system and
      the real world, when the error codes don't make sense in terms
      of when the error that comes up doesn't make sense in the
      context of what the person is doing.
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      To use your control and freedom number three. So users often
      choose system functions by mistake. And when neither clearly
      marked emergency exits leave the unwanted state without having
      to go through an extended dialog and support, Undo and Redo.
      So that's one, one x.
      One expression of user freedom is the ability to try something
      and then undo it.
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      As an example of when it's people don't have freedom is when
      there's a command that's unclear about what its impact would be.
      You're not always in charge. Unless you do something. And then
      it's not clear what this there isn't feedback. telling you what
      happened when we executed this command you're not sure about and
      that's compounding the difficulty.
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So consistency and standard is number four. Users should not
      have to wonder whether different words situations actions in the
      same thing. So to me, the progressive disclosure mechanism that
      we talked about, whether it's better to have the arrow or if
      we're going to use an arrow which should represent more
      information to disclose and where they should operate. That
      should be
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the opposite case. So we talked about up arrows or the chevron
      pointing up or down or sideways. And so, once we agree on to use
      that symbol in a way in the interface, then we should always use
      that and use it in that fashion. So that if we see and Chevron
      pointing to the side We know it's going to be, we click on it.
      And there's going to be more information. And if we see an arrow
      pointing down, that means this is showing extra information, and
      we can hide some of it by clicking on it again.
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So number five,
      even better than good error messages is carefully designed to
      prevent a problem from occurring in the first place. Either
      eliminate error prone conditions or check for them and present
      users with confirmation option before they commit the action.
      Make sense?

      So it's just it's not just enough to have a good error message.
      Which would cover which we covered in the heuristic to having a
      strong match between the system and the real world. But error
      prevention means that we're trying to think about what people
      are wanting to accomplish, and designing it so they can do that
      without errors.
      Okay, six theistic is recognition rather than recall. So the
      it's basically, you want to give people, you want to let people
      recognize options rather than trying to recall the command X to
      perform some function,

      flexibility and efficiency of use. So that people who are
      familiar they can use accelerators. The power users can have
      command key equivalent to the menu options, for example. So
      maybe we'll cut and paste.
      So I am, I'm very habituated in to not do just to doing Ctrl C,
      or Command C, and Command V, to copy and paste. But I noticed
      that sometimes now the application requires me to go to the Edit
      menu to pull down, like the menu command is a more powerful
      version than the keyboard shortcut. So that's a little bit
      disconcerting. And just like when I was talking about setting up
      the meeting, and then I could see it couldn't see the
      requirement to register for the meeting, in the meeting

      invitation. And that two interfaces between the desktop client
      and the web client are different. So

      that's more of a consistency thing then.
      But if it's, it also affects flexibility and efficiency of use,
      if I'm sure that I can create a meaningless registration on the
      desktop, or I don't know that and then know that I can't. And I
      choose the wrong one. And then I'm stuck in that loop between
      humans human in the computer. So I see it's 1245 already. So I
      thought we did well with that. And getting people engaged. So
      I'm going to take that chat information and put it together in a
      quiz that we can do before next meeting, and next meeting. We'll

      talk about creating groups through the project and having some
      time to work on that. Okay. Thank you for today. See you on
      Thursday. And I have an office hour, two to three today. Okay.
      Anything before we go?
      Okay. Looks like a nice day. I'm not sure if it was going to be
      as nice as yesterday, but sun shining anyway. So I hope you have
      a good day. And stay well and we'll see you next time.
