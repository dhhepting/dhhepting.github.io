      Okay, so remember there's a lot we have 2726 students here today
      so I can you may be more empowered to feel more free to go ahead
      and consider just instead of chatting. But that's perfectly fine
      if you just want to chat
11h33:

      Let me share my screen
      a seeing the course information now. The course web page looks

      Okay so I think that has it now
11h35:

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So I'm gonna create a poll here is the waiting room a good idea
11h36:

      Make sure that we have everybody in the room before I publish it

    msg: >-
      Only 78% voted so don't you go ahead and vote please if you can.
      The reason I'm thinking about waiting rooms and sending links
      out just before class is to to maximize security because some of
      you remember being zoom bombed with me in winter so I'm I'm
      leery of that happening again.
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I'm not sure that the waiting room is a is a good support for
      that or not? So
      because I have to keep I have to admit people when I noticed
      them and then I'm kind of relying on the fact that people have
      people have a link to request to join the meeting. So
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      60% Yes, 40% No. So this brings to mind one other question
      that I'm going to ask in a poll as well.
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so another option for me to do security is to let you
      register ahead of or send you an email to register for the
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, So has anyone you can answer in your in the chat if you
      like or put your hand. Has anyone done that experience with the
      registration process?
      Go ahead, Matthew.
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I haven't had experience with the registration process.
      That's her haven't answered the poll XML. I'm not sure what you
      mean by register ahead of time, but he does tell me a bit about
      what that would actually look like.
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Well, as far as I understand, it would send you
      there's an extra step ahead of time to
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Where you would? I'm not sure what it looks like I was just
      reading about it. I didn't try it. So, perhaps we can try it for
      our next meeting and then we can discuss.
      So I should have added an option for this question. Let me see
      if I can.
      So I think it's like saying that you're going to, you're going
      to RSVP to the meeting.
11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So what I believe registration is essentially doing
      okay, so
      C d c, the zoo options right now
11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Go ahead, sorry. Oh,
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      thank you professor. Like the question says, we can
      join the meeting directly in that does this mean with
      registration there will be no waiting room. That's the only
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I'm just I'm just weighing different options. I
      don't want to
11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Make it too onerous. For for everyone to be engaged in class.
      We're also
      sort of thinking about the interfaces here. Because we're
      talking about human computer communications. So we want to think
      about the interface in general, so I'm not sure that I'm
      answering the question directly, but so I'm good. I'm gonna set
      up our next meeting with registration and then we'll talk about
      your experience with it then. Okay, so registration and no way
      didn't vote for next. next meeting. Thank you. You're welcome.
11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So yes, 53% to 50%. Is this a strange result? That was noted in
      the chat? So
      I'm going to show you Okay, so my question is, do you see the
      zoom window or the
      all right As my webpage in the as a shared screen. Okay, that's
      enough. Thank you. So that's not as difficult as they thought.
11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I talked to you about recording. So I think I have a
      reasonable process now. So I'm going to show you first the
      screen from meeting to with the transcript
      so the transcript opens to the The card it collapses, but it's
      open to begin with that so that the anchors will work. So you
      can sort of go down to the bottom. So I've added chat and audio
      to make them clear. So he has comments about the formatting. And
      when there's when there's only one of the two. Then I leave it
      blank like that 1201 here.
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so let's say
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      We want to
      link this tool tip that says copy timestamps like
      so I haven't tried this yet. And then in a new window see see
      what the fragment at the end after the pound sign? Hashtag etc
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      We can get to a point.
      So a lot of work well.
      Now the work is done. I think I want to show you talking about
      how to get this audio transcript. So, on the one hand zoom does
      an audio transcription and I have, they're using this program or
      service from odd otter.ai They have noticed that the transcript
      from zoom is less accurate than the one from otter AI directly.
      So, my process now is to record the meeting and zoom and then
      get a transcript from and then pass the audio file to otter.ai.
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Here, here it is. Here's the result from Tuesday's meeting.
      So you notice that
11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So this is time differently it's just time from the start
      recording. So I'm not sure whether I'm okay to share this with
      you directly or not.
      So if I, if I get approval to share this link to you, I can just
      post that on your courses, and then I'll edit it. So I'm working
      on my thought is that
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      My thought with this is that I'm talking in class.
      And I pause like William Shatner does perhaps. Or if I have a
      few, and doors are anyway I don't state the ideas quite clearly
      as I would like in the transcript, but I know that it's there
      at, let's say 1159 or now it's 1156 for today's meeting. So then
      I would prefer to
      clean That text event, so maybe it's not a transcript. But it's
      a record of the meeting.
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Neither I don't think so what I noticed about the zoom
      transcript is
      it's better at
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Zoom is better at identifying speakers Where is everything I
      think we had some of the speakers here. So when I noticed them
      all just
      put a generic idea there like I did for the chat window.
      So, this one is from the start of the video
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Are started the recording, it's not quite so clear when it
      happens in in real time. And the chat is recorded and like the
      time of day. So what I've done is I in the script that I'm using
      to convert the format is to put the starting time of the audio
      transcript or the audio recording so that the times are
      adjusted. So they get one on one time with no seconds as a
      timestamp, so it matches up pretty well. It could be it. It
      could be asked by a little bit
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      All right, so
      any reports scan we have so we had a breakout rooms the other
      day talking about what?
      Okay, so before we get into the breakout rooms from the last
      day, the question is so how is the student audio transcript
      being handled so What I
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      what I intend to do is that's in the in the public web page that
      I'm going to take out names of students and put in student or
      FSS or some some generic identifier just to understand that
      there's a different speaker. But all good. I'll see if I can go
      through and see if the zoom transcription is correctly
      identified the different speakers and I'll make note of them as
      I'm making note of them for the chat room, so I'll keep a
      private So who's been speaking and interacting? But then I will
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      D identify students in public presentation of the information
      that makes sense.
      And the reason I can do it exactly like with the chat room stuff
      where it's all written out and the names or the names come up so
      it's easy for me to Take those out and make make a substitution
      for a name. Substitute a name for an identifier, a generic a, de
      identify an anonymous identifier because the speaker
      identification in the audio transcript isn't isn't so great. And
      the two transcripts so the one I get from the one that I'm
      showing you now and the one I get from zoom
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      they don't always match up. In terms of where the brakes are, so
      it makes it even more difficult. So, I'm just trying, I'm gonna
      just try and do my best with identifying student student voices
      in the transcript and the audio transcript. Okay, any other
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Any any discussions that happen in break rooms that you'd like
      to talk about?
      Okay, so seeing The version on Tuesday and the version today for
      the the transcript interface.
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      do two more things seem possible?
      Okay, so I had a private question of where I will upload the
      lectures, lecture recordings.
      So the idea is, well, you're gonna be on Dropbox, and some of
      them are already. I started doing that but I'm it's taken me a
      little more. Well, I was focusing on the transcript stuff a
      little bit more than that. I haven't put everything up yet. But
      they'll be on Dropbox for this semester, and they'll be
      available through the meeting pages. So if we go to
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      the end and I think the end Yeah. So here's the image. There's
      that sketch that I drew the other day. So there are more images
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      They would show all the images for a particular meeting would be
      here and then I think I have a recording
      a second my piece of audio.
      Anyways, there'll be a link when there's
      curve for images And audio come up so well, I will put the audio
      files into that Dropbox directory. And then I have a little
      script that creates a sharing link and then rewrites the name so
      you don't have to see the dropbox interface.
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Now so the so the recording everything associated with a meeting
      will appear on the meeting page.
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      anyone with some thoughts about making use of chat as a way to
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I'm answering a chat question so this is a private chat also
      including the transcript. So know anything about that
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Anything if the word privately so you can see this. This is sent
      to me privately but if they're sent to a particular person then
      it'll say from so on from student to me and then the fog I read
      in parentheses privately. So when I'm processing this to put on
      my webpage, ay, ay ay ay.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Any ideas about using the transcript
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, well I don't want to belabor the point.
      So I'll have some some. I'll have some input things implemented
      for Tuesday as examples of how I think they might be. It might
      be useful.
      Or that's my hope. I'll get something marked up to show you. So
      we're meeting five and so I want to think about assignments. So
      There'll be some individual assignments. And then there'll be
      some projects that are done in groups. So the groups can be, as
      I say, we'll say ideally four people in a group.
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So you can make up your own groups. If you like.
      If you want to have some conversations with people about that.
      You can do that.
      And then maybe on Tuesday, we'll check back in on that and see
      how people are doing And then we'll have some time we'll get the
      crews formalized and
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      and have some time to start working on the project. So the first
      assignment for the project that might be due in two weeks is to
      find a website that you're your group agrees with your group to
      find one that you agree to agree on that you'd like to examine.
      And then think about ways are opportunity He's to improve the
      website. So if they do something badly, or if you have some poor
      experience with it and there's some opportunities for redesign
12h15:
  talks:
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So how many people have in mind? Okay with yeses, and noes.
      Go ahead and ask him. How big should the groups be? Well, I'm
      thinking ideally for people ideal. Okay, thank you, but it isn't
      need may need to be five or three would work as well in a pinch,
      I think. Okay. Thank you, sir. Oh, you're very welcome.
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      And maybe that's easier than putting your hand up to unmute
      yourself. And then I can see when you're when you're talking or
      when your mic is active, even though maybe you're not talking
      yet. I can see that and then I can call on you. Just a thought.
      Okay, so I've been thinking about
      what would make a good group and so in the text it talks about
      cognitive diversity. Anyone so at the university here we talk we
      talk a lot about equity, diversity and inclusion, inclusion. So,
      cognitive diversity should fit right into that. Do you think?
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So? Now, I'm not sure how much cognitive diversity
      we get amongst computer science students. What do you think are
      some sources of cognitive diversity? So what does that mean to
      you and what do you think are some sources of it You want to
      type in the chat or talk? That would be fine with me.
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Let's consult Google
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Yeah, okay, so I say everyone who's answered is, is,
      is on the right track, I think. So to me, it just means having
      different ways of looking at things or thinking about things.
      And that might come from. We saw, as one said, I said, pardon me
      out, well, in a new light, I'll be, I'll be studying computer
      science. So we come to it from different perspectives. And I
      remember my first year of undergraduate, I thought, Hmm, maybe I
      could Say political science. So then I put in I took CS one or
      two years it was called back then and I really enjoyed it. We
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      did basic it's a computer language not an insult.
      I think it's supposed to be it's an insult, right? In the modern
      parlance, but basically is an acronym. Which means it's an
      abbreviation that spells at work. So as beginners all purpose
      symbolic instruction code. Anyway, yes, so everyone may have a
      different perspective. So it used to be that People have talked
      about the Myers Briggs type indicators because that's that's
      gone out of favor because there's a history behind it is
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      it seems to be not such a rigorous tool, although it seems
      refused to provide reasonable results. Anyone heard of the Myers
      Briggs stuff? Yes or no?
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So I'll put a link to it. I'll add a link to that material.
      Anyway, so that so there are different kinds of tests we can
      take that might show different styles of thinking or different
      styles of learning. We're not going to do that officially, I
      suppose, serve our backgrounds where we've grown up and shape
      our perspective on things. So I was born and raised in Regina
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So sorry I got a sign up the chat there.
      Anyway. So, me being born and raised in China, I spent some
      years in the states up to a year and a half in the States. And
      then I was at FSU for a while in the lower mainland of British
      Columbia. For a while, then I came back so I was away from China
      for 10 years. So that's given me my own perspective on things.
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So we can think about different ways that you might approach
      problems or
      it's very rare that we can ask one question
      see, they're really seen the mighty pythons the Holy Grail. Now
      so easily there's, there's two kinds of people you can say.
      People have seen the movie and those who haven't. Or maybe
      there's more people have seen it and didn't like it and people
      saw it and liked it And anyway, getting off on a little bit of a
      tangent here. So I was looking for icebreakers on zoom and I
      come across social distancing, bingo. I haven't read too much
      about it yet. But um, get that sorted out for Tuesday so we can
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      talk about that and get
      Sunday is broken and
12h27:

      And then have some ideas about groups.
      I'll put up a couple of videos to for you to look at for next
      time and then we can talk about

  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So carry on. He said physical distancing and social solidarity
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      like, social distancing, it's like we are not socially
      distant. We are close together in terms of our ideas, our
      notions, our emotions, but we have to keep up physical distance.
      We shouldn't make it like
      between our communications are like that.
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Yeah, okay. I understand. So some days I have
      some issues being here. Well, my kids are both away from home
      now. So my wife and I are empty nesters. And perhaps I'm driving
      my wife crazy a little bit by being at home. But it's also
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Yeah, that we don't keep the we don't let the physical distance
      distances socially. So thank you for that opposite that that an
      important explanation. clarification.
      Okay, so talk about that attack of the annoying or the impolite
      robot video Do you think that's going to go on to become a viral
      sensation and everybody had a chance to see it. I think we
      watched it in our meeting. But let me

      let me go back and
      since it's only 15 seconds, I can play it here.

      About Attack of the killer robots and so on. I know it's not as

      At the same time it's it's time has been programmed.
      So as you made a comment about any pointless cfpwv music and for
      simplified text if you want to go viral. So I was watching
      Kroger last night and if any of you who watch COVID But he did a
      dance video to Trump's recording of him downplaying the virus.
      Oh, yes. clickbait titles. Yeah. Yeah Attack of the inflate
      robots doesn't quite

      quite grab it. This isn't quite magnet for clicks maybe. So I
      like your suggestion for the title rafail anyway last night so
      they did a video dance video about Trump's audio recording with
      Woodward saying that, oh, I would like to downplay the virus and
      then you Talking with and when President Trump was on a town
      hall the other night, he had a question about downplaying the

      So they did a video. I'm not sure if that's on. So we try and

      All right, so what about
      this interface? So do you think there's room for improvement?

      Okay, so we had 60 4018 to 30 plus voters. So let's

      The first thing that comes to my mind is 60 minutes. 60
      minutes is quite legitimate, so it should take that as an input.
      And the second thing is like I knew everybody, almost no 60
      minutes in one hour, but San Dimas, somebody is following a
      recipe that says like he should make for a cook for 60 minutes
      altogether. So I think they must have the layers to exactly go
      with that and not to get confused why it's not taking another

      Yeah. Yeah, my thought is if it had, it's the
      blinking the air. So it seems to understand how to convert 60
      minutes to one hour but then it tells me an error. So it's like
      a once to start in our argument with me. Exactly, is a passive
      aggressive response. Well, you entered it wrong but I'll correct
      it for you. So I've been known to have arguments with Siri for
      my for my kids enjoyment. So they get it they also think get a
      kick out of me. taking issue with the stove timer Okay, thanks.

      You can type in the chat or if you like.
      So 12 people voted no. So here's my theory and you can disagree
      or agree with us is that people. So when people are looking at
      software interfaces are different kinds of computer interfaces
      They don't have a clear view of Pardon me. They don't think that
      they don't have an expectation that the interface should augment
      their abilities rather, it's up to them to interact with stove
      and the way that it likes to be interacted with. So if it's not
      convenient, then people can take that on that extra
