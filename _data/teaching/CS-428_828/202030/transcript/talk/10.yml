      Hello everybody
      file is simply equal to its main attributes its size. By
      contrast, conventional systems file has a dozen or so attribute
      to specify or create a file. It takes endless amounts of
      chitchat. Nobody's being that talkative or the minute I got
      something going the background here, I think

      I'm just typing a message in the chat. No boy.
      I'm gonna turn the audio off here for everybody.
      Okay, that's a little better. So I don't mind having microphones
      on but just to not all everyone do it at once. And so remember,
      you can put your hand up on the

    msg: >-
      Oh, I don't have a hand. Yes. I'm pushed.
      Yeah, so nobody realized the mic was on but I thought I had it
      turned off by default.
11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay. How's everyone doing today?
      So just because I turn the mics off,
      doesn't mean that you don't have to just use the chat.
      Specifically, soli.
11h35:

      So I want to go back to our
      discussion for last week about your courses.
      So maybe we can
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      All right, I have to share the screen.
      Okay, so here we are back at the group. So I found an email.
      This is a group of street, I am creating. So added the students.
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I was asked last day, how do I create groups to make sure
      that everybody's in a group but not more than one? in a group,
      right?
      So the screen being shared, okay. Can I get a yes or? No? I
      think it is. Okay. So to answer the first question,
      Is everybody in the group well, so this number is now I can see
      a one and a zero at the end of the line.
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, how visible is it from here?
      Okay, so, yeah, so we have to scroll that side to side, which
      isn't?
      Yes, so it does have a selected users group. But if we didn't go
      through so I have to go through and and see who doesn't come up
      with the group.
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I know Shivam is in a group. So we'll create that group for
      him in a minute, so
      Okay, so I got another private I got a private message with a
      group. So I wanted to say
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that well, that I have a number of different ways to contact. I
      mean, people are using different ways to contact me. But I'll
      show you that screen again. And that link. So one person I
      think, use the email link with a subject on it. That I could
      easily look for.
      Make sure I have the whole in mind are located all of them. So I
      think I have three, two other groups group list here. That will
      get you in from my email. But I'll show you where the
      communication part is again.
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah. Okay. So if I want to make sure that people aren't a
      group, and only one group I have a way to check it right, I
      guess. Now is this. We talked about those three levels of
      activities. So it can be effective that Yes, we can. Yes, we can
      do something. And then it's comprehensive, comprehensible. That
      we can even figure out how to do something. It makes some sense.
      And then the high highest of the three levels is the activity of
      satisfying
11h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so I'm not blocking the sun from my eyes here. Not a very sunny
      day today. Anyway, does that make sense?
      So
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I'm gonna check if somebody is talking.
      Okay, let me let me add the groups that I have here. So I'm
      checking my email. So you can see that I go
      Okay. So now that I've created one group here, project group 15.
      And then what I have to do, I have to go back to groups
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and look for a net another project group. An empty one, okay.
      Okay, now I've got one step, add remove users.
11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So we're on the scale of
      how would you rate this activity as you watch me do it?
      Any anyone willing to offer opinion on this. Go ahead, Matthew.
      It looks very tedious and not fun to do. But I can still do it.
      So then it's it's a it's barely possible. Yeah. So it's
      effective, right? So we can do it, but not not enjoy ourselves
      and not well it's approaching comprehensible I guess because you
      can figure out how to do it from what's there. It's not but it's
      a lot of clicking.
11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if I wanted to so let me add a condition constraint here.
      So now if we go back to groups just remember
      the overview. So groupings so this to me seems like a nice idea
      then we can create a different grouping so that way we can have
      different groups of people but we might have the whole class
      broken into
11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that's not starting out promise. So we can we can break the
      whole class into different groups. So each set of groups cover
      includes all students in one and only one group. So if you
      remember some your cs 310 is still called that. Anyway,
      equivalence classes, and that's not my place here. And maybe
      that's not the place to look at it, but
      that's just smart theoretical connection here Okay, so and then
      here are my overview of the groups I can see that I have that
      many groups 2468 groups made up and
11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and this one that says no, no groups are not in a group is not
      quite as helpful as they want it to be because it includes
      people who aren't student who don't have a student girl in the
      class. I realized
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, okay. Yes, Kumar. Yeah. Hello, professor. I thank you marine
      regarding my group, and also saying your methods for that. But
      still, we are not at it. Yeah, okay. I'm getting to it. Really,
      I am. Thanks. Do you have any? In fact, I'm doing it as part of
      the class here.
      So, before I add the other groups that I have, because I have
      listed Army. You have any observations about this? So the just
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the summary helped me with the idea that that I set out to do
      foot it put all students in one and only one group of three or
      four people.
      So the question is selecting multiple names. Okay. I think I can
      do that. Let's let's try it out with this next group.
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, does that look great? Yes. Kumar and other members of the
      group? Yes. Okay.
      So I know this is part of the discussion last day was that we
11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I heard that I heard the group's you know, sort of maybe making
      assumptions or explaining why Moodle slash your courses, does
      things in a certain way. So that, to me seems like a symptom of
      thinking that people are the humans thinking that it's our job
      to adapt to the systems if we can't figure it out. It's our
      fault. It's not a poor design. So go ahead, Richmond, you have
      your hand up. No. Yeah. I was saying I'm having a hard time
      finding a group. So I wanted to quit if I can work alone. Well,
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      well. We'll figure out the rest of the groups today. Okay, thank
      you. Okay. You're welcome. So any any thoughts about how this
      could be a little bit easier because that potential members
      start out being 47.
      And we don't have a reason Made now, we've made nine groups, I
      think.
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      or eight groups now, anyway.
      So we have we don't have 43 students left Dewey.
      Okay. So the comment from referral is an obvious one might be to
      widen the field some more information is readable. Okay, so
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I would counsel you to avoid the word obvious. And another
      problematic word is assume.
      Okay, but anyway, let's see if we can widen the field
      and get something more helpful.
      So fairy all commented that that was quick to select multiple
      users at once. And I was surprised how quick it was as well,
      because I usually have more trouble finding usernames in the
      list. Okay, so if I make it a little wider now as wide as
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, I don't want to be a liar. So there No, it's as wide as my
      screen.
      So that helps to say,
      then we can see who which ones are ever one behind their name,
      and which ones have a zero behind their name.
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I think, I think so that's a good observation, though, in
      working with what we have. But if we were going to make an
      interface, we're gonna look for areas for improvement on this
      interface, what's something was even a bigger impact and being
      able to see all the information at once.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So
      let's say so if we had a smaller display, instead of having the
      one be at the at the end of the line, you could have it as
      appear on the first part of the line. That would not make us
      resort to stretching a screen bigger than we'd like to think
      that it would help the situation at all.
      Now I've stretched so big that I have to make chat room. It's
      all again.
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Nobody's chatting, yep.
      Okay, so if I started with 48 students, and I make, let's say I
      make six groups of four. So that leaves 24 students. So I've
      allocated half the students. So six times four is 24. Students.
      48 minus 24 is 24. So I've allocated half the students. So do I
      need to see all the possible members who are already in a group?
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Any thoughts about that? So as I'm assigning people to groups,
      have them
      come off the list of potential members.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, I want to make sure that I got the other group or
      Okay.
      Does everybody leave? No. So, still there.
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so a couple of good suggestions.
      So if we have a filter by the number of groups of students is in
      that, so that that seems like a good approach. But so how would
      we make that clear? It seems like maybe it's it's a solution
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      in search of an activity. That makes sense. So So when we think
      about the problems that we have,
      that we would like to solve with software, and interface or a
      tool that we're using,
      you first need to understand what it is that people wanted to
      do, sort of understand and define the problem and not start with
      proposing solutions.
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, I mean, we can say, Oh, well, we know this is going to fix
      this problem that we observe and that it might well be way to,
      you know, deal with it. So that we can shrink the list of
      Sorry, I'm reading the chat here.
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So, we want to understand that
      understand the problem first and then reflect on it
      before coming to a solution, so, then that makes sense that we
      want to define the problem and understand the problem that
      exists are people who are using the interface to do things so
      there might you know for creating groups like that for for the
      class there might be a more efficient way to do it it doesn't
      appear to me to be apparent that there is a something
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      better way to do this.
      So
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      sorry, I can I was looking at messages here. So
      so you want to take time to understand what people are
      experiencing with the interface the way the way that it is and
      understand what they want to accomplish and where they're having
      problems. So I'm not going to do the blanks. But anyone can
      anyone guess what and that's setting up very well. Sir it's a he
      and ends with a lie. And something that is needed in great
      quantity these days. Which may be the lack of it has been on
      display too prominently
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      said enough of a clue. Oh, good. Good job, Matthew. I'm sorry to
      have a prize for you. I guess I need an exit. If I did have a
      prize, you get an extra it would be a bigger one because you
      First the question correctly as well. Then they came to they
      gave me not be
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so clear always so that other people get the hint. The way that
      I stated it.
      No, it ends with y starts as E and ends with y. So Matthew does
      denote the correct answer. Oh, oh, see, I didn't get that it
      ends with a question mark.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that yes, empty is another word that starts with an E, it
      ends with y. And I suppose you want to talk a little more
      philosophically, we have too much empty well. So that's the
      opposite of empathy, we have too much empty and not enough
      empathy. I can trust it around there.
      Okay, so I, I found a link with empathy, I'm gonna post this in
      my mail smarting.
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      The New York Times it just happened to be I guess it was from
      the weekend before Sunday
      without all the extra search parameters at the end.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      So that just might help a little bit. Some grounding in empathy
      in the current day, like I looked at. So how empathetic it
      starts out with saying, how empathetic are you? Here's a simple
      test. Read the news. Speak to your boss, right public
      transportation. start a conversation with someone who has
      opposing political views, spend time with your child or spouse,
      sit in traffic or just spend 20 minutes on Facebook. So empathy
      is the ability to understand others perspectives, feelings and
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      experiences from their point of view rather than from your own.
      So this isn't talking about empathizing with with the, with the
      users of the software. But do you see how it's related.
      If I make that connection, clear,
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So you don't have to read the whole article, just the common.
      This the first step that I is the opening paragraph where the
      last sentence I read even seemed like a valuable thing to have
      for.
      For interface for user interface signers.
      Okay, so can anyone empathize with me talking to a screen? Let's
      see. Now I don't have my participants window up so I can see.
      Anyone can empathize. One person can empathize. No, to start.
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay. So a couple yeses, so that's good to hear.
      All right. So I'm going to try to draw something again.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      So there's a comment that the last group that I created I didn't
      say it yet. Okay, so where's the Save button?
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      It's not quite so clear isn't thinking this will save it.
      Okay, let me
      not good at multitasking, especially today. So all right, let me
      deal with the group's first so
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so then here's somebody who, so geo Kumar wants to be
      added to a group. So if I want if I realize that somebody wants
      to be in a certain group and I don't know which group number it
      is That's, it's number one, I guess. Okay, you're helping me out
      more than okay. So you're sure you're not sure. So let's look
      through them. So I can see the names of the people in the group
      by clicking on them.
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so that's one thing go back to groups.
      I can do.
      Yeah. So even being able to sort by
      number of groups people are in would be a help. To me.
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Again, I mean, we can acknowledge the fact that we're coming up
      with solution potential solutions, but let's not focus on them
      right away. Because you want to not have the pressure of finding
      a solution.
      If we focus on getting a solution to the problem, then we do
      kind of a depth first approach. And if we are interested in
      exploring ideas, then we do more of a breadth first breadth
      first approach. Looking at different alternatives, so we can try
      a little bit here and we'll go different direction this is so
      brainstorming is breadth first. And,
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and getting getting something done before the due date is step
      first. So we can so we need a little bit of both, right? So to
      begin with, we need some bread first, generate some good ideas.
      And then later on, we need some depth first to fine tune those
      ideas and create something that we can test. We can prototype
      and test with people and then we can go back and that cycle. So
      we're ideas, we're not trying to complete everything at once,
      but the
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      narrative process it has to stop at some point.
      Okay, does that make sense?
      Alright, so amongst the 37 people here 36 students here Are you
      in groups?
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      I'm going to put you with Richmond and colo will follow loop a
      loop a sorry I for too many else are there I think.
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so we have and so go back to groups.
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      So start our next group with Sean.
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so the people in the class list around Shawn are also not
      in groups. So I'm going to try this out.
      This is a new strategy for me to make a group.
      Okay, now I wish I knew how many people went in groups yet.
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I can.
      So it's not perfect, but that's not a terrible way to
      accommodate things. comet in my activity I described.
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so now I have to go back to groups again.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      There
      take one person out of the last four person group that I made
      because I can see that I'm running out of people. So it looks
      like my task is complete.
      nearing completion.
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      See, and then there's another thing there. I have to click on
      the order of things, it's important there that I need to click
      on the Add remove, because then the name flips to the other side
      so I can remove it
      back to groups,
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      remove users
      and it makes sure that I didn't miss somebody above up here.
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so we go back to groups.
      Does everyone feel like they're in a group? Yes, fear
      actually are in a group.
      So I can delete these other two. I will shortly I guess. So we
      have 14 groups for 48 students, so that's
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      just fine. Okay. So now is the grouping. So let's look at the
      overview. Again, if we can filter by grouping, project proof
      all. So I'm looking for 48. So to me, it seems like it'd be nice
      if there is a way in the overview to find out how many students
      were allocated to groups. I could look at it and say, There's
      nobody left over. Not in a group.

      So I guess that maybe that means that everybody's in a group
      because there aren't, there's no line that says people not in
      the group. But it's not clear.

      If there could be some, some affirmation, something in the
      affirmative that says
      yes, oh, students are allocated to groups. Okay, so I promised
      that I was going to draw something so let me
      I don't think I did this properly the other day. I have a dialog
      box come up here again.

      So what can we, when we observe somebody doing something, we can
      classify our observations into four groups.
      So you can observe me clicking buttons. So that's what I what I
      do, or what what the what the person does.

      ask some questions. After this is their partner emphasizing
      Wow, this is too much like a real tense time.
      Okay, I think we're out of time for today all share my my
      scuffle rendering. And link to a template you can think of you
      can use from your own perspective. Sorry, what does that mean?
      So you can copy the template that's nice to draw on or you can
      be empowered to draw something with your with your, if you have
      a tablet or some however you want to draw it, paper and pencil
      and then scan it in later on. That's all good. So it doesn't
      have to be done a certain way. We want to record people's
