      Morning everyone I see this a bit later than I
      thought it was so I apologize
      whatever I'm doing today
      again, I thought I turned the doorbell off but it's still
      ringing
      So any questions about the other questions about the assignment
      that's due today? Pardon me? That was due yesterday I do have a
      couple of hours a few hours ago.
11h38:

      Any thoughts about it? Then we can move on to questions about
      the last group assignment. Last piece of the project and then
      talk about what's optional for the last, last individual
      assignment.

      more person to vote
      those centers here about one third of you have watched it and
      two thirds haven't yet watched it
      so what about the title for that video? Or or that those
      materials rocket surgery made easy.
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      How'd you read that title?
      Is it clear what it's talking about? So a good way to identify
      the video.
      Okay, so
11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      as the title indicate what the video is about.
      So maybe not so much.
      So
      so so in English, there's the idiom. Well, it's not rocket
      science. So it's a play on that. That's how I understand it. To
      play on that phrase so it's not rocket science that type of
      rocket surgery which may be seems more complicated than it
11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that's maybe too cute by some measure and it doesn't convey the
      doesn't convey the subject of the video.
11h47:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So this may also be part of my own needs to try and be cuter
      than
      required to make light of most today see see the human a lot of
      things.
      Anyway, let me see if we can find the video few Alex actually
      titled
11h48:

    msg: >-
      if you're shooting the screen
11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so, you can see this is the title of the Steve Krug's
      book. So rocket surgery is how to how to book for doing your own
      usability tests.
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that's maybe the more clear than the than the Amazon
      description about it. So his own website is making that more
      clear.
      Let's see if we look at videos
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay,
      so demo usability test is maybe a bit more clear.
      So I invite you go through that. And then we've also linked to
      his website for some sample materials that can be useful.
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the idea is
      the title of the book, and my references to the title of the
      book.
      Have to clarify this is about usability testing and how
      straightforward it is to to run usability tests.
11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So in terms of naming things, there's also some, some design
      choices in terms of creating titles and
      which we can evaluate with heuristics as well.
      So if we talk about, we had the video or the title is rocket
      surgery made easy.
11h55:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And we think well, that's good humor intrigue in terms of what
      the video is about.
      We encourage people to click on it. But on the other hand, they
      may say, Well, I wouldn't click on that because you're
      interested in right. We're not interested in rockets. We're
      looking after rockets.
      So this is a bit about the information design portion of the
      interface. So if we think about our Computer and human are human
      and computer pardon me, isn't the right order.
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yet the interface we have
      the interface we have affected. So the the choice of
      descriptions, titles and so forth. That's part of the
      information design. So the commands that we need to discover
      techs to use the interface, and how accessible they are, that
      reflects the Gulf of execution, the person is coming to the
      computer with the goal to accomplish and then it's a question of
      how to transform that goal from
11h57:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      from his or her from their,
      their thoughts to concrete actions on on the interface commands
      to execute. Silly choice of commands is clear. And the Gulf of
      execution small if we're looking for a video called rocket
      surgery made easy. So if we did that search that we saw, right
      we just did on screen, then we can
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      we can jump to the video fairly quickly.
      If we know what that's about, if we skirt if we don't if we
      aren't in on the joke or the cute, intriguing title, then you
      might not be very able to
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, to pick that video complete
      might not be able to determine the video quite so easily. And so
      the link may be there. But if we're not sure what the title of
      the rocket surgery implies, then the information or the what
      we're able to present interpret from the display on the
      interface is misleading. I'm sorry that that took a long time to
      get out. But does that make sense? some sense
12h00:

      Okay. Now
12h01:

    msg: >-
      Shall we take a few minutes to go into breakout groups into your
      project groups and discuss the next step of the assignment of
      the project? The last step of the project so if you have any
      questions are talking with your group members to see what
      questions exist for your group and then we can discuss them in
      in in the larger setting once you return from the breakout rooms
      and and then we'll talk about the other assignment stuff as well
      after that, Okay, so let's see Mari
12h02:

      Okay, so now if I shouldn't if I magically not magically, but I
      click the button here for breakout rooms and you should go start
      your
      okay. So, we'll try we'll come back about 10 after so seven
      minutes, give or take

    msg: >-
      Okay, everyone's back now, everyone's back is coming back.
      So.
      So I had one person, just not fit into a group was was
      unassigned based on the default or the allocation of groups that
      I created based on the emails that I had seen up until the end
      of October.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So here's a question. Is it to say to owners, is it a reasonable
      requirement? Create a register with your your China email
      address? Does that mean does that have any practical
      implications or is it just specifying an email address?
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      So let me ask a poll about that. Rubbish. Hello, professor. Hi.
      Yeah, yeah. Okay.

      My group and I were

      and just one second here. Okay. There's a lot of
      noise going on. I don't know.
      Hello? Hi. Often. Okay, so we're going to talk about the last
      project part in a second. Okay. So keep your question just a

    msg: >-
      Is it difficult to register for meetings? Using? Yeah.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I'm wondering
      if it's
      it's possible to make that a requirement of your registration.
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I don't know that I can enforce it in zoom, but I'm just curious
      as to whether that's a reasonable thing to request for students
      because that would certainly
      make the groups easier to farm and breakout rooms.
      So of 21 people who voted so far, one person has said it's
      difficult. And 20 people have said, No, it's not difficult.
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So Would anyone like to talk about why it is difficult? Whether
      or not you answered that way.
      And any of the other seven people that any of you who are still
      at your computer
      maybe not okay.
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, let me just share the results. So
      any discussion about that any clarification?
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      in future I will ask students to register using their regional
      email address. And that will help the process considerably, I
      think in terms of making breakout rooms and so on.
      This, I keep thinking about the Apollo 13 example
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      in terms of having creating a spreadsheet with names. So, you
      think you could match on names for the red people who are
      registered for zoom. But if I try to upload a spreadsheet with
      names or the sofa, the spreadsheet that I need to upload now to
      create the breakout rooms as the group and it's a comma
      separated value format, file with the group and the email
      address, so there are no names. And if if I include names as
      additional columns, the upload gets hung up. So and discouraged
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      from using names. So I wrote some scripts to find out email
      addresses associated with different students. And then I found
      out who the students which group the students are in. And then I
      added those emails to the, to the group. But then today, I found
      that, I mean, it's not a perfect solution, because if I haven't
      captured your email address, and some people will still be on
      the side, two groups.
      So in future, I will
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      make it a point to make it a point of saying
      to register with your your China email address, and then
      and then we'll just try that out. And up a new requirement,
      which is not which I hope that it won't be too difficult to to
      accommodate. Okay, so there, let's go back to the project. Now
      that we've talked a bit more about the interface for groups. So
      rubbish. Go ahead. Please. Yeah. Hi, professor. So can you hear
      me? Yep. Yep. So
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      it's fading a bit now.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Can you hear me now?
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yes, I can.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yeah, so we discuss about the tasting of the author
      interfaces. So we are very clear about that one. But one doubt
      we have is that like, after doing the tasting, when we get
      feedback from the other team members for the, for the low
      fidelity prototype, a and b. So after that, what we need to do
      like we need to design a low fidelity prototype, or do we need
      to like do implementation of that?
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      So I'm asking about the like, what is the final expectation from
      us as a group to like, what we need to submit in the project
      three?
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, so the idea is to create a representation
      have an improved interface based on the testing and your
      experience with the design process. So you're, you're starting
      the materialized assignment, or portion of the project with two
      prototypes, interface a and an interface to the prototype, which
      are paper and pencil. So based on your testing, you're gathering
      data about those two interfaces for the activity for you're
      focusing on then
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      you're going to create a vast version based on your experience
      in the design process and the results from the usability test.
      So it doesn't have to be a high fidelity prototype. Because let
      me go and find what I written there to make sure that I'm not
      talking about what
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      With the shared text we have to look at.
      So one thing I see that I have to deal with is writing a
      JavaScript routine that keeps track of the meetings, so that it
      doesn't require to relearn my updates. For the website, I
      updated the website on Tuesday. And so the that's how it's
      getting the today is when it should be pointing to the 23rd.
      Anyway.
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I, I'm leaving a little bit open in terms of what you
      present. But so the last line of the assignment here says, based
      on your experience in your project, your testing of your lo fi
      put up for your low fidelity prototypes. Create a single
      interface design combines the best ideas from your to Lofa low
      fidelity prototypes and any other sources.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yeah, so yeah, we have a like doubt about that one. So
      that's
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      okay. So it, it can be a sketch or if you want to
      do something a little bit more.
      If you want to create some screens with a drawing program, that
      would be fine as well. So I'm just trying to leave the door open
      a little bit in terms of how you create that, how you represent
      that interface design. Okay. That makes sense. Yes. Yes. That
      makes sense. Yes.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Thank you.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      You're welcome. Any other questions that came up
      with regarding testing? Or the other part of other parts of the
      third installment of the project?
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Oh, Hello, sir.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Hello.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Oh, so I have two questions regarding this project. So
      the first one being, you just explained that we need to make a
      final prototype interface I mean, so we did two different
      models. For example, we did interface A and D. So we need to
      give two final outputs, right? an interface a final output an
      interface B final output?
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      No. So what I'm asking is based on your testing,
      and your experience, with a design and your experience with the
      project in general.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Okay, you need not be dependent on the metaphors that
      we used in Project two. Like we did two different metaphors in
      Project two. So I was just wondering if you're, we need to
      improve that.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so the idea is, so your interface, your low
      fidelity prototypes are based on the metaphors that you
      selected. So you're creating so as part of the second project,
      installment you're, you have two metaphors that you're exploring
      in a low fidelity In sketches of the interface and the
      prototype. So a way to think about the testing that's going on
      in this third installment, excuse me is to think about which are
      the which prototype, which metaphor, better suits the activity
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that you're presenting. Which of the two metaphors is better at
      conveying the aspect to the interface to your participants. So
      that's one source of data. But you might also realize in the
      process of doing the testing, so the comments that are made, you
      might. And I'm not saying that this essay has to be that, that
      you have to discover something in this way. But you might say
      that, well, based on the feedback we got, we realized that the
      interface protocol, or interface design should have something to
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      highlight the spit of information or make this accessible is a
      command or something like that. So it's not strictly just from
      your testing of the two low fidelity prototypes, based on
      YouTube metaphors. That's not the only source of data of you
      insight for your final interface design. So instead of
      finalizing the two different metaphors are going, I'm asking you
      to create a single design that takes the best ideas from both of
      those low fidelity prototypes. And your other experience related
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      to the project to create a single final interface design. That
      makes sense. So that's pretty nice. Not not refining, too, but
      taking the two that you have and finding what's the best way to
      express all the ideas you've had in a single interface.
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you.
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so that was one question. Or was there?
  - persid: Unknown
    msg: >-
      I just read through your description again, and the
      question was answered. Thank you.
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, okay. You're welcome.
      Okay, and so I've put up the the third individual assignments,
      which are, which I've indicated are optional. So it's meant more
      to really, really reduced pressure about completing them on us
      on a timeline. I still think it's a useful endeavor to create
      something on others for the for the submission, but you won't
      have to worry about it being a drag on your mark. Okay, so the
      assignment is optional, but recommended. How's that?
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, I think they do show up. I
      think I saw them here on the

      discussed.
12h41:

      to test the date, when the web page is visited. And
      and then also maybe check the time of day. So there's a few
      cases to check here.
      And the data is available. Well, the way to get the data is
      available from the website to my repository. I've put the I've
