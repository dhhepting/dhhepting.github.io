      So who's happy that there's snow on the ground
      anyone
      I remember when I was a kid that I would really enjoy going out
      or I thought getting snow before Halloween was a big deal. Now
      I'm not so thrilled either.

      I'm glad that there aren't too many questions. So everything's
      clear, I hope. So what I'd like to do, we have 28 people here
      27, including me. That's not what I meant to say we have 27
      participants 28, including me.
      So my wife and I were discussing the weekend about how to go and
      vote in the provincial election. And you hear so much about the
      American election coming up in two weeks. But there is an
      election here in Saskatchewan on the 26th of October, which is a
      week from yesterday. So
11h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So what I'd like you to do in breakout rooms, with your groups,
      let's talk about finding information about going to vote and
      making a plan to vote. So I know not everybody's may not be
      eligible, not everybody who may be eligible to vote in the
      election, but some of you are. And let's imagine that
11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      that's your you want to find out if you're eligible. And when
      and where you can vote. You have to go on. For example, do you
      have to go on the day of 26th? Or can you go early? Or can you?
      Do you have other ways to submit a vote? Your vote? So those are
      the kinds of questions I want you to look for online. And I have
      a source that I looked at yesterday, but I let you maybe find
      better sources of information. That makes sense.
11h35:

    msg: >-
      Okay, so I'm going to open the rooms and we'll see how we go

      So, clicking away there is a keyboard. But they would like to
      share what they what information they found that would help them
      plan to make to cast a vote given that not everybody is maybe
      eligible to vote or so on
11h57:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I'll go first outside

      let me share screen
11h58:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so I clicked on the this is an aside I clicked on the mute
      everybody new participants when joining the meeting so when I
      switch back from the breakout room to the main room and I start
      talking then I realized my microphone is muted. So that's the
      pause at the beginning of our group gathering after returning
      from breakout rooms
      it was it seems funny to me that as being the host or the
      organizer that I'm not differentiated and some other controls
      that I have available to me are I can turn my video on or off
      and I can say whether you can try another video or not. But it
      seems like some things are not consistent.
11h59:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay. Elections scotch.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      So I noticed that asking the question today I'm still able to do
      advance voting.
      So in my sharing of the window, can you see the pop up text
      there? Anyway, it's showing on my screen as I hover over these
      different things. This is an alt text. Everything is an all text
      so that needs to requirements of having an all texture things
      but it doesn't
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      doesn't provide any extra information.
      So
      less than encouraging to see, I mean, it's not just say they
      haven't don't have the alt text, they've just put enough value
      to make it
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      seem compliant.
      Okay, so advanced voting is possible followed by mail
      application deadline October 15. So that's no longer possible.
      So get registered. Okay COVID-19 in the election
      get registered to vote. So I didn't know that I had to register.
      Let's see. It says Oh, voter registration is now closed that's
      encouraging and I registered to vote you can still do so in
      person at the polls either during advanced voting or on election
      day. Okay.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so this wasn't I taught I click back let's see if I can
      follow find my train again here. Get back on the train.
      Okay, so online tool to find your polling location. So I know
      that I can, can vote today even. Let's see where I can vote.
      You can use my location.
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      That's not my location.
      Okay, so that
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so it's not getting the location properly. But I am able to
      enter my postal code and
      get close.
      So my address is not correct. But the constituency is Garner
      Park, holding division.
      Vast polling recommended poll location, which is just down the
      street for me. And today, I can vote from now until 8pm.
      Tomorrow or Thursday, Friday or Saturday.
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And I can also
      vote between 9am and 8pm on election day.
      This information sufficient so it says recommended pole
      location. Does that mean that I can vote at any place?
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay,
      so, so a good suggestion to click on the link there advanced
      voting every voter can choose to vote in advance of election.
      Check your voter information card or elections scotchman. Where
      do I vote for events? one location we recommend in your
      constituency.
      Yeah, so yes, constituency may have more than one polling
      location.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      But it becomes more difficult if I can go to any place to cast
      my vote.
      So that's interesting. It goes back to the find.
      I want to see if I can put in a URL address works.
      Okay, so it gets redirected here.
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it doesn't give me an answer but the recommend the where I
      can all the different places I can vote.
      So on election day, I guess reading between the lines here I can
      vote can advance vote in different locations.
      But on election day, I can only vote at the polling location
      closest to me, which is just down the street.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Any other questions that came to mind?
      So is the website
12h12:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so which pieces of wood
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so vote your way so I can vote in person. So that's clear that
      there's one polling location for the day
      five in person during advanced voting.
      So it says the recommended polling location but it doesn't say
      which other ones are possible.
      voters are eligible to vote by mail before your 15th deadline.
      locations for a vote by mail ballot are no longer being

  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-

      So I need identification and proof of address, I think proof of
      identity and proof of identity and address.
      But there's lots of other ways to prove it. Apparently.
      So when it says 50 plus acceptable ID options. I I wondered
      whether there was that's just for me being over 50 years old.
      I didn't really wonder that But I wondered why they they put 50
      plus just seems like why not discount to the count the total
      number of options in the list.
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Anyway, okay, so there's, there's some ID information.
      So if you're telling somebody to somebody asks you a question, I
      didn't get a card. So what do I need? What do I need to do? So
      what would you tell them?
      Let me
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      get mine. Here.
      Okay, so what would you
      if you didn't get it? Okay, I think I'll start sharing this

    msg: >-
      Does that sound
      there are many there are over 50 different ways to identify
      yourself.
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so is that enough information of I say go to the elections
      that's ASQ website and find your recommended polling location
      so we checked out the second one but let's just check out how to
      get there from the first one.
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay
      looking for the link that says Where do I have the link for
      where do I vote I didn't see it again.
      So Here's a couple of questions that still remain not sure. The
      same ID requirements.
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      If you do have a motor car,
      not sure if you have the choice.
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Any other questions?
      Did you know about this website before? I was thinking about
      this in terms of keeping people informed about and for the
      people, especially wanting to vote by mail, that there is an
      October 15 deadline to submit a request.
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And whether there was sufficient advertising for the website or
      the places that people go online. So I'm curious about that as
      well. How many people knew there were it was a Navy news
      deadline for mail and voting was? Or to get started with that
      anyway, was a 15th of October. Let's see, which was Thursday.
      Last week, right.
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, it's an interesting question about this is a personal
      responsibility or
      the government we should wait for the government to do
      something.
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So the question maybe also is
      do the rules around voting eligibility maybe
      too onerous for some people and might take away their their
      voice in the election if they can't meet the threshold for ID
      and so forth. And maybe we should just consider, consider
      whether the website provides clear enough information
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Then if there's
      any any dissension misinformation or missing information or
      incomplete information then light discourage people from voting
      so we can think of the activity of finding a plan to vote is
      this important so then there are the people who are
      you know whether the website works on your mobile phone is one
      thing and then another thing is you know, people who don't have
      easy access to a computer and maybe the public computers they
      used to visit have restrictions on them.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I'm looking on my phone for the at the website and so from
      the get go home
      says Where do I vote?
      So I'm going to take a screenshot of this and upload it let's
      see if I can do this within I got the screenshot taken now. If I
      can share it.
12h34:
  talks:

      It's my computer.

      Okay, so now in the Dropbox, copy Dropbox link. So here's the
      link to that picture.
      I should see

  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I think that's the same link. I just renamed. Change the
      extension to one the more common
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      anyway after all that now I should better show you this. So this
      is the view of my screen
      on my phone never wonder if I can actually
12h39:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      share this screen with you.
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I can do it.
      So the Where do I vote that has the arrow beside it looks to me
      like there could be something to click. But it's not that's a
      heading. And so advanced routing. So the under the heading of
      where do I vote? Because advanced routing
      Oh, no, that's I see what's doing.
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So it's highlighting. Okay, so when you see this screen who, who
      sees that as a heading
      and the information appears below or how many people think it's
      I don't know the ANP devices agent.
      So I have to share some more information about that. But it is
      an apple thing. So I'm going to say
12h42:
  talks:

    msg: >-
      So how many people think that See that? Where do I vote as

      enter

      that's interesting.
      Know why I could click on one spot because the others anyway,
      we're out of time today. So this is an idea of. So we'll see you
      on Thursday and think about this as an idea of going through a
      specific making things specific enough to be relatable. So that
      we can say, Okay, this makes sense, or it doesn't quite make
      sense or could be improved, or I might find this frustrating or
      confusing. Let me get into some details about things. Anyway,
      that's enough yapping for me. So have a great Tuesday. And I
