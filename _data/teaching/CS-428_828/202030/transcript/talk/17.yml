      Hello
      Hello, Hello.
      Nice to see people today. Well, I'm seeing names anyway. How's
      things going for you in the semester in the class and
      just life in general. Oh, where am I? I cam slowly coming into
11h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      focus here.
      Yeah.
      So is anyone heard about Proctor track four? Have you had any
      direct experience with it? Or do you know people who have had
      experience with it?
11h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah. So
      I tried the onboarding activity yesterday. Yes. So there's
      there's a security breach and then so they were suspending the
      service for a week or so.
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, so
      I was considering using it as a way to get more firsthand.
      first hand experience with it is we can
      examine what the issues are. And you need to sort of think
      critically about using Proctor proctoring software like that.
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And what the implications are.
      So do you think that this proctoring software can help avoid
      issues of cheating? Or can they help prevent them? Or do they
      cause more problems than they solve because people are nervous
      about having to stay in, in the cameras focus. And being aware
      that everything is monitored. So I know that when I set it up, I
      had to give it a lot of permissions. could monitor my keystrokes
      could record the screen could do different things like that.
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, well, let me
      let me ask a question and I'll get a poll going here.
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      This is really something here. Let me see if I can show you
      this.
      Okay, so I'm showing you the desktop now. So I said add a
      question to the poll. And she is this will come through but
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so the management of Windows is an issue here.

      Okay, so I'm did three questions and I'm going to watch all.
11h48:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So we have 26 out of 29 people. So we'll wait till two minutes
      another 30 seconds and then we can discuss if we get a few more
      participants
11h49:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      okay 28 of 29 Okay, so do you think you proctoring soccer should
      be used in this class? So pretty clear consensus that no it
      shouldn't be. Cheating is a concern for two thirds of the people
      replied. And about 80% are what four and five didn't think their
      information is respected with the privacy of their information
      with respect to that software. It's a little bit too intrusive.
      And then there's the issue of security breaches and unintended
      consequences of information being leaked onto the
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      onto the web or into other information. So because they're
      private, it's a private company and they're offering these
      services an a for profit basis so they don't want to release all
      their They don't want to give away all their trade secrets to,
      to do what they're doing. However,
11h51:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      it seems that if we don't have some access to what the software
      is doing, then we we have less trust in it. It's all complete
      black box. It's opaque. Then we have to trust the company who's
      interested in making profit. So what what do you think is a
      balance there?
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay. Not everybody. Let's not have everybody talk all at once
      here. Okay. So, moving on. So what do you think about having a
      question on the exam if we do just use if we're using your
      courses and have a question that you upload a picture with your
      ID Do you think that's a compromise
11h56:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so maybe,
      oh, we'll just work on that I won't deal with E proctoring a
      proctor track.
      So now as we look at this screen here, how easy is it to add up?

      Oh, I didn't share the results of the poll, but I guess you can
      see it right. So.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if I want to add another poll, now I can move it. Okay.
      So you saw what I press there didn't do. So press the edit
      button here, so that that doesn't necessarily increase
      confidence that or give me confidence that what I'm doing is
      going to be adding another poll. Instead of editing the one
      that's already been done, and then
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, see you can't see the polls window where I'm pointing. Can
      you see my cursor?
      Okay, so the polling window here, let me take a picture of it
      for
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh by button, I can see it.
      Okay. So here, there's an edit button. And it's not clear
      whether I can
      whether that's the way to edit and create another poll or just
      to edit the one that's already there, but if I do click on Edit
      and the live version, then I get a new poll screen.
12h04:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting

      Give you

12h05:

    msg: >-
      Paul.
      Hmm.
      So I'm reading the chat prior. There was a private message to my
      chat.
      But it doesn't matter. Me by default doesn't send me to this the
      person who wrote to me last time. That's interesting. Anyway, if
      you don't have an ID and you're not in Regina and so on and so
      forth. I think if you have a picture you have some kind of
      identification. That would be a help that you can that has your
      picture on it. I will send a note to the registrar's office
      today about
12h06:
  talks:

    msg: >-
      that issue. Okay.

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So here I am trying to figure out how to get to that second poll
      that I made.
      We try it again.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I don't still don't see
      a button for another poll, but I could try and relaunch poll
      one.
      Okay, so it's going to clear the first pole. So we have a
      picture of the results. That's good.
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So you don't have to answer at this time. I was just I'm just
      trying to get this other poll up.
      Oh,
      take a picture.
      Okay, so
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      If you can see the difference here. The first one has no carrot
      or Chevron or whatever. Upside down carrot or point the chevron
      pointing down.
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Not gonna let me do that. I think.
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, anyway, so the poll, different polls are accessible
      through the new menu that pops up.
      I'm going to see whether I can is working before.
      Okay. Got it at that time.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      All right, so I'm gonna launch this poll about.
      Okay. So 20 of 29 voted. So I'll give you another round of
      minutes
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      to complete your voting
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, we'll stop there. Two people didn't vote, but that's okay.
      So maybe because you can see all the windows that I have to deal
      with here. Maybe that's why people voted 44% Yes. And only 15%
      voted no. And then almost the same number of yeses.
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Almost the same number of people already, maybe as Yes. So
      together we have 85% of people taking it's not a bad doesn't
      look too bad. So here you can see the impact of or we talked
      about Likert scale questions before and know whether this should
      be bounced around.
      center so that the choices are should be equidistant from the
      center. So in this case, the center would be maybe. But if we we
      don't always have to, it's a choice whether we would want to
      include that center as a choice on the question.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So you can see that here 41% of the people picked maybe because
      those maybe it's because it's easier to sit on the fence so to
      speak. Any any maybes like to talk about why they picked maybe
      either in chat or on the microphone.
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So So no, nobody's okay.
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Yeah, okay. So the first one seem relatively easy to make. Yeah,
      that's true. So I, I didn't immediately see where the poll is
      being created, or how to access it. So if we look at
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay,
      neither.
      Okay, so here's the screen has one poll in it.
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And then is the screen with more than one pole in it?
      So can you see the
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so the middle of this Proctor track is just Can you see that
      Proctor track dialog box?
      So in the middle of this, that Proctor trap track app is wanting
      to access my keystrokes again I guess I didn't give it
      permission yesterday.
12h24:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay.
      Say deny. Oh, but now
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      zoom us that app zoom.us dot app would like to use would like to
      control this computer using accessibility features.
      So what does that
      what does that mean? I wonder.
      I'm gonna deny that
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, it seems to be connected to my choice of spotlight.
      Okay.
      So I did a bit of reorganize. We are organizing on. Let's get
      rid of this annotation thing.
      Yeah. Okay. Anyway, so back to the other comment about the first
      poll, it's relatively easy to make. The some of the wooden
      windows were hidden, so it was not hidden from your view. So it
      looked a little easier than it was. Yeah, that's right, it was a
      little more easy to do that.
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And then then the new polls were not
      was not easy to my attention was not drawn to the existence of
      that drop down menu in the header.
      So what are some ways that we could do do that differently?
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And so how does it if you want to think about how does it
      decrease or increase the golf of evaluation or execution or do
      they are they both affected?
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      what would be the impact of having that drop down menu there
      from the start?
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Or what about having
      Paul one visa?
      What about this heading or this text being part of the drop down
      menu, so they click on it you'd see Paul one but there wouldn't
      there maybe there could be a as a Paul as an option under here.
      way if you click on it again, then you can select if there are
      more than one poll and you can select them here. Okay,
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      so I'm trying to edit the poll.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, I'm giving you another poll here. Just two answers. So
      create a new poll during meeting easy or hard.
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Can you give a few more seconds? And the last few people to vote
      if they'd like.
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so this is kind of the same question as the number as the
      second poll that it's phrased just a little differently. And it
      gives only two options. So whereas there were 85% compared to
      15% said it was hard before 85% who were we need are not
      negative. And here we have 73% who are not negative. So maybe
12h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      see that the issues about whether you have center point or not.
      Okay, anyway, with 10 minutes left, let's talk about the midterm
      and,
      and some things on the web page, and assignments and different
      things.
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I'm going to stop sharing the wall.
      Alright, so you can see this meeting for today. So this link
      here will take us to your courses, as you know, and you know
      that I have an office hour today. And then as the meeting
      unplanned, couple more office hours after the class meeting on
      Tuesday, and then we have the midterm on Thursday. Okay, so we
      have agreed that I won't use the proctoring software, but we'll
      just do a quiz in your courses with a question where you can
      submit a picture and
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      some ID to be determined. So I'll have some answers for that on
      Tuesday. Now, what exactly should we review? We'll talk about a
      review on Tuesday. So what I'd like you to do is if you had to
      post some suggestions for questions, and topics in
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      and I rearrange this a little bit here.
      So there's exam discussions, here. So you can that's where I'll
      ask you to put ideas for questions or topics.

      I've also arranged
      I think.
      So I've created new forums for the project discussions and
      individual assignment discussions.
      And I changed the labels a little bit to make it a little more
      clear about what, which is what?
12h42:
  talks:

      Okay, so yeah, the individual assignment to I need to make us
      after the project to I was just trying to clean up things.
      So what's a helpful resource? Just I didn't get the context for
      that.

      we can get into that. I mean, I would appreciate those comments
      and suggestions as part of Part Two participation in the

      you saying? are you answering easier hard for the zoo interface?
      And
      Okay, that's it. So I guess I guess we'll say goodbye for today
