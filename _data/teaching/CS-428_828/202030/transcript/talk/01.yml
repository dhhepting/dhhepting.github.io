      So I'm just typing a message in the chat, as well here. So I
      have a chat. I'll try and keep an eye on the chat that
      if you have something to say
      there's a blue hand icon at the bottom of your

      Some directions or
      if I should go slower faster, probably you won't say to me go
      slower. They'll try and work on faster
      to get going here
      and then more you can give a thumbs up or thumbs down
      a wave
      and I guess
      either break or need some coffee. I have coffee with me.
      How many people have coffee with them?
      Do a yes for coffee.
      I include myself in a coffee. So for two to
      four 44 participants

      over half and half the know is taking it
      okay for any nose.
      Are you have you already had your coffee today
      and because it's already 1130
      you're sufficiently caffeinated
      tea still
      50% participation

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      civil of half and half for coffee, okay, so I'm going to clear
      So the next question is,
      is even pressing yes or no icon on the interface, too much to
      ask for participation from computer science students
      yes or no.
      Realize like, there was one yes.
      I realized that if I get a yes answer
      there. You're
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      torn between clicking yes is too much
      and not participate well. Anyway
      some ideas about

      So I'm doing an audio recording of this for myself, which all
      I'll post later. So,
      in past when we've had in person meetings,
      taken pictures of the lightboard and so on,
      to go along with the media from our meetings. So I'm going to
      see what having
      the audio recordings of our sessions
      posted as usual, but then
      maybe the chat
      or some notes that I type in
      we'll figure out how to

      everybody, Did everybody get

      Do you know of anybody who is not

      Anybody here who's not registered? Who doesn't have a URL of

      Port 28 and a 28 page.
      Does that make sense?
      anyone willing to give me a yes or no for?
      Does that make sense?
11h45:

      so I think you're seeing the your courses page now.
      That's being shared with you.
      let's see, from Shawn. There's a zero percent complete vironment

      Yeah, I'm
      I'm not listed.
      Can everybody find this page

      we'll get that sorted out that you can
      you can get to the
      course directly from here.
      So let me
      unclutter my desktop of it here. I was experimenting
      over the past few days with the idea of
      having my Mac take dictation of what I'm saying. But in the as
      far as I can tell, it needs to have input focus.
      Not even work then so
11h49:

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      It's still a work in progress
      in terms of

      It's so hard to

    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      these should all work. So this is Yeah. So Shawn had the comment
      about the zero percent progress bar and I think that's related
      to your progress tracking so he can see your progress here.
      That's what's going on.
      So here's the URL courses student User Guide, if you have
      questions about your courses
      so here's my website.
11h53:

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So let me
      go to that.
      Oh, I see.
      Maybe because I did the
      try to open its own tab and it just opened
      the tab with the link Instead of going there directly,
11h54:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      come back to that.
      Let's see if this one goes directly
      or less.
      So here's the link.
      The DHH link
      on my schedule is
      the link for the class
      on my webpage and URC is your courses link.
      So I'm doing
      things in turn with my site is being built
      with Jekyll
      which is so how many people have heard of Jekyll before

      Okay, so it's a tool
      for static Website Builder. And it's the one that goes with

      So if you create,
      if you have a GitHub account, you can get a web

      So I've been working on this for a little bit,
      my webpage

      I'm doing this

      reasonably well.
      So, today's
      so the question topic we're going to be exploring this semester
      in general is
      what makes
      a good interface
      and then how do we
      design an interface for, for people, for humans.
11h59:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Here we go. So how many of you How many people think that I'm
      using the chevron correctly here? So
      should it be closed? Should it be closed like,
      like it is, or should it be
      pointing down when it's closed, and then pointing straight up
      when it's
      So I know how many people notice the use of the chevron and
      on Wikipedia
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      To me this makes more sense
      that here's here it is being closed.
      But there's more content here.
      So I can open it and access it.
      Because and to me,
      it seems like
      if it's pointing down or pointing up, it's a little bit
      less clear to me whether it's open or closed.
      Because I could see that
      if it's pointing up
      it could mean that it's closed or
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      It's a question of is it closed? Or
      do I need to click on it to close it?
      Whereas if it's pointing to the side
      I know that it's not Oh, I,
      I have a sense of a stronger sense that it's closed and it's
      going to be opened. If I click on that link
      take a quick poll.
      Okay, so the question is
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Have a phrase the question is yes you know, do you like
      do you prefer
      so Wikipedia is
      is the
      example that comes to mind most quickly but
      then there's other other ones as well.
12h03:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So don't worry about hurting my feelings.
      So you can say
      yes. For Wikipedia
      and no for for me For mine, the example that's shown here on my
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I realize I can't see him here.
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      I'm getting a couple.
      So we have about 5050
      for those who are participating
      and that, that's fine.
      So if you want to
      actually speak
      and unmute your microphone, you can do that. Just put your hand
      up so I could acknowledge you
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so as it's written in the chat,
      if you would prefer to use a symbol like
      Linus refolded or collapsed and then a down arrow for
      showing her
      request for collapsed and
      minus for uncollapse are shown.
      So that's another
      another set of choices.
12h07:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So of the seven people who said yes to Wikipedia, why do you
      think that works? Well, I just the Wikipedia
      way of doing it work.
      Let's see. I'm doing
12h08:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So I see that
      nothing has collapsed here
      let's see what happens if we go to
      a mobile site.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so not my purpose wasn't to try and
      test out Wikipedia. If you go to the Wikipedia page on Wikipedia
      on your mobile device
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      I don't see a way to switch to the mobile app site.
      So how do we
      So Mitra has
      identified the word that I was going to explore
      this more intuitive.
      So how do we develop intuition?
      How do we say that an interface is intuitive or not?
      This is just happened by magic
      so to speak.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So, where to From where does intuition come?
      I'm not going to ask for people to
      use the microphone if
      they're not comfortable. But Can somebody reply in the chat
      question about intuition.
      Maybe you have already
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      Okay, so
      something's familiar.
      past experience analytics.
      Yeah, so
      we have the idea of
      it doesn't necessarily
      agree with word processors, we don't have a, we don't come up
      with the idea of cut and paste is Ctrl V and control. Pardon me
      Ctrl C and Ctrl V or Command C and Command V on a Mac on an
      apple platform.
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So we don't
      come up with those ideas
      just to start us in here,
      but because
      they've become popularized
      and adopted in other interfaces.
      So we get our intuition about how things work on the computer.
      from our experience with other pieces of computer software, it's
      one thing and then when we're dealing with a new piece of
      software to do new things, we do look for and we can help the
      user to, to develop intuition by connecting it with something
      they've had experience with In the
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      real world, so to speak.
      we can encourage a metaphor.
      For example,
      a standard or common example for a metaphor maybe trying to
      connect people who have done haven't been online shopping before
      to connect that experience with going to a store a bricks and
      mortar store and doing some shopping.
      So, you might
      well, let me let me pose it as a question
      for some further discussion next day
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      What are the things
      that are familiar that would help
      somebody understand how to do online shopping online shopping
      that can be connected to
      a bricks and mortar store kind of experience.
      let's we'll have a full a discussion online and
      and our next meeting
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So I understand just thinking about Stephen Colbert talking
      about playing to an audience and how difficult it's been to
      record shows at his home looking into
      a screen on
      its own screen on this computer or camera and not having any
      Not like I'm well,
      not to compare myself too much to Stephen Colbert except I can
      identify with that.
      So, my thought is
      that we could
      more of a
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      This can be more of a sort of flipped classroom
      so that
      we'd have things to look at
      between meetings and then the next meeting we can talk about
      them and work through problems and discuss.
      That seemed
      like it might be a good way to
      to go
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      So here's another question.
      For the people who aren't clicking yes or no.
      Can you?
      Is there a way that you could see yourselves being comfortable
      and participating in these sorts of discussions in class? Should
      we set up should we use groups and breakout rooms I haven't done
      breakout rooms into
      But should we have some
      some problems to deal with and then work in small groups. Okay

      demonstrating to class that it's not.
      Not not

  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      are nervous about that. But yeah.
      Well, so I was going to talk about that as well.
      I took a class, a math class on semester long ago when I was an
      undergraduate. And we spent the semester studying wallpaper
      There are 17 different ways in this will be
      with me for the rest of my day is that there are seven Ways to
      have a wallpaper pattern.
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
      And my favorite, I think, is the glide reflection.
      But I'm not going to talk about all paper patterns. But what,
      what I wanted to say about that is, when we're studying the
      you can become immersed in that
      in the subject. So when I was in that class I was looking at
      every time I saw a wallpaper, and see what kind of symmetry it
      had. I would be much more attuned to it. So now that we're
      talking about human computer communications, and how to develop
      that are centered on people.
      So I'd like you to take off

      Being that much more observant about the software and the other
      interfaces you encounter
      in your daily lives and then we can discuss them.
      So if you have
      screenshots or descriptions of
      on the web or in your in on your computers, or things that you
      encounter in
      daily life like the

      Okay, Shivam has his hand up.
