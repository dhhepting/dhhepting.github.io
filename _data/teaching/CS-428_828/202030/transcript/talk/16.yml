      Good morning
      Sorry I'm late getting things going here
11h36:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I was trying to fix the problem on the website. And it hasn't
      been going so well. And then I looked at the time and I thought,
      Oh,
      so if anyone has an experience with Ruby as a programming
      language.
11h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So my website is done in Jekyll, which is a based on Ruby. And
      it's doing some strange things to me. And I did some I also
      upgraded the version because it was giving me some problems. So
      So it seems to be a few different things going on that got me in
      my into the position and now. So
11h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      well see that's, that's an interface issue as well, because the
      error messages that come up. So basically,
      so if you're writing template files, so the HTML files that get
      generated based on a template, so that way, you can have it
      based on the data that's on the website. So that's the static
      site generator. So it doesn't use any, it doesn't make any
      database calls. When,
      when the website is running, so though, when people look for a
      page, those pages aren't dynamically generated, they're all
      statically generated and then uploaded. But templates are a
      great thing. for consistency. For example, I'm getting error
      message now.
11h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Let me share the screen here for you.
      So this tag, open brace percent sign is not properly terminated
      with regex with regular expression.
11h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      percent sign closed brace included. So that seems to me in the
      documentation to be an error with the version of the template
      language that I'm using less jackal. But Jekyll says that it's
      using a version that shouldn't have this problem. And then it
      also tells me line 12. So let me show you line 12 here
11h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so here's line 12, which is just pretty plain HTML
      statement. So the reason the way it goes, is it yet, as it's
      processing it, so reads this and include on line seven, it
      includes
      the thing that does the pagination across the top. And then
      once, that's all that gets included,
11h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      then
      here's line 12, which is supposed to be causing the error. But I
      don't see it. So I'm gonna keep working on that. And sure, it's
      something that I can find fairly easily. I hope. I'm making
      progress on it. You see that?
      So if we're trying to think about these ability of this front
      end to, to track down errors, it would be nice to have a
      facility to generate line numbers. So I could figure out where
      in the code this is coming from. I can take a guess. Then I've
      been narrowing things down. But there's no no templating
      language thing that I can put in that will give me the line
      number, a particular point in source. So I mean, it may be that
      I'm,
11h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I didn't come to the come to use jackal because I have a lot of
      experience with the Ruby. It's because Jekyll is used for the
      GitHub Pages, so anyone have things set up on GitHub?
11h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      My chat window go
      realize that last one that went private chat.
11h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So that was my comment about Ruby. And then
11h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if you have
      you can set up
11h47:

      so I think I might be clickable for you. Not me.

      Okay.

      So if you're interested, I have. So this website is available.
      The repository for the website is available. And you have.com
      slash dhf t.io. So that whole name is the name of my repository
      at GitHub.
      So I saw I've seen lots of people submitting assignments, so any
      questions or concerns about the assignments?
11h50:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      should look at my channel. Oh, no, there it is. Okay.
      Okay, so we talked about metaphors last day and the way that
      people, the users, the the people using the software, maybe have
      a different perspective on things than the people who design the
      software. So we can call that, that everybody had, we can say
      there, everyone, whether developer or user. I'm trying to say
      people, or person, person, instead of user to be more human
      centric. Instead of user is a little bit detached. So I'm, I'm
      I'm trying to change my ways. I remember I did some, I had some
11h52:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      experience with the interactive television industry some years
      ago, and there is a term that was floated, they will say talk to
      people, users of interactive TVs as users. So VI, E, Ws, er, of
      users instead of user. I didn't catch on in my experience
11h53:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      want to
      I'm gonna put this into
      Dropbox here. So some screenshots from before. Well, I can don't
      have to do it. Now. I can. I can show it to you now. Can I? I'll
      put the pictures in
11h56:

      Okay, this is a little bit long way to go here.
11h59:

  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So if I want, so I'm interested in finding out who is
      participating. So tells me I can get to the usage reports here.
      Reports usage reports, usage. I looked at the one for Thursday
      meeting 15.
      And I can't find anything here.
      So if I export this as a CSV file, yeah.
12h00:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      See, you can still see the same window is that right?
      Except it's not at the front anymore.
      Okay, now it's back to the French Ruby.
      Okay. So the idea here is if I wanted to find To who
      participated in the meeting
12h01:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      it's not clear what to do here. I don't see
      any chance to get participants.
      Anyone else see something here? And the image I'm showing
      currently
12h02:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      not everybody all at once, okay
      so this is a screenshot so if I go Let me see if I can show you
      the window.
12h04:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I'm just curious how many people use this screen to get to
      our meetings?
      Yeah, so meet me to sing Chris time seeing the screen.
12h05:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so can you see the zoom.us stuff going on? I think I think
      you can. Okay, so if I go back to my account,
      so it gives me all this profile stuff and notice they do have
      the chevron here so it's pointing to the side and when I click
      on profile, it closes up, but the icon does change.
12h06:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      In fact, we get two profiles here so let's see what meetings
      does
      observe that same thing. Yeah. So you get an extra heading
      there.
      Anyway, that's actually not where I want to look. I wanted to go
      down here see reports. So usage reports.
12h09:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Link down below rebel.com.
12h10:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Well, there we go. So better. You can
      you see me now Hear me? Yeah. Okay. My power cord got
      disconnected from the computer and it was low, low power and
      just decided to quit on me.
12h11:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So now
      so you could hear me before, but now it's a little better.
      Okay, so go ahead and take up too much time, so much time with
12h12:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the audio visual stuff in the sense that only in the sense that
      helps to in terms of usability.
      Okay, so going back to where we were, you share.
12h13:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so go down account profile and then the reports to get to
      the point of saying, Oh, we have usage reports. So in the usage,
      we have meetings participants and meeting minutes with a
      specified in a specified time range. Okay. So that's what we're
      interested in.
12h14:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Nine, the wrong meeting? No, I'm not. I
      don't know why that one is. comes up in. Like, this is a 16, not
      15.
      Anyway, let's go back to let's see, we could go
12h15:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I think I must change the settings because now the table is more
      clear than it was before.
      So the document that was a suggestion to try it just goes to
      documentation. Getting started with reports okay.
12h16:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      These are not necessarily help things. So after I say the one
      that I showed in the screenshots from the other day where let's
      write the default settings.
      So I can do is get the participants. So if I want to find out
      who participated, I have to click there.
12h17:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      And then I can get a list of users and a total total number of
      minutes. People are in on in the meeting.
      I'm going to try this. See if we can switch to. So just remember
      what meeting we're looking at, which is 15. from Thursday.
12h18:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Can you see the title their participants underscore? And then
      what's this? long string? The one is there because it's a
      download of this file earlier.
      So who remembers what meeting this is?
12h19:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So this is 15. Right? What are the chances people remember? If
      you have to sit on your desktop for a minute, or if you had two
      different meetings?
      Two different meetings open at the same time. Could you tell
      which is which? So maybe it's not important to tell.
12h20:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Maybe it's not important to differentiate. Because, you know,
      you get the participants from this meeting. And then you know,
      that there, you've got the different meetings accounted for with
      these IDs. So who would like to think this is so this is being
      downloaded into my personal computer? It's not. It's not
      available generally.
      So I have the title of HBC meeting 15 created for the meeting
      but it still gets marked as
12h21:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      With the ID. So I asked you to tell me which was meaning 15 or
      14 or 13 or 12, then it would be harder to do it based on the ID
      because not only is this a string of 311 numbers, they all they
      all start with nine I think that's my experience, they seem to
      start with nine.
      Okay, so then we get the name, the original name, and then the
      user email and then the total duration in minutes.
      Go back to
12h22:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      the car
      cvrd export in that so let's see if we can just let it go.
      So I wish I could find where I've set those columns up. I don't
      see where
12h23:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      CSA reports are.
      bring you back to this page.
12h25:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I didn't say anything about maybe record recording.
      No. Okay.
      So the idea of looking at that first screen.
12h26:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So this is the way it starts out
      the display.
      So can you see these sorts of things? So, how many people have
      accounts on zoom?
12h27:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so if you do yes or no, please.
      So just suddenly to try to see what kind of interface comes up
      for you. And so you know if you navigate this
12h28:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      okay.
12h29:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Oh, yeah, now I remember what were the toggle calls comes in. Or
      Pardon me. I remember where the settings are.
12h30:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I better go back to the web page.
      So here's the ticket here. cago column
12h31:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay,
      maybe even make it more sparse.
12h32:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So maybe select columns or select output. Yeah. So I think there
      are a couple people who started in last days meeting. And once
      so this report displays information for meetings that ended at
      least 15 minutes ago.
12h33:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Free
      way, so you can get the list of participants by clicking here.
      So if I was really colorblind, and that's just the limited way
      that I am, might be hard to see that that's the link. So we get
      some extra information on the mouse over things. So I can I know
      that that's a link because the cursor changes.
12h34:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So
      So another thing to do here, maybe I'll put your Well, I'll let
      you go in groups are a few minutes, five minutes to talk about
      this. That if you wanted to organize reports
      for zoom, let's see what kind of metaphor might you use.
12h35:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So they're using a spreadsheet metaphor here.
      It's not clear. There's not a clear call to action as they say.
      Like getting the participant reports Excuse me. So what's,
      what's a way to organize it that would be maybe more clear any
      ideas about
12h37:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so I'm gonna put us in, put you into breakout rooms for
      five minutes. So I have an office hour to two today, two to
      three assignments for the rest of the semester will be posted
      today. not different from what I've discussed already about
      them. And then also on Thursday we'll have a look at and talk
      about things for a midterm exam the following week before the
      break. Okay. All right, so
12h38:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      I'm going to open rooms now.
      Wow.
      So
12h39:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      everyone,
      so I'm still talking to most people here. So anyone changed
      their email address from otherwise?
      Yeah, no, I know. It's no registration.
12h40:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So I didn't, I didn't see the benefit of doing registration.
      Because I can get the report of all participants. So now I guess
      I see the benefit of registration.
      So I wonder if the participant report is going to be different
      today.
      So I'll test that. See what kind of reports are available.
12h41:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, it's gonna take me a long time to get everybody sorted out
      into two groups here.
12h42:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      Okay, so the rooms have been closed, and everyone's back.
      So instead of sending me back the documentation,
      okay, so there are like three quarters, no two thirds of the
      participants in the meeting who rent automatically assigned to
      rooms. So I guess we'll have to do registration in the future.
      So that's why I didn't get put into any room. You're in a room
      with more than one person. That was great. And I suspect,
      because you used your your China, you would use your your China
      email addresses.
12h43:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      So instead of sending me back to documentation to understand the
      interaction of options, what what might be a better way to
      present that information to the to the host to the meeting. So
      for example, if I need if I need to have registration open to
      assign people to rooms. Then if I don't select registration as
      required, then I shouldn't be able to upload as do the pre
      assignment of breakout rooms, for example. So there's a fellow
      by the name of Jef Raskin who is a designer on the apple. He's
12h44:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      passed away, but I think I saw his son on the Netflix
      documentary, I started watching the social dilemma, I think
      anyway, but he talks about the first he thinks about what could
      be first and second laws of human interface design. And the
      first one is like the Asimov's law for androids. Computer should
      do no harm to users work nor through inaction allow harm to come
      to users work. And the second one is the user should know no
      more work than is absolutely necessary. So there might be
12h45:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      different ways to interpret the what is absolutely necessary,
      but
12h46:
  talks:
  - persid: Daryl Hepting
    msg: >-
      In the case of me capturing all everyone's email addresses and
      putting them into groups, that should be as much work as I need
      to do. And you could think there might be even less work. If I
      would keep I could associate names and and I could get a report
      about breakout rooms, maybe that would be an easier way to deal
      with it as well.
      So I'll leave you to think about any questions about what I've
      asked you to think about the metaphors a different metaphor for
      accessing reports. That seem okay. Sorry, I'm a couple of
      minutes late here now I just anyway, I have an office hour too.
      So I'll see you then.
12h47:
  talks:

    msg: >-
      So, I'll say goodbye for now and we'll see you on Thursday.
      Okay, take care everyone stay well. Right.
