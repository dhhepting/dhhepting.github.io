      So without using the interface, but looking at the appearance on the screen,

      And they may not become real issues for the user. Because we're not using it

      is basically we count keystrokes, for activating different things in the interface.
      So, key presses certain number of seconds mental activity or thinking about
      what to do next is a certain amount of time. And switching between a mouse and
      a keyboard or keyboard and the mouse is another amount of time. And then pointing

    persid: Daryl Hepting
12h38:

      the values aren't as important as, as the relative weight. So switching between
      a keyboard and a mouse takes longer than making a key press and a keyboard and,
      and so on. So we can, we can get a hierarchy of we know which is more expensive
      in terms of time. So, if we have an inexperienced typist, or an experienced
      computer user, their time, there absolutely times will be different than somebody

      So the idea is for valuing two interfaces, then we can get a time for our idealized
      user to use both interfaces based on the standard timings. So it won't be that

      couple pixels wide on the screen, and we're very far away from it, it's gonna
      take a long time to to hit the target accurately. But if the target is very
      large, and we're not so far away from it, well, even if we are a little far
