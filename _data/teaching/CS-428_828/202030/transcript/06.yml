      in the chat, I directly got the link displayed on my webpage itself. I got an
      email A minute later, but even before that, I got the link directly on the webpage.
      So I could even directly join from there. Okay, so I think I think because the
      timing years are close to the meeting time that it just gave you a link to join
      him. That might happen five minutes before the meeting. Okay. I'm gonna guess
      that so I mean, there, there are lots of things cuz I'm guessing out here. Okay,

      that if we see and Chevron pointing to the side We know it's going to be, we
      click on it. And there's going to be more information. And if we see an arrow
      pointing down, that means this is showing extra information, and we can hide

      about what people are wanting to accomplish, and designing it so they can do
      that without errors. Okay, six theistic is recognition rather than recall. So

      in to not do just to doing Ctrl C, or Command C, and Command V, to copy and
      paste. But I noticed that sometimes now the application requires me to go to
      the Edit menu to pull down, like the menu command is a more powerful version
      than the keyboard shortcut. So that's a little bit disconcerting. And just like
