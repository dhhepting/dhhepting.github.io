     continue with testing groups as assigned, ok?
  - persid: S05
    msg: >-
     Yes. How would you like us to handle things if we can't get in touch with people at all? Some of my group is still having problems reaching anybody in their testing goups. Can we modify our assignment output somehow?

     that you can see both questions is a feature, not a bug, I think!

     Mostly we've had issues with contact. My of my group's testing groups have had at least one member who hasn't responded to any attempts to communicate.

     for the "Rate Your Group", do we rate our testing groups as well, or just our main group members?
12h43:
  chats:
  - persid: S05
    msg: >-
     Yes, we've gotten some done, so that's good,
12h44:
  chats:
  - persid: S05
    msg: >-
     Just not everybody. We can submit our report as-is and note the difficulty in communication, if that is acceptable. Or get friends and family to do some testing for us and document that in the report, if that is agreeable.
