     Any thoughts about how these doors relate to the heuristics that we discussed last day?
11h49:
  chats:
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     yes and no. I believe there are certain regulations on front doors (that they always have to be pull when you enter, and push when you leave), but for inside doors, some are more difficult to figure out than others.

     Yea pulling from the inside is a danger in case of a fire

     The door completely reflect the usability mistakes of heuristics UI desighn. Its confusing all the timeâ€¦no consistenc and visibility of which way should we open, etc.

     even there are some clear glass doors that people can not perceive to be a door and hence bumps into them.
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     so no handles, no clear hints to be a door
