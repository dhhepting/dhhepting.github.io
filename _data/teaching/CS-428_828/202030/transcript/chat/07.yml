     Any thoughts about how these doors relate to the heuristics that we discussed last day?
11h49:
  chats:
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     yes and no. I believe there are certain regulations on front doors (that they always have to be pull when you enter, and push when you leave), but for inside doors, some are more difficult to figure out than others.
11h54:
  chats:
  - persid: S20
    msg: >-
     Yea pulling from the inside is a danger in case of a fire
11h56:

  - persid: S14
    msg: >-
     The door completely reflect the usability mistakes of heuristics UI desighn. Its confusing all the time…no consistenc and visibility of which way should we open, etc.
11h57:
  chats:
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     even there are some clear glass doors that people can not perceive to be a door and hence bumps into them.
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     so no handles, no clear hints to be a door
12h00:
  chats:
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     yes that is true
12h02:
  chats:
  - persid: S21
    msg: >-
     Three points to that. 1. This doesn't necessarily apply to interior doors, in which case things again become ambiguous. 2. People then need to be informed of these standards at some point, which is then documentation. 3. I'm not sure that these standards are consistent internationally, which reintroduces ambiguity.

     I'm not sure that our schools teach fire code regulations to elementary school kids, for example.
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
     let’s do some research about building and fire code regulations for commercial or multiple occupant buildings in Saskatchewan or Canada… and see what constraints we have to work with (or internationally)
12h07:
  chats:
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     that's kind of part of the code though? it helps us out when we don't notice it.
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     the only people who have to be taught are the people who check it and have to build according to it.
12h09:
  chats:
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
     Yes, that’s true that the fire code helps people invisibly, so to speak. But are there cases when the code works against people?
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     if a new normal has to be introduced, users are the ones to be taught. for example, the differences internationally
12h33:

  - persid: S22
    msg: >-
     Had trouble finding proper information on fire code regulations, the official national guide requires you to pay for it

     How did that go? Could you hear my audio in the break out rooms and see the messages? I didn’t see any new chat posts during the activity
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     I found some basic info on electronic doors specifically: https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/laws-regulations/labour/interpretations-policies/044.html
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     it was good. have pondered over the 10 heuristic points. how there are differences in places.
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     we can not hear you in the rooms but could see the message from you
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     audio - not heard, messages - seen separately from chat window
  - persid: S06
    msg: >-
     We couldn’t’t hear but your message was showing on the screen for few seconds.
12h35:
  chats:
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     at the top of the window, not in our chat window
  - persid: S06
    msg: >-
     We couldn’t see any option to reply to your message there
  - persid: S08
    msg: >-
     we were not able to hear you but we have seen message from you as a pop-up

     yaa
  - persid: DHH

     So, we can also apply the heuristics to other things, like zoom.

12h38:

     so no user control on our end
  - persid: S23
    msg: >-
     I wasn't even aware you sent a global message. Zoom didn't even flash to tell me there was a message, like it usually does when one shows in the chat window.
  - persid: S02
    msg: >-
     we can't even copy the message to clipboard
12h39:
  chats:
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     it was just a pop up without a window that disappeared in a few seconds

     though breakout rooms create a question of scope and reachability but certainly enforces privacy and integrity within the groups.

     affordances
12h47:

  - persid: S23
    msg: >-
     On the topic of hammers, it's not like you can do anything about the risk of bending a nail. A nail has to have that design to be able to hold the object together once nailed in, and the hammer has to have that ability to project force onto the nail.
  - persid: S23
    msg: >-
     So it's more about the fault tolerance we're willing to accept when it comes to a UI. And for doors, I think it should be MUCH lower than a hammer and nail.

     a door with a flat plate affords pushing.
