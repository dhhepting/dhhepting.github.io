      The zoom bomb was probably because we used a link that was posted publicly on the university webpage, your common changing of the links is more than strong enough protection professor. Waiting room isn't a big trouble though.

      I suppose, groups with a lot of interdisciplinary connections. So from different degrees, for example. I'm in a sci-fi English class right now and there's a lot of people from different degrees. A surprising amount of CS majors as well.

      The catalyst for our computer science careers can be totally different. These differing catalysts mean that our specializations and generalizations can vary wildly.

      There's also enneagrams, for example. But part of the problem with MBTI is it can be a self-fulfilling thing, where people read it and try to fit themselves into that mold.

      you tell people they fit a box, and some people will try to stay in that box.

      Well, that's a way to look at it. Likening Myers-Briggs to astrology makes it sound even more wishy-washy.

      Not necessarily. Ennegrams are okay because they promote change. But unless you actually mention that as an aspect of the thing, it just turns into a what stereotype are you most like? MBTI is a bit more rigid, and based on testing. But you can pull in colour theory too, which is also got some science (ish) backing. we try to organize people into like categories, some are more based in fact than others.
