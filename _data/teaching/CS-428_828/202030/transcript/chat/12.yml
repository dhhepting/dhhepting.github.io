     I thought of some, but not any that would be widely used; i.e., websites I was using. I imagine the idea is to pick a website that's widely used

     Maybe finding the section for ‘frequently asked questions’? When I click on the link that says ‘help, faq, abuse, legal’ it takes me to a page with a bunch of links but it doesn’t explicitly say that these are frequently asked questions? Maybe this is just confusing for me since I don’t use Craigslist
