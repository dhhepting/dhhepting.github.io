     I was unaware of it, but then I didn't feel the desire to go look for it. So, I guess how much of that is personal responsibility and how much should the gov do to proactively tell people about it?
  - persid: S06
    msg: >-
     didn't know about the mail in vote deadline. i think all the information will be there on voter's card and if someone missed one , eventually missed on all the info.
