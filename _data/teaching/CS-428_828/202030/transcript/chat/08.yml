     we can go to add a tab or button for a couple of options, but in this case it can be just a check box added in the same interface.

     Being in the physical room creates a sort of obligation even if students do still regularly flout it and play games on their laptop in the back.

     for the very reason we are taking zoom classes, there are others staying home for the same. and often we struggle to keep it as a mere study time.

     Zoom meetings are boring as compered to regular class. Also we can meet students personally which makes the experience amazing, as I like to meet meet different people and have conversation with them. But on the other hand zoom meetings are bit flexible so it’s easy to study even if we miss the online lecture(only if meetings are being recorded).

     Now might be a better time to ask who DOESN'T have a group yet? It feels like there's already plenty who are taking this class with friends and already had plans for groups basically from the start... but what about everyone else?
