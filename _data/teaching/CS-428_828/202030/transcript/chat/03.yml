     I went to Walmart in North Battleford, and during the self checkout experience, and all through the store, screens with cameras on them are shoved in the face. It feels like not welcome there.

     A good experience I've had recently so its on my mind is getting used to the ArcMap GIS software. An interesting thing it does is data files cant be dragged around projects directly, must be explicitly cut/copy pasted to help prevent users from making mistakes and accidentally breaking their file structure for the project which would do Bad Things. I thought that was a good design moment.

     The interface of checkout at HomeDepot is pretty Bad, it takes 5-6 seconds to show the scanned item on the page which is a pretty bad link between the database and the front end. Even the touch response is not great.

     Bad experience with UR Courses. Sometimes when you log in, then it would show us the desktop image if any random course and then again we have to back to log in page and refresh the site.

     Another thing I hate, is it seems like finding pricing for modern websites is a chore. A recent example is DoNotPay, where they didn't show the price until I was at the step of signing up.

     If they can't be honest with your payment methods, it makes me suspicious. So of course I didn't sign up.
