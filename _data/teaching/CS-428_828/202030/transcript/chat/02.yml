     As we get people into the meeting, a reminder that the meeting is being recorded so that we can have audio and a transcript of the meeting. I will not keep your names in the transcript of the meeting.

     It looks good. Only some comments lack context.
11h48:

    msg: >-
     This looks better, but when you want to evaluate class interaction of the students and give them grades. At that time, providing students first/last name in chat transcript, would help you in evaluation
  - persid: S01
    msg: >-
     with time stamps in blocks, i think it will be a lengthy document
11h49:

  - persid: S07

     transcript is missing the actual student names
11h52:

     No student names is a feature, but I have them still in the raw data
  - persid: S07

     This seems great . Good to know
  - persid: S14
    msg: >-
     Sounds good!
11h54:
  chats:
  - persid: S05
    msg: >-
     Instead of time, have question that prompted the responses
  - persid: S12
    msg: >-
     Yes it will keep the track of topic of discussion
  - persid: S15
    msg: >-
     How about we just skip the time when we had no responses or chats? Helps in optimizing
11h55:
  chats:
  - persid: S16
    msg: >-
     I think having the time is still important, cuz then you can go and get the context within the video and see if something is missing.
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     It feels like some are close together, could group close ones together since they will be on similar topics. Like group ones that are 2 or less minutes apart maybe. Though they open easy so we can infer that ourselves as well. If the questions grouping are easy to implement I support that option as well that's helpful for context.
  - persid: S01
    msg: >-
     it will be complex to have the topic from the audio. but if questions were put in chat, that the convenient way
11h56:
  chats:
  - persid: S07
    msg: >-
     I think it will be good to have it in standard time format HH:MM:SS. It seems to be more descriptive.
11h57:
  chats:
  - persid: S07
    msg: >-
     Oh sorry I did not mean to include SS . I mean to have it in standard time format like HH:MM
  - persid: S17
    msg: >-
     Maye we can change the way we formulate the question in the chat, students can take the extra effort of using Q1) and then post it, people can answer or discuss on it. It would be easy to group it then?
11h59:
  chats:
  - persid: S02
    msg: >-
     If we include the question that raises the responses then it will be same as the forum nit the chat. I think time is important to include in the chat and subject to the response can be added before replying to the chat.
  - persid: S02
    msg: >-
     not*
12h00:
  chats:
  - persid: S17
    msg: >-
     That seems a fair point.
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
     To think about for next day, how could you present the chat data so that it is as helpful as possible?
  - persid: S14
    msg: >-
     What I think is it might be very difficult to track question numbers for students, sometimes we end up mentioning wrong question number and it can introduce challenges for the person who is referring the chat later
12h02:
  chats:
  - persid: S01
    msg: >-
     there is always a delay between putting our thoughts in words and the upcoming messages on chat
  - persid: S16
    msg: >-
     If you could have the audio/video/transcript in a box nearby, and the timestamps linked directly to the part the class where it happened, that would help a lot
12h03:
  chats:
  - persid: S12
    msg: >-
     I agree with Farial that it happens most of time
  - persid: S14
    msg: >-
     May be, professor can add the chat title for each meeting chat transcript, and a brief introduction about topic being covered and what understanding can be gained. After that, time title can be a good choice. This both things may help to refer chat transcript later

     Should all questions (even yes/no) be put into the chat and responses recorded there?
12h10:
  chats:
  - persid: S16
    msg: >-
     I like having the questions in the chat, but yes/no should be answered with icons on participant screen.
  - persid: S12
    msg: >-
     Yes or No question should be done in vote from participants window
12h11:
  chats:
  - persid: S03
    msg: >-
     I think yes/no questions will make it too clutered
  - persid: S04
    msg: >-
     No, I think questions like yes/no need not be done in chat
  - persid: S18
    msg: >-
     Yes/no responses shouldn't be put in the chat. It isn't necessary.
  - persid: S14
    msg: >-
     I agree with them
  - persid: S01
    msg: >-
     Yes/No are fast at the click, but if we want to keep track of some particular voting, it has to be chat
  - persid: S09
    msg: >-
     I also think yes/no questions will just clutter the chat
12h12:
  chats:
  - persid: S21

     Yes, so we can add it to the transcript.
  - persid: S17
    msg: >-
     We need to keep track of what is the answer to your question
  - persid: S16

     Can't we just add a note to the transcript as far as the  result?
12h13:
  chats:
  - persid: S17

     So I prefer yes/no to be included
