      Do you think that the presentation of chat and audio transcripts will be helpful to you? What kinds of things can you see yourself doing with this display and what other features would you like to see/

      When we go through the lecture presentations, the transcripts help us to clarify any doubt we may have on a preliminary basis.
  - persid: S15
    msg: >-
      yes it sure is helpful

      Itll be useful to find information from a lecture. Atleast better than trying to scrub through video as long as the transcript is accurate
  - persid: S03
    msg: >-
      chat transcript can serve as the true happenings of the meeting. we can re live the meeting. apparently it looks good, but I always think may be we can make the interface more compact. not the lengthy one.
  - persid: S08
    msg: >-
      Transcripts can be helpful to those also who have missed the lectures so as to know what was discusses
  - persid: S08

      If a student misses any of the online class, these transcripts play a major role on highlighting the student with the class discussions. He might get a glimpse of the ideas or topics covered in the class
  - persid: S12

      Presentation of chat and audio can be helpful sometimes. But I think a summary of the chat can be another option of representing chat and audio

      Question is about the searching a keyword from transcript
  - persid: S16
    msg: >-

12h25:

    msg: >-
      so if we were to browser search the transcript would we have to first open everything?
  - persid: S25
    msg: >-
      It opens the whole transcript at once so we're able to search it all at once
12h26:

  - persid: S25
    msg: >-
      It functionally does "expand all" and "collapse all" I'd just forgotten how it worked exactly
  - persid: S25
    msg: >-
      If the individual timestamps are collapsible, would we be given an option to collapse and expand all as well?
