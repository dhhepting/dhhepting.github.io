     Speaking of adding members to a group, I couldn't find the method to use the course email to contact Dr. Hepting, so I just used his email. I hope that's alright.

     if you have used an email server other than uregina to send the email to professor it might be in spam.

     Our discussion was less effective then it could have been because we don't have access to that particular dialogue. But we did come up with some ideas.

     The chatlog does preserve the global discussion before breakout rooms if you send one before creating them.
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     So the best way is to pose the question in zoom chat and then turn on breakout rooms.

     Ezra's issue was that they don't have access to the group page which they were discussing so a chat log wouldn't help with that

     Ye he meant it would be great if we would have screenshot of group page UI so that at the same time we can see it and discuss about it

     We can make sure like once the student is added to group it is removed from the other lists of students
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     Like I mentioned in the chatlog, I think it's Moodle's intention to allow a single user to be added to multiple groups, so we have to strike some sort of compromise.
