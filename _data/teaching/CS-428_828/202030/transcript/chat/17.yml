     heard about the security breach

     None of my classes have used it yet. one that was going to changed their mind due to student concerns

     and privacy concerns already before the breach
  - persid: S07

     My other class abandoned it too as students were not onboard due to the security breach

     As per my view, it will cause more issues as I will be more nervous for sure.

     I think I already spent enough time thinking critically about eproctoring nonsense trying to convince professors in other courses not to use it
  - persid: S12
    msg: >-
     In my perspective, e-procotor causes more problems

     If I'm being honest, most cheaters are not very smart, so e-proctoring does block cheaters since it catches them in the act of doing really blatant or easy-to-find stuff.
  - persid: S10

     I agree

     with the changing directions the companies need to build trust and respect the user's privacy. and as a user we'll be limited with the choices initially.

     yes it seems like. but  URcourses already has a lot of our information.
  - persid: S06
    msg: >-
     That would be okay I think. Though we have to make sure we get the picture on our computers before the test starts, otherwise we may have to do something that could be flagged as not good web activity on the urcourses test.

     Is a UR Courses (moodle) quiz acceptable? If so, how about a question on the quiz to submit a picture of you with your ID?
11h58:
  chats:
  - persid: S07
    msg: >-
     yes that should work
  - persid: DHH
    msg: >-
     Can you see any issues with the polling interface on zoom?
  - persid: S15
    msg: >-
     If the quiz is time-limited, that could be a little stressful if someone doesn't know how to easily get a picture from their phone to their computer. What about a prerequisite quiz where you submit the picture, and then that unveils the real quiz?

     It seemed like the first poll was relatively easy to make, but the second took a lot more time and had to wipe the first

     i can see I2 with the same submission date same as I1. i assume that is yet to be set. because it really worrisome to see no submission for something that's haven't been there before
