     For empathy maps: In the assignments I found that my answers for Says and Thinks were very similar. What do you see the major difference being?

     I didn't quite understand the difference between says and thinks, but the page Dr. Hepting linked re: empathy maps has a helpful hint
  - persid: S17
    msg: >-
     "It is possible to have the same content in both Says and Thinks. However, pay special attention to what users think, but may not be willing to vocalize. Try to understand why they are reluctant to share — are they unsure, self-conscious, polite, or afraid to tell others something?"
