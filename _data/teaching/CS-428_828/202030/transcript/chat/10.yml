     the most obvious one might be to widen the field so more of the information is readable.

     You may want to see members that are in a group already in a situation where multiple group things are going on. I dont know if we would want to remove them entirely from the list. It'd be nice if we could sort them on grouped or not I think.
  - persid: S06
    msg: >-
     one option is to remove them from the potential member list. other is pushing down the members who already have a group with the ungrouped ones at the top.

     Perhaps a filter option that allows you to filter by number of groups a student is in. That would narrow down the list and save you time.
