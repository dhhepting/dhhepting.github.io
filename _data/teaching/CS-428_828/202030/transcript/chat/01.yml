     Do you prefer Wikipedia’s use of chevrons (^, v) to mine (>,v)

     in my opinion as long as it is consistent in a group of chevrons and makes sense, users gets use to it.
  - persid: S10
    msg: >-
     I would prefer to use a symbol like '-' for folded. and then use a down-arrow for unfolded. or '+' for folded, and '-' for unfolded.
12h06:

  - persid: S05
    msg: >-
     - and + easy to understand
12h08:
  chats:
  - persid: S17
    msg: >-
     To me, it's because it's like it's the "direction" that the relevant content is going to move, with the right arrow that direction doesn't match the arrow in that layout at least

  chats:

     it works on mobile device
  - persid: S12
    msg: >-
     To me its more intuitive, the v mean to drop down(expand) the content and then the ^ means the opposite to condense the content upwards
  - persid: S15
    msg: >-
     https://www.wikipedia.org we can see chevrons here
12h10:

  - persid: S13
    msg: >-
     I think Wikipedia way works is because it follows conventional logic. So does the + and - symbols.
  - persid: S13
    msg: >-
     by testing
12h11:

  - persid: S17

     Also, theoretically, up and down arrows are more universal, where a right arrow would be pointing "backwards" in right-to-left languages

     I think intuitiveness in interface comes from the existence of real worldanalogues

     Intuition comes from past experiences and what we expect from them?
  - persid: S12
    msg: >-
     I think partly from past experiences.

     I like verbal discussions, but also I like chat discussions since you never miss your chance to reply to something you're interested. I remember especially during the classes, we would get some pretty heated discussions, but the conversation needed to be cutoff so class could continue. We had forums, but once we were out of class, we didn't necessarily maintain the same passion for it later.
