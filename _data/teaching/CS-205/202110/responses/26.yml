    shown in class?&nbsp; Similar length?&nbsp; Similar question style?)<br></li><li>I
    would love to know the answers to the final, but I think I'll just need to study
    for that one!<br></li><li>We discussed many topics from previous meetings, like
    sampling and quantization, colour models, and information entropy.<br></li></ul><br></p>

    \ as methods to make digital sounds from analog and how\r\nto decrease aliasing\
    \ (a visible pixel stair case) by increasing pixel counts,\r\nusing vector mathematics,\
    \ etc.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p><br></p>"
