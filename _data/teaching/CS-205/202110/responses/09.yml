    Meetings".


    '
- desc: Can we get more useful details and particular request for next assignmnets?
    and for the first assignment, I still have some simple question about how the
    p5js works. For example, the js never call the "draw" function but the function
    still was reached and draw the canvas.
- desc: 'This meeting was a follow-up to questions from our last meeting and explained
    the assignment 1 requirements in more detail.

    I learned that we could either add functionality to the example, ensuring it is
    commented, or create our own.


    Other than that, I also learned about what bitmaps are most commonly used in...photographs.
    This seems obvious looking back at it, but it didn''t come to mind when quickly
    thinking about it.'
- desc: Thank you for the introduction to P5js. I feel a bit better about tackling
    the assignment after this. From my understanding now, we are to use P5js to demonstrate
    the idea of entropy (or randomness) through visual representation.
- desc: I would have preferred that you ask this sort of question in class or in my
    office availability -- next one is Wednesday 12:30-14:30. [smile]
- desc: In our 9th meeting, we discussed about our entropy assignment.
- desc: In this class we learned the assignment#1 example, get idea about how to do
    the assignment#1, I learned more knowledge about P5.js
- desc: We mainly covered the assignment and talked about p5.js and entropy once more.
    Also talked about last class's material at the beginning of this class.
- desc: I think starting the class off by going over some of the more interesting
    student engagement responses is a nice way to start the class, and it might help
    answer some students questions regarding previous lectures.
- desc: In this class we discussed about the assignment 1. We went through some of
    the codes on p5js and how they worked and how outputs differed with different
    inputs.
- desc: In last class we talked about sampling and quantization - the number of bits
    restoring. Moreover, I learned about illustrate entropy assignment 1. Entropy
    = surprising. I learned about random number generating in P5.js and also how to
    create slider.
- desc: We have discussed assignment 1 in this lecture............
- desc: I finished the assignment last week but I am really glad you went over it
    in class. I am going to go back and add a couple of things to it. There are multiple
    YouTube tutorials for p5.js that I used last week to help understand things when
    I got stuck. I used the framerate function and the slider to control the rate
    at which an item would appear in on the screen. I am going to go back and just
    add a couple of other things to it based off of your explanation in class.
- desc: It was really helpful to see what to do for the assignment, i enjoyed the
    class.
- desc: 'We learn about p5.js in last meeting.

    We also went through and understood the given example code of p5.js.'
- desc: In our last meeting we explored p5.js and entropy and its example which is
    very useful for our assignment 1. From this meeting I got many answer of the questions
    that I had regarding p5.js and assignment 1. Thank you :)
- desc: 'Ah, I completely forgot to post!

    I found it very helpful to discuss the assignment so much and go through some
    p5.js stuff.

    I actually found everything in this meeting to be very clear!

    I would love to learn more about p5.js and create more interactive examples with
    concepts from the class.

    Bitmaps for photos are related to the last class, and p5.js is related to the
    assignments!'
