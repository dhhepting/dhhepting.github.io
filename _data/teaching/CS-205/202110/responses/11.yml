- desc: 'This meeting we learned more about color models such as RGB, HSB, and YUV.
    I learned that RGB is an additive to black model while CMY is a subtractive from
    white model.

    This was interesting to me as I had never thought about why 0,0,0 in RGB was black
    and 255,255,255 was white. Now I know why!.


    We discussed the project a bit and the example of a color blindness test was great
    as inspiration for what the scope of our projects should be.


    We covered YUV color modelling at the end of the class and didn''t quite get to
    finish it (I think). I look forward to learning more about it.'
- desc: In our 11th meeting we discussed RGB, color, saturation and what to do with
    our group project. Red Green and Blue (RGB) is a additive coloring system that
    every modern computer and phone screen uses. Unlike subtractive coloring systems
    like painting or drawing if you mix every computer color pixel light together
    you get white light and not a muddy brown. Saturation is defined as how intense
    and pure a computer screen color is with low saturation being grey scaled. In
    class we discussed about what to do for our group project which will most likely
    involve P5JS programming again.
- desc: 'I found YUV to be very interesting, and a good way of displaying colours.

    I''m a bit confused about how you would convert between RGB, CMY, and YUV colour
    mappings.

    I would love to learn how to freely convert between colour mappings!

    I found that it was helpful to review a bit of the information on colour models
    we discussed in previous meetings.'
- desc: today we talked in depth about RGB,HSB,CMY,CMYK etc.. and more about project
    proposal. I still don't have much understanding about p5.js, which makes it even
    hard to think about an idea for project. Our second assignment is on the topic
    'text and image color', which we haven't discussed yet, I'm looking forward to
    it.
- desc: I enjoyed learning about different ways of displaying colours and the visual
    representation of HSB colours was nice! I wish that we would discuss assignments
    earlier so that those of us hoping to get an early start have clear expectations.
- desc: we learned about RGB and HSV, I got some knowledge about it, then we taled
    about Project Proposal, gave some example about it's concept, ambition, content,
    plan. Now I have some ideas about the project.
- desc: I find it interesting that there are so many ways to express color, prior
    to this course I had never considered that there was anything beyond RGB values
    and the 6 digit hex codes.
- desc: Even after expalining about proposal, I still feel the options are too open
    and maybe a list about some available options with specific requests will be very
    helpful.
- desc: Representing colors using the CMY system is kind of opposite to the RGB system
    because in the RGB system we add RGB to black to get different colors whereas
    in the CMY we subtract colors from white to get different colors. HSL also plays
    an important role in determining the different shades of a particular color.
- desc: In this class we talked about the proposal that is due, this was helpful to
    know what is really expected of us. We also looked into RBG
- desc: In the last meeting, I learned about RGB(Red, Blue, Green) and HSB(Hue, Saturation,
    Brightness). The HSB is a single best colour system in digital system. If you
    think of a corn shape in 3D view, the angle of the corn represents the Hue(it's
    an angle) and it is measured in degrees (e.g. 90 degrees, 360 degrees, 120 degree
    and etc). The saturation is the value of a surface of the disk. And the perpendicular
    value to the surface of the corn represents the brightness. Both Saturation and
    Brightness value can be measured in percentage over the Hue value. The value can
    be between 0-100%, where 0% is represents the black value and 100% can be represents
    as black value of either Saturation or Brightness. I also learned about CMY colour
    model (Cyan, magenta and yellow) which produces a muddy-black colour, CMYK (Cyan,
    Magenta, Yellow, Black) and YUV colour model.
- desc: 'In this meeting we explored more about colours.

    A concept that made everything click for me was how RGB is additive to black and
    CMY is subtractive to white.

    We briefly talked about how YUV can be used for compression. What does that compression
    entail?

    A thought occurred to me when we were discussing how inkjet printers display colour.
    I did a quick search to see what colour system a colour laser printer uses. And
    it seems to use cymk as well.'
- desc: Meeting was kinda tough to follow due to legibility of written notes - this
    was brought up and Professor Hepting informed us he would commit to finding a
    more workable solution moving forward. We briefly touched on concepts relating
    to colourspaces before the Project was discussed.
- desc: In last meeting, we talked more about RGB that is Red Green Blue, HSB that
    is Hue Saturation Brightness color. I learnt how all colors can be shown in cube.
    Line connecting is Black and white is brightness. RGB is additive and CMYK - Cyan
    Magenta Yellow Black is subtractive.
