- desc: In our 17th meeting we discussed p5.js functions connecting images to sounds
    and the assignment due yesterday. There was an example given to us in class that
    hurt our ear drums but showed different beeps as pixels of a drawing were formed.
    Some of the functions will make a different sound, change the sound durations,
    pitch, tone and so on. Some of the pixel coloring functions randomly choose a
    pixel to appear for the dragon painting.
- desc: We talked about assignment 3 and different frequencys of sound
- desc: I do think going over the P5Js programs is useful for helping students go
    about their assignments, but I feel like we spend too much class time on them;
    I would rather see new concepts / theory in class.
- desc: For the last lecture, we mainly discussed the expectations of assignment 3
    as well as the example sketch on how to turn an image into sound.
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about the 3rd assignment and what is the professor's
    expectation from it. Later we saw p5js codes that worked with sounds and how we
    could edit them to create different sounds, also how that would be helpful for
    our assignment.
- desc: In the last class, we talked about couple of P5.js function examples that
    are MIDI keynotes, and MIDI notes. We also discussed the bootstrap example.
- desc: "Discussing the advanced features for the assignment that was due on Monday\
    \ was interesting. I had already completed my program and had implemented what\
    \ I considered as an advanced feature. I have a drag and drop feature. I think\
    \ it\u2019s really cool, and it was not easy to implement. I could make the drag\
    \ and drop work and accept the new image but I had a hard time getting the program\
    \ to restart with the new image. That part was the hardest to implement. I am\
    \ looking forward to the next assignment because it\u2019s almost the opposite\
    \ of what we did for this one. There are lots of interesting features that can\
    \ be included. I have lots of ideas, so I am looking forward to starting this\
    \ and seeing what I can come up with in a week."
- desc: Some functional equations in assignment3 still confuses me, when I did the
    code, I tried to change picture I preloaded but I cannot update pixels successfully.
- desc: 'I found it valuable to discuss the assignment again, and to talk about the
    future assignments.

    I''m still a bit confused about what''s expected for the next assignment.

    I''d love to learn more about this coming assignment!

    This assignment discussion reminded me a lot of our prior assignment discussions.'
- desc: 'In this meeting we recapped sound sampling, looked at our image to sound
    assignment and discussed what an advanced featured was.


    We also looked at various MIDI examples. I googled what MIDI meant after class
    ( I think I missed the meaning of it in class) and discovered it means Musical
    Instrument Digital Interface.'
- desc: In this meeting we discussed what would be a suitable advanced feature for
    assignment 3
- desc: In this class we talked about the assignment that was due and also looked
    into the next assignment.
