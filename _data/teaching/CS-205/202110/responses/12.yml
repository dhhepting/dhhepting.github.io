- desc: 'I found it very helpful to chat about the assignment, and see ways to convert
    a canvas into a bitmap!

    I was pretty confused when I saw my project proposal was overwritten by someone
    else''s!

    I would love to do more interactive examples with p5js in class, I feel like it''s
    a great tool for learning.

    This feels like it built on our understanding of bitmaps, and our previous discussions
    of p5js'
- desc: In our 12th meeting we discussed different functions on p5.js that we can
    use in our group projects and how we will submit our proposal idea for our projects.
    A new function we learned in p5.js was to put text on the canvas screen. Other
    functions we saw on p5.js was to take a text that is on the canvas screen and
    change its color and size or flipping the text and spinning it in a circle. We
    had some difficulty in the beginning of the class for submitting our project proposal,
    but it was solved in the end.
- desc: we talked about submition problem of Project Proposal, then we got ideas about
    Explore Text and Image in Colour assignment.
- desc: 'In this meeting, we spent quite a bit of time fixing up our project and assignment
    submissions on URCourses. Although it ate up lecture time, this was needed and
    technical difficulties are always annoying.


    Other than that we also saw examples of what we are to do/possibilities for our
    P5.JS in assignment 2. Since I had already finished the second assignment, this
    was a good validation to show that what I had done was similar.

    I hope we move on to sounds/video elements in the next lectures ( It seems like
    this is the next step based off the assignments).'
- desc: Thank you for going through the second assignment. I am still unsure of the
    assignment but at least I now have a starting point and can build from there.
    It is a good thing that we had the opportunity to go through the due dates for
    all the assignments because they all had the wrong setting. Now there will be
    no issues when we are handing in our assignments.
- desc: The website of p5.js references is much more helpful than I thought, it mostly
    answers all coding questions I have gotten in p5.js
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about the project proposal. As there was some
    error in the submission page for the project proposal our time mainly went into
    fixing it.
- desc: In last class we saw an example for bitmap that is text as image. image was
    created using the saveCanvas function which will be useful in Assignment 2. P5.js
    is getting interesting and hoping to learn lot more that can be done with p5.js
- desc: In this class, we spend most of our time discussing the issues we had regarding
    file submissions for our group project.
- desc: We've discussed assignment 2(explore text and image in color) in this lecture
    and Dr. Hepting fixed some issues on UR courses.
- desc: For this class we spent most of the class trying to get our proposal submitted
    which was good as everyone was freaking out about the submission.
- desc: 'The meeting was really helpful. we learn about ASCII with the single byte
    character. Also how to find the like we got to know 0 is leading bit can only
    occur with single byte character same ASCII

    10=

    110=2 byte character

    1110=3 byte character

    11110=4 byte character'
- desc: In the last meeting we looked into the sample for text as image. We discussed
    about sample assignment. We resolved the issue regarding the Submission for "Project
    Proposal"
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed some troubles with our assignments and assignment
    submissions.
